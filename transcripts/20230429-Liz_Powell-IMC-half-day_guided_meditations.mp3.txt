 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Well, I'm going to record this, but welcome everyone. I'm so happy to share this half day with each of you. You know, half days on Saturdays have always been a favorite for me because they offer opportunities that we don't get at other times. We can make a little more time for sitting practice than we sometimes have time for during the week. And it feels like a good length of time when we don't have so much time that we can go to a meditation retreat. It's also supportive to be sitting with each other. It helps summon more resolve, more strength in the practice. And sometimes we, you know, once we sit down to meditate on a Saturday, the impact of the demands of our daily life makes themselves felt, you know, fatigue, restlessness, aversion, whatever comes up. That's, you know, typical. But it helps to have the boost of getting to sit with a group while we do this practice together. And a scheduled event is often a great way. So for so many of us, one of our most important goals is to continue to move towards freedom from stress and suffering. And a half day of really focusing on sitting and movement practice is a support in that direction. So that's the inspiration for opportunities like this. And I'm going to continue this spring to offer some half days to give that opportunity and also a sense of continuity during these half days. You know, there's a great way doing this practice today to make sure that every minute, no matter what you're doing, whether you're sitting in practice, whether you're moving, whether you're getting up to make a transition from one to the other, even if you're taking a break for tea or to go to the bathroom, continuing to practice awareness through all of that, that continuity really helps build momentum towards freedom from suffering. So what we'll do is after this brief introduction, we'll have a 35-minute meditation that'll be guided. And then we'll have a specific type of meditation while moving. And I'll give an introduction to that specific type of meditation. And then we'll come back for another lightly guided period of meditation. We'll do another very short movement meditation. And then we'll end the morning with a brief Dharma talk. There will be an opportunity at noon after that Dharma talk for an optional practice discussion group where you can ask questions, you can share what's going on in your practice, and reflect on it a bit together. So you're welcome to that as well. And I'll facilitate that. So a couple of things I'd like to emphasize today. There are no right or wrong experiences in meditation. All we're going to do this morning is become aware of what is here right now, what the mind is noticing, and what its attitude towards that is. So we could observe a series of objects and just spend all day, every day observing objects. You know, objects being hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, thinking. And that's wonderful, but that's not enough. What we need as well is to notice what the mind is doing with that. So we'll be working with that today. And because there's no right or wrong kinds of awareness that we have, no right or wrong attitude or relationship with what's coming up, you don't have to try to make your meditation be a certain way. You get to relax and do less. So you could think of this as being like a vacation. You don't have any work to do, you don't have any obligations, chores, duties. You get to sit here and watch the parade of moments of experience as they flow by. So this is a day I'd encourage you to be extra kind to yourself in that way. And what we do today is intended to strengthen the ability to be aware of how the mind is relating to these experiences that arise, persist, and pass all the time. What is the mind doing with that? So with that brief introduction, we'll spend a period of guided meditation. And before we start into that formally, maybe bring to mind the reason you do this practice. What's your intention for meditating today? And when I ask that, I suggest you don't need to be thinking about this or really be complicated about it. Just allow yourself to recognize, float up to awareness, what's your intention, what's a simple wish for your practice today. And then taking your time to establish a comfortable posture. That could be sitting, it could be standing, it could be lying down. Whatever is helpful for you that will be comfortable and sustainable. And that will also allow you to remain aware, alert for what's coming up. And as we settle in, it can be helpful to take a few longer, deeper breaths. And perhaps with the out-breath, releasing or softening any obvious tensions or preoccupations. The out-breath can be a way to relax or ease the mind and body a bit as you settle in. Having ease wherever it's possible and allowing anything that cannot be softened or relaxed to be just as it is. Let this meditation awareness will be mentioned and you'll be invited to notice what are you aware of right now? If you're hearing the sound of my voice and you know that, you're aware of hearing. This is as obvious as that. Can you shift your awareness and attention to the feeling of your feet on the floor against the surface you're on? Now you're aware of sensations of touching, feeling. Do you know you're sitting? Now you're aware of sitting. So you know these experiences or you're aware of them because the mind is paying attention and it is aware. These are natural capacities we have that are available anytime. If instead you had been worrying about a relationship or work or something, you might not know. You might not be aware of hearing my voice or of the sensations of sitting. That's of course what happens when attention and awareness get caught up in the past or the future. So instead we're emphasizing being aware of what is happening here and now. Attention can be directed to anything. Awareness can be aware of anything that comes up and we don't have to direct the attention. We can receive whatever comes to the senses, receiving what is coming to hearing, receiving smelling, tasting, touching or feeling, sensations, seeing visually if her eyes were open or even seeing in the mind's eye and also the sense of the mind itself. Seeing moods, attitudes of mind, emotions in the mind. So I'll offer an experiment called Mindfulness Out Loud with which some of you are already aware to demonstrate receiving. We can simply receive a series of experiences that present themselves. I'll do it by repeating the phrase, now I'm aware of, and as I reach the end of the phrase I'll say what's presenting itself in awareness at that very moment. Now I'm aware of the pressure of my legs against the chair. Now I'm aware of the graveliness in my voice. Now I'm aware of silence. Now I'm aware of slowing down. So that's just a simple example and if you'd like in the next minute or so try it. Just saying very quietly in the mind, now I am aware of and then noticing what's most obvious as you finish the phrase, noting it quietly in the mind as a way to enter this flow of awareness of changing experience. That's one sort of way that you can comb in on the awareness moment to moment. Now you can release that exercise if you wish and turn to simply allowing whatever is being received in awareness right now. These experiences that awareness may receive from the body, breathing, feeling, states of mind, activities of mind, it's okay to allow any of them that is obvious in awareness and allow what's obvious in awareness to shift and change. From time to time we can prompt awareness by asking very quietly as a whisper in the mind, what am I aware of now? And if you've been trained to maintain awareness on a single object like awareness of breathing or awareness of sensation in the body, no problem. When you ask what am I aware of, it may be that that normal usual object comes up most of the time. But it's very important to notice when something else becomes more prominent in the awareness, don't ignore it or push it aside. Allow yourself to be aware of any other objects or sensations or thinking, anything else that arises in awareness in addition to your usual object. And periodically, gently asking, what's the attitude of mind as I'm receiving what's coming into awareness? How am I relating to it? Again, just whatever is most obvious about that. Is the mind at ease with itself, relaxed with what is coming up? Or is it trying too hard? Is the mind calm or agitated? Is it distracted or more clearly focused? Is there resistance or more openness? Or the attitude, there's no need to change it, just simply noticing what it is. Thank you. Thank you. From time to time, renewing the awareness to what is most obvious and what the attitude of the mind is towards what's being received. If the mind drifts away, simply notice when you return to awareness, what am I aware of now? And how am I relating to that? So we'll continue the meditation in silence. Using either of these methods to bring yourself back, whenever awareness drifts away, you can come back with, now I'm aware of, or what am I aware of now? And what is my relationship to it?
