Here we go.
Okay.
So for the theme for tonight, which is going to include our birth being inspired, it being Casey's birthday tonight.
The theme that I like to invite us to practice with to work with is opening up our perspective, opening up our perspective as if you were sitting on the top of a proverbial mountain and looking at the entire, entire trajectory of your life.
Not just this moment. Yes, we will be embodied in this moment.
But sometimes actually, if we're too much in this moment and if our vision is too narrow, not in an embodied way, but in a heady way, you're just thinking about all the problems and the issues and all what I'm going to do about this and this is terrible.
This is never going to end. This is awful. That tightness of vision, which you might be familiar with, that tightness of vision can create a sense of contraction, a sense of tightness, contraction.
And even sometimes meta might be hard to be accessible in that state.
And I trust, I'm sure you have experienced what I'm talking about. We've all experienced.
I should ask anyone not have not experienced this tightness where you just, your vision is so narrow, so narrow, really, as if you're just swimming in what the problem or the most recent drama might be.
Whereas the invitation tonight.
Ah, even just talking about that, that tight vision kind of gets my heart clenched. It feels so contractive. So letting go of that view and instead, instead having a sense of a sense of openness and openness of vision and openness of vision.
That here is this being who is you, living this life. This being has been born, has come into this life. This being someday will leave this world, of course, of course.
And this whole arc, this whole arc, so many things that have happened, so many beautiful, surprising, amazing and so many challenging things that have happened that you've grown through.
And this road will continue. So this, this expansiveness of vision, including both you and including other beings.
And this expansive vision can be with the right invocation, can be a perspective of equanimity, equanimity, that things come, things go.
Ah, it's okay. It's okay. This is an interesting, interesting, mysterious journey being human.
It's such an amazing, mysterious journey to have a body, even if this body at times doesn't work so well or has this mind that has its kind of particularities and quirks and funny ways that it acts and reacts in the world.
Oh, sweetheart, oh, sweetheart, this interesting body, this interesting heart, this interesting mind that happens to be me.
Wow, how unique is this? It's so unique. It's different from any other body, any other mind, anybody else in the world.
So this sense of tenderness, letting there be a sense of tenderness for this being, who is you, who has this arc of life and is doing their best, doing their best and opening up, opening up to the mystery, opening up to this mystery.
That is our life. I'm sure you have noticed by now, it's not all under our control, not our bodies, not our minds, which doesn't free us from responsibility and wholesome intention.
And yet, it's so much of this self, this being that is ungovernable, so much of this body, this mind, this heart. So having from this perspective, having tenderness, having the love, not self-flagellation, like, bad, bad me, do this, why can't you do this?
Like, oh, sweetheart, oh, sweetheart, oh, sweetheart, this is just being human, is just being human, is so, hmm, is so challenging enough, is so amazing enough, both challenging, beautiful, profound.
So this expansiveness of vision, expansiveness of vision is what I am inviting us to practice with.
So that's enough of a setting for our guided meditation. So let's, let's land, let's arrive, let's arrive in this body.
Ah, let's arrive.
Letting go of all the words, letting go, letting go of the words, letting go of any thoughts, just arriving in the body, in the tender sensations of this body sitting, this amazing miracle of life.
Pulsating, breathing, blood flowing through the organs, listening, sensing, just this amazing body. Ah, inhabiting it fully, arriving in it fully.
My body, wow, so incredible to have a body, wow.
So much work, so well, even if there, there may be challenges in the body, so much of it works so amazingly, well.
Dropping in, dropping in the weight internally, to your belly, dropping in, letting, letting the breath be breathed on its own, to lower abdomen.
And with each breath, landing, landing more deeply, arriving more fully into the present moment.
Just taking a moment of refuge, taking refuge with the breath and the body.
As much silence in your silence as is available.
And if thoughts arise, it's okay, they will, they do, not a problem, not a problem.
Gently smiling at the thoughts.
Saying thank you, thank you so much. Let's come back later, not now, come back later.
Letting the body, the breath, relaxing the body. Ah, be the center of your joyful attention.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just being breathed, just being breathed.
Breath in the abdomen, calming soothing.
Breath out.
Just here, now, deliciously here, in the body, embodied.
Being in the body can help expand our vision, not being in our heads. So come, come back to the body.
Breath out.
Breath out.
Breath out.
Breath out.
Spending another minute or two just arriving.
With the breath, with the body, before we turn.
We'll open our hearts to Mitta.
And now I would like to invite us.
As if we were watching a movie of our lives still staying embodied.
Feeling the breath, feeling the feet on the floor, our hands, our bottom on the cushion.
Not getting heavy, but staying embodied, and yet in this movie theater, we see with our heart, not with our head, with our heart.
With our bodies, we perceive the arc of our lives, the arc.
Having been born.
The sweet, sweet newborn, finding themselves at the world.
Maybe a little smile, feeling of tenderness arises.
Feeling of tenderness.
This being, this being who is me, and yet not me.
This precious child.
As if you were a newborn, not thinking so much about what happened, or was she either loved, or challenged, or challenged with none of that.
If those come up, please drop them.
Not the door we're entering tonight, but as if you were that newborn.
Embodied, wow, in this amazing, miraculous world, mystery, wow, incredible.
Everything new, everything fresh.
The sun, the clouds, the green grass, butterflies, water.
Now bowing to that little newborn.
And now let's move forward in time for the purpose of this practice.
Of course, life is so uncertain, and we don't know what is going to happen when, and how longer lives might be.
We could be hit by a bus and die tomorrow.
And yet for the purpose of this practice, this visualization, let's imagine ourselves perhaps years from now.
So there's a sense of spaciousness, perspective, looking, looking at the world from the perspective of, let's suppose a life well lived by that.
Whatever needs to happen, needed to happen, did happen, or not.
We're just at a state of peace and equanimity, letting go.
Now looking at the clouds from that perspective of the end of life.
Again, not knowing what it will be like, but just for the sake of this guided imagery for a moment.
Clouds, sun, maybe sunset, trees, butterflies.
Whatever images of nature, soothe and calm you, maybe it's the ocean.
Maybe gratitude arises, thank you.
Wow, this miracle that I was a part of.
Maybe even saying goodbye to the body.
This miracle that was my body.
This body that is me and also not me.
This being is so much more magnificent.
With so many dimensions.
Maybe a sense of warmth, tenderness arises for this being.
Who is you and not you?
Parting, parting.
Thank you, goodbye world.
Now bowing, bowing, staying embodied, feeling your body, your heart.
Feet, your hands, your bottom on the cushion.
Bowing to this image.
Now letting your vision be expansive.
Including all these versions of yourself.
So many versions.
So many ups and downs between the moment of birth, moment of death and this moment here.
So many moments of joy.
Bliss, so many challenges.
So much growth, it's just all beautiful, mysterious, unique.
Letting your heart, inviting perhaps, inviting gently.
Your heart to include all of these beings, all these slices of this being.
Through time.
The old movies, there would be reels, all these different images, these slices of life.
Don't have to think about them all, just letting your heart open up.
No sweetheart, this being, this being knows me.
Loving unconditionally, offering love, good will.
To all their beauty, their divinity, their Buddha nature, their foibles, all their mistakes, all their pain, their sorrows.
Unconditionally loving at all.
Not picking and choosing.
Thank you.
Maybe appreciation, gratitude arises for this being, who is you, doing their best.
Maybe warmth, good will, love.
If you're expanding your arms, stretching wide, far and wide.
Loving this being.
Even what seems unlovable at times.
Loving that too, loving that especially that.
Especially that because often what appears to us as unlovable really is suffering, really is dukkha, especially loving that.
Thank you.
And maybe one of the images of the real comes up in the moment in time, maybe, maybe not, that attracts you.
Attracts your heart especially, wanting, calling to be loved, to be held unconditionally in love.
Maybe it was a time when you went through challenging time, valiantly courageously, or anything at all.
Living their beyond conditional love.
Living their beyond conditional love and acceptance.
And now bowing to that image, coming back to this body.
This moment in time that is also one tableau, an image out of this real, this movie real of this life.
This expansiveness of vision including loving yourself unconditionally for whatever is arising in this moment.
This being who is you and also not you, an expression of beauty, goodness, divine, Buddha nature, whatever words we like to give it.
To love and to be loved.
There are so many dimensions of this, here, this being.
As if we're looking into a mirror, mirror looking into a mirror, passing back and forth.
Infinitude, loving this being and being loved.
Stretching into infinity all these images in the present moment.
So many dimensions are humanity and divinity, loving and being loved.
And as we bring this sitting to a close, maybe in your mind's eye, bowing to yourself.
Your divinity bows to you, you bow to your inner Buddha.
Toe is bowing to home.
Thank you, keep going, keep loving.
May all beings including ourselves open up our hearts with full love, unconditional love to ourselves, to our own inner goodness.
May all beings be free.
Thank you everyone.
Thank you for your practice. Thank you for being part of the Sangha.
Even if this is your first time, you are a part of Sangha now.
So we have some time for reflections, questions, comments.
And the invitation as always is what you share is for the benefit of both yourself to be held witness and also for the benefit of others, the Sangha.
It's a gift.
Sharing questions, confusions, insights, aha moments, it's all the gift we offer each other.
And if you just send it to me in chat, I will not read your name. If you send it to everyone, then it's public. I will read your name as well as your reflection.
One reflection. Thank you for the vitamin metta you offer us here. That is so sweet. Thank you for that reflection.
Vitamin metta. I like that. Vitamin M. Yes, we all need our daily vitamin M, don't we?
It supports our heart. It supports our minds, our bodies and the way we show up in the world.
So, especially if you are new, haven't spoken for a while, you're so welcome to read. And if you want to speak, oh yes, please raise your zoom hand and you go to the reactions on the computer and you find it there.
Raise hand. Otherwise, I will not see you because I only see just a few of you because of privacy. Since this is on YouTube, since I'm on spotlight, I only see very few people, not every one of you.
Nancy says, yes, nourishing to be in Sangha and meditation. Yes, I agree. Nourishing for me too, to be with you, friends.
Questions, comments, reflections. Why did you notice?
Jane says, no words for how beautiful that was. Thank you, Jane.
May it be nourishing. Practice be nourishing.
So I can say more, but I'm going to pause and invite to see any voices would like to be brought into the space.
What did you notice? What came up for you? What happened?
Karen says, I found it so interesting and mysterious to reflect on how I am and also I'm not the same self at different ages.
I could probably think about that for a long time. He has pretty mysterious and magical current. Yes, it's...
Yeah, so I appreciate that that reflection has been ignited for you. So the invitation I have is actually drop that in because it's already been dropped in through this meditation.
So take it with you. See, it don't so much think about it because many of these reflections don't lend themselves to thinking about.
But as it's been dropped in, carry it. Carry it with yourself. When you go to bed tonight, just open to it.
Not thinking about it, but just kind of let yourself soak in it tomorrow. Maybe when you go for a walk outside, kind of take it for a walk with you and see what might arise.
Yeah, and see more dimensions of this mystery might open up for you. This is lovely. Thank you.
Wayne, I see your hand is raised. Please.
I've been... It was helpful for me to sit with my... I was not looking at anything, but just to almost not quite completely close my eyelids, but just keep them slightly open, but my eyes unfocused and it just helped me stay a little alert enough.
Sometimes for these six p.m. sittings, when I completely close my eyes, I wander off and my mind often runs more when I'm...
Yeah, yeah, great. I am so glad you've discovered that and also sharing it with others, Wayne, because that opening the eyes was just a slight slit to let light in.
That's a fantastic tool to be used when the mind is foggy or sleepy very gently, just it raises the energy of the body. Beautiful. I'm so delighted you've discovered that. Lovely. Barbara, please.
Still muted.
Oh, there.
Thank you, Nikki. I appreciated what you said about the arc of your life and I thought of my life like a rainbow, you know, beginning little and then getting older and now, you know, sort of kind of getting towards the end and
I found my mind went to visualizing myself as a young child exploring the beach where I grew up near a beach and I don't know, it was just a lovely reflection on
sort of where my life has gone at different parts and ending up here where we are.
I don't know, just a reflection on the totality of the life experience and I want to thank you. It's been a good life so far now.
It's been a good life. What I'm hearing, there's a sense of gratitude that has arisen for you. There's a sense of gratitude and I trust there was meant to also for this being who is you. That's what I'm hearing.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Gratitude and metta for this arc of life. Lovely. Beautiful. Thank you, Barbara. And Abraham, I see your hand and after this will go. So please unmute. Yes, you're unmuted.
Hi. I also really like that looking at the arc of my life and it's helpful to not get too caught up in whatever is the Sherman drum that's happening right now.
But also you made mention of seeing ourselves when we were courageous, when we stood in the breach, when we stood up for what was true and and didn't desert ourselves.
And I appreciated that.
Thank you, Abraham. Thank you so much for highlighting that. Yes, I did drop that in and how for you that ignited something in your heart and in appreciation. It's beautiful. Thank you all.
So, yeah, thank you all. So it's six fifties. The time one more reflection has just come in. Viewing the arc of my life was very effective. I spent decades in addictive patterns.
I've had a lot of regrets. I'm so sorry. Then me said, Yes, I know. Now me answered. It was such a relief. Thank you.
Wow. Thank you. That is so beautiful to be in that.
Yes, to ask for forgiveness and offer understanding to ourselves. Thank you so beautiful, so powerful. Thank you for sharing that.
So dear ones, let's turn, let's turn our attention to practicing in small groups with one another holding each other with metta with appreciation.
And if you can stay, please do. You have to leave no judgment.
But small groups can be so sweet. They can be so supportive.
So I'm going to create the rooms now. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. See what kind of wisdom.
There's so much wisdom in this Sangha. See, hear the wisdom that your friends here offer you.
So the rooms are created, opening them. Take care.
All closed. Everybody is back. Welcome back. And we have just about a minute if there are any reflections, especially if you have not spoken today.
If you'd like to share something in chat or quickly raise your hand, just bring us home.
You'll have 30 seconds, please. Anything that came up when you're in groups.
Thank you.
Okay, we're going once, going twice. Just want to appreciate.
Jerry says, the small group helped me like myself better than the past. Oh, that's sweet. It's nice. And Nancy says, we discussed the arc of our lives. Very lovely. That's very sweet.
So thank you all. Thank you for your practice. And yes, happy birthday again, Casey, sharing part of you, the arc of your life, all of us sharing arcs of our lives in this moment together, supporting each other,
practicing, supporting ourselves and all beings everywhere. Thank you for being part of the Sangha. May all beings be happy. May all things be free, including ourselves.
Thank you.
