 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me okay? Yeah? Great. Yes, two thumbs up even. Yay. Thanks, Nancy. Good morning. Good morning. How are you? I'm very happy to be with you all in person. Wow. Three dimensions. Sweet. It still surprises me after two and a half years of Zoom. So let's begin with sitting together and I'll offer a very lightly guided sit just to help us settle. Now arriving, arriving in this body, arriving in this moment in time. And bringing awareness to this body, to this body sitting. Or maybe at home you are lying down if your body needs to lie down right now because of pain or self-care. The position of this body. And if there is movement needed right now, rolling back the shoulders perhaps, maybe trying to sit up a little straighter just a tiny bit, just to bring more awareness, more uprightness, more sense of integrity and alignment. And feeling, feeling the connection of your body to the earth. If you're sitting on the cushion, feeling your bottom on the cushion, your legs, your feet. If you find a chair, the bottom of your feet on the earth. Feeling grounded. There might be a lot happening, maybe a lot has happened before you got here physically, figuratively. It's okay. It's all right. That can be happening still, but it's like a globe, it's like a snow globe that's shaken. Still settling, still settling, it's okay. Set the snow globe down on the earth. Feel grounded, feel the connection of it. Feel the stability of this body while all the flurries, all the flurries settle, the flurries, it's okay. But be aware, pay attention, pay attention. This moment is precious. Fleeting, pay attention. Let the breath move. Let the breath move, however it wants, deep shallow. Move through the body, not controlled. Let the body be relaxed, soft. The mind be soft. When the body is relaxed, the mind can relax, checking in with the forehead, softening if needed, the jaw, neck, shoulders, eyes in your socket, in their socket. Let them relax. Ah, moving down, arms, hands, chest, abdomen, sit bones, and legs and feet. Ah, really landing, arriving more deeply, every moment. Ah, moving down, arriving more deeply, arriving more deeply, arriving more deeply, arriving more deeply. Ah, Welcoming each and every in-breath and out-breath. Every in-breath like spring. Every out-breath like the fall, leaves falling and letting go. Every out-breath like spring. Every out-breath like spring. Every out-breath like spring. Every out-breath like spring. Every out-breath like spring. And appreciating and letting go in each out-breath. With equanimity. Every moment a new arrival and a new letting go. Arising and passing, arising and passing. Such is the nature of human life. Pay attention. Arising and passing. Arising and passing. Arising and passing. And if you find your mind is travelling to distant places, memories, plans. It's like the snow globe is getting shaken again. It's okay, it's alright. Notice what has happened and set the snow globe down again and again and again. Become embodied, connect with your body. Let awareness know that you're sitting and breathing. No judgement, no self-recombination. Just gently set it down again and again and connect with this passing moment. And this body, this river of experience, the body, mind and heart. Arising and passing. Arising and passing. Arising and passing. Arising and passing. Arising and passing. Arising and passing. Arising and passing. Arising and passing. Letting the attention be turned inward. To the flow of experience in the body. As a way of grounding, settling. And knowing, knowing change. Sensations keep shifting and moving. Maybe tingling in your hands, sit bones. Temperature shifting. Maybe feeling the abdomen expand and contract with each breath. This landscape of shifting, changing experience. It keeps changing. Stay with the change. Arising and passing. Arising and passing. Feel impermanence intimately for yourself internally with each moment. Arising and passing. Arising and passing. Arising and passing. Arising and passing. Intimately knowing change internally in each moment, not as an idea, but as a felt sense experience first hand. What do you notice? Does it stay the same? Does it keep shifting? Does it keep your breath, sensations, thoughts keep arising? Seemingly, uncontrollably? Notice what's happening. Just pay attention. Get to know change intimately. And if at any point knowing change feels overwhelming, too much is changing internally. Then feel the stability of the posture being grounded on the earth. Feel the snow globe resting on the earth, stable. Stability, stability. The support seeing change. beat Can there be a sense of spaciousness, stability, groundedness, your body, your mind, sitting upright, grounded, rooted, with change, with change, internally, making space allowing for change, as it is the nature of all things? Can we welcome change? With stability, groundedness, equanimity. And not fight against it. It's all changing all the time. Can we intimately know this for ourselves, even for a split second? And as we bring this sitting period to a close, appreciating yourself for your practice, not judging what happened or did not happen. You did your best. You showed up and aligned your actions as best as you could with your intentions. Wonderful. Appreciating yourself for having shown up, practiced, and trusting there is goodness. There's goodness in this cultivation and offering this goodness to yourself and all beings everywhere. May my actions, my practice, my wholeheartedness, without attachment to results, may my goodness be of service to all beings everywhere, including myself. May all beings everywhere be happy and free, including myself. Thank you.
