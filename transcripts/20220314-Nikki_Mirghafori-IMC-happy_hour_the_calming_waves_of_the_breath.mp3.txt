So, hello dear Sangha. Hello, welcome. Good to be with all of you.
So, to be in this world of ours at this time, at this point in what's happening geopolitically, et cetera, et cetera.
So, there may be, there may be some heaviness, of course, of course. It's hard not to have heaviness paying attention to news and what is happening.
So, during this evening's happy hour practice, I want to continue what we've been paying attention to last week in different ways, addressing, addressing,
send the need for stability, the need for peace, the need for groundedness, so that there is stability internally to hold, to meet the challenges of the world.
We did equanimity practice last week. We also did calming the energy body with the breath.
Many of you seem to like that. Just sense of bringing calm. We did joy practice on Friday, again, as a way to support us in challenging times.
All of these practices and compassion practice, of course, both equanimity and joy practice can be support, can be support for a compassion practice.
So, what I'd like to invite us to engage in tonight is more of, slightly differently, this attending to the energy body in terms of establishing calm, establishing centeredness,
establishing groundedness, which can both hold joy and sorrow. It can hold both, but there needs to be a stability.
There needs to be a sense of equi-poise, equanimity, to hold whatever there is, instead of toppling over, especially when the news in the world is so challenging and difficult and heartbreaking.
So, that is all the framing that I think is necessary for tonight. And let's just settle in and practice together.
So, let us arrive, let us arrive together as a sangha, as a community, and individually, in this body, in this moment in time.
Turning the gaze inward, attending to whatever is arising in this moment here, in this body.
So, if you are taking stock, greeting yourself, sensing, sensing internally.
What's happening in different parts of the body? You can check in popcorn style.
Just know, getting to know, oh yeah, maybe the head is a little tight, shoulders, hands might be cool or warm.
Maybe the feet are tense, maybe the sit bones are relaxed, or whatever, whatever is happening in your body.
Take time, take time.
And knowing what's happening in the body doesn't mean that we judge or we push away, we just know, oh, this is what's happening.
Hello, dear body.
Let me get to know you.
Hello, dear body.
And is it possible to release, to relinquish thoughts, entanglements that are not helpful right now, as you take refuge in this moment?
Taking refuge in your intentions and the goodness of your intentions for being here, practicing, aligning, aligning how you spend your time with your values.
Taking refuge in this goodness.
Just this moment, just this moment of cultivation is enough.
Maybe bring awareness, maybe bring your awareness to the heart center, very on the center of your chest.
Let there be a sense of gentleness, kindness.
As if you were with your hand gently caressing, holding the middle of your chest caressing, physically or in your mind's eye.
Softening.
Getting the breath be natural.
Not so much that you are breathing, but you're being breathed.
You're being breathed.
Let yourself be breathed.
As if the breaths, these gentle breaths are coming through the heart center, the middle of the chest.
Lending, contracting, bellowing ever so gently.
The rhythmic motion of the chest and the abdomen.
A calming soothing.
The calming soothing of the energy body, the body inside, energetically releasing.
Letting yourself enjoy, enjoy, be healed, be calmed, be soothed by the rhythm of the breath.
The chest, heart center, the abdomen bellowing through the body.
Ever so gently happening on its own.
Could be very shallow, that's fine, let it be shallow.
Or be, doesn't matter.
The breath might be slow, slow, slow.
Each breath, calming, calming the body.
Each breath and lullaby reverberating through your whole body, calming the entire body.
Slowly, slowly.
Slowly, slowly.
Slowly, slowly.
Slowly, slowly.
Slowly, slowly.
Slowly, slowly.
As thoughts arise, as they will arise, not a problem.
No need for self-judgment or criticism, simply notice, oh, this is what I'm thinking about right now.
This is the thought that has arisen.
For the sake of this practice, release, not that there's anything wrong with thinking.
For the sake of this cultivation, bowing to the thought, releasing, thank you, please come back later.
If you're important enough, you will come back.
Letting there be an enjoyment of the breath as if it's lapping of waves, waves lapping on the shore of the body, the whole body.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The lapping waves, calming soothing, moving through the heart center, the abdomen, the whole body, releasing, relaxing, centering.
There's a gentleness, an expression of metta, an expression of love.
There's this gentleness of the lapping waves through the body.
Stealing the whole body with ease, with metta.
Not overpowering, but gentle, caring.
Responding to whatever is needed right now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Can your chest be calmed with this loving, gentle energy, these lapping waves of the breath?
Your heart be calmed, soothed, held.
Thank you.
Can your whole trunk trust in the abdomen?
Be soothed, calmed the lapping waves of the breath, gentle, gentle, never so gently.
Thank you.
Can this gentle lapping waves of the breath filled with metta?
Can these waves radiate, fill the limbs of your shoulders?
Energy is calming energy moving up from the chest, filling the shoulders, the neck, radiating down the arms to the hands.
Moving up through the head, radiating down from the chest and the abdomen.
Down to the belly, lower belly.
Shilling the sit bones, the waves calming the upper legs, pouring into the knees.
The lower legs and feet radiating down through the feet and upwards on the top of the head in all directions.
It's calming soothing energy of metta, not contained, not limited to where the skin ends, but further out as if we're sitting.
It's expansive sitting, spacious no boundaries of these waves lapping inside outside.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Was this container greater than our body for sitting in?
Sitting in this container filled with lapping waves, gentle, gentle, metta.
Lapping waves of the breath, filled with metta kindness, benevolence.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This whole container that includes our body filled with metta, with care for this being who is me, and the sense of ease.
Of course this care, this metta radiates outward, this whole body, it's a body of metta, gentle, gentle, caring.
Just being in the world, it radiates kindness, touching others, doesn't have to be forced.
How else could it be?
The body filled with gentle metta
will impact others
with metta.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let the energy body be calmed.
Calmed and radiant with the breath, with the metta filled breath.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let this calm to nourishing, lapping waves of metta, be healing, grounding.
Let yourself enjoy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Letting there be equal amounts, radiating inside, radiating outside this metta and calm this peace, radiating through the entire world.
It's a gift you are offering, gift of your calmness, your stability.
Peace offering that to the world, with care.
Thank you.
May the fruits of our practice be of service, be offered freely to all beings everywhere, our calm, our care, our stability,
for ourselves and others, may it be of service, may all beings everywhere, especially those in our zones, may they have peace and ease, may all beings be free.
Thank you.
Thank you for your practice everyone.
If you have time for any reflections, any questions you may want to share, you can type in chat if you like, or raise your zoom hand.
If you type in chat, if it's typed to me alone, I won't read your name, just the comment.
So it's private and if it's typed to everyone, I'll read the name also.
Any reflections you'd like to share for the benefit of everyone in the Sangha?
Any questions? And also acknowledging that this practice can be quiet and very calming, this energy body practice, so you may not be moved to speak.
Bill says, wonderful session Niki, thank you. You are welcome and thank you for your practice.
Another reflection, wonderful. Deborah says, I really appreciated the image of the lapping along the shore of the lake.
Was I the lake or the shore? Oh, I love that question. Was I the lake or the shore? Or both? Love it, love it. Thank you, Deborah.
It's lovely, I love the image.
Vicky says, very calming indeed. I love the waves too, thank you. You're welcome and thank you Vicky for your practice.
Catherine, I see your hand.
Yeah, just today is a very difficult day for me to settle or find ease, but I've been doing this practice now long enough to take refuge in the knowledge that that changes and to just keep practicing and have much less reactivity to the difficulty of settling in this particular session.
And so I feel really grateful for that, that I can come as I am and accept myself as I am.
Thank you for that gift, that gift of reflection, Catherine. Indeed, indeed, knowing that it's impermanent, it comes and goes, causes and conditions arise and sometimes it's easier to settle, quote unquote, sometimes it isn't, and yet to hold all of that with kindness and acceptance just as you said.
And beautiful to have that, to have cultivated that acceptance and care, no matter what, that is metta. Yeah, it's not reward oriented only if you settle then I will love you.
No, I love you either way, sweetheart. It's okay. Yeah, thanks for bringing that into the space, Catherine.
Okay.
A couple more reflections. Wonderful way to go off into the evening, calm and centered. Very grateful, Nikki, you're welcome.
Megan says, the wave imagery made me think of the Disney movie Moana. She is called to enter the ocean and embarks on a hero's journey. It's not easy. There are waves and storms, but she follows the call.
Oh, I love that reflection. Yes. Hero's journey through our breath. Yeah, I love that. Thanks for that reflection, Megan. Love the imagery.
Jerry says, you mentioned that we need to reach out to all in warzone, but we are not in this world with the potential warzone.
I'm not quite understanding the question, Jerry.
I think what I meant to say is this radiating out, the radiating out of care to everyone and offering the calm. So I'm not quite sure what the question is. I can quite get it.
May the lapping waves shore up our body.
And one last reflection. Thank you, Nikki. I feel strong enough to hold both joy and sorrow. Yet light like a snowflake. Yet light like a snowflake, almost free from gravity.
Yeah. Yeah.
Jerry is clarifying, are we all not in a potential warzone? Oh, of course we are. Everything can. Oh, yeah, of course. Everything can change in any minute, not to make us anxious, but life is just what it is.
Life is anything can happen at any moment. You can be hit by a truck, it could be war, it could be anything.
And yet, and yet, can we stay calm? Can we stay centered in the middle of the waves, the waves of the ocean, supported by the internal waves of calm?
So I'd like to invite us to turn into sitting together, maybe just in silence, maybe we just hold silence space for one another, or maybe we share.
And one last reflection. This is from Julie on YouTube. Thank you for a beautiful soothing meditation.
A great reminder to come back to the heart space at all times. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
So, thank you all. Donka says Gitta. Bitta, thank you, Gitta. So I'll create the breakout rooms. And again, take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Just maybe there's just need to hold space for one another.
Maybe not much needs to be said, or maybe something needs to be said. It's all, it's all good. So I'm going to open the rooms in a moment. And yeah, take care. Here we go.
Okay, welcome back, everyone. The rooms are closed. Everybody's back. We just have a couple minutes, if any, last minute reflection, especially from being together in the groups.
If you'd like to share, the floor is yours.
Going once, going twice.
It seems like there is a feeling of closure. Hope you enjoyed. Yeah. Yeah, sounds good. I see a request to have some guidance about how to behave the group. I think that is important.
I often do say to please take care of yourself and take care of others and speak from your own experience, not speak about other people's experience. Please, please do not do that.
And the person who privately messaged me, I would appreciate if you stay later and tell me if their issues are rising, because I really would like to make sure this is a safe place for everyone, and that people don't drop out because they don't feel safe with someone, you know, talking about their
experience, etc., or anything else that's happening, so please do stay and help me help support the community. And Deborah says, I told my group that during the meditation, I found myself stay, stay, staying instead of go, go, going.
Ah, yeah. Is it a question or is it a statement? I wasn't quite sure, Deborah. I think it's a statement.
Maybe I would just leave it, leave it as that, and I don't see your hand either, or so maybe. Oh, statement. Yes. Okay, sounds good, Deborah. We'll let that sit, we'll let that stand as it is.
So let's bring our evening to a close. Thank you so much, everyone. Thank you for your practice, for your dedication, cultivation, both for your own sake and the sake of all beings everywhere. May all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thank you. And good night.
