Yesterday, we explored the Four Resolves and how wisdom and truthfulness came before
resolve so that we could make results that were skillful and appropriate for our situation,
for our capacity, and the Four Resolves of the Buddha, the resolve for wisdom, clear-seeing,
deep understanding, the resolve for truth, to see things as they actually are free from
assumption and bias, beliefs, and the resolve for generosity, the aspects of generosity of
both giving and releasing, and the resolve for peace, ease and balance, and then we infuse
those resolves with kindness so that our practice is perfused in metta, this wish for our own
well-being and the well-being of everyone, to bring friendliness to all of our experience,
and to have the resolve of being free from aversion. And so as we practice this morning, there might
be a particular resolve that comes to mind for you, the resolve for kindness, peace, generosity,
the resolve to be steady in your practice, and the resolve to not cling that's a way of releasing,
and to see clearly, to notice which mind states are beneficial and which are causing you suffering.
So let's begin by settling into the body, this resolve to be embodied in our lives,
to sense the connection in our own body to the earth, and to sense the connection to all those
around us. When the Buddha spoke about paying attention internally and externally, he was
referring in one way to this interconnection with all of life. You might sense that right
now, as you breathe in, taking in air that was external, as you breathe out, releasing,
this interchange of the breath of life.
If you like, you can stay with the attention on the breath or on the body. Very simple.
Awareness of being alive. Just this body, this breath.
If it seems right for you, you can allow the attention to be open, including whatever
arises in your experience, a sound, a sensation, an emotion, a thought. Resting at ease, knowing
this experience is a rise, change, sometimes disappear, or another experience draws your
attention. Perhaps aligning with the resolve to stay present, open, relaxed, and mindful,
and gently keep the continuity of knowing.
And
the beauty of resolve and of patience is that each moment is a fresh start. That releasing
of past and future and being here, now. A long time ago, the movie actress Mary Pickford
said in life, it's not the falling down that matters, it's the getting up again. A new,
fresh moment. Intimate, alive.
Continuing now in the stillness. Aware, receptive, relaxed, and uninvolved with the experiences
that arise. Undistracted, at ease.
Beautiful, beautiful, sweet, loving.
Notice where the attention is right now.
And the attitude in the mind, wanting or resisting, kind or judging, aligning with
this resolve for generosity, receiving experience just as it is, as best you can with friendliness.
Knowing that kindness can simply mean being here without aversion.
And that includes without aversion to aversion.
And if we're pulled into distraction stories, not now, here, or a soft no, not right now,
not taking that exit, getting off out of that carriage of the train, whatever analogy works
for you.
If you've made a resolve, notice that we continually need to realign with that.
And if you've made a resolve, notice that we continually need to realign with that.
And if you've made a resolve, notice that we continually need to realign with that.
And if you've made a resolve, notice that we continually need to realign with that.
And from time to time, you might also notice the balance of energy and effort.
Does the body feel tight or tense?
Is there striving or just pushing?
Striving can be very subtle and we can relax back and receive experience.
Or are we spacing out, sleepy, and need to bring in
a little more energy and interest, brighten the mind.
Very gentle adjustments that support our practice.
Not fixing or trying to get it right.
More a releasing of trying to get it right.
This, here, now.

Gil was talking about if it's not simple it's not vipassana and it came to my mind when he said that an acronym that we were trained in in medical school.
KISS K-I-S-S keep it simple stupid.
But you can change that to keep it simple softly.
Or you could say keep it simple sweetie if you're so inclined.
But it's helpful when the mind gets all over involved.
Simple.
So with much regret as you know or may have forgotten I have to leave this morning when I agreed to come and take Kamala's place and I'm so happy that I did.
I had another commitment that I didn't want to rearrange that's starting today actually but I'll be there this evening and then for the next two days.
So I'm really regret that I won't be part of your closing circle but it's been such a pleasure to be with everyone here and just looking at all your faces how much I've appreciated getting to know everyone.
So I really thank you and thank Gil for inviting me and that others in my community were supported me to go.
And I'd also like to offer blessings to Kamala.
I'll be hopefully speaking to her in the next few days and to appreciate so much getting to know Jozen.
And to wish you all that the Parames continue to gradually grow and flower in your lives.
I find them such a beautiful practice to have the resolve to keep exploring.
So the other thing is that this morning there'll be sign up interviews for people who would like support with their practice.
So if you're someone who's in the community here and you might be able to speak at another time or if you just like to say hello and socialize with Gil or Jozen a little bit.
You might want to leave the space for someone who actually needs support.
And so the list will be down on the board when you go down and I think that's it.
So any brief questions about resolve and loving kindness, Parames?
And so as I feel into the stillness, this has been such a beautiful retreat. There's been a lot of stillness in this hall and a lot of both sincerity and commitment in all of your practice.
People who are new to practice, people who've been practicing for years, it's been a really wonderful community.
So thank you for your practice and enjoy a full day of practice today.
