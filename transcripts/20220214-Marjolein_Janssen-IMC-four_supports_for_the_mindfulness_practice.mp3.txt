Welcome again.
So then my name is Mariela Janssen. I am from the Netherlands and I live in the
US. That's where the accent and the weird name is from. Very happy to be here with
some of you here in person and some online to YouTube and for those who
celebrate Happy Valentine's Day. I want to thank also the volunteers who make it
possible for us to be here in person at IMC and who make it possible for the
recording and the YouTube stream. So yeah, big bow for the volunteers. Thank you.
Today I'd like to talk about four ways, four helpful, supportive ways that we
can use in our practice, both on and off the cushion. I came up with those
supports a while ago when I was doing a retreat and they were very helpful
reminders for me to stay balanced and stay on course on the path towards a
more peaceful, a more wholesome, a more free life and I still use them
regularly in my practice and so I thought I'd share them and hope that they
are also of use to you or at least maybe one of them. So I'll briefly mention them
first before I dive deeper into each of them and the first might be familiar
which is mindfulness and mindfulness is of course the ability to be aware of
what is happening while it is happening and then the second support I'd like to
talk about is relaxation because if we can relax a little bit in our often
stressful lives this can be very helpful and I will give some tips and tools on
how to do that and then the third support is kindness and I'd like to
specifically focus on kindness towards ourselves because I think that's
something that in our society is often difficult while it is vital for our
well-being and then the fourth support will be return to the present moments so
we all recognize when we are meditation we just go off lost in thoughts of past
or future and just a simple reminder to be in a present moment can be very
helpful so mindfulness relaxation kindness and returning to the present
moments so first mindfulness the Buddha says in the suttas mindfulness is
always useful so we can never go wrong by being mindful it's a very special
quality of mind if you think about it because it really helps us to be aware
of things we see what is happening while it is happening there's not really
another aspect of our mind that can do that and mostly most people live in
their lives without really knowing without really being present for what is
here right now what is happening in our body and mind and we live mostly out of
old patterns and conditionings and tendencies that we cultivated through
our life in our childhood and later on in life without really knowing that we're
doing that a simple example in my own life is that I used to like be super
aversive towards cleaning like if I had to clean my house I was like oh I have to
go clean again and it's really really needed again and I really don't want to
do it and I was like days and days would build up like oh I really need to
clean and I really don't want to and then when I was actually cleaning I was
still aversive towards the cleaning I really want to do something else I
really don't like this and true mindfulness practice I started
recognizing that better enough aversion towards cleaning and I became aware of
like oh maybe this is actually not so useful maybe this is actually painful
to be aversive the whole time and I had to see it maybe like a hundred times
before it started to shift a little bit towards like letting it go and being
more present and just finding it a bit more neutral to clean and sometimes I
now even like it sometimes it's even just a pleasant way of being mindful of
the body so it can actually change so mindfulness can really help us to see
all these old patterns these conditionings that we tend to live from
and we might find very unhelpful unwholesome patterns and tendencies
that are based on greed or aversion or delusion delusion sometimes also called
confusion so it's very useful to keep an eye out for like oh is there any greed
or wanting in the mind is there any aversion is there any confusion
presence but we can also find very helpful and wholesome states of mind
when we start being mindful like patterns that are based on generosity and
compassion and wisdom so if we find those kind of patterns that is very useful
to see because if we say for them if we acknowledge them then they strengthen
and they become more so it's a very good thing to really acknowledge those
kind of patterns and tendencies as well so as you understand probably this
mindfulness Sati in Pali can really help us gain insight into our own minds
insight into what is governing our lives those patterns and tendencies and maybe
another super simple example is when we just start meditation then we find out
like oh the mind thinks a lot I didn't know that like how much the mind is
thinking so that's just just these tiny little simple things that we can notice
and seeing these patterns is of course not always pleasant we we often see
things that are not so pleasant but Sylvia Borstein is a meditation teacher
she says mindfulness meditation doesn't change life life remains a
fragile and unpredictable ever mindfulness meditation changes the
heart's capacity to accept life as it is and so mindfulness can help us to grow
this heart's capacity to be with both the pleasant and the unpleasant to
really have the capacity to be with what is mindfulness itself is a non-judgmental
presence for life for mindfulness it doesn't really matter what happens
mindfulness itself doesn't have a judgment or doesn't need anything to be
different than it is it's just seeing life as it is in this present moment so
in a way we can learn to be not so reactive anymore and not necessarily
want want things to change not necessarily want to push it away or pull
it towards us but just to be there with it just to open to whatever it is
however difficult it might be I do have to say that is it's a training it's not
something that's like in an instant like we can do that sometimes we just need
some time in this process so it can be useful to practice with easy things
first and we don't start with the biggest thing in our life to open to that
but to start with maybe something small like if someone cuts you on the highway
and you feel anger coming up that you start with that anger or when you have
an itch and during your meditation you you don't want to move so you feel the
irritation of the itch that kind of thing might be useful and then slowly we
will build some resilience and bit by bit we have more and more capacity to be
with difficult things so patience is really important in this process really
see it as a gradual learning process and I do want to say that we sometimes need
to back off sometimes it's just overwhelming with what we experience and
it's just too much and then it can be just really skillful to turn away from
what we experience to to turn the attention away can be also very skillful
and wholesome at times that doesn't important side note to what I'm saying
but in the cases that it's not overwhelming and super difficult then
when we do open to difficulty then to help us get a little bit motivated we
could ask ourselves like do we want to live in ignorance or do we want to know
what's happening even if it's maybe not so pleasant because only when we know
what is happening can we change it and can we work towards a more wholesome way
of living with a bit less reactivity maybe so when we know we can start to
learn from it and gain wisdom and we can practice this knowing of what is
happening both in formal meditation as well as in our daily lives and especially
in daily life we can see those patterns and conditionings that that govern our
day our lives and our activities and we can see simple things maybe like
craving for coffee in the morning or that we see that when we say hello to our
neighbor and that it's actually coming from our kind heart or we see the change
of mood during the day from energized to down to at ease to stressed we can see
all sorts of interesting things
so when we start to see more and more know more and more about our own minds
and hearts then we start to develop more and more wisdom and skillfulness in our
lives and one of my teachers say no rotation he talks about that there's
this wisdom part in the mind that wisdom is like this separate part in the mind
just like like anger and love they're all like little entities in itself in the
mind and then those can grow or weakened hopefully with anger for example and
then when we start to see things with mindfulness then the wisdom part of our
minds can start to learn from that and one way of learning would be that what
we see and what we're gonna see is that what leads to happiness and freedom and
peace and what leads to suffering and that's a very important thing to start
seeing like what I realized with the cleaning that my response of being
super aversive towards cleaning was actually not leading to happiness but
was contributing to more and more suffering in my life so we start to see
the painful habits and then start to let go of it because wisdom starts to
start to let go of his wisdom is the is the part of the mind that can let go
it's not us that let's go let's go
so we don't necessarily meditate to get rid of a problem but a more helpful way
to see is that we meditate to start to understand and to learn and to gain
wisdom
so and this way you can make mindfulness your whole your whole
pot your your whole life becomes your pot because it becomes this fertile
ground for wisdom that's what I wanted to say about mindfulness and then the
second second support I'd like to talk about is relaxation maybe you recognize
that sometimes you sit down for relaxation for mindfulness or for
meditation and you just sit there and you do your thing but you don't really
start anywhere you just sit there so what often is very helpful is when we
have a little bit of a beginning when we start our meditation and one of the
things we can do to start would be to relax because when we deliberately
relax then it will condition the next moment and next moment so every moment
conditions the next moment so if we deliberately relax then that helps us in
our meditation so we can also relax during daily life we don't have to wait
till we sit down for meditation anytime you think about it you can relax like
when you drive to work or when you're in the bathroom or when you're eating
whenever you think about it but how do we do that how do we relax like the
first easy thing to do is to relax the body because the body and the mind are
connected so if you consciously relax your body then it will affect your mind
as well and one way to relax the body is to do a body scan so you just go through
the body and just touch on with your attention on each part of the body and
often this little bit of attention for the body already relaxes the body and
sometimes direct invitation to the body helps the body to relax so you can say
may the body relax or if we have certain tensions in certain parts of
the body we can we can invite those parts to relax like the shoulders maybe
the forehead or the little muscles around the eye sometimes get get tense and
sometimes just breathing in and out a bit deeper a few times can really relax
as well and we can also work with the mind to relax and the simplest way is
again an invitation you can say oh may the mind relax and see if that does
anything sometimes it will sometimes it won't because what relaxation is
actually what it actually is is an absence of unwholesome mind states so
when we experience those unwholesome roots for example greed wanting a
version delusion confusion that I was talking about earlier these cause all
sorts of unwholesome mind states to arise like wanting attachment frustration
despair sadness fear anger whatever it is that we experience if we experience
any of those kind of mind states then relaxation becomes a bit harder because
when these mind states subsides then relaxation will automatically follow so
relaxation is about the absence of desire or a version or confusion so any
time you find yourself being not relaxed you could ask yourself like oh is
there maybe desire a version or confusion present right now is is there
anything I want different right now because if we're in contention with
reality it's really hard to relax so when I was feeling tense about the
cleaning I couldn't relax you know I was feeling tense I was a versus I or you
know you you feel your whole body contracting and then when that lets go
then there can be a relaxation and there can be an ease in it in the
cleaning and that's a whole process of course it's not that when once we
recognize oh oh I'm a versus or or I'm stressful that it let's go immediately
sometimes it does sometimes just a simple recognition is enough but
sometimes it doesn't sometimes we need to see those patterns like over and over
again just a recognizing of it is it's the first step
and this of course ties back into the mindfulness and recognizing of what's
happening is mindfulness so mindfulness is the basis for the relaxation in a
way you can say so with mindfulness we can start to recognize like we can
also start to see like oh I am not relaxed right now and indeed there is a
version or one thing maybe in the mind or you can see oh I'm actually really
relaxed and the mind is pretty wholesome right now you can see start to see
that those things are related connected so that's what I wanted to say about
relaxation and then the third support is kindness so as I said I'd like to talk
about kindness towards ourselves even though kindness towards others is very
useful and wholesome of course so fantastic also to practice kindness
towards others but I think for a lot of people here in the West yeah kindness
for ourselves is a bit underdeveloped like many of us are you know somewhat
unkind towards ourselves we experience self-judgment or self-hatred or
or self-loathing things can be pretty strong patterns of the mind and the
Buddha says hatred never ends with hatred by love alone it ends this is an
ancient truth so sometimes we try to overcome this patterns of self-judgment
or self-hatred with hatred like oh I don't want this pattern I it needs to go
away but it doesn't really work because then we're trying to end our hatred
with hatred and hatred is a little bit of a strong word a version is kind of a
milder form of hatred you could say so these patterns we can actually overcome
by kindness kindness towards ourselves I would say that developing this this
kindness for ourselves is actually for Westerners often a fast track to more
ease and more peace in our lives and I do admit it's not easy to develop this
it can be it can be quite a challenge especially because these patterns can
be of for example self-judgment can be very strong but we all are somewhere in
our practice and we all have to start somewhere so even if it's not easy and a
lot of those kind of patterns come up it's still worth it to incrementally
try to practice this I think that trying to cultivate the kindness will be
beneficial for almost anyone even if you already feel kind to your towards
yourself you can always practice a little bit more and if you imagine being
kind to yourself how that influence like every aspect of your life and there
are several ways to do this to practice this kindness towards ourselves and the
first one is very simple that it would be just a simple intention so we can have
the intention to be kind just the intention to cultivate kindness because
intention shapes shapes our mind and shapes the next moment in the next
moment what I said with the conditionings of the moments so it's a very
powerful tool I can use that in all sorts of settings not only with kindness
but it can be very strong a strong way to cultivate it because the mind will
start to direct us in that direction even though we might be miles away from
kindness right now it will give us just a direct interaction it's like trying
to launch those big big tinker ships trying to to change the course you
know you might not might not notice it much in the beginning but every tiny
bit that you pull on the wheel is going to going to have an effect in the long
run so intention we can use intention and then the second way we can develop
kindness is through using what is called metta meditation and then metta is one
of the Brahma viharas the heavenly abodes that's translated as loving
kindness meditation and I think most of you are probably familiar with metta
meditation but just to sum it up it's it's a Buddhist meditation form that
uses phrases to generate this hard quality of loving kindness so we would
express phrases not out loud but just in the mind like a wish for ourselves for
example may I be happy or may I live with ease maybe healthy and what I said
about relaxation we can start with relaxation if we do our meditation we
could also start with kindness that is a choice I mean you don't have to know
everything but sometimes you can maybe start with relaxation sometimes you
can start with some metta practice with some wishes for yourself and you can
even try this in your daily life like also whenever you think about it use a
phrase may I be happy may I live with ease I use it a lot during my daily
life just when I feel a little bit down or something I just realized oh I can do
a little bit of metta for myself just a few phrases and it sometimes just
lightens the heart out right away it's not like an instant an instant cure for
everything but it can sometimes just give us a little bit more light in the
heart whenever we need it
and then the third way to cultivate kindness would be to pay attention to
when we are kind to ourselves and when we are not kind to ourselves so it's
also would require some mindfulness so being mindful of body and mind state of
mind and also this is a learning process we can learn and grow from those
moments that we are not kind to ourselves and we can see those moments over
and over and over again and we start to recognize the patterns that it that it
comes from and the mind might start to realize at some point that it's not that
great to experience unkindness towards ourselves the mind start to realize that
it's painful and unpleasant and that's what I said about gaining wisdom this the
mind recognizing that it's painful is wisdom at work and if wisdom if wisdom
starts to grow then it might at some point steadily slowly let go of these
patterns or just a little bit here and there so wisdom can really work in the
background it's not something that we would easily see for like it's like with
that big big tanker ship like only when we are way down down the road down the
road not really a road but are we way down our path we see at some point oh we've
actually steered so much in the in the wholesome direction now I start to see
that my part actually changed compared to where I came from it is something that
that can be a very slow process but at some point we might see some effects
can be weeks can be months can be years so an example that Sharon Salzburg gives
she's a meta meta meta teacher a personal teacher as well but she does a lot
with meta and she describes in her book on loving kindness that she once was on
a retreat so long retreats and she was doing only meta only meta for herself
and during that retreat after some weeks or a month or so I don't remember she
she got a message that something was wrong at home so she needed to leave
the retreat early and she didn't feel any meta that she had like set all these
weeks for for nothing she taught because she didn't feel anything and just as
meta practice was just not working for her she was thinking so she was packing
her stuff and she dropped a bottle and it just shattered all over the floor and
her thought was something like it's okay dear and she realized wow meta meta just
came up for myself and she just like before her retreat she would never have
taught anything like that but now the meta even if she didn't notice anything
during the practice it had worked somehow so we never know what happens in the
background when we practice is kindness for ourselves maybe at some point we
have a kind thought too and of course we can be aware of those moments that were
unkind or towards ourselves but it's also very important to see those moments
that we are kind towards ourselves and really take those moments in really
savor the moments because if we savor it but any wholesome states also with
kindness we really reinforce that state of mind when we really really enjoy it
and feel it then it can can grow more and that's not an ego trip at all it's
actually the building of a healthy self and we kind of need a healthy sense of
self before we can let go of ourselves I can Buddhism we talk about all the not
self aspect of life but yes we need a healthy sense of self before we kind of
can let go of ourselves so this kindness towards ourselves is actually
contributing to to this aspect as well of not self it's very both beneficial for
wholesome and free life
so that was what I wanted to say about the kindness and then we get to the
last support for our practice for today which is to return to the present
moment or go to Buddha again don't chase the past or long for the future the
past is left behind the future is not yet reached right where it is have insight
into whatever experience appears and quote
like how much of our lives do we spend not in the present moment how much of our
lives are we off into daydreaming about the future or worrying about the future
planning or we're ruminating about the past thinking about this fun vacation
that we had some years ago or this difficult conversation we had yesterday
or whatever it is and of course we do need to think about the future we do
need to make plans like else we wouldn't all be here we wouldn't have turned the
computer on to look at the Dharma talk and so there is some use in you know
thinking about the future or the past but often like a big chunk of the time
that we are lost in future or past it's just this habit pattern of thinking
thinking thinking but it doesn't really contribute much to our lives so being in
the present moment and really experiencing this moment like what's
happening right now in the body what's happening right now in the mind can be
very skillful and can be very grounding and stabilizing and if you think about
it like is there anything do you ever get anything else than this present
moment not really right we always get only this moment and this one and this
one our lives is just this flow of present moments everlasting present
moments even if we plan for the future or if we think about the past or worry
or want something or have a version towards something in the past or in the
future and the only thing we have is is those worries or wants or feelings or
thoughts in the present moment and it's even if you think like oh I want like
let's say I want a pizza right now like you never gonna get that pizza in this
present moment it's always a wanting to get something in the future once you
get it it's not this wanting anymore of this moment that makes sense so it's
important to recognize that we can't really escape this present moment even
though we're off in thoughts and about future of past and this returning to the
present moment is also a simple recognition like oh I was gone I was
lost in the thoughts about the future of the past so it's also involves
mindfulness again and often when we recognize that we are already back in
the present moment and next to that we just see oh I was gone and now I'm back
we can also more actively tune back into this present moment like we can check
into what the body is right now like oh it's like this right now there's maybe
some tension here or there's some softness there or some bar and or
whatever it is and we can tune actively into what's happening in the mind and it
doesn't have to be like this big elaborate investigation it can just be a
tiny moment in our daily lives or if we're meditating then we might do it a
little bit more elaborately tune back in the present moment and try to stay
there but in our daily lives it might be just a moment like oh yeah the body is
like this right now or the mind is like this you could try it even right now
when I'm talking to tune into the body tune into the mind present moment
sensations recognizing it's like this right now
so that's what I wanted to say about the returning to the present moment and
like what you can see throughout all these supports is that mindfulness is
actually the basis for the other three supports so we need mindfulness to
recognize is there any stress present is there an unwholesome mind state present
or do I need to relax a little bit more the first the first support to relax or
mindfulness can recognize are we kind towards ourselves or is there some
harsh harshness or judgements in our minds and mindfulness can help us to
learn from these patterns and tendencies of harshness or judgment and maybe
eventually let go and and cultivate some kindness and mindfulness can
recognize if we're off into future or past we can help us remember to return
to this present moment
so if you have bandwidth for only one of those four supports then you can pick
mindfulness because then you cover all of them basically and mindfulness is
always useful as the Buddha says so but you can also pick and choose or see
which one resonates most with you right now which one you feel like would be
beneficial right now or what I do is I've written them down I use a digital
notebook and they're there when every time I open that notebook they're there
clearly there and I see them like struggle times a day and then I remind
then it reminds me like oh yeah right I was supposed to be mindful or I take
this conscious moment to relax the body and if it lacks the mind I invite the
body and the mind to relax or check in is there any aversion or the tension
present or then I see the kindness reminder and like oh yeah I supposed to
be kind toward myself let's cultivate a little bit of kindness and sometimes I'm
really stressed out and you know my to-do list is right there and I'm like oh
I have need to all these things and like oh yeah kindness oh yeah I can be kind
towards myself or I consciously return to the present moment seeing that
reminder like oh yeah I only have to take care of this moment and then this
moment I don't have to think about like four weeks from now just this moment
and of course there are many other supports that we can use for our lives
and our meditation practice these are just four that I came up with that were
very helpful and useful for me and some other support that you can think of
might be like the other Brahmavihara's compassion joy equanimity maybe support
like acceptance or patience or impermanence might be useful and so we
all have different conditionings different habits patterns and tendencies
and we all need different types of supports in different times so we don't
have to be attached to the four that I talked about today yeah I just wanted to
share that they've been helpful for me and how they can be helpful for you
maybe as well so the invitation is to discover for yourself what is supported
for you in your practice in your life and that might change over time as well I'd
like to end with a poem by the poet and teacher Kaveri Patel and the poem is
called dare you dare you you always have so many things to do so many places to
be your mind spinning like fan blades at high speed each moment always a blur
because you're never still I know you're tired I also know it's not your
fault a constant brain bus is like a swarm of bees threatening to sting if
you close your eyes you've forgotten something again you need to prepare for
that or else you should have done that differently what if you closed your eyes
would the world fall apart without you or would your mind become the open sky
flock of dots flying across the sunrise as you just watched and smiled thank you
for your kind attention thank you and yeah it's about time so I'll stay here in
case there's any questions but otherwise there's you're free to go
