 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. What I was thinking about meditating with just now and also before this set is something about the way that Sayadaw Utejaniya teaches, that's the primary teacher of Andrey Efela, and how he teaches this perspective on insight meditation that is really informed by the third and fourth foundations of mindfulness by attending to mind and attending to what's called mind objects, which is anything that happens in the heart and mind, an emotion, a thought, a perception, a belief, all that stuff. But there's also the way he teaches, and that is something that's a little bit harder to transmit. If you listen to his talks on Dharma seed or have ever had the fortune of going to visit him at a retreat center or at his monastery, there's this lightness about him. He really holds things lightly, and there'll be these big group practice discussions, right? And people will be talking about seeing the things that one typically sees in the third foundation in the mind, greed, hatred, delusion. And by the end of the practice discussion, everybody will be laughing about having seen these things because it's good news, right? It's good news to see them because if we see them, they don't have us hooked by the nose and they're not dragging us around. We see them. We're a little bit free. The seeing free is just a touch. The awareness itself isn't tangled up in greed if I notice the greed in the same way it is if I don't. So I wanted to talk about these kinds of flavors of a wise attitude that are really supportive in being able to see the parts of our hearts and minds we might not like as much or from a Buddhist perspective are not wholesome, they're not helpful. So that lightness, that sense of humor is a huge asset to cultivate. One way that's been helpful for me in cultivating it is something, I believe Andrea came up with this on a retreat. I haven't heard her talk about it in years, but maybe I invented it. It's a believability index. So this is a one to 10 chart or a zero to 100 chart depending on how numbers oriented you are for how believable any given thought is when it pops into the mind. And it's just so helpful sometimes. It's like that thought can have so much authority when I actually subject it to how accurate is that likely and it gets a four out of 10 or a two. It's a way of catching the imagination in action, right? And it's okay to be a little playful with it. I heard Joseph Goldstein talk about this on a long IMS retreat once and he'd actually invented this little cartoon character in his mind. Was Ben Willoughby or something like that? And it was just a reminder to him, right? When things got really bad, almost always the thoughts are something that used to happen or that we've imagined might happen or that we imagine will happen. And so just the playfulness. That doesn't exactly fit into receptive interest as a practice, but this is a skillful means that can be used when the mind gets a little unruly. I'm sure your mind never gets unruly, but mind does sometimes. So other flavors of the wise attitude that are helpful for this noticing of greed, hatred, and delusion are really their opposites. So when you think about greed, what might you think the opposite would be? From my perspective, there could be a number of answers to that, but generosity is one. Contentment is another one. When I think about hatred or aversion, let's do the whole range, right? Well, metta, loving kindness, compassion, even indifference are all quite far away from hatred, right? And then delusion, mindfulness, wisdom, discernment. So all of these are really helpful qualities to cultivate in order to be able to see generously, kindly, clearly, clarity, discernment, wisdom, the greed, hatred, and delusion operating even at the very subtlest levels of our minds. And then they're not a problem because what we see we can free, but especially if it's seen without an attitude of needing something to happen. Hating my hatred is going to make more hatred in the mind, right? It doesn't help so much. What else to say about this? Yeah, here's something. All of the flavors of wise attitude that I've found that are consistently wise attitude have something in common besides the wise part, and that is that there's some kind of equanimity involved. So even if it's joy, there's some kind of equanimity. It's like appreciative joy that doesn't need to hang on to that thing and keep it. It's the kind of joy that has an open palm. Mindfulness that is open to what arises and what passes away, as opposed to the kind of mindfulness, and I think we've probably all done it, being very mindful of that thing so it will go away. Right? Doesn't work so well, generally. I don't think I've found it ever worked for me. So it's the attitude that comes along with some of these that we're really looking for. So there's a flavor of equanimity. I'm not talking about necessarily the most high exalted equanimity you can get. That's beautiful. It's the crown jewel of Buddhist mind states. I'm just talking about your garden variety, daily life. I'm okay with it. Equanimity, you know, it's all right. That level is enough. You don't need to aspire to the highest heights necessarily. So all of these are not things to do in the meditation. They're things to notice and to appreciate in that open-handed way when they do arise, because they will allow for the clear seeing of the other factors of mind, other qualities of mind, as the mind tends or relaxed. Is it spacious or contracted? Is it feeling free or is it feeling caught? Is it wound up in something or is it calm and peaceful? It's not like these less pleasant states are wrong, but again, it's noticing them. It's okay being with, allowing, and stepping back. It's in the stepping back. It's in the seeing the attitude of how we see these things. That's one place where freedom can lie, just a little bit of freedom, a little touch. So I hope that made sense. Be interested in any questions you have about it or any questions you have about practice in general. That's what I've got to start us off with tonight. I'm going into Q&A mode now. Yes, Anthony and then Fred, I'm just going in the order I saw you. Anthony, I think you're still muted. I'm here now. I let you unmute. Sorry. There you go. Sorry to silence you. Thank you. Yeah, Mike. I just wanted some your insight on the. So, out of meditation, I got a fairly good pattern down of like, connecting with the breath as the anchor and calming that, you know, in that, I calm my. I get a sense of calm. And then, of course, when I when I, my mind starts to wander, I catch it and I bring it back to the anchor. But my question to you is, I have a hard time like, knowing like, so when I catch my mind wandering, I tend to see, try to stay in that. I'm having a hard time staying in that whatever it was wandering on and dropping that question in of what's going on here, you know, or what is, you know, so my question to you is, how do you is that is that okay like to so pretty much I'm catching myself. Once I, I noticed that I'm caught in thought, you know that I'm often thought or whatnot. It sort of dissipates. It dissipates, and then I connect back to the breath. But as far as like inquiring about what I was thinking about, I'm having a hard time. Okay, that makes total sense. Thoughts are very subtle creatures, right, often, and they're shy, like you aim too much attention at them and they, it's very common for them to sort of go. So, you don't need to make a project out of it. That's the first thing I'll say like what you're describing with your directed attention practice with your breath and then bringing your attention back to the breath. That is a totally valid form of practice, and there's nothing wrong with continuing to do that if that that is what works for you. The invitation in this more open awareness style is at the moment you're noticed that you're lost. Maybe the, the mind has such training with going back to the breath that that's what happens and that's fine. But just notice that there might be any lingering sense of maybe the mood of what was there or maybe there's an image left over or something like that you don't have to go hunt for it, but just allow, sometimes there's like a little lingering that happens, that can just be sort of noticed receptively without having to try to be like, Oh, what was that thought train there like you don't need to get into that stuff. Does that make sense. So, it's, it's a skill like anything else to learn to allow the awareness to percolate through some of these other places. And the most natural way I found for it was when the mind sort of if it snaps back to the breath for example if it's like really accustomed to being on the breath to just sort of be interested, not even to try but just be interested like, Oh, what was that. That's it. Nothing more. And if, if gradually you might end up seeing more. That's great. Thank you. You're welcome. Let me know if that didn't answer it. We can, we can try again. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Fred Brandaman. Thank you, Don. Yeah, I really like that believability scale, you know, I often will drop in this like, is it true, when there's this some thought, especially if it's a ruminating sort of thing. But I can always kind of debate whether it's true or not I can always kind of convince myself maybe does but I like the believability, believability scale because, because most of them are not believable, and, and, and that's, that's kind of a playful way to look at it I really like I really appreciate that so thanks and the way you put the everyday equanimity as like, I don't know I'm just having some awareness that it's there, it's present that maybe it's something like contentment, maybe that there's just like nothing more needed, but that's such a, and against the stream kind of kind of attitude to just like be okay with the moment as it is and not constantly needing to tweak it or adjust it or I feel like that's mostly my mental activity is trying to make the moment better or less worse. So anyway, thank you. I can't remember who said this but some famous teacher said basically most of mindfulness meditation, most of spiritual practice is learning how not to make things worse. Like, that simple, right, can we just get there, can we get that far. And something about the believability scale. Oh yeah, this is from Pima Schodron wrote this and in the earliest years of my practice I had it taped to my bathroom mirror. And it was three words. Are you sure. That was it. And it was a really helpful practice just. Any other thoughts. Yes, Ali. I'm wondering if there. I'm wondering if there is any value in wandering might not bringing it back and just letting it go. So, define what you mean value in your meditation value and yeah because eventually it'll come back. Eventually it'll settle down maybe you know it needs to take a break. I don't know what the hell it does. But. So, so, it's a wonderful question. So from the standpoint of the receptive awareness practice. If you can allow the mindfulness to go with the mind wandering. And I don't mean you have to necessarily keep track of every single thing it's thinking but even just being aware of mind is wandering mind is kind of drifty. To start expanding the scope of what your mindfulness. Sati what it is aware of. And that can go very very far it is possible to stay mindfulness through the process of falling asleep and into dreaming for example. That can even happen. So, it's a lovely practice, if you, if you can do it the. It takes, and I say do, it's almost more allowing it to happen, it takes practice in this form to cultivate that. The other value I've noticed is And this is maybe the mindfulness isn't as sharp, but there's just enough to notice, oh wandering mind, and like, especially that like 50 daydreamy mind where thoughts are a little weird and maybe like, don't totally make sense. The quieter ends of the spectrum they call the hypnagogic state it's sort of like this in between waking and sleeping state. I've heard some teachers kind of dismiss that I don't dismiss that state like that entire process to me is a beautiful marker of the mind and heart starting to relax and it's actually part of the settling process for a lot of us. So to just notice it and appreciate it and like not try to fight against it is, there's a lot of value in that, like, oh, drifty mind. Very drifty mind, relaxing mind, and then Andrea talks about sometimes she'll notice her mind will just go off and it just clearly needs a break. Like, okay, mind taking a break. That's fine. So, there's definitely value in it. And I don't want to set the expectation up that it's always possible to do like, you know, I've been practicing for well over 15 years and there are times where I'm still like, just woke up in the middle of full fledged daydream. Okay, here we are. So, you know, our minds come installed with that stuff. Right. Thank you. You're welcome. Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah, there are questions or comments. Anthony, please. Yeah, just a quick thought that came to mind with your, when you brought up about equanimity. And I was thinking of emptiness and what just came to my mind is that, you know, with, you know, being an everyday life, work and you know whatnot, that there is a balance there between, you know, the emptiness and then the ego, so to speak. Not the ego, but the, for the self, I guess, you know, there's kind of a balance there. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a really important thing to, to note. Definitely. Can you say a little bit more about the balance, what it means for you. So I think that, you know, to be in complete state of emptiness would kind of be kind of, it could be kind of out there, so to speak, in everyday life. So, you know, we do got to, you know, connect with our characteristics, so to speak, in our work, in the workplace with your, in your whatever setting it is. And so there is, I just thought of that word equanimity and it came to mind with the balance, you know. Beautiful. I appreciate what you're saying about balance and I actually forgot to mention this as one of the flavors of why his attitude is simply balanced mind. It can feel very normal, very mundane, very, very normal. What you're saying about the balance between emptiness and like, I would say a healthy ego structure, right? That's also really important. If, if not that you need to do it to practice, but if you were to read the ancient discourses, it's very clear that the Buddha had a healthy ego structure. He had not just dissolved into nothingness. He wandered around and taught for decades and ran a monastic order and got into debates and advised rulers and, you know, all these things, right? Fully awakened, the ego structure still was there. It was just the absence of greed, hatred and delusion. That's what he was empty of, right? He wasn't empty of being a human. And the point you're making is super valuable, right? We need our, we need our full capacities in our lives, right? Our capacity to connect with each other, our capacity to connect with ourselves, to be savvy, to show up. So, yeah, balance. Thank you. You're welcome. Any other questions, comments, ideas, this conversation is sparking. So I'm just going to riff on balance for a few minutes. Anthony brought into the room. So, in the ancient suttas, mindfulness is almost like the fulcrum. If you think about a child's teeter-totter, mindfulness is the supporting piece in the middle, right? It is the balancing factor. So there can be energy and investigation on one end that really sort of build up the energy and there can be calm and samadhi on the other end. And those, we're kind of always trying to bring those into balance and meditation. But you never have to worry about having too much mindfulness. Mindfulness itself, that balances out everything else. And I just use a simple example of five factors of mind, but this can go into seven factors of mind or all of the factors of mind. It's like the mindfulness itself helps us integrate. And then there's another quality. Mindfulness is satti, sampajanya, which is often translated as clear comprehension. But I like another translation even better, which is mindfulness of context or awareness of context. So how are we applying this practice in this situation? How is it appropriate? I was in Burma, one of the two times I was in Burma, I was learning something called the Mahasi-style practice. And one of the signature things about that practice is you're learning to notice minutia of experience. So they ask you to move very, very slowly. And you can always tell when a yogi had been at the meditation center a little too long because they would be moving very, very slowly, even if there was a car coming down the meditation drive way, meditation center drive way, right? Like the mindfulness of context wasn't always there. It was too much about the minutia of the details. So that's another form of balance is what am I applying my mindfulness to? This can be contextual like that, or it can be ethical. A classic example is in wrong mindfulness. That's the kind of mindfulness a thief might have in stealing through a house, getting ready to rob people. The thief is very aware of where they're placing their feet and how much noise they're making and where they are and where the other people in the house are. The intention is a little off, right? Rose, wise mindfulness is in the purpose of building the wholesome. The purpose of building benefit to yourself, benefit to other people. So, balancing. Even the lightness, right? Yes. I guess that's why they say at the end of the retreats, longer retreats just to be mindful when driving home because you're going really slow and then Ram Das was saying that he's going like 45 miles an hour, 60 mile an hour. Almost got a ticket of just going too slow. This was you or someone else? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Ram Das was explaining that. Oh, Ram Das was explaining that. He was just going and then he had a big conversation with the, oh, sorry, big conversation with the guy, the police officer. Anyway, yeah, maybe that's what, but then I don't know if you have a minute for a couple of minutes. Should I ask you another question, Dawn? Yeah, I'll try to make a quick answer. Sure. To what extent are you, do you think, you know, I mean, when we're in the conversation, I mean, we see someone or in our heads, the emotion arises first and every other thought that comes in is just the following of that emotion that's been set in the early childhood. And the thoughts, you know, form from there, including many giants. So I mean, I know it's like a big topic, but it's a big topic, but I'll actually flag it for either next week or for Andrea. That'd be great. Yeah. Thank you. You're saying in conversation or when relating to other people, to what extent are the thoughts and judgments arising sort of based on imprints of emotion and beliefs that are already there versus. So the one thing I will say about it is it's a two way street, right? Our emotions definitely generate thoughts and then the thoughts turn around and they will generate still more emotions. This is probably not news to you, but to be mindful of how that process works, right? And in conversation, it's a different level of awareness. I find it really helpful to be grounded in the body and just notice when my emotions start to get activated. I can remember still to this day having a really intense conversation with my little sister after I got serious about meditation. And it was such a aha moment because I could feel all the emotions coursing through, but I didn't have to speak from them. I was like, Oh, yeah. So thank you for the question. It's a big one. You could do. Thank you. We could do a series on that easily. So we have managed to make it through a full hour, folks. I just want to take a moment to dedicate the benefits of this practice. So trusting that the goodness that we've cultivated here together will ripple through each of our lives and outwards rippling through the lives that we touch and the lives that they touch. May all beings be safe, happy and peaceful. May all beings be free of suffering. Thank you so much for your kind attention, each of you.
