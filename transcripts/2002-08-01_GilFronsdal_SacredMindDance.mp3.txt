 What's been on my mind this week, today especially, is how to see the sacred in the mundane, or how to appreciate the mundane as an important area of spirituality or practice or place to wake up, place to see what's ultimate, what you feel is ultimate, the ultimate perspective of your life. And when I started sitting doing meditation practice in earnest in my early 20s, within a few months or maybe six months or so of doing the regular practice, I became very aware that the boundary that I made between my meditation, my mind and meditation, my mind outside of meditation was an arbitrary line. It was the same mind and that the level of mindfulness, of acceptance, of non-conflict, non-clinging, non-aversion that was happening in the meditation was a possibility for me to have in my daily life as well. And it became very important for me then to learn how to extend the mind of meditation, the mind of non-clinging, the mind of certain kind of acceptance into all my activities, into my work, my student and my studies, my relationship with my friends, my work around the house, cooking and cleaning and all the various things that I did. And in fact for me, a very big part of, even to this day, of my Buddhist practice is trying to better and better integrate the experience of meditation or the mind of meditation, the mind that I touch in meditation into my daily life so that there isn't a divide. So the freedom of meditation, the ease, the calm, the peace, the love, the compassion that can arise there can arise just as well in daily life. And some people even have the opinion that unless it's applied in daily life, it has no meaning, unless you can find a way to. Otherwise it's just a matter of using meditation as an escape or as a vacation or as a way of having being stress-free or stress reduction. And you're missing the opportunity to find the sacred in every activity. There's a beautiful story that I read many years ago. I thought it was beautiful. I think it comes from the Christian tradition and it's story of an angel, messenger from God, that comes down to earth and first goes to a king who appears in the story maybe to be somewhat full of himself, kind of pompous. And the angel says to the king, oh, the almighty God has deigned to show herself himself to you in whatever way you'd like to see God. How would you like to see God manifested? And so the king says, well, I'm a king, I'm an important person. So let God show herself himself in all the majesty of the almighty. And so God does that and produces apparently a tremendous thunderbolt that zaps the throne and pulverizes the king. So then the angel goes to a peasant, to a farmer and asks her, you know, saying the same thing, God has decided to manifest herself to you in whatever way you'd like to see. How would you like God to appear for you? And the peasant farmer says, oh, I'm just a humble person and what I like is if God can show herself and the faces of my neighbors and my family and in the tools that I use in my trade and the water I drink and the food I eat. And so God did. And that farmer lived happily ever after. So rather than focusing on the majesty and the power of what's possible in spiritual life, to focus on seeing, you know, a certain way of seeing the things we touch with our hands every day, the way of, you know, things we contact with our eyes, the things we engage in, the activities that are so mundane, so easy to do. And I know it's very easy when we do the same activity over and over again every day to think that this doesn't, you know, to forget about the activity itself and to be caught up in our thoughts and our concerns and our agendas. And to miss the opportunity that something as simple as driving to work might offer you or cooking or cleaning or whatever it might be that's ordinary, regular, everyday activity. The kind of the inspiration for thinking about this today was the reminder or the thought that one of the most mundane things that we do, regular things, we ordinary things that we do every day is walking. We walk. Most of us walk and, you know, quite a bit. And walking is so mundane, so simple, so ordinary that I couldn't possibly get away with giving a Dharma talk on walking because you'd all think that this was too, you know, too simplistic, too mundane, too ordinary. I mean, that's not what, you know, spiritual life is. You know, I don't want to learn about how to walk. I learned how to walk when I was two years old and he's going to tell me about walking. I feel that I learned to walk. I didn't really learn how to walk until I was 28 years old. Isn't that something? And I was at Tassahara, which is then monastery in the Big Sur mountains. And in the context of practicing there and trying to bring this mind of meditation into all activities of my life, I discovered, to my surprise, there were times when I could walk on the roads of Tassahara back and forth and every step felt like a step of love. I was stepping into or it was expression of love or stepping into love or it was just love was being expressed with every step. That's pretty special. Just in the ordinariness of just taking a step. Can something as ordinary as a step be the fulfillment of some great spiritual reality or possibility or state experience? I think it's very nice that if you look back at the history of Buddhism, all the way back to the Buddha, most Buddhists, most Buddhist monks and nuns, spent a lot of time walking. The Buddha spent a lot of time walking. He didn't ride on the horses or carriages. He didn't have cars or anything. He just walked and he walked a lot. He went traveling all over northern India. He spent a lot of time walking. And I suspect that a lot of the power of his concentrated mind, of his still mind, of his awakened mind was supported by the power of walking. Walking mindfully, walking with attention, taking each step completely for itself. And in doing that day after day, John Travis, who's a Vipassana teacher and friend of mine, tells a story of when he was kind of, he doesn't use this word exactly, but kind of a crazed out hippie in the Ashbury, taking drugs. He used to live in a garbage dumpster near the Golden Gate Park. He claims that was his address, that the postman would bring mail there. That seemed a little far fetched to me. But anyway, he was kind of way out there. And he somehow ended up going to Nepal and meeting a famous Tibetan teacher there and hung out with his teacher for a while in Kathmandu. And then at some point, the teacher and a little entourage of people took a helicopter, or airplane, I think, airplane, into some other place in Nepal where they had some little monastery. And there wasn't enough space in the plane for John. And so John was going to go and walk there. And he had a sherpa who went with him to carry some of his gear. And it was a long walk, many days, I don't know, weeks or something, you know, over the Himalayas and into this place. And he was given instruction at the beginning of the walk by his teacher saying, keep your mind and your feet. So he did that. And, you know, when you're climbing the mountains in the Himalayas, you know, walking, you really feel your weight, you feel the contact with the ground. He was told to do that. And he says that after a while he was crying because it really helped him to get into his body and be in his body with his background and his drug use and all that. He'd been quite disassociated from his body and living kind of in fantasy life. And that simple act of walking, connecting him to something concrete, to the ground, to the earth, to himself, to the moment, just in walking. There's another Vipassana teacher by the name of Kamala Masters who had gone, I think, on one Vipassana retreat, one retreat, or somehow had been connected to Dharma practice, to meditation practice. And it really sparked her. She really woke up and some, you know, enthusiasm and feeling this is important, this is a place for me, this is for me to do. But she had four children and she was a single mom. And so she was able to go, I think, on a short retreat at some point with an Indian Vipassana teacher named Munindra. And at the end of the retreat she said, well, you know, I'd like to continue, you know, how can I do this? And he said, she'd go on retreat, go on a long retreat. And she said, I can't do that. And he said, well, then you have to practice at home. And she said, I can't do that either. I have four kids, I have to work and, you know, I've got to, you know, it's just too much. And he said, oh, yeah, you can do it. And so she invited him home to her house to live there for a while. And he went with her around and watched her as she did things, washing her dishes and walking around. And he started to kind of, okay, this is how you wash dishes mindfully. And he kind of, you know, it was like a coach, kind of, you know, this is how you do it. And then there was, she had a hallway in the, her house between, like, all of the rooms. And he designated that hallway as her temple or as her meditation hall or walking hall. And every time she stepped into that hallway, that was a place where she was supposed to practice mindfulness, mindfulness of walking, mindfulness while walking. And then she got into the different rooms where she had to be in laundry and kids and whatever you do. But that hall was supposed to be a place where she kind of just, everything else you can let go of and just do the steps that she did, the steps that she walked through that hall. And so she engaged for years in bringing mindfulness, practicing, just washing dishes, being there for just the dishes, just being there completely for the dishes, being, you know, you know, it isn't so much that the dishes are important, but it's the full presence and connection with those activity you're doing. When she walked into the hallway, just being there in the hallway with the steps, learning with the art, the tremendously important skill of learning how to let things go and not have things linger and hold on, you know, hold on to things and preoccupations and concerns, but learning that skill, it's a difficult skill to learn, to learn how to let go of things even temporarily. And it turns out she had a very deep practice through that activity, very, very deep. The other Vipassana teachers were in awe at how deep she went, how mature she became in her spiritual life without being able to go on retreats, which is the usual mode for a lot of, you know, traditional Vipassana practice. And then eventually when her kids basically grew up many years later, she was able to go on retreat and now she's a teacher on her own. She's one of the great teachers in America. Wonderful woman. And so the Buddha walked, so the Buddha walked all over India and, you know, he walked a lot more than normally any of us walk because that was his mode of transportation. But, you know, he walked, he had to walk maybe into town to go for his alms around to get his food. He didn't just drive down to the grocery store, you know, and jump in his car and get the groceries as quickly as he can and rush home so he could give a Dharma talk or, you know, or whatever he had to do. You know, if you have to walk for an hour into town to get your food, you don't tend to kind of do it harried. I mean, you have to, you kind of get into the rhythm of it. You walk. That's what it takes. You walk and you walk and you walk. I mean, he probably didn't live in a culture that was as time centered as we are in our culture where everybody's, you know, scheduled. But he, you know, he walked and he's walking, that walking at ease, that walking peacefully with each step, that walking as if you don't have to get, as if you're not trying to get anywhere. Of course, he was trying to get something into town, but you, all of you have probably maybe gone for a hike someplace, a hike in the park or hike on the hiking, and getting to the destination was not the point of the hike. The point of the hike was to hike. And many of you, I suspect, have the experience where doing the activity is not the point so much. The point is to get it over with as quickly as you can so you can get onto what's more important. Is that something common? There's more important things than life to do than going shopping, you know, walking and, you know, brushing your teeth or, I don't know what the mundane things are that we tend to overlook and not see as very important, not to the point. Let's get onto the more important things. But to, in a sense, to just give in to the mundane activity as if there's nothing else beyond it, the need to do, to settle into, to find our peace, our place of non-conflict. In here, write this. And if we don't start doing it in the mundane, I don't think there's not so much value in a spiritual life. I think in the way you walk, in the way you talk, in the way you clean, in the way you shop, in the way you drive, in the way you lay yourself down to sleep, the way you shower. And to do it, you know, not as a person, some people might hear this, some of you might hear this and say, oh, this sounds like a burden. And some people feel oppressed by the idea that all my waking hours, I'm supposed to kind of, my mundane activities, I'm supposed to bring this kind of presence and mindfulness. I practice meditation and it's so hard to do it there. And I do it and it's helpful in whatever it's, you know, but now I'm asked to have the same challenge in my daily life too. In a sense, yes. But in a sense, it's also the art of learning how to do that in a way that's enjoyable, in a way that's not stressful, doesn't add a burden to your life. Because a path of mindfulness, a practice of mindfulness generally is supposed to bring a sense of lightness, ease into our life. So if you're, if you are rushing, take something as simple as walking and you're rushing to get somewhere and your mind is kind of ahead of yourself. There's stress that builds up in your body in that rushing and that pushing forward in the mind that's preoccupied with something else. And that stress has a toll on our life. It's possible to walk in such a way that no stress accumulates from the activity. And what it takes is being present for that activity as if it has no purpose beyond itself. As if we're not trying to get it over as quickly as possible. So if you drive to work and you park your car and you walk from your parking lot spot to your office or your store or wherever your work might be, can that be your meditation hall? Can that be your temple, that walk? How is it that you walk from your car to your place of work? Do you have, you know, is it something that you don't pay any attention to because that's, you know, that's like the crack in the day that doesn't count. That's between things. It's between the important things, between driving the car and listening to the radio, which is important. And you know, you have to turn it off unless you bring a walkman with you. And then you have to walk to your office and that's, you know, in the time you get your office, that's important or your store or wherever you work. But the walking, that's a crack that doesn't count. Or can you see that not as a crack, but see it as the doorway into, in that moment, finding something very special about how to be alive, how to be here and present. Every moment is an opportunity to find the kind of, I can say many different, I can use many different words because each of you will have your own word, but something that you can touch through your own meditation practice, some deep sense of satisfaction or rightness or being at home or peace or some experience of non-conflict. Perhaps it's as powerful as significant as what mindfulness is for you is a moment of honesty. It's not a matter of peace. It's not a matter of compassion or love or great spiritual things, but it's a matter of this is a place where you're really honest with what's happening with you. In honesty, it feels realer than anything else. One of my early Zen teachers described how he was first hooked onto Zen. He was introduced to Zazen meditation, Zen meditation, and it was physically very painful for him. He was kind of an athlete and sometimes athletes have really hard time sitting cross legged on the floor because their legs are kind of tight. And he was excruciating pain, but he found that that was the first time in his life that he felt like he was real. You know, it's a sad commentary of how he was the rest of the time, but he was very much in his head, in his fantasies, in his intellect, and very removed from the concrete realness of his life, the physical immediacy of his life. And that was the first time he had an experience of being real. And so even though it was painful, he decided to follow that path. So for some people, what mindfulness does is it brings kind of very sharp honesty about this is what's happening now. If you slow down to walk, just be even to walking, what you might find is that you walk in a hurry to get things over with, to get there because you're anxious or you're afraid or you're ambitious or greedy or whatever. And by walking mindfully, you can start seeing clearly what's going on. And it's phenomenally valuable to do that. There's a beautiful, there's a eccentric teacher who comes to Spirit Rock every year named Ajahn Jumnyan. Any of you seen Ajahn Jumnyan? Ajahn Jumnyan is, you know, he's one of the great masters, meditation masters of Thailand, great man, great realization, great teacher, but eccentric. For a while, he, people in Thailand revere monks a lot, especially highly attained monks, and they often want to give them things. And often they think they, partly they want to give because they feel like they get a lot of merit if they give. And this is a monk who has this kind of vow of simplicity, you know, he doesn't need much. And then give him all this gold, gold Buddhas and gold jewelry and trinkets and, you know, all this stuff. And sometimes abbots will just hoard it in their back room or sometimes they'll just give it away or sometimes they'll sell it and use it to build out their monasteries, all kinds of, you know, the range of things. What he would do was he would wear it. And when he first came to Spirit Rock, you know, he underneath his robe, he looked like he was really fat, really fat, you know, because he had all this gold and jewelry. Imagine what it's like to go, you know, go through security at the airport, the metal detectors, you know, I heard stories about it. The people who shook his head when they saw him, you know, all this, you know, all this gold, you know, stuff. And, and, and so if you gave it something to something to him, he just put it on, added, you know, those heavy stuff is walking around with it. And, and it was something about, you know, that I'm not sure what he was trying to teach people something. What? What was he teaching? That extraneous material things weigh you down. So he won't be walking like a gorilla. He can walk upright because he's so heavy and he won't be able to give talks everywhere because he can walk. So that's pretty, it's interesting to me. Yeah, it's beautiful. So he, so he, you know, he, so I forgot why I was talking about Arjun Jumyun. I went off on a tangent to Arjun Jumyun story. What? Now before that, that was a kind of, that was like a little aside telling me, telling you about that, but that's the way it goes. What? Yeah. Oh yes. Now I remember. Yes. He, he was talking about the nobility of suffering. And usually we think suffering is awful. And when you think it's awful, then it is. And it, you know, you can't argue with that, but the nobility of suffering comes when you see suffering, when you bring a perspective on your suffering that's different than the perspective of self pity or, or what was me or I'm stuck here, or this is terrible or, you know, or anger or, you know, all kinds of attitudes might have ways in which we might see our suffering. He was suggesting, suggesting there's another way of looking at our suffering. And that way you should look at it as part of the path towards liberation. And when you do that, you, you ennoble your suffering. You see the nobility of it, but you have to see it as something that's part of your spiritual practice, that you're going to bring attention to it. You're going to find your, your, how to be not in conflict with it. You're going to study it and see the causes of that suffering, the craving, the clinging, the fear, the hate that might be the cause of it. And then learn to let go of that. And when you can see that the potential, not necessarily you can do it, but see the possibility of that and look at your suffering that way, then there's a very different relationship to it, which in the Buddhist tradition, he would say, he said is ennobling, makes you into a noble person. Yeah. He had the off the shoulder robe look, and it would be really hot or really cold. And he just, it's so like a rock and he would remember to say, Oh, can you open the window? Could you turn up the heat? And he just sits there and and everybody else in the retreat got sick, right? Yes. Actually, I left early because I was so alone by the physical, but he kind of, he, he slept in a, in a bathroom for many years to just to be alone because there's so much demands on his time. So, you know, you think he, you know, he sleeps at least in a purity, but no. So when he was cold, he said, you know, it's actually cold. Well, the body's cold. I know. So he's a quite a character. You should go see him when he comes to town. But the nobility of suffering. So it's, you know, mindfulness helps us, helps us see what's real. So, um, walking, may I encourage all of you to take walking seriously, that how you walk and that when you, you know, those times when you find yourself walking, that you might actually say, think of walking when you walk, that's your temple. That's your retreat. That's your spiritual discipline, spiritual life can be realized, can be practiced, can be unfold in the walking anytime at that time that you're walking. It's available any time, any step you take. And why not? Why are you going to put it off? I don't have time today. You have to walk. Anyway, you might as well use it for two purposes. What do you think of that? So in Buddhism, there's a, there's a very, not only the Buddhist monks nuns from the ancient times do a lot of walking, you know, to get places and whatever, but they also do a lot of walking meditation. And I don't know how many of you are familiar with walking meditation, but it's one of the great spiritual meditation practices of Buddhism. It's not known so well. The books in English usually talk about sitting meditation. In Asia, they actually build walkways and sometimes hallways. They're specifically designated for walking. At Spirit Rock, they have a walking hall that's probably, it's really big. I don't know how big it is, but it's really big, but much, maybe twice the size of this room here. There was builds only function is that people can walk in it. And people walk back, you get about 30, 40 people who can walk back and forth next to each other. And so there's a whole practice of walking meditation. It's usually done by walking a little bit slower than usually would in daily life. And I find it's very nice in daily life to walk a little bit slower than I normally would. And then when I, when I, I'm not doing walking meditation, but you know, formally, but doing kind of walking around town, being mindful, I find it very nice to coordinate my steps with my breathing so that I kind of, maybe for every in-breath, you know, maybe, maybe it's like four steps is, is a cycle of breathing in and out, but somehow keeping a rhythm going between the breath and the steps is very nice. Sometimes I don't pay attention to my breathing while I walk, but just stay and keep my, my attention in my feet or my legs as I walk. And it's as important, as significant to do that, as to center your attention on your breathing when you meditate. There's joy and delight to be found in something as mundane as being present for your feet as your feet touch the ground. Now, isn't that great? Isn't that radical? Is it boring? It's up to you. So what do you think of that? Do you have any questions or comments? Reservations? Anything I said today? Or anything else? I think one of the issues would be when walking, particularly out on the street, keep your mind shut off or at least focused on what you're doing because of so many stimuli coming in. How do you do that? That's one way to practice meditation, is to kind of let everything else fall away or turn away from everything. Just keep your attention on your feet. Another way to do meditation is called choiceless awareness, where you're not trying to keep anything at bay, away from anything, but rather what you do is you try to wake up to the present moment to what's actually happening. So suddenly there's this loud car driving down the road. That becomes your place where you do your mindfulness. So whatever is happening, whatever is predominant, most pronounced in the environment, that's where you center your attention. It's kind of like the analogy I like very much is that if you're sharpening, don't push the analogy, but anyway, if you want to sharpen a knife, it doesn't matter what whetstone you use. Any whetstone will do, you sharpen the knife. If you want to sharpen your attention, your concentration, your mindfulness, any object of awareness can sharpen it. There was a time when I was particularly ill and I was taking a qigong class. And I would notice that as I walked up the street, because I'd become aware of it as sort of a physical bubble rather than a mental awareness, that I was always kind of getting ahead of my bubble of energy. And experiencing it that way for me, for some reason, it was like, oh, oh, I want to stay in it. And this is the pace I need to walk at to stay in it. It was a very visceral form of that, it seems like. Beautiful, yeah. Where is your center of gravity in terms of, not your weight, but the center of gravity of your presence or your energy? And it's all too easy to have our, in some sense, our attention or sense of presence or something projected ahead of ourselves. And I first became aware of this phenomena on retreats, where I'd be sitting very stable and centered in meditation and walking meditation. And then they'd ring the lunch bell. And lunch is like the best entertainment going on a retreat. And so I was really eager to get to lunch. And I noticed that my center of gravity of my presence was no longer in my torso, my body, but was projected a little bit in front of myself. I was in a hurry, I wanted to get that thing. So it was kind of like a little bit ahead. And sometimes the center of gravity can be behind you slightly or the sense of it, as we hold back and hesitate. And to kind of find out where the center of gravity of your presence or your being is, and to find how to center it right here, you know, will help you relax and help you be at peace. I'm just starting to see that, you know, explain exactly that, like you said, suffering, I imagine, and experience, but there really is a, there's a place where it's just the suffering, you don't get into the earthly cause of it, you know, how it happened, the story, or the person, situation, that you really can not always, or not too often, I guess for me, but it's just sort of a neutral kind of experience. It's just the suffering, it's just the pain that's going to be there. The anxiousness, just the experience, and how it happened isn't really important. And I think that's really, that's very intriguing to me, because I think therein lies a healing of some sort. And now I'm grasping, and that would be nice to have an athenor, where you divorce yourself from all the extremely stuff about it. Just be aware of it. That's all, that's really important, like, in the wrong setting. Yeah, I think so. I guess that just comes with meditation. What you're pointing to, one of the things you're pointing to is the possibility of having a simple presence, simple awareness of what's happening, without complicating it with judgments, interpretations, clinging, aversions, holding, all the, we tend to complicate the immediacy, simplicity of our experience with all these attitudes and ideas and relationships that we add on to it. And if you can experience suffering or pain, very simply, without making a deal out of it, it's a lot easier. And one of the ways we make a big deal out of it, it often adds to it, is we, some way or other, we let the pain define who we are. It becomes a source of identity, you know, sometimes negative identity, oh, you know, I'm a failure as a human being because this is happening to me, or I'm embarrassed to let people know that I'm suffering this way, so I'm going to hold it tight and, you know, not let anybody see it, or, you know, maybe if I let everybody see my suffering, people will treat me kindly, you know, or, you know, or I get my, I can get what I want from people if they feel, you know, if I, they feel guilty, if I let them know how so much I'm suffering. We complicate, you know, our relationship to suffering because of things we want. And not to want anything about, just let it be, sometimes can be very, very helpful in healing. And one of the, one of the possibilities in that is sometimes is we can, the suffering will self-heal itself. We can, sometimes we can leave our suffering alone, but be very mindful of it at the same time. We don't want to ignore it. You know, hold it gently, lovingly, it's an awareness that sometimes, without any relationship for or against it, just let it be there as if it's going to be there forever. And sometimes it'll self-heal in that, in that presence. Yeah, that, yes. You know, the conditioning is so strong, and there are reasons for the suffering, and a story, and only, and why didn't, and, you know, all this explanations, justifications, all that, all the garbage, that there's just this, I guess that's what you're saying, that that's what makes, gives you, I mean this, you know, it's just this knot, or this whatever, this thing, that you can loosen up around, and not, with the mind, you know, the mind just does all this conditioned stuff. It's hard, it's hard to tone down. Yeah, the mind has no shame. The mind is, you know, a strip. The, so, yeah, a lot of meditators have found it very helpful, at times, not to be engaged in the story making behind their suffering, because, you know, who did what to who, and when, and, you know, the history of it, and all that, and sometimes that just keeps it all locked into place, and there's a whole very different way of relating to it that can bring healing and peace. But, and it can be very powerful just to hold the experience of suffering in awareness without doing anything more to it. But I want to say, kind of, as a little, kind of, and the central teachings of the Buddha is there's a cause for your suffering. And the cause, and this is one of the most radical teachings of the Buddha, it's very challenging and upsetting for some people to hear this as a teaching. The cause of your suffering is your craving. It's what you do, something you do. So it's not, it doesn't have to do with your history. History is the condition for the arising of the suffering, but it's not the cause. The cause is something you do. So the analogy might be, all kinds of people come together, and through a lot of complicated history, that you are related to that history somehow, a distant past, and someone said, you said something to someone, and they said something to you, and there was a misunderstanding, and then this happened, you know, and finally someone builds a fire, a little fire, a campfire. And so there's all this whole history that caused that campfire to be there, conditions to arise, and somebody built a campfire. And you decide it'd be really great to grasp a hold of that flame, and you go in there and you put your hand in the flame, and you're going to grasp it. Now it's a little bit hard to grasp flame, right? And if you try to hold on to it, what happens? You burn yourself. Who's responsible for you burning yourself? You don't blame the causes and conditions of all the people, you know, all the complicated story of why the fire got there. So you are the one who put the hand in there, and it's really clear that you're the one responsible for that clinging, that grasping. And what you're trying to grasp doesn't really exist either. So it's kind of like that with, so there is, you know, we have to also see where the place of responsibility is for us in the moment, where the grasping is. Well, it's a quiet group here. I was hoping to say something a little bit challenging, so if you're challenged, I was hoping you'd be kind of, you know, aroused to ask questions, but so, yes? You talked about recognizing. Yes. If I didn't know how to walk mindfully, how do you explain that? I was to start, for you, I would start by saying, study how you actually do walk. Isn't that self-centeredness? Well, so that's a loaded question, is that being self-centered is bad and wrong? That's implication, right? So what is it, what is it you understand about self-centeredness? Oh, so you have to find, there's a path to that, and the path to it is to begin by studying how actually your walking is. Get to know your walking, study it, get to know it, and in getting to know it, become familiar with what it's like actually to walk for you, what the experience of walking is like for your legs, your feet, your soles of your feet, and then learn to begin bringing a full attention to that experience, what your experience of walking is. So full, so complete, that you can actually begin letting go of the normal preoccupations, fears, desires, obsessions that the mind has. And as those kinds of obsessions of the mind fall away, and the veils, the cloudiness of thoughts and ideas fall away, and you can just see directly, be really fully present, directly immediately for the fullness of that step. Right there you'll find what's sacred. That sacredness right there. So you asked, you know, how can I learn to walk? You learn to walk first by studying how it is you walk. And then in studying, and once you know how you walk, then learning how to keep your attention in that simplicity of those experiences of walking. Is it self-centered? It's, you're sensing your attention here in this physical body, in this being here, in that sense it's self-centered. Usually self-centered implies self-preoccupation with self-image, self-identity, you know, narcissism, what I want, you know, me at the expense of others and all that. Hopefully this is the opposite of that. This is the healing of that kind of unhealthy self-centeredness. Because as you, they're fully for this step, fully there for washing that dish, fully there for talking with your friend, you learn, what you're doing is learning to let go of the self-centeredness, it actually is a barrier to that fullness of connection. So people who are self-centered, it can't really be fully present for how things are. They're fully, they're present for how things are, but it's often through the filter of what they want out of the thing and how that, how the world out there is going to feed into that self-centeredness. So it's not really there for a thing in and of itself. And as you learn to do it with your feet, you learn to do it with your neighbor who's suffering, you learn to be present fully for your friend, or you know, you'll learn actually to get out of yourself, get out of your own way, so you can actually be of service to others if that's what you want to do.
