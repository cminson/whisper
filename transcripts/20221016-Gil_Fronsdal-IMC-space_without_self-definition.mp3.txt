 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So in the world of, and here in the United States, of spiritual care, the field of spiritual care, pastoral care or chaplaincy care, there was a theologian named Henry Nowan, who was kind of foundational for establishing kind of a general field of, or the ethos, the understanding of spiritual care in hospitals and chaplaincy and things like that. And he had a very, there's a very famous quote, a teaching from him, which I don't remember exactly how it is, but it goes something like this, that to offer spiritual care is to create an empty space in which to welcome the stranger. This works particularly well like in chaplaincy, where you're meeting people you don't know, the chaplain is meeting people they don't know, but to create the empty space in which to welcome the stranger. And so what is this empty space that we create? And I think it's easier to point out what we, the opposite that we create. We fill the space with our opinions, with our assertiveness, where even sometimes there's no space where people have retired too much to take care of them. If we're taking the initiative and working on them. And we fill the space with our judgments. We fill the space with our conceit, like I'm special, I'm going to be the spiritual caregiver, or I'm this and that, or sometimes it's negative definitions of ourselves we have. And so kind of people can feel that we're so, you know, the emotions and the ideas that we're kind of living under that there's no space for the other. And in offering spiritual care, if that's the purpose, it's to kind of clear the air so people can breathe, so people can be themselves, so people can feel like it's okay to be themselves. And they're not being judged or put into a box. And so to recognize that this person's welcomed here as they are, completely as they are, and that's so important for this kind of spiritual care because that's the foundation, that kind of acceptance is the foundation to let someone blossom, let someone find themselves, let someone grow and develop and kind of become even more who they actually are in some way. So we also can do this to ourselves. We can create an empty space in which to welcome ourselves, a kind space in which to welcome ourselves. And what do we do that gets in the way of that? One of the ways is that we define ourselves in a lot of ways. And that way in which we kind of fill the space with definitions of ourselves is one of the things that meditation can help clear out. There are other ways that humans can find ways to clear out the space for themselves, clear out all the definitions that we're operating under. I mean, sometimes here locally someone might go down to the coast and walk along the shore of the sand. It's such a big open expanse sometimes. And that can be a place where so much falls away and is forgotten away from society. And there's a kind of space there, just be and not be defined. Somehow the magnitude, the magnificence of the great Pacific Ocean and the sky and the size of it can just kind of give a very different perspective of who we are. Whereas in an urban environment it's so easy to be defined by our job, our relationships, our traffic patterns, all kinds of things. But sometimes in the night sky and looking at a clear dark sky where all the stars are shining, a very different kind of feeling for who we are that maybe creates that kind of empty space where we're not defined. And so meditation can be one of those places where, and it's actually an important function or opportunity of meditation, is to discover how to be present, how to breathe, how to be attentive, with a kind of empty space for ourselves without definition. This is represented a little bit, I think, or very powerfully by how the Buddha referred to himself. We call him the Buddha. We keep saying Buddha, Buddha, Buddha. He wasn't called Buddha as often in the ancient his time when he was alive as much as we're calling him that these days. We kind of settled on this as his name, but it's really epitaph. It's not really a given name. It means the awakened one. And there were people who called him that. He seldom called himself that. Many people called him by his given name, Kottama. But how he referred to himself was he used this very enigmatic phrase that was maybe not original to him. It might have been already a title for spiritual teachers in his time. And the word in Pali is tathagata. And tathagata is made up of this word tatha, which is a very simple word that means like this or thus or so. And the gatha part is, lots of people have written about what this word gatha is, but we find that used repeatedly as a suffix that just means something like the one. The thing. So the thing that is the one that is so, the one who is like this. And imagine if someone, you go to someone and you say like, what are you and who are you? And they say, oh, I'm like this. You get what you see kind of. I'm like this. Maybe they don't even say anything to you. They just open their arms and it's like, here I am. They don't define themselves. It could be a little irritating. But there's also something very profound about that where the kind of the way, the self way of seeing and holding oneself is in this empty space where everything's allowed to be there is welcome. But there's an idea, let's not define it in any one particular way. Any one particular way of definition narrows the field. It doesn't allow for the fullness of what a person is. It doesn't allow for the fullness of what a person can grow into in the next minute, in the next moment. And so to not be defined. The Buddha did define himself at times. And he recognized that it's appropriate to define. It's a little bit ringing. Is it ringing a little bit? Maybe it's a little bit too loud. Let's see. Is that the better now? You're always welcome to say something if the sound is not good. So the Buddha did say there's a time and place to define people. And he wanted to define people by what they do. So if you're farming, then you're a farmer, he said. If you're selling goods, you're a merchant. If you're a ruler, if you're ruling people, then you're a ruler. If you're a thief, he says, if you steal, then you're a thief. But very clearly, this is provisional. These are just conventions. These are just ways of referring to people by what they're doing. That just helps us organize our life in an efficient way. Imagine if you go to a hospital, say you have a big illness, maybe big surgeries needed, brain surgery. And you really want to take care of it. But that particular day you go to the hospital, they decided defining everyone in the hospital by what they do, that's an old hat. It limits everyone too much. Today in the hospital, everyone who works there is not going to have any definition. No one's going to be recognized as a surgeon or as a janitor or as an administrative person. We're just there working. And so then, you know, we need someone to come and do surgery. Everyone shows up. The whole hospital thing works so much more efficiently if people kind of are known by their function and what they've been trained to do. But when they leave the hospital and they take off their maybe their uniform and they're like, you know, then they don't have to be defined that way anymore. Some people want to continue to be defined that way outside of their work. They're holding on to it. Their status, their power, their all kinds of things come with certain roles. And so people will hold on. One is that you better define me this way. They tell you who I am outside of the context of what they're doing. And like for me, you know, I spent a lot of time teaching, but there was a time where when I was a beginning teacher, I would go home to my wife and she said to me, Gil, you're using that voice again. So, you know, that's the place I can't be a teacher, right, at home. So there's places where you better drop it, you know, put it aside. And so this ability to be defined while we're doing something and drop it when we're not doing it. The ability to be defined functionally in the right place by what we're doing in certain situations. But also have the ability to create for ourselves an empty space where of course you're allowed to be who you are. But maybe there is no are, maybe there is no thing that you are in terms of fix that a thing. In Buddhism, the idea is that who we are is what we're becoming. It's always dynamic. It's always changing. We're in a constant state of becoming and renewing and developing and growing and transforming and changing. Buddhism has this very dynamic view of what a human being is. And so because of that, the idea of a fixed definition limits the open space in which we can grow into the next moment, the next moment, the next moment. So we come to meditation and part of what's possible in meditation is to let go of all the definitions. Let go of all the judgments. Let go of it all. Sometimes for some people it might be easier to do for the external definitions in meditation, maybe. That the profession we have, for example, or the place we have in a family. It was kind of eye opening for me when I was in my 20s and I was talking to a Zen teacher about my relationship to my father. And the Zen teacher said to me, you know, your father, there was a time when your father was not a father, was just a person. And chances are once you really left home, I had already left home, but I guess I hadn't. He has a life outside of being a father. And I said, really? I was like, oh, I just thought that's who he was. He's the father. And suddenly he became much more multidimensional and I kind of created space for my father to be something beyond just a father. So it might be some meditation is a place where the external definitions, how we are in society, maybe can drop away some, maybe a little bit easier. Sometimes then how we do it for ourselves on the inside, how we internalize these things. And not a few people will define themselves by their shortcomings, will define themselves by their negative judgments. I'm to this, I'm to that. And, you know, for me, when I was young in my twenties, I was the, I kind of, I had a wonderful, amazing capacity to feel guilty. And I was just guilty if I breathed somehow, just like no matter what, I was, you know, before I did something, I was guilty. Before I even knew I was going to do something, I was guilty. Excuse me. And I, and it was only when I started doing my meditation practice, my then practice, I saw how pervasive it was. The first time I saw it was I was walking across the meditation hall floor and I felt guilty in the way I was walking. And I said, what? What's going on here? And so we might think that we're somehow inadequate, we're not worthy. We've sometimes done, I feel that way because we've internalized judgments from society. And we do, our society, societies, do terrible things to each other. Judging each other by their race and their gender and their sexual orientation and their class status and all kinds of things that we do, size and age. And then sometimes people internalize it. And so they go around feeling that somehow, you know, they're not unlimited. They're not filled with huge, unlimited potential to become something in an inner way, but rather they're held limited by these judgments, these ideas, these concepts that we're caught in. And so the amazing thing that's possible in meditation is to not just calm down. Meditation is often associated with becoming calm, but calmness is just the kind of tip of the iceberg of what can happen as the mind gets still there and quieter. And one of the things that can happen is that the activity of the mind to judge, the activity of the mind to define takes a break, takes a vacation. And we come to a time when we feel ourselves, we experience ourselves without any definition. So that like the Buddha, at those moments, if someone said, who are you, what are you? It would be a sincere answer to just go like lift your arms out, you know, wide and spread them wide and just like hear it, you know, just in the gesture imply just this. Or maybe you say, who, you know, someone says, who are you, what are you? I'm this. No definition beyond that. And they have to just kind of somehow deal with that or take that in or, but that seems sincere. Anything else seems like it maybe limits it or narrows it or, and, and, so to come to a place where this sincere answer is this, this is who I am. So sincere places, we've created an empty space in which to welcome ourselves. Empty space to allow whatever we're kind of meant to be or whatever the conditions come together to move through us and wants to grow and develop and express itself, that we, we kind of begin creating space when seeing that and discovering it. One of the advantages of doing this at empty space, this non-definition, is we can see much more clearly when we begin defining ourselves. We can see more clearly when we begin acting and, you know, becoming something. And if in fact what you're becoming is the hateful one, the one who hates the hater, you can see that clearly. And in that clarity where you haven't been judging yourself, you haven't been criticizing yourself for feeling guilty, you continue to not criticize yourself. You continue not feeling guilty, but you recognize, for example, the hate that arises and you recognize this is not good. This is not useful. This limits me. This really limits me. In fact, the Buddha said that very clearly. He said, greed, hate and delusion are limiters. They limit people. They kind of, you know. And so we can feel the cost of having hate in a way that we can't if we're living an active, stressed, racing around life. And we don't even, you know, it just feels like hate can just feel like, just, I don't know, it's an automatic pilot. And people don't realize that they were hating until after they're arrested for road rage. Because they were so beside themselves in what they've caught up in. This ability to come into some modicum of an empty space where we can welcome all of who we are can help us be much more responsible for what we are and what arises within us without judgment, without criticism. And we can learn to recognize when what's coming through us is healthy and not a problem. And when it has motivated by unhealthy things like greed and lust or conceit or hate. This is a hugely powerful insight to have. And to see that and then to work with it and practice with it and maybe return to the empty space. Because the empty space that welcomes a stranger is a kind space. Is a place of kindness, a place that allows for the heart's care to be there. It's a caring place. Remember the Henry now and his quote was a quote for people who are caregivers, spiritual caregivers. That's a space they're creating for their care. So to have that care for ourselves, have this care for others, by having the discovering how to breathe, be alive, be attentive without definition. Maybe in a way that can be a bit like a very, very clean glass. Have you ever gone up to a glass door and tried to walk through it without realizing it was a glass? I've done that. It's just so clean and clear. I don't see it. But you know, the glass is defined like we have here for the birds, the decal on the door. That defines as a door for the birds so they know. But you know, the windows dirty or tinted or whatever. But if it's really clear, then it kind of has no definition. So the mind can become like a clear window or even better, an open window. So to sit, meditate, and to see what our mind is doing without judgment, to see what our mind is doing, dedicated to create an open, welcoming space for all of it, can allow the warm, open space, can allow the tension to unwind, can allow the stress that's behind so much of our everyday behavior to settle in quiet. And the stress behind defining ourselves, the stress behind being caught in self-definitions and self-judgments, has a chance to relax and relax and relax. And so you can follow the path of that relaxation. Follow the path to less and less being defined by anything, until you find that the absence of definition provides a freedom and a capacity to welcome everyone in a friendly space. So those are my thoughts today. So do you have any thoughts? Anybody have any comments or questions? If you could use the mic, Camille's going to give it to you. Hi, thank you. A little bit louder, please. Yeah, thank you. Just what you're talking about is what I'm really working with right now, and I'm really realizing how much I hate. And I think a lot of it comes from, obviously, a projection of self-hatred. But also, just using, like, trusting my own inner guidance as far as where my hate goes. Like, sometimes, I mean, I knew someone who was a Buddhist teacher who hit her dog, things like that. And I had so much hate. I just, anyone who hurts an animal, it just fills me with rage. And so I don't even really know where I'm going with this, but I guess I have a lot of confusion sometimes about, like, what to accept, what to reject, and my own inner guidance, but knowing that I also just don't have it all figured out. So I feel like things are really tight at the same time, but also really spacious. And I don't know, I just, it feels really groundless right now. And it's scary. Yeah, well, I certainly appreciate the clarity in which you can talk about this hate that you have and rage. I mean, that's quite phenomenal to have that kind of clarity and to be able to have the willingness to say it publicly like this. I take this to be really healthy, what you just did. So I think you're on a good path. And the fact that you're kind of feeling groundless at this particular juncture, probably there's no way around that. I think it is a groundless time to kind of come to terms with it, to deal with it, to see it so clearly. And the fact that you can hold both, both some kind of more spacious way and the struggle with this hate and rage, I think you're probably in good hands with yourself. And I think that probably just continue because the hate that you're feeling, the rage you're feeling, it probably needs that friendly, welcoming space. It's probably something, actually, it's probably a symptom of something deeper. And so don't feed the hate, but make room for it, befriend it so it has space and time. And because it might begin to settle enough that you can feel what's actually underneath it. And I don't want to limit you what it might be, but just to give you a hint that I think a high percentage of people who have hate and rage, somewhere underneath it, there's a deep sense of hurt. And so eventually it's the hurt that really needs your attention and care. And to be sidetracked too much by believing the hate or acting on the hate is actually a disservice to what really needs the attention. Thank you. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes. I think so. Thank you for what you shared today. Your teaching resonated for me, not only in what I'm working on right now, but in relation to a kind of tangential idea which might be relatable for others, which is one of the things I discover when I'm meditating, in that when I'm in the open space, when all has fallen away and I'm in the stillness, is that that is where there's space, not only to let go of defining, but to let go of self-judgment, to work with my thought life, to be able to notice that I am believing my thoughts and to then choose to not only allow, starting with the allowance, and then for me there's prayer involved as well, so in connecting to source and opening. And in that I'm creating space, and I'm deeply grateful that you put some words to what happens there. Very nice. Thank you. Very nice. And just to add something to what you said, is that as you're doing what you're doing, making that space, seeing your thoughts and what you believe, it's probably a process of continuing ability to open more space, new dimensions of more space, and then you see more and more deeply what some of the thought patterns are, and which ones are healthy and which are not. Thank you, Gil, for today's talk. So continuing on some of the points that have been raised, I just wanted to ask if you mentioned we need to create an open space that we don't have judgments, but often we come with judgments and it's tight and restricted. So is the path of going from the tight and restricted space to open non-judging, is it basically acknowledging what's coming and giving space for what's coming, is that the path by which it happens or does it happen through developing a meditation practice? It's a great question, and so hopefully my response will address it. One of the really important abilities we have as human beings that maybe is underappreciated is the capacity to have the veto over what we do, to say, I'm not going to say that, I'm not going to do that. We don't necessarily have control over what the mind kicks up, the thoughts, the motivations, what we feel like we want to say, what we want to do. That is maybe outside of our control to always, and that's why it's good not to be able to judge ourselves for what comes, because it's not necessarily in our control what comes, but we do have, and that's what we want to have as a minimum in Buddhist practice, we want to have the ability to have the veto power. And so, okay, I'm not going to say that, and I'm not going to act on that. And so learning to be restrained, to be at peace, to be at ease in not doing is a phenomenal capacity. It doesn't sound very exciting to be restrained, right? I mean, come to IMC and learn how to be restrained. I mean, no one's going to come. It just feels like that's too restrained, that's too limited, that's too something. But it's actually the opposite, that as we learn not to act on the unhealthy motivations, unhealthy harmful things that we mind is capable of doing, or if we're unsure whether it's healthy or harmful, to maybe hold back, we actually then get closer to that place of being undefined, being unlimited, being free. We're actually exercising our freedom in doing the veto power. Is that address your concern? Yes, thank you. So what you're saying is, keep doing the vetoing until you go from a constricted space into an open space in the mind, and eventually develops all the time, like not just during meditation. Yeah, especially if you're in social work. You know, there are times, of course, where you want to kind of give free rein to what's going on in the mind. And sometimes meditation is that place. When I used to go to the gym, I worked in exercise machines, that was a time I gave free rein to my mind, and I would sometimes close my eyes doing some of the exercises and just like complete freedom to let my mind do whatever it wanted to do. Or if I go for a walk up in the hills here, and there have been times when I've been really angry, and I go for a walk, I'm not going to do anything to anyone, I'm not going to say anything or do anything, but I'm going to go walk fast up in the hills and let it just kind of course through me. So I'm not suppressing anything, I'm not repressing anything. It's very important to see it clearly. But what the veto power is over is causing harm with it. Thank you, Gil. Thank you. Good morning, and thanks very much for the talk, Gil. So I think you can become aware that sometimes, kind of building on what you were just saying, that I can either have a response to someone that seems unkind, or even an immature reaction. So it just strikes me that it's almost like I have a bunch of three year olds and seven year olds within me, and I've kind of got to say, no, no kids, we're not going to do that. But sometimes it comes out and you do it, but much of the time... Sometimes you need to call on the inner adult. Yes, exactly. Or the inner grandparent, if you have good references for that. So we have all these capacities, we can't necessarily control whether these inner kids are having a party. But you do have the veto power about what spills out. And hopefully by nurturing them over time, you can help them maybe grow up a little bit. Yes, I think very much so. Very, very much so. Yes, is there a mic over there? Where's the other mic? Oh, you have it there, okay. Hi, good morning. I think going back to having that veto power is a way to have inner love for yourself, but then also external love for those that you're talking to, having that respect. And so I'm glad you brought that up because I think that's very important. It's something that I think a lot of people miss these days because they just care about, I have an opinion, I have an opinion, I have an opinion, but it's not more of, you know, well, maybe what I'm saying is going to be hurtful to that particular person. And I'm glad you brought up the space about not only making space for a stranger, but making space for yourself. Because I think a lot of us just forget that who we were and kind of comparing that to who we become. And I think that's something that gets lost in some sort of translation. As we're growing older and older and older, we forget that, you know, hey, I'm so busy with my external life that I forget that I need to, you know, take a step back and go, who was I before? And what am I missing? And I think that's something that a lot of people can, you know, take advantage of. By the way, off topic, you have a great aura. I'm just, I'm seeing that in you. But yeah, I think that's, I mean, it's important for people to be kind to each other overall. Great, great. Yeah, thank you. That was really well said. Thank you very much. And so I think this just reinforces, again, it says it a different way, you know, how important meditation can be. Thank you for the talk. I was thinking when you were talking about how the Buddha defined people by their jobs, merchant, teacher, doctor, and so forth. And then you spoke personally about your teaching voice when you got home and were with your wife. So I was thinking about fixed views, and that's one thing that makes us suffer, fixed view of oneself. If I'm this, I need to behave and respond in a particular way. So you hinted at it, but I'm wondering if you could speak to how having this fixed view of self, doctor, teacher, lawyer, brilliant physician, can really be something that we cling to and cause some difficulty in our lives, more suffering. Yeah, well, if I want one is a little bit, when I go back to what you said, I think if we took if it's too crowded with too many definitions and activities, there's no space for love. There's no space for kindness. There's no space for inquiry. There's no space for deeper self-discovery. But if we cling to like these roles, these jobs and stuff, it can be a headache for the people around you, because you're expecting them to participate in the idea. You better treat me that, you know, I'm like, you know, you better treat me with the right respect because, you know, guess who I am, you know, and I'm this way. Yes, and I noticed for myself, I was a teacher for a number of years, and defining myself or thinking I was teacher was a heavy load to carry. So it's much more liberating and freeing psychologically to say, oh, I'm just who I am, or I am the, I am what you see, basically, rather than having to put on the role of a teacher all the time. So that was a weight that I somehow got rid of at some point, but it can be a pretty heavy burden for people. There are people who would prefer that when they meet strangers, that the strangers don't ask them, what do you do? First, you know, right away, because somehow that immediately defines them too much. You know, they don't want to be defined so quickly by what they do. And other people love it. And then in between, it's just sometimes a very, very nice way to connect. So how do you know where in that spectrum it is? It depends on the context of the person. So I think we should stop. But, well, if you want to come out in the parking lot now, I think it's warm enough, bring a folding chair with you, and we can sit in a circle, take off masks, and outside, and continue the discussion. We often do this on Sundays, so everyone's welcome to stay. And thank you for being here today, and thank you for your great comments and questions.
