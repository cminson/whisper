So we're talking about this important topic which appears importantly in the teachings of the Buddha.
It appears often. Sometimes it is presented in ways that it's hard for modern people to identify with or appreciate.
But I think that the teachings on the five aggregates, the five groupings, or the five divisions of our human experience,
might be easier to appreciate through presenting them as a story, which is a little bit paradoxical,
since part of the purpose of this teaching is to help us come to the end of stories or appreciate a different way of being.
And so it begins, these five aggregates, five groupings, with the direct experiences of things, the sensory experience.
And the Pali word can mean appearance, appearances, but it's just like in English, what appearance means, what comes into view.
But it also can be extended to be any sensation that comes into experience, anything we sense.
And so it's kind of the raw sense data from which we build our world from, our understanding of the world.
And then when there's a Buddhist psychology, then the understanding is once a sensation has come, sense data has come,
the first detail of that that becomes then apparent is the pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant or unpleasant of it.
There's some idea that this kind of amoeba like being, you know, for against or pleasant or unpleasant is very basic and occurs almost immediately after just taking in a sensation.
Before we necessarily even recognize what it is.
And then, but so then, and we often react to the pleasant or unpleasant.
It might be that the recognition knows that this is terrible, this is uncomfortable, or this is wonderful.
That's the simple act of recognition, the third step.
But it could be recognizing what the object is.
You know, like I was talking earlier about the meditation bell we have here.
So I see it, it's a pleasant sight.
And I recognize it as a bell, but we have to really appreciate that the recognition is not that doesn't live in the object.
The recognition is a often a construct, a very simple application or projection onto the thing.
In this case, by its function, it's operating as a bell.
So we call it a bell.
The many years ago in San Francisco, I saw someone who was a homeless person who was kind of asking for money.
But he had a beautiful Japanese bell.
I was surprised how beautiful it was, kind of like this one here that I have.
And he's going around and asking for donations.
And I said, oh, it's now the bell is a begging bowl.
And so the recognition, so those are the first three of the aggregates.
The appearance of sensations, experiencing it as their pleasant and pleasant are not neutral.
And building on that, there's the recognition.
And the recognition is usually just one word.
Just a simple label idea of what it is, concept.
And then once we have a simple concept, then there's an elaboration that goes on.
And that elaboration can be a story or some construct that's more than just the object itself that we're recognizing.
And so I see the bell here and I recognize it as being IMC's bell.
And I remember the person who gave it to us many years ago and that where the person gave it to us or what inspired the person to give it to us.
I remember the person's name and my appreciation for that person and wondering what's happened to that person and feeling as warmth for this person as I think about this bell.
And so there's all this construction, this elaboration that it rises in the wake of having recognized this as a bell.
And that's innocent enough. It kind of adds to the richness of life to have stories and histories and things like that.
But it also is a place where life can get unnecessarily complicated.
And a lot of human suffering gets born in this elaborations that happen, the constructions that happen after the basic recognition.
Once there's all these things together, there's the appearance, the unpleasant, the recognition and the constructions of stories and ideas around it.
Then there's the fifth aggregate, which we'll talk about tomorrow, which usually in English is called consciousness.
And in the way the story I'm talking about, consciousness is not prior to all the rest of it.
It actually arises in the wake of all of this.
So we'll talk about that tomorrow.
But so for today, it's the fourth aggregate, the fourth grouping, which is usually translated into English as mental formations.
The Pali word, sankara, S-A-N-K-A-R-A, the sun means like with.
And kara is related to karma to make or to do and sort of form something. So that's why people say formations.
I like the word constructions.
It doesn't say mental in it, but that's by application.
It has to do with the mind, the mental constructions, the mental elaborations that go on in the mind, the stories.
And how we build are the worldly kind of living.
Some of it's built collectively, and some of it is built by our own projections onto people and things and ideas.
And this world of constructions has some to do with our inclinations, our bias, our preferences, our motivations, our presence of purpose, our fears.
It's a huge world that is part of the mental landscape that we live in.
Often we don't recognize it as such, and not only do we think that the recognition, the object we recognize, the third aggregate, is really what that's what it is.
And we're attached to the idea we have of it. I get attached to this being a bell here at IMC.
If someone wanted to use it as a trash can, I'd feel a little bit like, what? I'm not so sure about that.
I kind of like to keep it as a bell and keep it clean and things like that.
And then there's stories around it, constructs around it.
IMC bell, keeping it clean, what it means for a meditation center to have a clean bell.
And some of that's normal, but some of it can be, that's the world, not only of constructs, but that's also the world of constructions.
Now, of clinging. Now, what's fascinating around these teachings of the Buddha is that this constructing aspect of the mind is what constructs the other groupings.
That the appearance of things is partly born, not innocently because something comes, partly because we have an apparatus that selects that out of the environment.
Of all the things we could pay attention to, there's a selective process that this is important.
And we're selecting this or we're selecting the feelings, feeling tones, we're selecting the ideas, the recognition.
More often we're selecting the constructions themselves.
But for the Buddha, each of the five aggregates is a construct made by the constructing activity of the mind.
And so many times people in the West will say, the teachers will say that the Buddha said there's no self, what there is are these five aggregates, these five heaps.
And the Buddha actually didn't say that.
He actually saw the five heaps more as the problem, and he called them actually all five of them a burden.
And how I understand that is that the constructing activity of the mind selects out of the suchness of experience, the simplicity of the experience, certain things to prioritize.
And it's kind of in some ways necessary to do it, but there's a kind of extra, extra-ness in it that comes with it, that creates a lot of clinging, a lot of suffering, a lot of burden in this world.
That's very different if we rest in the suchness of things.
We just allow things to be as they are, almost as if we don't need to get involved in the appearance or the feelings or the ideas or the stories around it.
We're just very, we're there in a very, very simple way.
So these five, there's a story then going, you can say like I did, appearance, feeling tones, simple recognition, elaboration and stories.
What's interesting for mindfulness practitioners is it's possible to go backwards, to recognize that we're involved in storytelling and the elaborations of the mind, and then be curious.
Can I just recognize that that's happening in a simple possible recognition?
Thinking, story making.
And then step back further, is that pleasant or unpleasant to be thinking and telling these stories?
And then we take one step back, and what are the actual sensations that come along with it?
Maybe there's pressure, a tightness, maybe there's some kind of pleasantness and warmth in thinking about it.
And what we're doing is we're going back to the, what's primary or foundational to get grounded there.
So taking a stand on the simplicity of the experience, we're less likely to be swept away in the, in the, you know, in the currents of these elaborate thinking.
So sometimes we can watch from appearances as things get more complicated into stories, and sometimes we can trace it backwards to the basic simple sensations that are there.
And that's fascinating to kind of be able to go play the scales, mindfulness scales back and forth up this, and find and doing that, that you start appreciating that each of these five, these four so far,
are experiences that have a genesis, they arise, they appear, and they disappear, they come and they go, they appear and they cease.
And so it's possible to begin being in the flow, the current of these things, which is much closer to the suchness of them,
than it is to select them out and hold on to anyone out of the general flow of the river.
So I hope that made sense. And then tomorrow's topic, the last aggregate, I think is very interesting for many people when we call it consciousness.
So we'll take a look at what this is for the Buddha.
So thank you, and I look forward to tomorrow.
