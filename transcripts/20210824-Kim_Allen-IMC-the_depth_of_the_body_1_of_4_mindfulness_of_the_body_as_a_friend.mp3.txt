 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Okay. So for those of you who may have joined a little bit later, you can see that Gil is not here, and I just want to pass along that he is fine. He was planning to be here, but then he had to travel unexpectedly. So as I said, everything is fine. My name is Kim Allen, and I'll be here for the rest of this week. I know that Gil was planning to speak this whole week on the topic of patience. So this Monday's topic of staying true under stress is perhaps relevant this week. It's always a bit stressful to have a rapid change in circumstances or a change of plans. So that's something that we can all practice embodying us along with Gil for this week. And then I also thought that it might be more meaningful for you to explore the topic of patience if you have to wait until next week to do it. So we'll have a different theme for the next four days. I'll be talking about different ways of using the body as one's field of practice. And I'm calling this series the depth of the body, because we may not realize just how profound this very basic body is. So today I will talk about mindfulness of the body as a friend, a way that we can have a support for our practice at all times. And then tomorrow we'll talk about the four bodily knots. It's a list found in the teachings that's not taught very often, the four bodily knots. And then Thursday we'll talk about the body as a support for concentration, or the gathering and stilling of the mind. And on Friday we'll talk about the body as a vehicle of insight, even liberating insight. So today is mindfulness of the body. And the Buddha's teachings are just filled with ways that we can cultivate and get support from mindfulness of the body. And in particular, there is a story about the time that the Buddha died. And his cousin and attendant Ananda, you may have heard that name, he was very distraught, naturally. He had been, of course not only was he the Buddha's cousin, but he had been his personal attendant for at least a couple of decades at that point, and was of course very connected to him, and it hurt him deeply that his cousin had passed on and he wasn't sure what he was going to do after that. And so, but he did eventually go on with his practice and became awakened. And at that point he composed an awakening poem, as a number of the elder monks did. And this is a little section from Ananda's awakening poem. I'm completely disoriented. The teachings don't spring to mind. With the passing of our good friend, everything seems dark. When your friend has passed away, your teacher is passed and gone. There's no friend like mindfulness of the body. So it's interesting, right in that moment he came up with the idea of mindfulness of the body as a friend. So I want to talk a bit about mindfulness of the body as a friend. There are many ways, of course, to engage mindfulness of the body. Many of them are talked about in the discourse called the Satipatthana Sutta, the most basic instructions that we have about cultivating mindfulness of all different realms of experience. But there's quite a long section about mindfulness of the body. And this teaching includes a number of areas. One of them is the simple mindfulness of breathing in and out, as we did during the meditation. One way this can be used is simply to calm the body. It's always available, the breath. It's something that we can touch into many different times during the day, or especially on the cushion. And it's often, at least as long as you haven't had difficult experiences with the breath, it's often a way to calm the body because it's a kind of a natural rhythm coming in, going out. We can feel some ease through that. So this is one way that mindfulness can be seen as quite friendly. There's also in this sutta the mindfulness of postures. So literally knowing whether or not you are sitting or standing or walking or lying down, whatever posture you're in, you just have conscious awareness that that is the posture that the body is in. I think it's a great way to start doing mindfulness of the body practice in daily life. So, for example, you could notice right now that whatever posture you're in, are you sitting maybe? And do you know? Just take a moment to know that you're sitting and how you know that, because you can feel the body in that posture. And you might notice that just bringing this to mind has a slight clarifying effect on the mind. There's a little sharpening of attention when we know what posture we're in. And since we're always in some posture, this is a great way that we can sharpen our mind up at any moment, bring it into the present if it's in somewhere else, and just being clear about how our body is disposed as the way the sutta says it. And then another very simple way to be mindful of the body is mindfulness of actions. So this gets more specific to knowing what it is we're doing at a given moment. And the sutta lists all kinds of things, knowing that we're extending our arm or pulling it in, knowing, of course, which posture we're in, knowing if we're talking or not, knowing if we're eating, chewing, swallowing, even urinating and defecating. Everything is included. Nothing is left out of what it is that we're doing. And so this is, of course, yet another way to connect in and just be present. But I would say it goes farther in the case of knowing our specific actions than this practice becomes a basis for ethical action. So when we are noticing what we're doing, we can't help but be more aware of the quality of our actions. Even when we bring in the supposedly neutral awareness of what we're doing, just knowing, yes, I'm raising the cup to my lips and having a sip of water. It's very natural as we do that to also notice the quality of that action. Are we doing it in a hurry way? Are we angry while we're doing it? Do we have an intention of harm in some way? So these things become much more available when we have mindfulness of actions. So this is really our friend, right, looking out for our ethical quality. So just recognizing what it is that we're doing as we're doing it is a great support for bringing more wholesomeness into our life. And then as we get more familiar with these top level actions of ways of being mindful of the body, and of course, they can go very deep. I don't mean to cast them only at surface level. They can go very deep. But a new layer starts to get revealed when we tune into the subtler aspects of the body. There's kind of an energetic presence to the body. Often we feel it maybe more in meditation, but as we as we practice that, it becomes more available in daily life. So sort of like the way we can't really hear, you know, birdsong or quiet music when we're standing on a busy street. We don't always feel this underlying energetic sensations of the body if we're rushing around in our daily life. But as we learn to feel them on the cushion, they become more available to us off the cushion. And these these energetic sensations are more where those emotional feelings are housed. You know, the rush of energy that we feel when there's anger coming up in the mind or the kind of slight heaviness that we feel in the body when there's sadness or depression. This is great information and the way that the mindfulness of the body, if we carry it throughout the day, can help us connect with our mind. You know, sometimes in the press of being with other people or being on the computer or something else, our mind is going very fast. And if we aren't tuned into the body, we can miss some of what's going on for us. And then we may react in ways that we don't understand or regret later. So the body has a lot of information in it as we and if we practice that on the cushion, then we'll be able to bring that more into our interactions. So feeling the emotions. And then one area that I emphasized in the in the sit that I find I found very meaningful in my own practice is to check in and tune into the relationship between thought and the body. It's not often emphasized, but thinking actually does have an impact. In particular, I've noticed that when I am thinking a lot on the cushion and I'm trying to meditate, but my mind is busy. Each time I return to present moment awareness, whatever my object was, I noticed that there is kind of tendrils of tension that run down from the head down into the shoulders and the chest and to the neck can feel these ways in which the thought has tightened up certain channels in the body somehow. And so if we can tune into that a little bit sooner, we may not get lost in thought quite as easily. And also we may learn to think in ways that are a little bit more healthy. Sometimes the extreme tension that comes in with thought is because we've really gotten wrapped up in a story about ourself or a thought of revenge or some other kind of thinking it's not actually very helpful for our practice. And there are there are kinds of thought that are more helpful than others. And, you know, for example, thoughts about the Dharma or thoughts about ways that we can be helpful or things like that ways we could support people still thinking but it is, you know, more conducive to our practice more in line with wholesomeness and those kinds of thoughts you will notice don't produce quite as much tension in the body in the belly or the chest or throat. So again, we have information coming in through mindfulness of the body that we might not have if we try only to see the mind body is a great gateway into the mind. So this is once again our friend our friend mindfulness of the body helping us out in our practice, helping us to learn more about this experience of being human, so that we can bring forth the best of that in our life. So, once we start to see the body as a helpful experience to pay attention to you, and we gain some skill in tuning into a variety of aspects of it, like physical feelings and quality of our actions, and also the more subtle energies that tell us about emotions and thoughts, then we're setting the stage to explore also many other Dharma practices that use the body. And those are going to be the topics that unfold as we go on with the week. So, we'll continue with that tomorrow. And I look forward to seeing you then, you can come. So, be well.
