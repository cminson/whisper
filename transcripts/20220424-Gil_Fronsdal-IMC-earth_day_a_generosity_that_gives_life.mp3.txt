The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So before the talk, I think one of the nice announcements, especially since we're celebrating Earth Day today,
a few days late, but we do it on Sundays usually, is that the IMC is starting up, restarting its Earth Care group.
That is a group of people here at IMC who meet to talk about Earth Care activities, studying Earth Care issues together.
And considering what IMC might do in this wider world for caring for this Earth.
And I think they're going to start having regular monthly meetings, and a lot of them will be on Zoom,
so it means that people who are IMC-connected people far away could maybe participate.
And the first meeting will be next Saturday at 1 p.m. and Ram, who's here in the back, if those of you are here,
raising his hand in the back, he's one of the people organizing it.
And he went through the Sati Center's Buddhist Eco Chaplaincy Program,
and now he's deeply connected to this whole world.
And Shani here also, she's also went through the Buddhist Eco Chaplaincy Program together with Ram.
Anyway, so if you're interested, there's more information on the website,
under what's new, there's an announcement for it with the Zoom link.
It's also on the IMC calendar, or if you're here at IMC, you can talk to Ram and probably Shani too.
So to talk about this day, Earth Day,
I want to adapt a story that I'm fond of, I've told before, but adapted for this occasion.
And the story has to do with, in the village, there was a couple who were going to give birth to their first child,
and she was born, and this beautiful little baby girl.
And some wise elder of the village, or from the neighborhood, the area, came through town and looked at her and said,
oh, very nice. However, it's her destiny that she will die on her wedding night.
Oh, well. So the couple had the baby then raised his daughter,
and we're kind of hesitant to have her be married, but at some point they couldn't keep her from becoming married,
and they didn't want to tell her about the prophecy.
So she was married, and there was that evening a big party, and everyone in the village came,
and there was a big celebration and party to celebrate this wedding.
And the parents, of course, were a little bit worried what this meant.
And everyone was involved in the party, but then someone knocked on the door,
and it turned out to be this very old lady who lived on the edges of the village,
and people had kind of forgotten about her.
No one really quite knew how old she was, but she had lived there for her whole life,
and she had given birth to a number of kids she cared for,
she took care of her grandkids, even took care of her great-grandchildren,
but because people had children when they were quite young in this village,
after she had grandchildren and great-grandchildren,
she stopped having the energy to take care of them, that she was old.
And as the generations proceeded, she was forgotten,
and some of her kids and grandkids had died, and great-grandchildren had died,
and the people left this old, old lady.
She couldn't take care of herself anymore, and people left her alone,
and what you said, anybody of an old lady.
And so she was hungry and poor.
And so she came to the wedding knocking on the door to ask for some food.
And the guests opened the door and said,
I'll just shoot her away, someone that poor and old, just not so nice to have at a wedding party,
we're celebrating, they shoot her away.
But then the bride saw this, and so she went out and asked,
what is it?
And she said, I'm hungry.
Oh, let me bring you some food, and so you brought her a big plate of food,
and Mary said, sit with you while you eat, and she said, yes.
And that when they should finish eating her meal, the old lady said to the bride,
you know, I've been here living this village for a long, long, long time,
and I have a lot to teach you for the sake of your children,
and their children, and their children, down the generations.
I know things that people have forgotten.
I know the seasons to plant and harvest so that the soil doesn't erode away
and actually keeps the soil healthy and fertile.
I know how to harvest things from the forest, trees and everything,
so the forest regenerates.
I know how to care for the lakes and the rivers so that pollutions and sewage
and all kinds of things don't destroy the life there.
I know how to have fires in the village,
when to do it, where to do it, how to do it,
so that the children don't grow up with asthma.
If you come visit me, I'll teach you these things,
and the bride said, sure, I'll come.
And she went back to the party, it was celebration.
The bride and groom do what bride and grooms do,
and then the next morning, the bride was still alive.
So the parents were kind of like, what happened?
So they went to the person who had prophesied about her death,
and they said, well, there was one thing I couldn't tell you.
There was one thing that would allow her to live,
and that was she had to be selflessly generous.
But if I'd said that, it wouldn't have been selfless.
So she wouldn't have been real generosity.
And she did that selfless giving to this old lady,
and that kept her alive.
It saved her.
And it more than it saved her,
she got a gift back from it
and offered to come and study and learn.
And this old lady, her name was
in different languages.
In our Buddhist language, she was Bhoomi Matta,
the earth mother, Teramadre, an Italian.
In Norwegian, it's Yulmu.
And the word Yulmu means earth mother.
It also is the Norwegian word for midwife,
which is kind of nice.
You can probably make all kinds of connections from that.
Interesting ideas that our earth mother
also gives birth to all that we have here.
Supports it and brings it forth.
So here we are on Earth Day,
and we have this wonderful earth
that has been supporting us for generations.
The earth has cared for human beings
since the beginning of human beings,
provided abundance in order to survive,
in order to make it down through the generations.
And here we are.
And what's going to save us?
The earth is struggling, it's under assault.
The people of the earth are under all kinds of tensions,
stresses that are pretty awful with climate change and things.
What's going to make the difference?
What's going to keep us alive?
Well, from the story, it's an act of generosity.
To be generous.
And generosity can't be forced,
can't be an obligation that has to really come from us.
Which, to say that, or to hear that,
some people will protest.
We'll say, no, no, we have an obligation.
We have a responsibility to work to save this planet,
to save and mitigate the problems of climate change.
Not only for the sense of the environment,
but also for so many people who are going to be harmed by all this.
Some of them are the poorest of the poor.
Of course we're obligated,
especially here, maybe some of us in the United States,
where the United States has 5% of the world population,
but produces 30% of the pollution.
So, in a sense, you can say the privileged,
should actually use more of the resources,
should be more responsible.
Of course we have a responsibility.
We bring up our finger and we shake it.
You have to do something and you're responsible and obligated.
But obligation and responsibility and chastising like that
is not generosity.
But of course we're responsible.
Well, if you like obligation,
if you like the idea of responsibility,
if that's your thing,
then from the Buddhist point of view,
we have to turn it around and say,
well, we have an obligation then,
we have a responsibility to learn selfless generosity.
So that from selfless generosity,
we can support the world and the people of the world.
So there comes with a joy, a delight,
so we're willing not just to,
so we can sit down with everyone
and learn from them and be friends with them,
not be divisive.
There's a kind of poison that comes along all too easily
if we act from obligation, duty, like you have to.
It doesn't lift us up.
It's kind of, obligation is like a burden.
And it kind of,
I don't think there's much hope for us as a planet
if everyone has to, you know,
gear up their obligation and like,
okay, we gotta, you know.
And we do things with selfless generosity,
maybe tirelessly, maybe do a lot,
maybe give ourselves over to it,
but come from a motivation
that is inspiring,
that's nourishing for ourselves and for others.
Then I think there's hope and possibility.
Then it's contagious if we can figure out how to do this.
And I think that's one of the contributions Buddhism can make to all this.
Buddhism hasn't had a particularly,
particularly history, good or bad,
I would think, of caring for the environment.
People who are environmental,
a Buddhist environmentalist,
will kind of squeeze out of Buddhist teachings,
teachings that support caring for the environment.
So you can find it there,
but I don't think that,
you know, really search for it,
and you get small little hints here and there,
and then they put them all together in one big package,
so it looks nice.
But Buddhism hasn't had a lot to say about this,
but Buddhism has a lot to say about generosity,
about care, compassion.
Those are important.
And so when we see suffering around us,
then the idea is to generously care for that,
generously, inspiringly with love and kindness and friendliness,
engage in doing something.
And how do we come to that place
so that we don't have to fall back on obligation
or defensiveness or war to care for ourselves?
Well, that's the strength of Buddhism,
is to bring forth those in an inspiring way,
in a delightful way.
And so we learn how to look at our attachments,
our clinging.
We like to look at the ways that we create divisiveness
and hold on tight and create a sense of self
that contributes to divisiveness,
contributes to selfishness.
And to learn an alternative,
to learn to settle deeply and open up and discover
layers and layers of inner freedom,
layers and layers of joy and happiness
that dissolve selfishness,
dissolve self-centeredness,
helps us to feel more and more deeply connected
to our others, to the world.
Like when I, you know, like when I,
from the first years I was practicing,
I was in college,
and I took a botany class.
And maybe little,
maybe because of my meditation practice by that time,
and today when the professor was on the board
and spoke at the amphitheater class
and was talking about,
I think the photosynthesis in this,
you know, the cycle of, you know,
all the cycles and oxygen and carbon dioxide
and the cycling of all this.
You had all these diagrams of how all the cycles through nature,
you know, the simple cycle is that
we produce carbon dioxide
and plants convert it,
carbon dioxide to oxygen,
so we can breathe.
Without the plants doing it,
there would not be enough oxygen here for us to be alive.
So then I left the class.
I was kind of absorbed in this whole discussion,
very still.
And so because I was so kind of absorbed in it,
in the mind, everything, distractions,
and it kind of fell away,
when I went out and stood in the courtyard
at the college where there was this huge old oak trees
around us,
I stood there and I could have
became, I don't know, frozen,
but completely I couldn't move.
I just started looking at it,
and I felt, wow,
I could do without one of my kidneys,
without a arm,
and all kinds of parts of my body I could manage fine without,
but I can't do without these plants.
And so where do I begin and where do the plants end?
Where is the separation,
if I'm so dependent on them?
And I stood there in this kind of world
of separation dissolved,
and it felt this beautiful inspired sense of
the mutual support and connectedness,
and we're not born from the earth,
from nature.
We are the earth, we are nature.
We're not visiting this planet,
we're visiting life.
We are the life of the planet,
we're inseparable from it.
And so from that,
to be generous,
is your right hand generous
when it washes the left hand?
And the left hand, is it being generous
when it washes the right hand?
You could say yes,
but it's selfless,
it comes together,
it's because they're connected,
we don't think of that way,
because it's just caring for what's here.
The way that we relate to the world around us
has that kind of intimacy,
almost as if it's part of us,
there's no sense of it being an obligation
to care or no sense of it is required even.
But it's just, of course, we do it.
Of course that comes out of us.
It doesn't even come out of us,
of course it comes out of the world.
And this is kind of the beauty
and the mystery and the wonderfulness
of settling deeply into Buddhist practice,
is to discover this beautiful source of motivation,
this beautiful source of energy and engagement
that is kind of selfless,
kind of, we don't want to,
we can't claim it to be mine,
me, myself and mine,
but it's available and connected
or it lives in a mutuality with this wider world.
And then there can be generosity.
That's the selfless generosity.
That's what makes the heart sing and smile.
That's what nourishes and supports the heart.
So what is that generosity?
How can we learn it?
How can we enact it?
How can we give ourselves permission
to do wonderful things,
to turn on the light of that generosity,
that care, that love, that compassion,
turn on so that it's those wonderful things
for the world around us.
And not because it's an obligation.
I don't know, you know.
I'm going to miss my Netflix.
But rather, why would I watch Netflix
when I can do these wonderful things?
When there's something in flow,
this flow of the natural world,
it's this aliveness and goodness,
can just flow and be here
and feel more alive
and everything is kind of free
in this generosity
and in this doing in the world.
So this mutuality
and this intimacy with the world that's possible,
I think for me is represented
by the emphasis that Buddhists will have
on finding the four elements within us.
These four elements are said to be
earth, water, fire and air.
And what this means is that
there are certain characteristics, sensations,
sense, feelings that we can have
that are identified as being somehow
behaving in the same way within us
as we can find out in the natural world.
So finding the quality or characteristics
of earth within us
is defined where their support,
what supports us.
The ground supports us.
And in us, there's things that are solid
and heavy and supportive that hold us up
and allows us to sit upright, for example,
and receives the weight of our body
and provides support.
I kind of a little bit delight in this idea
that how important it is that we have this earth
to support us because without it,
we would just be like floating around in space.
I see some things as photographs of the astronauts
up in the space station
and they're just kind of floating around up there.
And I guess it's small enough space
they probably push themselves off the walls.
But imagine if the earth wasn't here,
we would have to find our way back to the earth
to push on something.
And we'd probably just kind of like be helpless in the air.
But the earth has gravity that pulls us down,
it keeps us and then supports us just enough,
just the right amount so that we don't float away,
but we don't get crushed by too much gravity.
So the earth is within us, the same thing.
And then there's the water element
said to be the characteristic of water
that we can feel, they say, is cohesion.
Like water droplets put next to each other,
they stick together, you get more and more of them together.
That cohesiveness also,
that phenomenon where water goes up
a little bit on the edges of a glass,
that's holding on and sticks.
Capillary action and plants that pulls up the water up the tree,
up these big redwoods we have here.
Imagine the redwoods, because of the nature of water,
properties of cohesion and water,
it pulls water to the very top of our redwood tree.
It's a big tall tree there.
So this cohesion, and so much of what we are,
we're held together, we're held together by the skin,
the muscles, the tendons,
all this stuff that holds us here together.
And if we didn't have the cohesion,
all our particles would just kind of float away,
but we're held together.
These are natural phenomena that somehow has evolved over time,
not of the cosmic soup.
And the fire element,
and they say how the fire element is,
is that everything that's animated within us,
and so all the energy that keeps us alive,
every sensation we have,
is an expression of something energetic within us,
the firing of the nerves.
Firing the nerves is kind of a fire.
And the energy we have that keeps us alive and going,
in some way or other has originated from the sun.
Sunlight comes down,
and the plants turn it into photosynthesize,
and turn it into carbide rates,
and we eat them, or something else eats them,
and then eventually if we eat the food,
we transform it into, somehow or other, into energy.
And then, you know,
in a sense, there's a continuity of that energy from the sun
that keeps us going,
and so we can feel that continuity of the energy, the aliveness,
the vitality.
It's part of the natural of this earth,
part of our solar system.
I think it's so cool.
And then the air element is,
they say it's the quality of movement,
and we're moving beings.
We're not plants rooted down.
We can get around.
We can walk around.
We can move our limbs.
We can move our chest, our diaphragm,
so we have this exchange of oxygen
and carbon dioxide.
And so this idea of kind of feeling within ourselves
characteristics or qualities or aspects
of what we can see outside
makes it so that,
suggests that there's not actually such a strong line
between self and the world around us.
We're all sharing so much of the same material.
It's said that each of us is made from recycled materials.
How's that?
Recology, you know, they're going to do a line of business.
You know, they're just all recycled.
I mean, all the material that we're built of
has been in many different places and times
and down through the millennia.
And it's possible that each of us is breathing in now,
at least one particle of air that the Buddha breathed
because there's so many, you know,
billions of little particles of water and air
that go into us.
Statistically, the way it spreads out,
it's a good possibility we're breathing in
something that the Buddha breathed so long ago.
So this kind of feeling of, you know,
this interconnectedness and interdependency
is a phenomenal thing to feel.
And to feel it in such a way that we want to be generous
and we want to learn before it's too late.
Learn from the elders.
Learn from the people who are studying it.
Learn how to use it to live in harmony with it.
How to enjoy maybe the sacrifices that we need to make.
Sacrifice meaning making sacred.
Maybe the lifestyle that some of us are living
is not sustainable for this planet.
And is there an alternative lifestyle that we can enjoy,
that delight us?
And this again, I think, coming back to Buddhism,
Buddhist practice, the possibility of learning
how to enjoy life without needing
the latest and greatest technology,
without needing a lot of consumer goods,
not needing a lot of doing things to require air travel
and even car travel.
Just to feel the delight and the joy.
One of my delights in Sunday morning
is to walk down here.
It's about a 30-minute walk from my house.
I enjoy it so much.
But what a waste of time, right?
I mean, I could have spent 25 more minutes at home.
It takes only five minutes to drive here.
I'm sure I could have spent good 25 more minutes
checking out the news again.
Or reading more, looking for more websites
and just kind of searching.
That 25 minutes could have been productive
and useful and all kinds of things
I could have done with Netflix.
But I actually enjoy the walk.
It's just a beautiful, wonderful thing to walk down here.
And so the example is supposed to be the example of
how can we, this practice of ours,
its mindfulness, attention being present,
how can we let that bring forth
this beautiful potential that we have,
this phenomenal potential we have,
so that we are inspired, we're delighted,
we're happy to live a radically different life,
a radically selfless life where,
of course, we want to live differently,
a different lifestyle.
It's not a sacrifice.
I would say that if I had decided to drive down here,
saved, you know,
so just five minutes to get here rather than 30,
so that I could do more web searching or whatever I do,
that that would have been a loss.
That would have diminished me.
It's the walk that enhanced me.
So I don't know if that example works for all of you,
but there are, maybe you have your own examples.
I hope when I die, I don't look back in life and say,
yeah, you know,
I think I should count up how many websites I visited,
you know, probably, you know,
and then celebrate that my deathbed,
yeah, I visited 232,000 websites over my lifetime.
What a great life.
Or look back and say,
actually, the feeling of joy, delight, well-being,
groundiness I had from these walks I take,
that is a good visceral memory that I should die with.
Wow, that is good.
Or the people that I touched or I was touched by,
remember those, these deeper connections and love,
and that's something to have.
So Earth Day, Mother Earth,
she's knocking at your door.
She's been forgotten.
She's starving.
What do you do?
Send her away?
Continue the party?
What do you offer?
What do you have to offer?
And what do you save?
What life do you save by stopping long enough,
sitting down with her long enough
to offer your generosity and to learn and study
from our great parent, the Earth parent.
So let us appreciate this wonderful Earth that we have
and all the inhabitants
and care for the Earth and its inhabitants equally.
They're inseparable.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.
And may the Earth thrive
in this wonderful way that the natural world
lives in harmony and homeostasis.
Let us support this harmony
and homeostasis whatever way we can.
Thank you.
