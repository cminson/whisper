 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. For those of you... Sorry for the annoying voice, folks. Nothing to do about it. So before we really get started, I guess I'll just introduce myself for those who haven't been with me before. My name is Dawn Neal. I'm one of the local Bay Area teachers. I teach around at a bunch of different sanghas, especially at IMC. So I'm happy to be with you tonight. So... Let's see. I'm just going to start right in. I got news earlier today that friends of mine at Iloka Vihara have been evacuated because of a large fire in the area. They're all safe. They're all sound. And they were praising the firefighters and the other frontline workers for the really beautiful work that they'd done in keeping everyone safe. There'd only been two injuries and... Where is it? This is up north in Placerville, California. So this is part of the effects of the Calder Fire. So I just want to name that and bring it in the room that wishing they are safe and that they stay safe and that all beings who are being impacted by the various disasters, natural and manmade, right now, stay safe. The first responders, the folks, the helpers have been on my mind a lot recently. I started working as a hospital chaplain again not long ago. And hospital chaplains... Yay, John! Thank you, Abraham. Hospital chaplains are kind of considered spiritual first responders in our own small way. We kind of walk towards the difficulty, walk towards the spiritual fires, if you will. And it's learning to step into the unknown, learning to step into a little bit of a different world, stepping over a threshold into someone's room and never knowing quite what you see there, what the reality is going to be in that other room. I'm just going to have people stay muted for a little while if you don't mind muting yourself, if you're not already. So it reminds me of when I was first trained as a chaplain, actually. My very first educator, this wonderful woman, described it in terms of learning to step over the threshold, stepping over the threshold and you never know what's on the other side of the threshold. And sure enough, every room is its own world. In some rooms there's joy and celebration, in some rooms there's tragedy, in some rooms there's death or difficulty, and some rooms there's just dramatic change happening. And as a new chaplaincy student, we were often kind of willing but a little bit nervous about stepping into that. There was the fear of maybe being overwhelmed by the suffering, or there was the fear of doing it wrong and maybe somehow making it worse. But what she taught us to do was she taught us to take a moment and just collect ourselves and to set an intention in our hearts. And that intention would be to invite an attitude, or at least for me it was to invite an attitude of loving interest towards whatever was on the other side of that door. And it was amazing the difference made. This loving interest is kind of an attitude that runs through all of the immeasurables through loving kindness, compassion, altruistic joy through equanimity even. And it was also an attitude that no matter what the world was that I was walking into, it worked, it met what was there, and it helped me to meet what was there. There was this interest of like, okay, what's this world like? What's this room like? What's this person like? There was this kind of sense of presence that would develop in the room, almost like being in a bubble with the other person or the other people, and the rest of the world would kind of drop away and it was just us together in this kind of field or bubble of kindness and care. So it was the dwelling in this feeling, but it was also enacting it, enacting it by offering presence and by receiving whatever was there, and really open, caring way. And then as I've sort of journeyed through hospital chaplaincy and other forms of spiritual care, really found that even in the most dire circumstances, keeping that intention in the forefront, whatever that intention is, and it's different for different people, but keeping the intention of kindness, presence, interest, that in itself can serve as nourishment, as solace, as strength, as a resource. Even sometimes, there's a sense of joy in the wholesomeness itself of the feeling. So that's the meditation I'd like to invite us into tonight. For each of you to settle back, gather yourselves together, and set an intention. And that intention is for you, be it loving interest, kindness, being with something in the heart that will support you and nourish you in this next little while. And just a housekeeping note, I'm now going to turn off the ability to chat and just set the container. The container will be quiet for the next little while. And I will do my best to keep my voice loud enough. And I'm settling into this body and stepping over, in over the threshold and into this moment, into this body, this breath, inviting that intention and inviting a sense of presence, taking a moment to scan through your body. It's helpful to have your eyes downcast or closed. The invitation is also to do that. Taking a few moments to settle, noticing this body and heart and mind exactly as it is right now. Maybe there's fluttering, pulsing. Maybe there's warmth or cool. Or distraction or flurry as the mind and heart settle into this moment. Allowing inviting all of yourself here. Softening the eyes and the face. Softening the belly and the shoulders. And tuning in, attuning to whatever anchor of attention feels most natural, most easeful for you. Perhaps it's the posture, the stance of this body supported with a chair or cushion or earth. Perhaps it's the vibrancy of sensations, the aliveness of the body. Noticing the details, the sensations. For those for whom it feels right, especially noticing the details of the body breathing. Allowing the in breath and out breath to be as they are. No need to fix or change. Attuning in. Dwelling in. The body or the body of the breath from this moment. Allowing each out breath to release. Release any excess tension or stress. Perhaps on the in breath receiving. Receiving this moment. This precious life's breath. Just as it is. Bringing a sense of devotion, attention, loving interest to the experience of this body breathing. Relax your hold. Gather the attention in the bottom of the heart. Gather the attention in the body in the moment on the breath. Perhaps allowing the breathing to spread throughout the body. Whether through feeling sensations. Perhaps imagining the breath filling the body, nourishing it. By the water revitalizes moss. Perhaps imagining every organ and cell suffused with kind interest and breath. Breathing in, receiving. Breathing out a gesture of offering and release. Perhaps allowing the motion of breathing to expand through the body. Making contact, suffusing, saturating. Even feeling the breath at the edges of the body, where skin meets air. In the subtlety of transpiration. In the subtlety of transpiration. Perhaps imagining or allowing the whole body to expand and grow soft on the in breath. To allow to offer kindness, loving interest on the out breath. To allow to offer kindness on the out breath. To allow to offer kindness on the out breath. If you find the mind distracted, seeing how gently, kindly attention can be invited into presence in this moment. Thank you. Thank you. If it feels natural to simply continue to dwell in the presence of this moment, in your intentions and the breathing and the sensations. The invitation is to continue. And if allowing imagination to be part of the practice feels nourishing or inviting. Perhaps allowing the image or felt sense of someone who makes you happy, makes your heart smile. Having that sense of their presence. Joining your own. Could be an image. A word. Even a tiny snippet of memory. Any form at all. Allowing the sense of this other one. To fill the heart center, the center of your chest. This kindness or care or appreciation. And inviting them in. To a kind of bubble or field of loving interest. It's helpful to focus these good intentions. Might try using some of the classic phrases. More makeup words of your own. Whoever feels more right. Or prefer to build a sense of steadiness. Focus. These phrases can be shortened to a single word. May you be happy. May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you know ease and peace. Happy. Healthy. Safe. Easeful. At peace. Allowing the intention of kindness, care, loving interest. To flow freely through this body, through this bubble. Offering. Breathing out. Perhaps receiving when breaking again. Thank you. You You From time to time, noticing the quality of the sensations in your chest, throughout the body, allowing the intention of metta to flow through, suffusing yourself, suffusing the bubble or the field around you. Thank you. If it feels right now, expanding the field, allowing these kind wishes, caring wishes, to expand beyond the bubble of metta, and to out further into the world, no need to stream, no need to even direct if you don't want to, but allowing the intentions to flow outwards, perhaps like fog or clouds on the wind. If there's a certain person or certain groups that you would like to send good wishes to, keeping them in these beautiful intentions. May you be happy. Be safe. Healthy. May you be peaceful, peaceful, and free. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And now still allowing the feelings or at least intentions and breath of kindness, loving interest to steep the body, the heart, the mind. And with this much or little energy, it feels right, opening the heart to living beings here, near, and far. May all beings be happy. Safe from harm and causing harm. May all beings be healthy. And may all beings be happy. Thank you. And then for the last moment or two of this meditation, please feel free to leave your Letting go of phrases or directed intention and basking, steeping, or simply being with whatever this heart, this mind is experiencing in this moment. Wishing the person in your seat, happiness, safety, ease, peace, and freedom. Allowing the moment just to move through. You You Thank you all for your kind attention I'm gonna invite a little post practice for just a moment which is staying in that place of meditation perhaps your hand on your heart or However else feels natural to you if you're ready to open your eyes Take a moment to offer metta to each of the other people in their little boxes in the zoom room Offering metta one by one silently and At the same time knowing that you are being showered with metta from each other person here You It's quite something To be together this way to cultivate these intentions together Thank you for your practice I Am going to turn the chat back on And allow you to unmute yourselves and if anyone has a A comment a response You're welcome to either put it in the chat or To say something about how that was for you if you prefer to stay in silence. That's totally fine Just an invitation to put your voice in the room You can use if you're gonna raise your hand, please raise your zoom hand so that I see you You can also just unmute Yes Jerry Or Barbara, I'm sorry I Just wanted to say that I very much appreciated your sharing about In feeling like you're a first responder for spiritual fires and the and learning to step over the threshold and stop and collect yourself and then go into The room where you don't know what you're going to face. I think that It helps give us all courage to try and emulate that Thank you. Thank you Barbara. Yeah, I feel all of us need to Collect ourselves even if it's our own spiritual fire sometimes especially if it's our own spiritual fire that we're facing Meditations not for the faint of heart So Thank you Barbara and Jerry writes very calming of the monkey mind. Thank you Jerry. Yes This practice is beautiful that way Thank you Jamie for your words Any other comments Notions questions Yes, Abraham, please. Yeah, I want a second what Barbara said Years ago I studied For therapy an art therapist and that was very much the attitude you went into each hospital room or Wherever it was that you were working Was to Bear yourself to the moment and have faith that you had whatever would be needed You didn't know what would be happening in each room. It was totally a different world a different environment. I Never forgot that it's a it's a very good practice So it was really nice to bring Remember that we'll bring it back to this practice. I also like Instead of the sep way of doing loving kindness with the set phrases that you introduced some of them But you opened it with just whatever came to mind like a hospital room where you don't know who is in there But just who is in my consciousness? Who do I want to send some of this to? Thank you Abraham, yeah the practice of stepping into a room the world a moment they're all in a way It's kind of the same practice Somehow, right? Like what's this moment like what's this world our thought worlds change so much from one moment to another? It's pretty dramatic, right? So thank you for bringing that into the room Claire please Just wanted to really echo Abraham sentiments. I have the unusual faculty of being able to do great grief counseling And a lot of it and the process is very similar But it's a gift to be able to do it and I'm grateful that I've been able to Thank you for your work Claire It is an honor and a privilege to be with grief isn't it? It's also not easy. That's right It's beautiful hard work Takes a lot of strength to support the person Yes Yeah, it certainly does and That actually is a perfect lead-in to Prompt that I'm going to invite you all to participate in those of you who would like to stay and talk with each other and Also the invitation that if you don't want to be in a breakout group But you'd like to stay to the end you can just decline and hang out quietly while people are talking and we join at the end but the prompt that That Claire's comment reminded me so strongly of is To notice and maybe talk about brainstorm with each other what kind of resources You have found when stepping into difficulty how has Kindness or compassion Or anything else been a resource for you. How do you draw nourishment from it? So that's the question if you forget it or if you would rather Talk about something else related to your practice that's fine, too Say we have 22 people Okay Here we go, we'll see most of you soon Welcome back everyone Just want to open the floor for just a moment or two of the time we have left if anyone would like to share any Responses to the conversation or any nuggets that emerged for you in the conversation I would love to hear it teach me Yes, Jerry Thank you, and thank you Don for being here. I always enjoy when you substitute so it's great. Thank you so much. So It came up about you know the difference between you know about the issues of loving interests and also about the issues of You know none of us really care to be in conflict But and we see you know some moment perhaps Kindness that might change the conflict but the issue of standing up to bullies So that you know sometimes You know who wants to who wants to be in conflict? I don't think anyone here does But you also don't want to be a pushover and then feel that you know Because you're so afraid of conflict that you can't assert yourself so that space between In a loving kindness way asserting yourself But finding some moment of kindness may be in even that assertion that this is necessary So I appreciate your comment on that in a context of loving interest Beautiful, beautiful question and I really appreciate the inquiry so For me, and I don't always manage to get there. I have studied conflict resolution But the most disarming thing Very often for someone who is so called difficult person Is to express the same thing And the most important thing for them is to express sincere interest in what's happening for them Now if it's an actual bully Sometimes that has to be accompanied by a very firm No But a no said with love Right With with a sense of I'm going to prevent you from continuing to cause greater harm in this circumstance to yourself or to others Buddhist perspective allowing a person to perpetrate harm actually harms them greatly because it Brings negative karma into their life and that is not something that will play out well for them later either so that's one perspective and i'll maybe close with a comment that Munindji very famous teacher in india told sharon salsberg After she had arrived rattled and shaken for a practice discussion with him After someone had tried to attack her in new deli and take her purse off a rickshaw And she asked munindra. What do I do when he said my dear with all the loving kindness in your heart You take your ela umbrella and you bought them over the head so being a Paragon of loving kindness does not mean being a doormat, right? So We've reached the top of the hour friends I left it a little bit short for the sharing at the end, but thank you so much for your practice. It's a delight To practice with you and to cultivate these intentions in the world May all beings be free of harm and causing harm May all beings Be safe happy peaceful healthy and free Thank you so much Thank you Thank you, don Thank you, don Thank you Good night, good to see you again Thank you Thank you, Neil Good night, Fred Be well, friends Take good care
