The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So over the last number of weeks in this class, when I've been here,
we've been exploring the teachings of the Four Noble Truths kind of in some depth
because at one point the Buddha said to have said,
what I teach is suffering and its end and the Four Noble Truths is an expression of that.
First Noble Truth, there is suffering.
Second Noble Truth talks something about how that happens with the arising of craving,
the arising of suffering. So that's exploring suffering.
And the end of suffering expressed in the Third Noble Truth, the ending of craving,
the ending of suffering. And the Fourth Noble Truth being tools,
supports, teachings that help us to find this way to the end of suffering.
And so everything he taught, it is said, comes under these four aspects.
And so I've been kind of going through each of these Noble Truths
and looking at the various teachings that are offered from the Buddha
that are explored with each of these Noble Truths.
And so today I wanted to explore the Third Noble Truth.
But to begin, I want to just give a little bit of context about the Four Noble Truths
to kind of just overview the Four Noble Truths
and then dive in a little bit to the Third Noble Truth.
So as human beings, we all experience some kind of struggle.
Stress could be a subtler form of it.
Sometimes stress gets really obvious.
All the way through to very obvious and deep suffering, struggle,
loss of loved ones, pain, physical pain, the suffering in this world,
meeting, seeing how we interact as human beings
and have so much divisiveness and the centuries of war and oppression
that come through our human actions.
This is all suffering and we all experience it.
And the Buddha in his life is said to at one point have gotten curious
about this question of suffering
and wondering if it was just inevitable that human beings suffer
or if there is a way for human beings to be free from suffering.
And what he discovered as he started his own journey,
went on his own journey to learn from the teachers of the day
and the time of the Buddha and to explore in his own mind
a particular question of suffering.
Because in the time of the Buddha, the methods that were taught
to settle the mind and to find the way to some kind of peace
seemed to be a lot about, well, there were two basic kind of methods.
One was about settling the mind into a deep concentration
where the mind temporarily at least would be secluded from any experience of the world.
And the other one was a mortification of the body
in which it seemed to be some kind of, I don't really know the details of those practices,
the ascetic practices and also the practices of mortifying the body
and just to starve the body to harm the body.
But I understand something, it was something about if the body got so unpleasant
the mind would leave the body, something like that.
And so there were these two basic threads of practices
and the Buddha learning those practices said,
well, the concentration is pretty good,
but it doesn't seem to get at the real question that I'm asking,
because the suffering he discovered,
it was only temporarily relieved through those practices.
And so he began to ask if there's a way for a deeper relief from the suffering
that we experience.
And what he came to and understood is that,
well, there will be pleasant, unpleasant and neutral experience that happens.
Unpleasant experience is not going to go away.
And so what we often think of suffering as being in association with unpleasant experience,
we often think of suffering as being separated from pleasant experience.
And he said, those are going to happen.
That is not going to change.
He recognized, okay, that's the condition.
That's the condition of the world.
We will be in association with the unloved,
and we will be separated from the loved.
And so his question got a little deeper.
Is it still possible to have peace in the heart,
even amidst those conditions?
And what he found is that a great portion of the suffering that we experience
is not the experience of the pleasant, unpleasant and neutral,
and being associated with the unpleasant,
being separated from the pleasant,
but rather our mind's relationship to that.
And that when the mind can come into a balance around the conditions of the world,
not be pushing away what it doesn't like,
and pulling towards it what it like,
trying to hold onto what it likes.
So not in this push-pull, not in this kind of greed for the pleasant,
and aversion for the unpleasant,
confusion checking out around the neutral experience,
that when the mind can be present with what it is, with what is,
then there's a letting go that happens,
a release from the vast majority of what we call suffering lies in our mind's relationship
to the events of the world,
not in the objective events of the world.
And yet, I feel like I always have to say this,
because we might think hearing that,
the relationship is the place of the suffering,
and that coming into balance,
kind of a non-reactivity to the events of the world,
what the experience is.
If we get ill, for instance, if our bodies get sick,
a non-reactivity to that,
non-greed, non-aversion, non-delusion,
around what's happening in the world and in our own being.
We might think that what that means is that we wouldn't do anything.
We might think that it would mean we would just sit there
and kind of the image of the sage on the mountaintop
just not doing anything,
kind of receded from the world or in seclusion from the world.
And yet, the teachings that the Buddha offered to come into balance
around what's happening,
really, I think a lot of it is to come into the sense of,
yes, this is what is happening.
It is not denying what is happening.
We are fully aware of what is happening.
And that place of not being averse or trying to hold on
when things are pleasant, averse when things are unpleasant,
isn't a place of non-action.
And yet, our minds kind of habitually in...
Most of our lives, we have been motivated by these movements
of aversion and greed to the point where we think that that is how things happen.
We think that that's how things are moved forward in the world,
is out of greed and aversion, out of confusion.
And so we don't really understand the possibility of a mind that is non-reactive
and how it might, rather than react to the world, respond to the world.
That there can be a responsiveness in that balance of mind.
That a mind that is aware and attuned to suffering in the world and in ourselves
and not resisting it, not fighting it, not holding on to something else
will be motivated by compassion to alleviate that suffering.
Not from hating an aversion and anger, but from a heart that's open and connected.
And so this is the possibility of the freedom from the greed, the aversion, the delusion,
frees us from so much of what we call suffering.
That when we come into a place where the mind is in balance around what's happening
in the world and in our experience, we don't experience the unpleasantness
as what we would call suffering.
We experience it as unpleasant.
We also experience it as, okay, this is what's happening.
We are fully present and aware of this is what's happening.
So the suffering that the Buddha's path frees us from, helps us to find our freedom from
is the suffering of reactivity in our own minds.
And so this is what he taught. He taught first about what is that suffering,
that what I just described is a little bit of the teaching to understand suffering,
that first noble truth, a little bit of that so that we can understand what it is that we are
exploring, releasing from, that the movements towards greed, aversion, delusion.
So exploring that understanding of suffering. And then we begin to recognize
that it is the movement in the mind.
The second noble truth is that this suffering that we can be free from is created,
is initiated essentially through a reactivity in the mind.
And the Buddha pointed back to a particular kind of mental process of craving,
wanting things to be other than they are.
Basically, I think of this one as being a craving for things to be other than they have already come to be.
That maybe is a way we can understand that it's not about not taking action,
but it is more about coming into alignment with what is already here.
So what has come to be already?
We often are resisting that, what's already here.
And that is as somebody, I think, said this is from Star Trek.
Resistance is futile to what is already here.
It's the bad guys that say that.
It's the bad guys that say that, yes.
It's so true that in terms of what has already come to be,
we can't change what is already here.
And so the coming into alignment with, okay, this is what is,
that is where the craving, we often, so much we see sometimes the suffering is about,
it's like, how can I change the past so that this won't be happening?
That's kind of what our minds do.
It's like, well, what can I have done differently in the past so that this wouldn't be happening now?
And it's like, well, that's a little bit like a waste of time in this moment,
because it already is here.
And so the exploration of coming into alignment with this is what's here,
non-craving about something else happening or not craving to try to keep it going forever.
This is this moment, this experience is what is making me happy,
so I better hold on to this.
That's a kind of craving, the kind of pushing away of reactivity,
also pushing away of the not liking is also a kind of craving.
Craving for things to not be what they are here in this moment,
the craving to hold on to what is here forever.
And so this craving is the basic kind of force in the mind that the Buddha points to.
When that releases, when that craving releases, then our experience of the world shifts radically.
When we come into alignment with this is the truth of things as they are,
the heart not being constricted around that, not being in denial about that,
and not trying to hold on to it.
Then there's a way in which our system seems to engage from a whole different perspective,
a perspective of wisdom and compassion and patience and love and joy.
And so the actions that come when that craving is released come from a whole different place.
So that's the first and second Noble Truths.
And the first and second Noble Truths really in some ways describe our usual, our habitual relationship to the world,
that craving that tends to create the struggles.
And then the third and fourth Noble Truths are kind of how we might shift the pattern of our mind.
The third Noble Truth is a statement that it is actually possible for that craving to end.
That is the experience the Buddha said, I found this.
This is possible for human beings to do.
And yet not easy.
In fact, when he first woke up to this, it is said that he was sitting under the tree, the bodhi tree,
and realizing the profoundness of the kind of subtlety of the craving and how deep it goes.
So it's not just about wanting a cup of coffee or something like that.
It goes very, very deep, this craving. And he said to have reflected this understanding that frees the mind from suffering
is very subtle and people aren't going to get it when I try to talk about it.
So that would be a vexing thing to try to teach and have people just not get it.
So I think I'll just sit here and enjoy this freedom from suffering.
And then it was said that he had another thought.
And I was like, no, there are some people out there that will understand this.
And he reflected on his companions and realized that several of his companions would be able to understand this.
And so he searched them out. He went and found them and said, hey, here's another way.
His companions had been practicing the mortification practices.
And when they saw him and saw, first of all, that he wasn't like incredibly skinny,
he had practiced the mortification practices to the point where it is said that when he touched his belly, he could feel his backbone.
So that emaciated. And so after he woke up to this understanding around craving,
he realized that the paths that he had been exploring, the mortification path, hadn't been so supportive.
And so he nourished himself. He got healthy again.
And then he took this journey to find his five companions.
And when they saw him coming from the distance, they saw that he was, you know, had flesh on his bones.
And they said, oh, we won't talk to him. He's fallen away from the holy life.
But as he approached, they saw that there was a kind of a radiance about him.
And they almost couldn't help themselves but to say, what have you learned?
And so he gave them a talk. And it is said that the talk that he gave them was the Four Noble Truths, was a teaching on the Four Noble Truths.
And so this freedom that he understood, he realized that it is possible for others to understand it as well.
And this is what we have been the inheritors of, the teachings.
And so he found for himself this possibility of a completely radically different relationship to the world.
And began teaching how it's possible to free one's mind from these forces of craving, greed, aversion, delusion, being three kind of flavors of craving.
And that's the Fourth Noble Truth, the Eightfold Path.
Wise understanding, which is basically, you know, a little bit of understanding, what is it that we can be free of?
And wise intention to kind of aim ourselves in the direction of the practices.
Wise speech, wise action, wise livelihoods, so engagement in the world in a non-harming way.
Kind of, this is a relational practice. It is not strictly a meditation practice.
It includes, this path includes how we relate to each other, how we engage as human beings in relationship.
And then the third part of the Eightfold Path is the mental training.
Wise effort, wise mindfulness, wise concentration.
So these trainings to support the mind, to understand, this is where it loops back to the First Noble Truth.
These trainings, the mental trainings, wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood, wise effort, wise mindfulness, wise concentration,
support us in understanding the suffering as the Buddha pointed to it.
Not being in resistance and reaction to what's happening in the world and what's happening in our experience,
but coming into a new relationship with it, non-greed, non-aversion, non-delusion.
So these Third and Fourth Noble Truth really offer a counter to the first two.
The first two are kind of our habitual relationship to the world and our experience of that relationship being struggle, stress,
dissatisfaction.
And the Third and Fourth Noble Truths are a pathway towards this completely new relationship to the world.
And so the description of, to come now to the Third Noble Truth more fully,
description of freedom, the Third Noble Truth described as the ending of suffering.
The ending of the suffering in this first teaching the Buddha gave to its five companions, he said,
the ending of craving is the ending of suffering.
And so this is the freedom that the Buddha was talking about and it's described as this freedom.
The Pali word for this is nibbana, the Sanskrit nirvana, which is more in our English lexicon.
Nibbana is the language of the Pali texts, the texts that are the tradition that this center is mostly connected with.
And that word, nibbana, sometimes translated as enlightenment, sometimes translated as freedom,
basically has a meaning, a simple meaning that's an everyday meaning.
It basically is the same word that's used when something is cooling.
So something that's warm, cools when you let it sit out.
And this is what this word means, it means cooling, the cooling of fire, the cooling of heat.
And we do at times experience the craving, the neediness, the aversion as a form of heat.
And so it's an image or an analogy in a way, the word that's used for freedom,
of cooling that fire of anger and confusion and desire.
So this freedom is primarily described or defined in terms of what it is not.
It's primarily defined not as the attaining of something or the getting of something, but rather the releasing.
And the main definition is the ending of greed, aversion and delusion, the ending of craving.
So some quotes about this, these are from different sources, but they kind of flow together well.
The extinction of greed, the extinction of hate, the extinction of delusion, this indeed is called nibbana.
Enraptured with lust, enraged with anger, blinded by delusion, overwhelmed with mind ensnared,
one aims at one's own ruin, at the ruin of others, at the ruin of both, and experiences mental pain and grief.
But if lust, anger and delusion are given up, one aims neither at one's own ruin nor at the ruin of others,
nor at the ruin of both, and experiences no mental pain and grief.
This is nibbana, immediate, visible in this life, inviting, attractive and comprehensible to the wise.
And for a disciple thus freed, in whose heart dwells peace, there's nothing to be added to what has been done,
and nothing remains to be done, just as a rock of one solid mass remains unshaken by the wind,
even so neither forms nor sounds nor odors nor tastes nor contacts of any kind, neither the desired nor the undesired,
can cause such a one to waver.
Steadfast as the mind gained is deliverance.
So these descriptions perhaps sound remote, maybe hard to fathom.
It certainly is somewhat at times hard to fathom what it would be like to be free from greed, aversion and delusion.
And yet it is, to me, an inspirational description.
When I first heard the word enlightenment and started meditating and practicing,
I thought it meant that I would get something and be in some kind of like altered state or something.
Something, you know, other than just being engaged in my normal life, certainly.
And yet this description of the freedom from greed, aversion, delusion,
we might, over time, definitely as I began practicing and began getting little tastes in just moments
of the mind being able to release aversion around something.
Just being with something that was unpleasant and like, oh, that's unpleasant.
The mind letting go of the aversion to it began to get a taste or a flavor of, you know,
just in a little tiny, tiny little, like, minuscule flavor that, oh, this might actually be possible as a way to live a life.
And as the quote said, this is nibbana, immediate, visible in this life.
It is not something other than, it's not necessarily something other than living in this life.
Living in this life in a radically new way.
That's maybe hard to fathom.
And yet the description is one that perhaps we might see as possible for us in this very life.
The other description that I find inspiring is one experience is no mental pain and grief.
That sounds pretty good.
And yet it doesn't say it doesn't experience physical pain.
It is that reactivity that is released.
The heart at ease with what is and able to act again.
It says nothing remains to be done, but that is nothing remains to be done in terms of letting go of greed, aversion, and delusion.
Because as the Buddha's own life is an example of, his initial inclination was not to do anything upon that freedom.
His initial inclination was, wow, that would be hard.
But he got up and he, through this other reflection, there will be people who understand this.
It would be helpful to offer this to the world.
And he did that.
And so nothing more remains to be done in terms of freeing oneself from the forces of craving, the forces of ignorance.
And yet that heart freed from that is inspired to act out of compassion.
And that was that movement of compassion in the Buddha's mind.
There will be people that understand this.
His whole life was a demonstration of freedom in action.
Standing in the middle of a battlefield, trying to kind of like Gandhi.
This is not, this is not a good idea to be fighting over water.
So he tried to stop a water war and it stopped while he was standing in the middle of the battlefield.
And unfortunately, when he left the battlefield, the fighting continued.
And yet, he tried, you know, he stood there.
So his life is a demonstration of the possibility of freedom in action.
And so these Four Noble Truths also have, each one of the Four Noble Truths has an action associated with it.
So they're not just simply statements of reality in terms of the first two of how we get caught
and kind of the possibility in terms of the second two of what's possible.
But the action associated with each of the Noble Truths points to how we can practice, how we can engage.
And so the First Noble Truth, suffering should be understood.
And that understanding comes about through the Fourth Noble Truth, which is cultivating the Eightfold Path.
So the verb associated with the Fourth Noble Truth is the Eightfold Path should be cultivated, should be developed,
should be engaged with those practices, the right understanding, wise intention, wise speech, wise action,
wise livelihood, wise effort, wise mindfulness, wise concentration.
We should learn about those and engage with them.
And through the application of those tools, and a lot of what we teach here is wise effort and wise mindfulness
and wise concentration, how to settle the mind, how to observe what's going on,
how to be with our experience so that we begin to understand it as human experience.
This is the Fourth Noble Truth being applied to our experience so that we begin to understand what is suffering.
So we understand it.
And as we begin to understand it, the mind begins to kind of get an education about what's going on
and begins to recognize that this agreed aversion and delusion is something this mind is doing that's extra, that's optional,
not actually necessary to engage in the world.
And the mind actually begins to recognize it can let go of it.
And that's the Second Noble Truth, the ending of craving is to be, craving is to be abandoned.
The craving is to be abandoned.
And abandoning may sound like something we do actively.
And there are times in the path that we can consciously and do consciously set things aside, recognizing maybe not,
but letting aside is often a not acting on, not repressing and not engaging in.
So if something like anger arises, we might engage with the path by recognizing, oh, this is what's arising.
This is anger that's arising, not repressing it, but also not expressing it,
opening to it in a new way with this practice of mindfulness.
What is the human experience of anger?
That shift from kind of being interested in what I'm angry at, how I can fix it, how I can change it.
How can I fix the world so that I don't have that thing, so that I don't have to be angry?
That's often our approach.
That this mindfulness brings a different kind of perspective which explores, what is this experience?
And I'm turning away from what we are reacting to towards the experience of the reactivity itself.
That's a whole different relationship.
And initially does perhaps take us some trust to have confidence that that's useful.
And so the abandoning here might be picking up the trust that it's useful neither to repress nor express.
The abandoning of our usual habit around reactivity, which is often either repression or expression,
and instead opening to, this is the experience.
That is the action associated with the Second Noble Truth,
that abandonment of our usual reactive approach to greed, aversion, delusion.
And then this Third Noble Truth, the action associated with that, is that it is meant to be realized.
So realizing the ending of craving.
The descriptions that I made there, I read earlier,
that's a description of the mind that is fully released, fully let go,
fully realized, this ending of craving at very deep levels.
It's like there are layers and layers and layers of craving.
It's woven through pretty much how we engage with all parts of our experience.
And it is humbling to see just how deep it is.
And yet there are, through the practices, as we engage with mindfulness,
as we have this curiosity to turn towards the experience of suffering
instead of our usual reactivity about it.
But what is this? This is a human experience.
It's a different approach, and the recognition of it as human experience
is also supportive in that we realize it's not personal when we're suffering.
It is the human condition that we are struggling and suffering.
And so in some ways it connects us as we turn and bring our mindfulness to our struggles, our reactivity.
For me at one early way this was expressed, I was noticing a lot of anger.
And in the exploration of it began to see some of the underpinnings, undercurrents of the anger
and some of the beliefs underneath it.
And at one point realized that the anger, this particular anger about a particular person in one situation,
that there was a kind of a wish or an urge in me that the other person be miserable because of my anger.
That that was the wish, that that other person be in pain.
And in seeing that, that was kind of humbling to recognize, wow, that is in this mind.
But in that moment it was much more recognizing, this is a human experience.
And the mind in some way kind of extrapolated to no wonder there's war.
This is not just about me, this pattern of when we've been hurt to want to lash out.
This is a human pattern.
And it's the seeds of war.
Right in here, in me, in this being, this is the seeds of war.
And so that to me was an inspiration to look internally, to begin to explore what might be possible to let go of.
And so this realizing the ending of suffering, there's certain ways that we get little taste of it as we practice.
Maybe just a little tiny taste at first.
Little recognitions of, as I said earlier, the possibility of being with something unpleasant.
And recognizing that the anger or the aversion to that unpleasant experience.
The first thing we might notice is that we can actually be okay that there is something unpleasant and that we don't like it.
And that there's a kind of a bigger container that can hold that.
Oh, this is aversion happening.
There's something unpleasant and I don't like it.
I really don't like it.
But the mind can hold that.
And instead of having this movement to try to fix it or change it in the moment.
We can be a little curious about the not liking.
And there's a different experience there that happens.
We're no longer quite so hooked by the aversion and can hold it.
And so that's a little taste of freedom.
Because that aversion or that desire, often it feels like it has to be expressed in order for us to be okay.
And yet one of the first learnings is that, well actually, it's okay to be with this anger right now.
And it may even begin to help us to tease apart which parts of the situation.
This is one of the benefits of being present with our experience as human experience.
Because when there is something like reactivity, some pieces of that reactivity are our reactivity.
It's our hatred of a situation or are not accepting of what's actually happened.
And some pieces of it are expressive of the wish to be happy and healthy and safe.
And so the mindfulness of holding the reactive pattern can begin to help us to see,
well what parts of this experience are about discernment and wisdom
and the need to take action in an unjust situation or the need to protect my well-being.
And which parts of it are about hatred and anger.
And so the mindfulness begins to tease apart, help tease apart those pieces of the reactivity,
allowing us to, in that non-reactivity, in that holding of that reactivity,
begins to help us to tease apart the pieces of that reactivity, supporting us to begin to engage in a new way.
And this may be one way that, one of the first ways that we feel a little shift in our practice,
a little taste of the freedom, is that we can hold our own reactivity
and just recognize, oh, this is what's happening, aversion is arising.
And then there may even be a deeper kind of letting go in which we are knowing
that there's something really unpleasant happening and we know it as unpleasant.
And we are not reacting to it.
It's just like, oh wow, that's unpleasant.
Yeah, that's the condition, that's what's happening.
And what's a skillful response to that?
So that the skillful response becomes predominant rather than the reactive response.
And so this is another flavor of tasting, a little bit of that letting go.
We, in moments, at times, may see the mind release,
that third realizing the release from suffering.
So sometimes it feels like that, that the mind just lets go of a reactivity,
and realizes, yeah, don't need to go there.
It actually uses up a lot of brain cycles to be reactive that might be employed
in the discernment and wisdom and love and compassion to respond.
And so we begin to see that release, maybe in small ways, just a little taste of that.
And these little tastes of release are kind of, they point us in the direction of this fuller release.
Something about those tastes helps the mind to recognize.
And at least for me, it was kind of like this, it's like, yeah, this is useful.
It's helpful to engage in this path because the mind is so much more able to navigate the world
without being tied up in knots.
And so these little tastes give us the flavor of the direction.
It's kind of like they become a little bit of a guide, of a signpost of something that says this way, this way.
And partly this way, the feeling of this way is because the shift that happens when we feel those releases
is so palpably more in the direction of well-being than the experience of being all tied up in knots with reactivity.
When we turn towards the reactivity with mindfulness, we feel the tied up in knotness about it.
We feel that. We feel that it's not well-being to be tied up in knots.
And as those knots begin to loosen and release, the feeling of that release.
The system, our system knows. We don't have to tell ourselves, oh, this is useful.
It's like our system says, yes, this direction, this is helpful.
And so we begin to get the flavor, a little flavor of that.
And the direction, because we've tasted it, it begins to pull us in that direction.
And then kind of a deeper, almost release, it's not so much release as it is not picking up.
At a certain point, the freedom that we experience isn't about seeing a letting go happen,
but more about seeing it's not worth picking up that craving.
That the mind comes into a new relationship with experience and realizes,
yeah, that holding on, that pushing away is that tying up in knots is just not useful.
And so over time, we might begin to recognize that we're not picking up suffering that we used to do.
And sometimes we might notice this in retrospect.
Over the course of years, the Dalai Lama actually encouraged us to review our practice
not day to day, but more in five-year increments and reflecting.
What has happened over these years?
Can you remember, recognize where you were five years ago,
or whenever you started practicing, what has happened, what has shifted?
Some of the shifts that happen, we don't necessarily see moment to moment the change that happens.
There's a gradual change, a gradual releasing, a gradual letting go, and a gradual not picking up.
And the Buddha used this gradual analogy a lot.
He pointed to this path as being a gradual path.
He gave an analogy about a carpenter who picks up the same tool
and holds it in their hand the same way every day.
And that gradually, if I were to pick up this bell, this striker,
pick up this bell striker 70, 80 times a day, eventually there would be little grooves.
Just very little grooves.
When we put on our shoes, shoes are a good example, because you wear shoes,
and the first time you put them on, if they're those shoes, those kind of shoes,
the flip-flops or the house shoes that originally they don't have a left and right,
but you put them on and not very long, you can tell the left and right of them
because your foot has kind of stretched the little places of it.
And likewise, the Buddha uses this analogy of the handle
and that each day the carpenter picks up the tool and a little bit of the handle
gets worn away by the placement of the hand.
And each day you're not going to notice how much has worn away.
But after five years, ten years, the carpenter picking up the tool
will have a sense of where the hand fits in that tool
and understand that there has been a wearing away.
And this is the gradualness of the wearing away that the Buddha points to.
So the most of the way our path unfolds isn't about big like mind-blowing insights.
Some of those happen at times.
I can probably count on two hands the number of those that I've experienced.
The really, the big kind of shocking mind-blowing kind of insights.
But the vast majority of the freedom that we experience is really, really gradual.
And we might not know what is happening while it's happening.
It might be known in retrospect.
So we have a couple minutes if there's any comments or questions about anything shared.
Yeah, and would you pass the mic back, Bill?
And there's a button on the side.
Thank you, Andrea.
My name is Ek.
Today I felt very happy because one of my doubt was cleared and cleared in a very good way.
The word you have explained, nirvana, which in Sanskrit means nirvana.
And in Punjabi we use this word, my language, first is Punjabi.
So first I will tell you the doubt around this word was,
I always found people talking about we achieve something.
This is something is a different kind of state.
Even though we use this in our daily language word,
but still I wasn't able to relate that word.
So I will tell you when we use this word in our daily language.
So the first time I heard this word saying,
I'm a grandfather, when one of our cows was holding with a wooden holding
and tied with a rope and she ran away.
And my grandfather said nirvana, nirvana.
And the second time I heard this word from in our again language,
the birds was trying to free themselves from a kind of holding around them,
a kind of net around them.
But when a bird found away, this said nirvana.
Freedom, release.
So it is a release. It is not something we should achieve.
It is not something a state.
So now I understood that this is absolutely related to...
Yes.
And so I was never able to tell someone that this is the word we use in our language.
What you are saying is enlightenment.
It is just a release.
Yes.
If something is holding you and you got released, that is nirvana.
Yes, exactly.
We are tied by the betters, by the bounds of greed, aversion and delusion.
And the other piece I love about this too is that my sense of the word is that
it is natural for beings to move in that direction of release.
And my understanding of it being cooling too,
like if you put something that has been hot and just set it down,
it is going to cool.
It is going to release that.
So this direction is kind of very natural when we begin to get the understanding
of how we are tied in knots.
Just as the bird of course will try to free itself.
Beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you for sharing that.
I feel wonderful.
And it is time to stop.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
Thank you.
