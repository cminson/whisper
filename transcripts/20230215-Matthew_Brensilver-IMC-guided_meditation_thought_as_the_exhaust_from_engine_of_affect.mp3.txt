 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay. Welcome. Welcome, folks. Appreciate seeing your names over there. Yeah, welcome to the 8 a.m. session here. I thought Gil and I made a mistake, but actually, 8 o'clock is a more dignified time for me to speak. And so, yeah, you all are benefiting from the pharmacodynamics of caffeine, better profile, and I am awake. So let's sit together. Just attuning. Attuning to the present. Attuning to the present in the way we might attune to another human being in front of us. To attune to another human being is to cultivate empathy. To clarify the landscape, the inner landscape of the other, that's attunement. To be responsive to the inner landscape of the other. And of course, meditation is a kind of self-directed empathy, attunement. To be responsive to the other. To be responsive to the other. To be responsive to the other. To be responsive to the other. Of emotion that calls out for its objects. Of a surge of a feeling in the body affect. And then the kind of interpretation of what it means for this moment, what it means for my life. For what I must have, what I must rid myself of. So much of our thinking, proliferation, is like smoke rising off of the earth. Off of the engine of affect. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to do this some of the time. But fatiguing for our heart to do it all the time. As the energies of our body surge and swell and bloom and collapse. We're practicing not over interpreting any of it. Not making it mean too much. Treating all of the urgency that our feeling life creates as a kind of false alarm. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For so long we've made our feeling affect me in so much, so many things. So many objects born of that feeling, so many plans and strategies. Of acquisition, of removal. But now our feeling, our affect, means one thing. Soft. Soft. Soft. Soft. Soft. Soft. Soft. Soft. Soft. Soft.
