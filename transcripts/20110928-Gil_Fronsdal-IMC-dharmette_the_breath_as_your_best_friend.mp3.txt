Dharmette : The Breath as Your Best 
Friend

One of the most helpful aspects of our life in meditation 
and outside of meditation is our own breathing. This is 
so much so that I like to think you want to make your 
breath your best friend or your teacher. If you want to 
have a really reliable spiritual  teacher, you don’t have to 
look much further away than your own breathing. If you 
want to find a really reliable support , you can find it in 
your own breathing. If you want to find a really reliable 
healer, you can find it in your own breathing. If you wa nt 
to find a way to  lubricate your life, you’ll find it in your 
breathing. If you want to have access to wisdom, you’ll 
find it in your breathing.  
 
Breathing is a great thing. It’s recognized in many 
cultures and spiritual traditions that the breath is a pretty 
special thing. There are many  words for breath that are 
quite significant. Buddhism has that. In fact the heart of 
much of Buddhist meditation is often meditation on 
breathing. One of the reasons why breathing is so 
significant is that it’s not just  a mechanical thing. It’s not 
just a matter of getting o xygen in and carbon dioxide out, doing  that efficiently , and that’s breathing . 
Breathing is deeply c onnected to our emotional life, 
motivational  life – what we’re motivated by and 
interested in  – and our physical and bodily life. 
Breathing  is the nexus, the meeting place of so many 
different aspects  of our inner life and sometimes of our 
outer life as well. You can feel and see sometimes how 
your breathing changes depending upon  what is going 
on in  the environment. Maybe it’s happening through 
the filter of your reaction to what’s going on in the 
environment. Even with something as simple as you’re 
walking in the sun , and then you come to the shade . 
And in the shade  you can sometimes feel a change that 
comes  over you  now that  you’re in the shade. It’s as 
subtle as that if you’re paying attention. Or you’re 
walking down the street , and suddenly someone starts 
walking towards  you. You  can feel your breathing 
change , becaus e perhaps the person is scary or 
attractive.  
 
Strong emotions have a big impact on how we breath e. 
If you get really angry , then you tend to b reathe much 
more in the chest, and  you don’t breathe out as much or 
as fully. Sometimes if we’re scared , it affect s our 
emotions in different way s. Love and compassion affect 
breathing differently . The breath can get held depending 
upon the relationships and attitudes that we have 
towards what ’s going  on. Sometimes it gets held in 
different parts of the body , such as the chest, the diaphragm,  or the belly. As you’re breathing, y ou can 
sometimes feel how the breath is being interfered with.  
 
I use the breath a lot. I try to pay attention to my breath 
throughout much of the day. I try to make it a regular , 
constant companion. Sometimes it’s the first indication I 
have th at something needs attention, like I feel my 
stomach get a little bit tight because I’m aware of what’s 
going  on in my belly as I breathe. It can be an early 
warning system  where you quickly  notice the physical 
change . I can notice a physical change faster than I can 
a mental change , because the mind is so tricky and fast.  
 
Watching  the changes in the body as you breath e can 
reveal a lot of what’s going on for you and what your 
relationship  is to the world. If we breath e consciously  
and with mindfulness  – even if we don’t try to change 
our breath  – the fact that we’re aware of what’s 
happening to our breath tends to lessen a little bit the 
full impact of the holding or reactivity  we may have.  
We’re not quite as caught in the reactivity  if we’re aware 
of the tension or the holding, or whatever’s going on 
with the breathing.  
 
If there is holding, tension or limitations in how you’re  
breathing, then just breathe into that sense of limitation 
in the chest  or the belly . Just  breathe into it like you’re 
massaging it. Don’t expect the tension to go away,  
because expectation gets in the way. If you just breathe in and out, in and out, it can be comforting and settling. 
Eventually something can give.  
 
Staying in touch with your breathing as you go into 
difficult situations can provide protection from getting 
caught up in the reactions , emotions  and ideas that 
might kick in. By having the breathing as a companion , 
part of your attention stays  in the present moment ; it 
stays  on something more neutral. Because  you’re 
grounded there, you have an anchor. You’re  less likely 
to be pulled off and get lost in your thoughts, reactions  
and emotions  in what’s going on around you. It’s like 
ballast  that keeps you grounded, keeps you in the 
present moment, and keeps you from spinning out. The 
more  likely  the tendency is for you to spin out in 
situations , the more useful it is to just keep breathing. 
There are some  times when  breathing is like a lifeline. 
You can hold onto it for dear life , because the spinning -
out mind is so incredibly powerful that if you don’t have 
a lifeline , watch ou t world ! You’re coming , and  you’ll say 
and do things that later you may regret.  
 
Breathing  in a regular mindful way tends to be relaxing. 
If you’re tense, frightened or in a lot of pain, many times 
the advice  you’re given is to breathe deeply. A friend of 
mine fell off the roof at Green Gulch and broke his arm. 
The fire department came to take him to the hospital. 
While he was lying there in pain, a big firefighter came 
over. Now this was Green Gulch, a Zen Ce nter, and my friend had been a Zen student for years. The firefighter 
said, “Just breathe.” [Laughter .] My friend rolled his 
eyes. I thought that was a good sign. It’s a common 
thing to just breathe.  
 
It can be hard to feel like it’s okay or warranted to j ust 
stay with your breathing. I mean : we have really 
important things going on in our life, right? We have 
really important emotions, reactions and stories to get 
involved in or be impacted  by or overwhelmed  by. “You 
can’t believe what I’m about to be over whelmed by. This 
is really juicy or important. I can’t do this breath thing . 
Breath  is kind of silly. It’s a little physiological thing 
going in and out . It can’t be as important as a life event. ” 
But I think that what’s important is not necessarily 
breath ing. What’s import ant is the mind that stays open, 
relaxed  and grounded , not caught by what goes on. 
Breathing, staying in the present for the breath , is one of 
those tools  or assistants th at keeps us from getting 
caught, lost or reactive. It keeps us a little bit more 
relaxed and present in different  situations.  The breath 
can teach us what’s going on. It can be a grounding and 
relaxing phenomenon.  
 
Breathing can  also connect us to other people. There  
are times when you can tune in  not only to your ow n 
breath, but to other people’s breath , and breathe 
together with them. You want to be careful when and 
how you do this, because it can be  a little invasive, especially if they notice you doing it. The situation 
where I learned this to be  most effective was when I 
with someone who was dying. We couldn’t  talk, or 
maybe there was  no more conversation to be had. But 
tuning into their breathing and perhaps breathing with 
them seemed to create an intimate connection with 
them . I don’t know if it really did. But there  is something 
very tender  – a feeling of being very present and 
involved – when I’m with someone who is dying and I’m 
tuning into and breathing with their breath. I don’t know 
how much they’re affected by it, but it  feels to me like 
there is an impact. I’ve also done it sometimes when 
people have been in distress. Again I’m not sure what 
the impact is, but I have the sense that somehow 
something in them tunes into the fact that there is some 
harmony or attunement goi ng on. There is a coming 
together in the rhythm of breathing at the same time. So 
when people are very much in distress, it’s one of the 
things we can do for them.  
 
The last thing I want to say about breathing  – paying 
attention to the breath, being connected to the breath  – 
is that people can have attitudes about life  that are in 
the background or at the foundation  that they carry with 
them into everything they do. They’re not so conscious 
of these attitudes . It’s not like they’re thinking about 
them . In fact , consciously , the main thing going on hides 
the fact that in the background of what they’re thinking 
is an attitude, policy or orientation that’s always there. For example , there might be an orientation : “I can never 
get enough in life; I’m always deprived.” Or there m ight 
be: “I need everything I have ; I can’t let anything go 
because it’s frightening to let things go. ” Or it could be : 
“Life is too much ; it’s too oppressive. It’s always  coming 
at me . Just leave me alone .” There are a whole sl ew of 
these kinds of attitud es. 
 
If you get really quiet in meditation and tune into your 
breathing , occasionally you can see how these attitudes 
play out in subtle ways with your relationship to the 
breath. People  who might feel that they can’t get 
enough sometimes  are really eager to breath e in. They 
might not allow themselves to breath e out all the way , 
because they’re so quick to want to breath e in again . Or 
people who don’t want to give up anything breath e in, 
but then they don’t want to breath e out – there is a little 
holding go ing on. Or people who are afraid or think that 
it’s scary to be out of control don’t want to breath e out 
all the way. So at the end of the out -breath , there is kind 
of a hesitation, an unwillingness to breath e out all the 
way. Sometimes people space out and get involved in 
thoughts at that point. Sometimes they don’t let 
themselves breath e out all the way , because it’s too 
frightening. And then there are  people for whom  life is 
too much  and want to be left  alone . They  can breath e 
out just fine , but they don’t want to breath e in. Their 
attitude is “ Don’t bring any of this on. This is  oppressive 
to have to breathe.” It might seem kind of bizarre to think that these kind s of attitudes are there in the 
breath. But I’ve seen often enou gh on retreats , 
especially if people  get quiet and subtle enough and 
they’re paying attention to the breath , and – lo and 
behold – there is something going on  at some point in 
the cycle of breathing in and out. It points to some of the 
subtle background at titudes that people carry with them. 
The fact that it’s subtle and in the background doesn’t 
mean that it’s unimportant. Sometimes it’s at the 
foundation or cornerstone upon  which everything else is 
built.  
 
I’ll say one more thing. The breath can bring a 
tremend ous amount of pleasure, delight  and 
satisfaction . Just tune into the breath and have the 
breath be relaxed and open. Really be there with it. The 
analogy I’ve been using lately is that staying with the 
rhythm of the breath is like stroking a cat , and the 
pleasure is like the cat purring. So at some point , you 
start purring.  
 
Enjoy your breathing.
