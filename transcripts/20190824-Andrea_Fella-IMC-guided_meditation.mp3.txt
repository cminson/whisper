So, again, finding a posture that feels relatively comfortable. 
And supporting the practice with relaxation, softening the muscles of the body, seeing if there can be some ease, some physical ease, as much as is possible. 
And checking in if there's tension anywhere. 
Can it be softened, relaxed? And maybe checking in internally. 
Sometimes I find this to be a real supportive check-in that can help the body to relax if I check in. 
Maybe the inside of the throat can soften and relax. 
Maybe the heart can relax the stomach and the intestines. 
Maybe they can relax. 
And maybe the mind can relax. 
Perhaps using that analogy of relaxing the brain. 
And now there is some measure of physical and mental relaxation. 
Noticing, is there awareness? Are you aware? The simplest of ways. 
Acknowledging. 
Aware. 
And what are you aware of? Maybe physical sensation, sound or sight. 
Maybe thoughts or emotions. 
What's the next thing? That's obvious. 
Whatever arises, whatever comes into our mental and physical experience, into our heart. 
Exploring. 
Aware of that. 
Aware of moods, emotions, memories, associations, thoughts. 
Are you aware? Relax and receive. 
Whatever is most obvious. 
Every now and then checking in with how you are in relationship to what is happening. 
Maybe there's okayness. 
And what does okayness feel like? Sometimes okayness can feel like calm or ease or intimacy or interest, curiosity. 
Are you aware? What is obvious? And the mind will wander. 
It will get lost. 
While you are lost, there is not much to do about it. 
That moment when mindfulness returns, it will happen. 
Just as the mind will wander, that mindfulness will return at some point. 
And in that moment, curiosity about that experience of mindfulness returning. 
This is awareness. 
And what is obvious? Has the mind been affected by the thoughts, the being lost, the wandering? That is the most, that's the closest thing for us in that moment. 
What is actually here is usually some effect that the wandering has had on us. 
How are you in this moment? If it's helpful after the mind has wandered, you might explore connecting with relaxation again, connecting with relaxing the body, softening the tension, remembering that that's supportive for this investigation, this curiosity about our human experience with mindfulness. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
So now it's time for our afternoon, our meal. 
And we'll have an hour for this. 
We'll have until 1. 
30. 
So those of you who are familiar with IMC, you could pull out a couple of tables in the community hall and some chairs. 
Those of you who know where the tables and chairs are, you're welcome to set them up. 
You're also welcome to eat outside. 
There are some chairs in the cabinet just on the other side of the meditation hall, just outside the meditation hall, some folding chairs. 
You're welcome to take those outside if you wish. 
Just please bring them back in at the end and put them back in the cabinets. 
This is in silence. 
The meal will be in silence. 
The practice is the same. 
Can you be aware while preparing your meal? Can you be aware while eating? Just exploring that possibility of aware of what? And noticing just this flow. 
There's a flow of many different experiences, many sensations, particularly while eating. 
There's taste and smell that come into our experience. 
And so noticing that, the attention may shift from seeing, to smelling, to tasting, to seeing, to feeling. 
So again, just exploring what? Are you knowing? What are you noticing? So we'll come back. 
I'll ring the bell at about 1. 
20 so that we can clear up the tables, have time to get your meals put away. 
So we'll be back at 1. 
30. 
Thank you. 
There are some local places to eat. 
If you need information about where you might get a meal, if you didn't bring a meal, you can come up and ask me. 
Thank you.
