 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Over the last weeks we've been exploring the teaching on the aggregates, and in particular coming in through the direction of the Satipatanasuta, exploring the fourth foundation. In the Satipatanasuta we are encouraged to recognize the aggregates, recognize the five, we could call them processes of body and mind, that weave together really to create a moment of experience, moments of experience. The Buddha talked about these five processes as being pretty much what is happening in the present moment, the processes of our body and mind that are happening to create our experience and that have been created by our experience. So they're both shaped by what has happened and are the shaping of what is to come. So these five processes are the body, bodily experience, and then four processes of mind, feeling the experience of whether something is pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant nor unpleasant, perception, the recognizing function of our minds, the function of our minds that in meeting the world, organizes or recognizes it based on memory, based on what we have experienced, the recognition of objects in the world, that we recognize people, that we recognize walls and couches and carpets and floors, instead of just having it be a pastiche of pixels coming into the eye, that we recognize objects. That's a process of perception at work, a mental function that puts together and makes sense of our world in many ways. It's a useful, really useful process of our minds. So feeling, perception, mental formation, which is the kind of the responding part of our minds, the part of our minds that relates to experience, responds to experience, and reacts to experience. These processes also shape our experience. So as we respond to experience or react to experience, if we react to experience with a reactivity of aversion or confusion, that tends to shape more aversion and confusion in our minds, as the Buddha is famously said to have said, whatever the mind frequently ponders, that becomes the inclination of the mind. And so these mental formations are that active part of the mind that is responding and deciding, choosing. It's got a volitional component to it, this mental formation, asda. And then the fourth mental aggregate, so one aggregate of body and four mental aggregates. The fourth mental aggregate is consciousness. Really, it's a very simple, at least in the suttas, it's described as a really simple process that apprehends experience at a Sun Store. So it's said that there are six kinds of consciousness. Seeing consciousness, smelling consciousness, taste consciousness, touch consciousness, tongue consciousness and mind consciousness. So the sensory apparatus that our body has, the five physical senses, and then plus the sense door of the mind, that there is the Buddhist psychology says that there is a knowing, a kind of apprehension at a sense door that something has contacted the sense door. It's kind of like a doorbell at a sense door. Like, yep, there's been a sight, there's been a sound, there's been a smell, a taste, a touch, or something happening in the mind. One of my teachers, Sayadaw Utejaniyeh, says that this function of knowing, he says it's a little bit stupid. It doesn't recognize the experience, that's the job of perception. It doesn't feel, it doesn't have the quality of the pleasant and pleasant or neutral, that's the job of feeling. So it knows, it's a really simple kind of quality, just a simple knowing of experience. Every single moment of experience, whatever's happening day or night, unless perhaps you're in some kind of a surgery where they have given you an anesthesia. I mean, it's possible, I think, with certain kinds of anesthesia to stop consciousness. And I had an experience of that at one point, coming out of a surgery like that. It was so strange, the experience, where, you know, I remember I was having surgery on my knee, and because there's all these reflexes in the knee, they really had to put me out. They told me they were giving me some very strong anesthesia. And so, you know, I remember, what I remember is the moment when they said, okay, we're going to give you the anesthesia now. And I felt like this kind of like moving into a sleep kind of state or something, just to kind of, and it was very pleasant. I remember that it was pleasant. And then the next moment, I was waking up, and there was no sense of time between those two moments. It was like one moment in the next moment. And it was a little bit odd, you know, that sense of, you know, it's like the mind did not have any sense of consciousness at all in that time. But in most of our, in our states, whether we, you know, even when we fall asleep, even in the state of sleep, there is a form of consciousness happening, this knowing, this the Pali vinyana. Knowing is often used for the translation, consciousness used for the translation. So every single moment of experience, there is this consciousness happening, whether we're awake or not, and whether we are mindful or not. So this is a, this is an important piece to recognize that mindfulness is a different thing, or, and sometimes I use the word awareness for mindfulness. Some people use awareness for consciousness. So it's, it's often useful if you're if a teacher's using the word awareness to kind of check in and how are you using this word. Are you meaning consciousness that think you know that that process that's happening every single moment, because some people will say we are always aware. And, you know, if they're saying that they're probably meaning there's always consciousness, whether or not we are mindful. So the, the knowing quality of mind happens, every single moment, mindfulness comes and goes. And we know this, you know, we know this that when the mindfulness is gone. And actually, this is a great way to kind of reflectively understand that the consciousness is happening all the time, consciousness feeling perception mental formations going on all day long, whether we are mindful or not. If you notice that at sometimes and sometimes this can be more obvious than others. You know if the mind really wanders and kind of absorbs into something kind of really interested in something without mindfulness goes into a thought and just like is wandering in that thought and then we wake up it's like wow I have been really lost in that thought in that, in that moment, especially if you've been doing something like one time I think I told this story not too long ago, one time, a few years ago I was driving to IMC, and my mind, you know, I knew I was kind of tracking where I was and I knew I needed to turn left at a stoplight, you know, a little ways down. And, and then my mind got lost it went into some kind of a thought, and it really thoroughly got lost it, you know, normally, when my mind goes into some kind of thinking it's often got some kind of mindfulness that's still happening, but in this case, it went so thoroughly into the thought that I lost track of where I was on the road and the next time I woke up it was probably you know few hundred yards down the road past the place where I needed to turn and I was stopped at a stoplight, I came back into mindfulness and I was stopped at the stoplight I looked up at the sign and it's like, Oh, that sign says Willow Street I've missed my turn. So, so the you know so there was the re arising of the of the mindfulness in that moment and in that moment I remembered, you know, having been thinking so there was an awareness, you know, there was the kind of the recognition of what I had been thinking about. But what there was not a memory of, and what is really humbling was any awareness of the seeing. And yet, seeing was happening because I stopped at the stoplight. You know, it's like I had no recollection of any of that. So the processes of seeing of hearing probably you know they were happening. I was probably taking in the you know the cars around me. I certainly saw the stoplight and I stopped. So the, the, the mindfulness was not there at all in that in with those objects of sight of sound of touch of touching the steering wheel, not at all with that. And yet, the consciousness of them was happening. So there was the consciousness and the perception, the perception was happening the perception recognize the red light the perception understood what it meant the volitional formations acted on that perception and said yes come to a stop here. So there was a lot going on, even though mindfulness wasn't happening. So these five aggregates function. Thank goodness, they function, whether we are mindful or not. So this, the process of consciousness is this, this really simple moment to moment meeting of our sunspaces. So, with the note with understanding that awareness and consciousness are different. We can be curious about what it might mean to be mindful, or aware of the knowing aspect of experience. This is what is encouraged in the Satipatanasuta with all the aggregates it, it encourages us to recognize such is body, such is feeling, such is mental formation such as perception. Such as consciousness, just recognizing really simply, this is the way the aggregate expresses itself, how it does what it does, the process nature of it, the experience, the aggregates both do the processing of and the. So for instance feeling, feeling both feels, and it feels pleasant unpleasant and neutral. So that often the feeling tones themselves pleasant unpleasant neutral are talked about as being feeling in certain places in the suit is in the Satipatanasuta mindfulness of feeling, feeling tone, we are encouraged to recognize pleasant unpleasant neutral experience. So the aggregates are both, we're both encouraged to notice that the process nature of these experiences, feeling feels, knowing knows, and what they feel what they know. So knowing knows the five, the six sense spaces, knowing no sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, things happening in the mind. So, to explore to begin to get interested in the knowing side of experience you know the knowing side of experience. I say this is probably the subtlest of the aggregates in terms of beginning to recognize it. Because and partly because it is so woven through every single moment of experience. It's kind of like the, the, the water that a fish swims in that not not recognizing it. It's, it's so ubiquitous, this knowing aspect that we kind of don't even see that it's there. It's a possible way, a possible way to begin to explore and you can potentially know in this moment just as a kind of a little meditation exercise in a way. Just right now, as you're sitting here. What's most obvious to you what experiences most obvious so whatever it is a body sensation my sound of my voice. Some feeling in the body. Just whatever is most obvious you can recognize that some vibration or hearing. So that object that experience. There's a quality to that experience you know if it's a physical sensation maybe there's a, and just as I touch my hands together like this my hands are a little moist so there's a stickiness so there's sticky, sticky quality. Hard, that kind of thing. So there's that quality to the experience or hearing you might notice kind of the pitch and tone of my voice or some, some things about, you know, the, the experience of hearing. So there's that side of the experience the, the experience side of the experience what we could call the object side of the experience. Every experience there's that object. And then there's the knowing of it. They come together. Every moment, experience and object site object site and knowing of it, hearing and knowing of it. Smelling and knowing of it. And so whatever is the most obvious experience for you right now. And I'm noticing okay yep body sensation site hearing. And then you might explore or just add in the little kind of reminder or it's just a little kind of wisdom pointing almost is known. Hearing is known. Sensations are known. Maybe a mind state or a thought is known. And that might or can begin to support the mind to be a little curious about the knowing side of the experience. And that tees apart the knowing from the object and just like just purely know the knowing we know the knowing or awareness recognizes the knowing through the meeting of an object. They come together. Normally our habit our what we've been taught actually what we've been taught through our lives is that the object is what's important knowing what the object is how it feels what it does. That's where our attention naturally gravitate. So in that side of this if this hand represents the object of the experience. We're mostly interested in the object. The knowing side of it is mostly just ignored. You know the knowing is is seen just as kind of like the. I mean maybe it's just like the way by which I know this thing. And so not important. What's important is the knowing of the thing. But the possibility exists. It's almost like with mindfulness mindfulness. Now my head represents mindfulness mindfulness can look at the experience from this side. Oh that's the experience of the of the object. That's the seeing. That's the hearing. Or it can kind of look from this side. Oh that's the knowing. Seeing is known. Knowing is happening. It's not like the object disappears with that knowing but it's just a little shift where there's that kind of recognition or understanding that there's this process by which the object is known. One way I think the earliest way for me that it became clear that the mind was actually making that shift. I was I was exploring working with a version in one sitting. This is so interesting when we have these really clear understandings even as I say this it's like I remember exactly where I was. You know the meditation is like it's right here. It's so interesting. Remember where I was in the in the in the house and what was happening. So it's kind of cool the way these insights just land in the mind sometimes. So I was meditating and observing getting to know a version exploring a version and I probably had heard this instruction and it arose in my mind. I don't remember why the mind decided to do this but it shifted from kind of noticing. Oh this is a version. This is the experience of a version. And the experience of a version has some unpleasant qualities to it. There was the noticing or the recognition of the tightness in the mind. The kind of the ripple effect of that tightness through the body. So there was unpleasantness happening. And that was a key piece of what I was recognizing that there's a version happening and unpleasantness is happening. So feeling tone was a big part of what the mind was noticing with respect to the version. And then the mind kind of shifted to recognizing a version is happening and a version is being known. A version is known. So that shift from oh this is the experience of a version. And this is a version is known. The main shift, the kind of the shift in the experience there was the feeling tone shifted from unpleasant to neutral with that shift of oh this is the knowing. Knowing a version is happening. And that was so interesting to me and it kind of pointed to that the knowing quality is a neutral quality. I even went and described this to my teacher. It's like I said you know the version is unpleasant but the knowing of it is neutral. My teacher agreed. Yes that is true. And so that that experience or that kind of exploration can begin to help the mind to understand what it means to connect with the knowing. For me it was a little bit harder to know that I was with the knowing. Initially it was harder at the beginning when I was just beginning to get familiar with the experience of knowing. And it was harder to recognize that I was harder to know the difference or to really have a sense of yes I know that I'm aware of the knowing of seeing as opposed to the seeing when there wasn't much in the way of feeling tone going on. You know when it was a pretty neutral experience the shift wasn't as clear to me and so it took some time to begin to understand or get a sense of oh that kind of quality of and this is just some language to describe ways that I've experienced this. You know it's hard to describe I think what the experience of knowing is but it's it kind of just feels like an infusing of it's like it's like a light comes on. There's the quality of light that allows us to know and experience. Like if the room is completely dark you're not going to see any objects and the light comes on there are objects so it's kind of that quality of light of illumination. And that kind of meaningful awareness and consciousness that consciousness quality illuminates the experience and now again so there's there's a little bit of confusion perhaps with awareness and consciousness. And so for example of my stopping at that stoplight without seeing it consciousness was illuminating the red light you know the consciousness was illuminating the seeing, even though I was not illuminated by that. You know, so the mindfulness wasn't there. And yet still there was that that the site was the mind received that site and knew what to do with it with perception with feeling knew what to do with it. So it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a subtle experience. And yet one that we can start to get familiar with know why, why is it useful to get familiar with this kind of subtle experience. Part of the value of getting familiar with them is that we tend to cling to them, and particularly create a sense of self around each of them. So with body we be quinolio points out you know we tend to identify the body as being where I am. As being how I am. Perception as being what I am experiencing mental formations as why I am doing things and consciousness as kind of the whereby experience happens or whereby experience arises. So I think the self in the first four little more kind of tangible in a way, you know, the body is where I am feelings how I am perception what I am experiencing mental formations why I'm acting the consciousness. I think the consciousness the way we identify with consciousness is a subtler kind of identification but it's very potent. And you might, you know, the, the teachings on not self point to. When the Buddha points to different ways that we identify. In a simple way he explores a three part identification. This is mine. This is who I am. This is me, this is myself, this is me. So the, the, this is mine, the kind of the ownership that connected to objects in the world connected to a sense of control perhaps. This is who I am. I think of that kind of the agent of experience, the, especially around the mental formations the, the part of the mind that decides chooses acts does things. The, this is me, more of a sense of, at least in my, my understanding of this. This is not particularly described in the suttas but this three this way this three part way of understanding it has been very useful for me. And that third one, this is me, and the language here, you know that this is who I am this is, this is who I am and this is me, the difference between the I being the subject of the sentence or the object of the sentence. So the I in the subject of the sentence being the actor, the actor, the object of the sentence being the receiver of the action. The, this is me. It may there may be a sense in identification, you know, not of recognizing, I'm not in control of what's happening here. I'm not making this happen. But it feels like it's happening to me. That I think is a key place where that that feels like it's happening to me. And that's a key way of identifying with consciousness. This this was clear at some point in my practice where I could really see the, the conditioned nature of experience just happening. And yet there was still the sense of, it's like I could see I was not doing the seeing I was not doing the hearing I was not doing the feeling I was not doing the mental formations, but it all felt like it was happening to me. And so a very subtle kind of identification is, it's like, you know, it's like, I, that the me is the one that knows the hapless kind of being that is being impinged on by all of these sense experiences. And I think a key way that identification with consciousness happens, that sense of it's happening to me happening to me. One thing I've been bringing in in each of these weeks as we've been exploring the aggregates individually is the simile that the Buddha uses for the aggregate. And the simile that points to the empty nature of the aggregate body like foam, just bubbles collected together, feeling like a bubble floating on the surface of water perception like a mirage mental formations like a banana tree went through with the past weeks. Now the consciousness simile, he says is the consciousness is like a magician. So what does a magician do. A magician creates an illusion of something that is not there, and creates a sense of something happening. But there's something else going on behind the scenes. So that's kind of, you know, a good magician will do something to redirect your attention so that you're not paying attention to what's actually happening. So there's a delusional quality there to the magicians show, aiming your attention elsewhere. So the simile, kind of, each of these similes for the aggregates kind of points to a particular aspect of the aggregate that connects to its diluting nature. And that's the way that we tend to be confused by the aggregate and thereby tend to have a sense of self connected to it. So with the consciousness, you know, the consciousness, the simile with consciousness again the magic show simile. And that's interesting simile because it does it does bring in the sense of intelligence in the simile. The other similes are much more natural processes at work, you know, bubbles that have been created and foam and a bubble on the surface of the water and a mirage that's just a natural process that takes an observer to see it so that brings in an observer, a mirage, but the the magic show simile brings in kind of some consciousness, a conjurer, it brings in a conjurer. That's a little bit different in a way than what the way consciousness is described in the suit is just this really simple. As Sayadaw Tejaniya says almost stupid thing that just knows experience moment after moment. But the so what what to me just thinking about that conjuring nature of experience, how how the weaving together of experience creates the sense of me, the sense of me because I think that's the key. That's the key, you know, conjuring that's referred to here, the conjuring of the the mistake of a me in the consciousness. There's a kind of a way I think that when we get to get familiar with this knowing quality, we start to see that there's these six threads these six streams of knowing. There's a knowing of seeing and knowing of hearing and knowing of smelling the knowing of touch and the knowing in the mind that that kind of they all weave together. And the knowing also the suit is point to the the the knowing in the mind, you know, the, the. So the mind base. So the six sense basis, there's the knowing in the mind, the mind then also can recognize feeling and perception. So there's the knowing of feeling the knowing of perception, even, and those all weave together in a moment. And that weaving of experience to create some kind of coherence around our experience. That to me is kind of the the weaving of the conjuring that we experience. You know, I'm sitting here in this room surrounded by objects and, you know, I'm moving my head and looking around and the room itself looks pretty stable. Even though I'm moving my head and there's this like different like stuff coming into the into the eye. The room looks pretty stable and I'm seeing I see an object like looking at the wall across the way. There's a sense based probably on history. So based on perception, based on past understanding that there's not only a side of the wall, but there is, you know, an understanding of the solidity of that wall. There's almost a visceral feeling of the solidity of that wall that comes with the seeing of it. And possibly there's a connection to sound, you know, the way sound reverberates off the wall that I'm not even conscious of, you know, I'm not even actively or consciously aware of that consciousness knows. Understand something of the hardness of the wall based on the sound in the room. There's a big difference between a room that's created by walls that have solidity and a room that's created by curtains in terms of what we experience. So the weaving together of all of these experiences into a coherent whole may be part of the function of consciousness. The kind of the weaving together of all of these threads of consciousness. The weaving together of the perception and feeling along with the sense door contact and and weaving together the site and the sound and the and the concepts about it so that it has a kind of coherence to it. So, you know, if I'm if I were walking across the room quickly, you know, I would slow down as I started coming to the wall because the mind so deeply understands the concept of the hardness of that wall. So there's like, you know, the weaving of consciousness puts together not only the site but all of the prior like understandings around the hardness of the wall. It's almost like there's not a difference between the site and the knowing of the contact, the touch contact of that wall. Kind of, you know, the weaving together of all of those that we don't see, you know, that we don't see that this is a process of mind we take it to be me. I am the one experiencing these things. There's one more piece that I would like to offer it'll mean that there's not probably time for questions but it's what it feels like a useful exploration around consciousness it's and for me it was it was a really supportive way in again to recognizing the experience of the knowing. So, we often think of like when I use the light analogy, I use the light analogies analogy for knowing we often think of light as illuminating the objects. So, you know, knowing illuminates the objects. Think of we might think about you know the consciousness as being the spotlight or the search light and it finds an object and then the object is illuminated. But the object and the knowing arise together. And in a way, and maybe not just in a way, you know that the, the object can also illuminate the knowing. So, this was really brought home to me at one point through an analogy of light. I was, I was in a, in a retreat, and it was a winter retreat. It had been very cold for many days, and lots of snow had accumulated, but it had stayed below freezing for many days and so the snow hadn't melted at all. It was really fluffy snow. And then the sun came out like I think it was the fifth day, the sun came out and there was all the snow still hanging out in the trees. I was in a cabin that had a courtyard that was really shady. There wasn't, there wasn't any obvious sun in the courtyard. I looked out and it just looked like a shaded courtyard. But as the snow started to fall from the trees, I was sitting there kind of looking out in the courtyard and, and as the snow fell from the trees into the courtyard, there were patches of light of sun rays revealed as the snow fell. It was startling because there was no obvious sun in the courtyard. When this, when the snow stopped falling, I couldn't see light in the courtyard. I could see light, but I couldn't see the sun rays. I couldn't see where there might be a patch of sun. There was no sun on the ground. And then I realized, oh, there's a deck here, you know, maybe if I look over the deck. So I went outside and I looked over the edge of the deck and lo and behold, there were some areas of spots of sun under the deck. And so there were, there was some light filtering through the trees and landing on the ground there. But it was not obvious in the air. It wasn't obvious in the air until the snow fell through it and illuminated the light. So again, using the light analogy, in this case, the light was not apparent until the snow fell through it. And then the rays of light were like magically illuminated by the glistening snow. So that image became a meditation object for me or a meditation almost instruction that as I experienced, you know, a sight or a sound, it's like, yeah, oh, there's a sight. Oh, and it illuminates the knowing. There is knowing happening and that the experience of the seeing is like evidence for the knowing, like the experience of the snow, the snow falling was evidence then for the light coming through the courtyard. That disappeared, you know, the evidence of that light in the courtyard disappeared when the snow fell, you know, when there was no more snow falling through the air. But I got to watch this a bunch of times because as the sun came out and the snow started to, you know, melt, it would just drop like big hunks of snow and I would get to see this explosion of light in the middle of the air. This explosion of the sun rays in the middle of the air. That was a kind of an analogy for me. Oh, sometimes the object reveals the knowing. The object can be the pointer to the knowing. So I'll leave you with that for today.
