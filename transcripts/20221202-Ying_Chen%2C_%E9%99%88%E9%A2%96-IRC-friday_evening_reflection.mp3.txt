 I'm feeling a quiet tenderness in this room. Please soft the kindness. And tonight I want to invite you to join me for a chant. If you wish, this is a chanting of Metta, loving kindness. In a way, and these verses are the calling forth of heart's wish, heart's wish to be filled with loving kindness, to be at ease, to be peaceful, and be happy. And so if you like, you can join me. And these are rather simple phrases and simple rhythms. And I'll chant this rather slowly, and so you can join me if at some point you wish to. And for those who are online, I know it's a little challenging behind the mute buttons, but participate anyhow, and so just know that we are together doing this. And so there's a phrase that goes to something like this. May I be filled with loving kindness? May I be well? May I be peaceful and at ease? And may I be happy? And then it'll go to may you, and then may we, and then and with may all. And so I'll start if you'd like to join me. Please do so. Some of you may know this. May I be filled with loving kindness? May I be well? May I be peaceful and at ease? May I be happy? May you be filled with loving kindness? May you be well? May you be peaceful and at ease? May you be happy? May we be filled with loving kindness? May we be well? May we be peaceful and at ease? May we be happy? May I be filled with loving kindness? May I be well? May I be peaceful and at ease? May I be happy? May I be peaceful and at ease? Thank you everyone for your practice.
