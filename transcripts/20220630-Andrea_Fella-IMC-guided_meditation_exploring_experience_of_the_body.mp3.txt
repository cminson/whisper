 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome to the Often in the guided meditations for this particular sitting, this group, this group, I offer a very spacious kind of exploration of just what's obvious, just connecting to your experience and tuning into what's obvious without directing or aiming the attention too much. Today I'd like to explore a little bit around tuning into the physical realm of experience. The felt sense of the bodily experience, partly because there's, the Buddha talks about there being different processes happening in our system, processes of body, processes of mind. And it's easy for us to kind of mix these up to assume we're looking at body when actually we're kind of exploring or knowing a mental aspect of experience. And so I'd like to just start the sitting. We'll start the sitting by settling in a little bit and then begin to explore a little bit about the felt sense of the physical experience. And then we'll explore a little bit more in the reflection and discussion afterwards around this distinction between bodily experience and mental experience. And we'll start by just connecting, as we often do, with being here in this moment and connecting, if possible, with some measure of relaxation. Perhaps doing this in a kind of a systematic way, just touching in to the sensations of the head and face and seeing if there can be a softening, a relaxation of those muscles. And perhaps there can be a relaxation of the neck and shoulders, the arms and hands. Checking in to the area of the chest and upper back, seeing if there can be a softening of all of those muscles around the rib cage. Perhaps there can be a softening across the stomach and abdomen, maybe letting those muscles hang forward a little bit. That's an area where we can kind of habitually hold tension. So maybe just letting that area settle out, relax. Perhaps there can be a relaxation of the middle and lower back, the hips. Maybe the legs and feet can soften and relax. And then perhaps taking in the whole body for just a moment. And seeing perhaps if there's a way, just maybe dropping in the request, may the body relax. Not trying to do it, but just inviting the body to relax if there's something available to relax. May the body relax and then see how the body responds to that request. And perhaps too there can be a softening or relaxation inside the body. Maybe the inside of the throat can relax. Maybe the heart, the area around the heart can relax. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. And then an invitation also, perhaps the mind can relax. Maybe there can be a releasing or relaxation of mental tension, of thinking, thinking about past or future worries or concerns. Maybe just for this stretch of time there can be a settling in, a letting go. Maybe the mind can relax. With some measure of relaxation of body and mind, this relaxation really supports our capacity to be aware, to be present with our experience in the present moment. And I'd like to invite you at this point to allow the attention to kind of connect with the body, the felt sense of the body. Maybe whatever's obvious in the feeling of the body, perhaps the contact points where your body is contacting a chair, cushion, a bench, whatever you're sitting on. That contact point, those contact points, maybe you can touch into the feeling of that contact, where the feet are touching, hands are touching, hips or back are touching. You might notice a sense of weight or pressure, maybe some kind of hardness in that contact point or softness maybe. Some areas of softness, some areas of hardness. This is one flavor of our physical experience, this aspect of solidity, of weight. You might have a sense of this body sitting, resting on the earth. There might be specific areas of sensation or just a more general sense of the body, the weight of the body. Or even perhaps some sense of firmness of the structure of your skeleton, the bones that are holding the body up. There's one flavor of our physical experience, a way perhaps we could say that our body communicates with us through this aspect of solidity, weight, hardness or softness. Another aspect of the physical experience has a more element of movement. A element of movement, of dynamic, energetic quality. So perhaps you might notice around this solidity, the movement of the breath. You might notice it, the physical movement of the breath as where the body expanding chest, abdomen rising. Or you might feel a kind of a swirl of sensation coming in through your nostrils and mouth. And that's the aspect of movement, sometimes more obvious, the movement perhaps of the rib cage and the breathing. On a subtler level you might notice in various areas of your body a sense of vibration or pulsing or tingling, which can have an energetic kind of quality, like it's like the energy of our bodies expressing itself through this vibratory pulsing, tingling kind of sensation. Allowing there to be relaxation and exploring receiving the physical experience and just seeing what's available as I speak in this way of these different areas or kinds of sensations. You don't have to push any sensations away if they don't match what I'm describing. We're just open to the possibility that maybe there can be the flavor of this vibration, pulsing, tingling, maybe in a small area. You might notice it in your hands, for instance. Or maybe in a broader pervading sense through the body, you might even notice a vibratory, energetic experience, a moving dynamic quality to sensation... A third flavor of physical sensation has to do with temperature, the range of heat to coolness. So maybe this is a little subtler sometimes, depends if the temperatures are extreme, perhaps it feels obvious when we're hot or cold. So just notice if there's any particular areas where the sensation of temperature is available. Sometimes we can notice where we're breathing in. If the air around us is a little cooler, we might notice a coolness in the nostrils. Maybe just a very subtle temperature shift there and maybe a little bit of warmth on the out breath. Sometimes I find the area of my hands can have more of a sense of heat or coolness depending on the temperature of the room. Again, you don't have to look too hard for this. This is an invitation to explore some different flavors of physical sensation. Some of the others I've mentioned, the physical, the contact points, the hardness, the vibration, pulsing, tingling are easier to connect with. Just relax and receive this felt sense of the body. Perhaps recognizing these different flavors of physical experience. Another flavor of the physical sensations has to do with moisture. This might be noticed, I think easiest to notice, perhaps inside your mouth. You could take a moment and just let your tongue rub across the surface of your teeth a little bit, the back of your teeth. Notice the slipperiness there. The quality of slipperiness is related to moisture. Moisture can be, this sensation of moisture can be more obvious if we have tears or perspiration. It's easier to notice independence on some of the other sensations. The tongue touching the teeth, for instance. With the tongue touching the teeth, you might be aware of the hardness of the teeth. The hardness is revealed through the movement or the pressure of the tongue against the teeth. That's movement revealing the hardness. And then the movement across the surface of the teeth, the slipperiness there. Both the hardness and the movement are supporting the recognition or the experience of the slipperiness. Relax and connect with this physical, very sensitive organism that receives so many different kinds of sensations. Maybe touching into the sensitivity of the body as you sit, as you breathe. Relax and let this sensitive body show you what it's experiencing. Letting go now of the active exploration of the various areas and just settling back, receiving how this sensitive body is meeting the world through these sensations. Relax and let this sensitive body show you what it's experiencing. Relax and let this sensitive body show you what it's experiencing. Relax and let this sensitive body show you what it's experiencing. Relax and let this sensitive body show you what it's experiencing. Relax and let this sensitive body show you what it's experiencing. Relax and let this sensitive body show you what it's experiencing. You might also notice that some of these sensations are pleasant and some are unpleasant. You might notice that you like pleasant ones and don't like unpleasant ones. These aspects, the pleasantness, the unpleasantness, the liking, the not liking, this is the mind's quirk. The pleasantness and unpleasantness is a mental experience. The liking and not liking a response to that. And so perhaps you may be able to tease apart or notice a difference between a sensation of tingling, pulsing, hardness, softness, and whether that sensation is pleasant or unpleasant. And whether there's a liking or not liking. Maybe just a little bit of curiosity about what is the physical experience and how is the mind in relationship to that physical experience. You may also notice that some of these sensations are pleasant and pleasant. Again, relax, settle back. This is more of an invitation than a directing of the attention, just receiving what's available in this physical body with a little bit of curiosity about how the mind is in relationship to it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
