Dharmette: Seeing Yourself as Whole  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

Two of you came to interviews  today  and mentioned the 
instructions I gave in the morning about letting go of 
thinking , and how t hat instruction  just made things 
worse. Somehow the thinki ng mind didn’t like  to hear 
that, and so it thought harder.  That’s certainly possible . 
So, letting go of thoughts in that active, directed way 
may sometimes not be very useful .  
 
Or, it could be an opportunity to see and understand  
more deeply something about the reactive mind, the 
threatened mind , and the judgments that go into  doing a 
practic e like  this – how we get  stirred up, rather than 
becoming more still or  quiet. I n case there were others 
of you who were stirred  up rather than settle d, you had 
company . Hopefully , someday  it will  be useful to know 
how to let go of thoughts.  
 
The subject  I want to talk about today  is how most of us 
have a particul ar way of looking at and underst anding 
ourselves. There are many ways of understanding 
oneself . An interesting question  is, “With what eyes – 
with what understanding – do you tend to see y ourself ?” 
Many times the understanding with which you understand yourself can be a tremendous source of 
suffering . So, a re there other  ways of understanding 
yourself, other ways of seeing or regarding yourself  that 
don’t cause suffering? Are there other wa ys that not 
only don’t cause suf fering , but perhaps bring you a 
sense of ease , happiness , satisfactio n, or 
meaningfulness?   
 
Sometimes I’ve  practiced with the question, “ What 
would it be like if I were seen through the eyes of the 
Buddha? ” Or, “If I had the eyes of the Buddha , how 
would I see myself?  How might  it be different from how I 
usually see myself? ” 
 
Some of you have proba bly been seen by someone  
else, and, in being seen and understood, you felt that 
they were relating to you very differently from  how you 
relate to yourself . Some people are very mean to 
themselves . Or they feel very critical of themselves . Or 
they feel guilty before hav ing done anything to be guilty . 
Or they feel inadequate  in some way . They feel scared , 
thinking , “If somehow people really saw who I am , they  
are not going to like me , and they’ re going to reject me .”  
 
But then someone does look at y ou and sees you . 
Maybe they see parts of you  you’d rather not have other 
people see . Or perhaps they see that you feel 
inadequate , or they feel how guilty you seem . They see 
that, but they don’t believe it  because t hey see you in a very different light . They see you as a whole  person . 
Maybe they see you as a beautiful person . Or they see 
you with respect and kindness.  
 
How do you see yourself? How do you normally  go 
around seeing yourself? Are there other ways of se eing 
yourself? Something I’d like to suggest that you 
experiment with , or be challenged by , or try out, is to 
assume that you’re whole . See yourself as if you’re 
already whole. What happens if you see yourself as if 
you’re already whole? What does it mean for you to be 
already whole?  
 
Many people a re divided against themselves. T hey 
have parts of themselves they don’t l ike, parts  they want 
to push away or  hide, or want to pretend aren’t there , or 
parts  that are secret or very private . In a variety  of ways , 
people a re divided against themselves . Or they feel that 
they are not whole because  of some inadequa cy or 
something wrong with them.  The idea of being whole, I 
think, implies  that there’s nothing wrong with you. It’s 
also a ver y respectful way to see someone. To see 
someone as whole, as a person with a certain degree of 
maturity o r autonomy , or worthy of respe ct. You’re a full 
citizen, a full person here.  
 
Something that I appreciated from the little contact I ha d 
with Buddhist monastic life ( and I don’t know if this 
might have been my projection ) was that once someone was ordained as a monk or a nun , there were certain 
ways in which one then entered a hierarchy . As a new 
monk or nun , one  had to deal with people more senior . 
But then there was an other way in which, once 
ordained , that new monk or nun became  an equal 
member of t he community and was  seen as whole . Not 
exactly autonomous , but given a certain kind of full 
citizen ship,  a certain  autonomy and ability to decide or 
choose for oneself. 
 
What would it mean if , in your mind, you saw yourself as 
being whole , the way you use the word ‘whole ’? What if 
you’re already whole , as opposed to already messed 
up, an embarrassment to the human rac e? Rather than 
seeing yourself as somehow less than other people , in 
seeing yourself as whole, there’s no need anymore to 
compare yourself to anybody else . No n eed for 
comparisons such as someone furth er along in the 
practice , someone better than me, someone kinder than 
me, so meone smarter than me.  Such comparisons are 
about not quite  being  up to something, not adequate, 
not a full citizen yet, or not seeing your self as whole.  
  
To see yourself as whole  implies a kind of acceptance . 
Who you are, how you are as a person is enough ; it’s 
great. Y ou don ’t have to be different. If you’re not a very 
smart person , then you’re a whole person who’s not 
smart, and there’s nothing wrong with that. If you are a 
person with some handicap or disability , and  our society  somehow  treats  you as not being  a full citizen , you are 
still a whole person, a whole person with a disa bility.  It’s 
perfect.  
 
Lots of great things have happened  to me in being 
around kids, now that I have children. One thing was 
that I had no idea how many children  are born with 
circumstances that make them different from the 
conventional person ( there’s on e or two conventional 
people  in the United States so we hav e something to 
compare against). But there are not that many. I started 
hanging out with childr en who are a utistic, or dyslexic , 
or have Asperger’s . I didn’t know  about  this when I was 
growing up , but now there’s a who le new understanding 
of kids with variou s kinds of hypersensitivities . Hearing 
might be hypersensitive,  so an y extra noise in the  
class room makes these kids  go batty. Or their skin is 
really sensitive to to uch. Before,  we thought these  were 
just difficult kids, but  now we  understand  them in a 
different way – it’s the way they were born . Especially 
when I started hanging out with kids with autism, I felt 
that these are children  and all you can do is love them . 
They’re whole ; they’re complete . They’ve come  into the 
world this way , but are  they less than anybody else? I 
don’t think so . There are an infinite number of ways to 
be a human person, each of them complete . And to look 
at peo ple as being complete in who they are , as 
opposed to “not quite up to snuff.”  
 How do you look at yourself? With what eyes do you 
see yourself? Are those kind eyes? Generous eyes? 
Compassionate eyes? Wise eyes? Or not?  
 
What I offer is to experiment with the idea that you’re 
already whole . See what’s it’s like to walk around the 
world with that idea. You’re already fine. You’re already 
perfect in a way. What happens then for you?
