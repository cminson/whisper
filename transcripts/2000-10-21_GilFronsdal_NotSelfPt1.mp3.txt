 Anatta is considered one of the gateways to awakening, to freedom. And there are two other gateways to freedom. There is the gateway of suffering and the gateway of impermanence. And different people will go through different gateways. So some people actually take the experience of Anatta is more important than other people, and for some people the understanding or the experience or the penetration of not-self never plays a very important role in their lives, but rather the gateway of impermanence or the gateway of suffering is highlighted for them. So that should put you a little bit at ease, that you don't necessarily have to understand this in terms of practice, but some of you will. And some of you, it will be a very important gateway, and maybe others of you, something else will be the gateway. The notion of self is one that, in the West, is one that has a certain history to it. And many of us here in the modern world often take the various beliefs and assumptions, ideas which are the foundation of how we operate and how we think about ourselves as being given, as being available to the natural order of the world. And not realizing that some ideas that we think are very fundamental to who we are are not part of the natural order of the world, but rather have a certain history, social history, and maybe they're not very old. The idea of individuality, which is so important here in the modern world, individuation is really central to a lot of the self-help movements of the modern America. They're all predicated on the idea that there's a self, and I'm going to fix myself or focus on myself, or something very unique about my own self-experience is really the key to some happiness or well-being or functioning in the world. These kinds of ideas which are taken to be natural, right, don't go back very many centuries, sometimes even back very many decades. And it's very useful, I think, to get a sense of the social history of some of these fundamental ideas so that we can question some of them and not take them as being absolute and fixed. It's been said that it was a big shock to the Western world when Copernicus said that the Earth was not the center of the universe, and not even, the solar sun is not even the center of the universe. And to realize that lack of centrality meant maybe we're not so centrally important as we thought we were. Darwin also was a big shock to some people, still a shock to some people. And it kind of had the same idea, we are the self, we're the human beings, maybe not as central as we originally thought we were in the scheme of things. And in the 20th century, near the end of it especially, there was a lot of questioning of notion of self. And there was both a creation of the notion of self, of individuality that happened over the last centuries, but also a questioning of that, this modern science and biology and sociology and psychology began investigating and looking for what is this self, what is the sense of self. And there's been some very thorough studies, critiques, analysis of the self in modern science and modern thought that is at least as sophisticated as Buddhism, maybe even more so, where it comes to the conclusion that the self doesn't exist. And so you don't need to go and just study Buddhism to get this idea that perhaps the self doesn't exist. You can just go to Stanford University and take a class in cognitive science. You disappear very quickly. There is a New York Times article that talked about some of this, kind of, yet as natural and as inevitable as human self-awareness may seem, evolutionary biologists and psychologists do not take its existence for granted. Instead they're asking deceptively simple questions that cut to the core of selfhood. Among them, what good is a self anyway? Has self-awareness been selected by evolutionary pressures or is it, to borrow a phrase from Stephen Gould, a glorious accident, the byproduct of a large intelligence that allows humans to build tools and otherwise manipulate their environment? It doesn't sound very noble. A number of biologists now suspect that a robustly articulated sense of self, far from being an afterthought of abundant cortical tissue, is very much the point of the human brain to propose that consciousness allows humans to manipulate the most important resource of all, themselves, and to use that invented tool, that invented self, as a tool to advance their own interests among their peers. They call it an invented tool. This theory in turn suggests that the sense of self, of being set apart like an island afloat in a dark cosmic sea, paradoxically may have arisen because humans evolved in a highly interdependent group, because in fact no human is an island. Certain oddities of self-awareness support the theory that it has adaptive value. Dr. Pinker said, self-deception is one of them. As psychology tests reveal, most people have a slightly inflated image of themselves and their talents. There may be an advantage in believing that one is kinder, smarter, and more in control than you really are, he said. To the extent that all of us are at least occasional liars, the best liar is the one who believes his own lies. Those with low self-esteem then may be the most truthful members of the tribe. But somehow that sort of honesty will not win you allies or a date on Saturday night. Actually I read an article in the Chronicle, I don't know if it's the best source, but... This year, it was just reporting on a study that said that they correlated people's natural abilities, and they took some tests, for example, and what people thought of their own abilities. So they would take the test, and before they told them the results of the test, they would... They would ask, what do you think about yourself? How smart are you? And what happened was that people who scored low on the tests had an inflated idea of how smart they were, and their skills and abilities, and the people who scored relatively high actually rated themselves lower than the people who scored high on the tests. So this ability to think of oneself and inflate oneself from one's abilities seems to be very much part of what human life is like for a lot of people. Do you think that's a defense mechanism since most people with low self-esteem kind of suffer from the matter? It might be. It might be a self-defense, or it might be that you need to be fairly smart to be able to have this self-critical apparatus to be able to have a more realistic sense of your abilities. Maybe. So it's not so much a comment on the people who are not so smart, it's a comment on the people who are smart that they tend to be more critical, they tend to analyze and look, and they're able to see where the shortcomings are. Because they have the better, they can kind of scan the horizon better and see all the areas in which they're not fulfilling. They know what's being left out. And say, well, you know, I'm not so good. Whereas the people who don't have that ability to scan the horizon and see kind of the bigger picture mostly just see the narrow picture, and it seems like they're doing really well. And, you know... Recap that it's more advantageous to be of low self-esteem and room rethinking. I don't want to go to make any conclusions based on this. I thought of this because this article seems to claim that those with low self-esteem may be the most truthful members of the tribe. But actually the study I read in the chronicle said that people with low self-esteem tend not to be as truthful about their abilities. They can inflate themselves above what the test scores say they should be. So I don't want to get into this too much because it's not that important. Mostly what I wanted to raise is the point that the self, which many of us take as being very central to who we are, and the sense of self has been questioned by modern science in the whole range of modern science, in biology, in sociology, in anthropology, and in psychology. And so the Buddhist teachings of not-self in that context doesn't seem so weird, because there's already lots of precedence for it here in the West for that kind of idea. Maybe it disposes us to be a little bit more interested or more kindly disposed to the Buddhist teachings of not-self when we realize that the great authority of modern academia is coming to the same conclusion. It doesn't mean we have to accept it, but it means that we can be a little more kindly disposed to it than reject it offhand, which some people do. There are a lot of misconceptions about what the Buddhist teachings of not-self are. There are a lot of reactions people have based partly on the misconceptions and partly on the conceptions themselves, the more realistic ideas of what the Buddha was teaching. And so you might consider some of the ideas that you've had about what it means to have what a not-them might mean. And maybe at the beginning of today it might be useful for maybe a few of you to state, in one sentence if you can, what you understand the teaching of not-self to be. It doesn't have to be your, it doesn't have to be your understanding. Why don't you present a understanding? What are some of the understandings you've heard about what not-self is? Yes? Well, one of the efforts that helps me is being coreless. There's no fixed, immutable thing that is me. And that there's, if there were, then liberation would be possible. Great. Okay. Coreless, spineless. Yes? A couple of note for us that helped me. One is upon I've heard from someone else. I am a self in the sense that New York City is a city. Most of you get to New York City until as easy as it is to find. It turns into shoulders and streets and people and bricks. And the metaphor that I invented sort of myself is I'm an individual in the sense that a flock of geese, that one way of being shaped of geese flying through the sky is an entity. It's phenomenal. Where does it go if you can slam on a lake and start walking around? It's not a way of shape. It just disappears as it's gone on parts rearrange themselves. Great. Barbara? I've had two people tell me, different people, in different blocks, say that it's a consciousness aware of consciousness, a consciousness aware of awareness. I can't think of truth too much with us. Okay. Yes? Ultimately we're void. Ultimately we're void. We're void. I also want the analogy to a rainbow, that like a rainbow comes together under the scientific particle coming together with the light and the moisture. But we are not. Go back to the whole head. Okay. Yes? I've heard it expressed as no separate, so. That's common. Yes? I think that it's like complete non-exaction. Okay. So if someone came up to you and asked you, did the Buddha teach no self, what would you say? That there is no self. What did he even say? Nor did he say no. What did somebody else think? I think Buddhism teaches there's no self? No enduring self. I think it needs to be qualified. What there isn't is, I just understand it. Permanent soul, I don't see it as specifically arching against the concept of the soul, the mind, that endures. So, and then as you think that that's clearly teaches a Buddhism, that the Buddha, that there's no self, that there is no self. So we have a range of, so far, three different opinions about this here. Yes? I think you split the difference. You said, you can look and you won't find it, but it didn't grow it off the road. It is the results of all the experiments you want to run. Fine. But it wasn't getting a better physical standard or something. Okay. Yes? You probably talked about the slave, but to me, the concept of the little self and the concept of reincarnations, they don't quite fit together in the world. Right. So if there's no self, then what's passing through? Time. Yes? Your bad habits. Okay. So let's begin looking. And I really would like this to be, you know, the Buddha speaking primarily. And so what that means in part is that you have to get into these texts and it helps if you relax. And kind of, you certainly engage with them in any way you want, but think of them as kind of a meditation exercise to be with these kinds of texts, that you're kind of taking these things in at a different level than simply an intellectual level, which is kind of letting go of the reactive responses you might have in order to absorb it in some deeper way. So the word for self in Pali is ata. And in Sanskrit it's atman. Sanskrit and Pali are almost the same language. You probably used the word atman unbeknownst to you, in that the Mahatma Gandhi, the Mahatma is maha atman, which means the great self, the great atman. That was the kind of title he was given. And I guess it's somewhat common for great people in India to be called mahatmas, great selves. And in fact, you find in the suttas that people who become arahats are also given this title sometimes. They're said to be people who have developed great selves, are great selves. So that's kind of interesting because Buddhism is about, you think that the experience of enlightenment is supposed to be about having no self, so what's this, rather than having great selves? One of the common ways, most common ways of using the word ata in the Pali tradition is as an reflective pronoun to something myself. There's no metaphysical or no big philosophical point being made. I'm here, I'm over here, I'm going to eat this food myself, I'm going to eat my own food myself for lunch, isn't that I'm going to have my lunch and you're going to eat it while I eat it? I'm going to eat my lunch myself probably, unless I share it with you. And so it's a very simple, innocent, reflective pronoun that refers to this person here in this part of the room. And in this sense there's a very famous, so much famous discourse, and we won't read all of it perhaps, but I'll tell you... So the story is that there's... Well let's read it anyway, so who would like to read, maybe we could read, first film I can read the first paragraph. Then the Lord, having stayed at Benares for as long as he found soothing, set out on tour for Urubela. Then the Lord, turning off from the road, approached a certain woodland grove. Having approached, having plunged into that woodland grove, he sat down at the root of a certain tree. At that time a group of as many as thirty friends of high standing, with their wives, were amusing themselves in that same woodland grove. One had no wife, so a woman of low standing was brought along for him. Then while they were heedlessly amusing themselves, that woman of low standing, taking their belongings, ran away. Somewhere else? Then these friends, doing their friend a service and seeking for that woman, roaming about... So before we move on then, anything else you want to say about this last discourse that we read? Concerns or questions? Yes? I don't know if I read correctly. Does this mean that because each one of the five categories can't measure up to three questions, then will we come up to this conclusion? Right. It's a little bit of a tautology. If we define self by these three categories, that's what the definition of self is. Then we realize none of these five can qualify as the self, as a self. You could have other definitions of self, and they're dime a dozen. So I guess these five ascetics who were spiritual seekers were searching for... They were probably the last clinging. These people were no longer clinging to their car, or their bank account, or their houses, or their status in society. But probably what was left for them after these years of practice was they were still clinging to some kind of ideal, spiritual ideal. They had to relate to permanence, or related to doing something with the five skandhas, searching the five skandhas for permanence, or something that you control, or something which was happy. And they realized that you can't find that. They realized that there's search for the self that they were searching for. There's ultimate good. It's more like... An interesting way of looking at this discourse is, you don't come from... It's not supposed to bring you to a conclusion, a philosophical conclusion of what's really what. It's more... In realizing, doing this investigation, these people let go of any clinging they had to the five skandhas. And in that release of that clinging, they became free. So it isn't that they did this analysis, and thereby came to a conclusion, physical thought, philosophical conclusion. They said, oh this guy Buddha, he showed up, and he thought there was no self. And now he got it. They didn't have to come to that conclusion. There was no need to make that conclusion. What the Buddha was trying to get them was to get them to loosen up their holding. And the consequence of this teaching, the effect that they had on them was that they turned away, they relaxed, and then became free. They relaxed their clinging. And it's that kind of practice concern, which is really the conclusion of the sutra. The climax of the sutra is not a philosophical conclusion, but rather the effect it had on these five ascetics. And that's the effect that Buddhism wants to have on people, is to get them to relax. Now in the next sutra we have a story of some guy who couldn't relax. So maybe we can have two people who read this and divide it in half. Just jump in. Yes, please. Then is there no self? Second time the blessed one was silent. Then Dr. Goda the wanderer got up from the seat and left. Then not long after Dr. Goda the wanderer had left, Penal Nanda said to the blessed one, why wasn't the blessed one not answered when asked a question by Dr. Goda the wanderer? Ananda, could I, being asked by Dr. Goda the wanderer, if there is a cell, for the answer that there is a cell, then that would be comforting with those priests and contemplators who are exponents of eternalism, view that there is an eternal unchanging soul. So I, being asked by Dr. Goda the wanderer, if there is no self, for the answer there is no self, that would be conforming with those priests and contemplators who are exponents of annihilation, the view that death is the annihilation of consciousness. If I, being asked by Dr. Goda the wanderer, if there is a cell, for the answer that there is a cell, would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are not self? No, Lord. And if I, being asked by Dr. Goda the wanderer, if there is no self, for the answer that there is no self, who willed it by Dr. Goda would become even more bewildered, because the self I used to have now not exist. So this is the only time in the suttas where the Buddha is asked specifically, is there a self or is there no self? And so what you find in no, and here he is silent on the topic, and you find no place in the suttas where the Buddha says there is no self. So that's interesting. Yes? When historically do scholars have a rough date of where Anatta started getting talked about? Well, he's talked about it all the time in the suttas, Anatta has talked all about it. But Anatta here is not, probably inappropriately translated as no self. Because the Buddha nowhere says that there is no self. Nowhere does he say there is a self. So that leaves the door open for people like Horner to say, you know, he's not negating the self, and therefore there is really a self, but that self exists outside the five skandhas. And this is the only mention at all? This is the only place where he's asked directly, you know, where he would have asked directly, is there a self, is there no self? And he refuses to answer. So it's very interesting he refuses to answer that question. But then Ananda asks, why don't you answer? And he claims that if he said that there is a self, then it would be understood that there's a permanent self, and that permanent self exists forever, an unchanging soul. And he doesn't want to posit that. He doesn't want to posit that there's a term. This is a translator's commentary, it's embedded in brackets, right? But if we take the translator's commentary to be accurate, the definition of eternalism, then Buddha doesn't want to posit that there is an eternal unchanging soul, unchanging self, atman. So it becomes kind of a negation of that, that there is a permanent, he doesn't want to affirm that there is a permanent unchanging essence, or soul, or consciousness, or something. He doesn't want to let anybody think that he agrees with the Brahmins. And there are particular views of this. Right. Yes. And the same thing with the Annihilationists. And the Annihilationists believe that this is it, when you die, it's all over, at the end. And he doesn't want to say that. The Buddha posits or believes that there definitely is continuity over lifetimes. And you don't want to negate that belief in the continuity. And one of the reasons you don't want to negate it is that that lends itself to immorality. If there's no continuity over lifetimes, then on your last day on the earth before you die, why don't you simply overcharge your credit card? What does it matter? Or something like that? You know, the bill's not going to come to you, you're going to be disappearing. So why not just... So... In another sutra that I read, where he says about whether life is eternal or not, and he refuses to answer that too. And he says the reason he refuses to answer is because it doesn't help for you. Right. So actually, it's in here. And then it's interesting, then he says, If I were to answer that there is a self, would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are not self? So this wording is something important. The arising of knowledge. So knowledge is not that belief. Knowledge is something you know directly, which can be, in our terms terminology, maybe you can see a perception. You really see for yourself that all phenomena are not self. Buddha's not saying the knowledge that there is no self. Rather he's saying that all phenomena, which means anything that you can experience, does not qualify as a self. And that's a different kind of statement than saying there is no self. It's saying, in the realm of experience, you won't find anything that qualifies as a self. Now that also kind of is vague, because that opens a door for people to say, Yes, an experience is no self, but then there is still probably some other kind of self. Right? But if it's only in your experience, if it's outside your experience, what does it matter? It doesn't matter at all. And then the last concern was that this poor guy, Bhashir Gautam, he just gets even more confused if he answered either way. Are there separate Pali words for no self and not self? As far as I know, not. I was curious about this, that too, in preparing for this, and I would have liked to come back and check the Pali. But normally it's just anatta. Anatta can be translated, it's sometimes translated, and no self, not self, non-self. So mean or something like that. Well, yes, but why this was translated in the beginning here, in his question, then is there no self? And why this was translated as no self here, I don't know whether it's anatta or some slightly different permutation of that. And I wish I knew it for the sake of the class. Do you offer differentiates here, though? Is that the same thing in the title? Well, that's his addition to it. Yeah, that is, yeah. Yeah. In here, I'm still not clear if there's kind of a positive definition of self in saying these things don't qualify, or whether he's saying that non-self is a self-definite in its own category, a form of void and stuff. I'm not sure, like in this sutta, in the previous one, it's like, well, there are these categories, so you've got to be able to control it, enjoy it, and enjoy it forever, which you've got somewhere, and saying, well, nothing qualifies for that, so it's not what we're talking about. I'm not sure whether he's throwing out ideas of what self is and saying, this one doesn't count, this one doesn't count, or if he's got a positive definition of non-self, meaning... There is something, but it's... Is non-self a thing that's being defined or self, is there a positive definition of self that nothing so far lives up to? Well, I don't think you find a positive definition of self, and you don't find a positive definition of no self. I think what you find is particular things are negated, as qualified, as qualifyable, as qualified as self. That's a tendency, so in the first sutta, the five skandhas, those particular things are seen as not qualifying as a self. So it's a definition, it's a negative definition, it's a negating of the possibility of those being a self. And here, I don't know exactly why the Buddha wants to negate eternalism and annihilationism, whether it's simply for the implications that has on spiritual life, or whether it's because of the insight that comes from meditation practice. I hope it's a second. And that's certainly the last category here, the knowledge that all phenomena are not self. That's an insight that comes from practice. So maybe in the readings we're going to have, but the Buddha claims that when you use your mindfulness practice, you can see very clearly the arising and passing of things. You see that each moment of experience, once you get below the concepts, when we see the world through concepts, it can seem much more permanent than it actually is. But when we drop below concepts to the level of how we experience the world, the phenomenological experience of life, then we see that it's arising and passing all the time. And if you're abiding in this arising and passing universe, then it's very hard, you can't claim that things are annihilated once and for all, because you see the birth of things, things get arise, they're not gone. But you can't believe in eternalism either because you see that things pass away. So since things both arise and pass, you can't take either position, according to the Buddha. And because things arise and pass, there's also continuity. So you have to somehow account for that continuity. So you don't account for continuity by saying there's eternalism, and you don't account for that continuity by saying that there's this is it kind of thing, I think it's just over. But you account for it a different way. There's the concept of the scon, does that predate the Buddha? It's a good question. And my guess is it predates the Buddha. A lot of material that we nowadays consider to be Buddhist material, Buddhist teachings, we're just pan-Buddhist, they're kind of part of the spiritual circles that Buddha existed in, and he's just using the common languages and categories. And a lot of those religions died away, and it survived in Buddhism, sometimes in Jainism. And I don't know the answer to your question, but it's my strong suspicion that he was just using categories that were already current. So the next one is a bit lengthy, and I don't know how your patience is with these kinds of discourses. But why don't someone start reading, and then at some point I'll instruct you to kind of skip ahead. I have heard that on the one occasion of Vaisagvara's stay near Savatthi, it just has grown. Then as Venerable Nama kept into his aloneness, occlusion, and this train of thought to those in his awareness, these positions that are undisclosed set aside, discarded by the Vaisagvara, the cosmos is eternal, the cosmos is not eternal, the cosmos is finite, the cosmos is infinite. The soul and the body are the same, the soul is one thing and the body is another. After death the top of God exists, after death the top of God does not exist, after death the top of God exists and does not exist, after death the top of God neither exists nor does not exist. I don't accept that the Blessed One has not disclosed them to me. I'll go ask the Blessed One about this matter. If he discloses to me that the cosmos is eternal, etc. Then I will live the holy life under him. If he does not disclose to me these things, then I will renounce the train and return to a lower life. So he goes, so, so, this is serious. The Buddha better finally, you know, let the cat out of the bag. The leader's been waffling now. Yeah, I mean, it's shocking. In the Buddhist Discourses there's a category of philosophers called the eel-wigglers. Eel-wigglers. They're like eel-wiggling eels because you can never pin them down on what they really believe. And so the Buddha doesn't refer to himself that way as other people. But anyway, so then he goes to the Buddha and he says to the Buddha, look, you've got to tell me. And then someone starts with the bottom paragraph. Malunya puta. Malunya puta, did I ever say to you, come, Malunya puta, live the holy life under me. And I will disclose to you that the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal, or the cosmos is finite, or the cosmos is infinite, or the soul or the body are the same, or the soul is one thing and the body is another. For after death a tathagata exists, or after death a tathagata does not exist, for after death a tathagata both exists and does not exist, for after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist. No, Lord. And did you ever say to me, Lord, I will live the holy life under the Blessed One, and in return you will disclose to me that the cosmos is eternal. And so forth. No, Lord. Then not being the case foolish man, who are you to be claiming grievances, making demands of anyone? Malunya puta, if anyone were to say, I won't live the holy life under the Blessed One as long as he does not disclose to me that the cosmos is eternal, etc. The man would die, and the earth would still remain undisclosed by the tathagata. So tathagata is another name for the Buddha. And so the question is, after death does a Buddha exist, means basically, it can be said, does a person exist after they die? Do you exist after you die? Do you not exist after you die? But it can also be more, does an enlightened person exist after they die? Since the enlightened person has ended the cycles of rebirth, it becomes even more interesting to know, well, when they die, what happens to them? Okay, and then we have this very famous parable that you probably recognize. It's just as if a man... It's just as if a man were wounded and with an arrow thickly smeared with poison. His friends and companions, kinsmen and relatives would provide him with a surgeon, and the man would say, I won't have this arrow removed until I know that a man who wounded me was a noble warrior, a priest, a merchant, or a worker. He would say, I won't have this arrow removed until I know the given name, the clan name of the man who wounded me. Until I know whether it was tall, medium, or short. Until I know whether it was dark, red, brown, or golden, or... Until I know his home village, town, or city. Until I know whether the bow with which I was moved was a longbow or a crossbow. Until I know whether the bow string with which I was wounded was five of Vangel's red, thin, and half a mark. Until I know that the shack with which I was wounded was wild or cultivating, until I know whether the tongue of the shack with which I was wounded was a vulture, a stork, a hawk, a bird. Until I know whether the shack with which I was wounded was bound to the canoe of an ox, a waterfall, a land group, or a monkey. He would say, I won't have this arrow removed until I know whether the shack with which I was wounded was that of a common arrow, a curved arrow, a barb, a cat, tooth, or an oleander arrow. The man would die, in those games, with so many unknown things. Trisk, if you... In the same way, if anyone were to say, I won't take a holy life under this blessed one as long as he does not disclose to me that the cosmos is eternal or that after death as we talk about it neither exists nor does not exist, the man would die of those things which still remain undisclosed by the cetagel. Valencia a puta, it's not the case that when there is a view, the cosmos is eternal. There is still living up with the holy life and it's not the case that when there is a view, the cosmos is not eternal. There is still living up with the holy life. When there is a view, the cosmos is eternal and when there is a view, the cosmos is not eternal. There is still birth, there is still aging, there is death, there is the sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, distress, and destruction. I made note right in the very end. And now, it's not the case that when there is a view, the cosmos is finite. There is a living of the holy life. So it goes through the skippna, I think. It goes on, it repeats the same thing. When you have any of these different views, there is not living the holy life. And then go down to so, malun kyaputa. Remember what is undisclosed by me as undisclosed and what is disclosed by me as disclosed. And what is undisclosed by me? All those categories. And why are they undisclosed by me? This is a very important section, it's kind of what Ines was referring to earlier. And why were they undisclosed by me? Because they are not connected with the goal, are not fundamental to the holy life. They do not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, calming, direct knowledge, self-awakening, unbinding. That is why they are undisclosed by me. So here it's translated disenchantment, what we had earlier as disregarding. And dispassion is dispassion. So in some sense you could say that Buddha's instructions or concern is very limited. And that is sometimes forgotten. People would like their religion to be a world class religion. They would like it to, which means that you would have opinions about the wide range of things and have all kinds of teachings on a wide range of great religious questions and metaphysical things. And after all it is reasonable to have these kinds of concerns and how you are going to go talk to your fellow people of faith and other religions if your religion doesn't have something to say about these important topics. But in a sense the Buddha's concern is very limited in scope. And he is not interested in things which don't lead to the particular goal. He might have interest in these things. They are not really irrelevant to answer these questions, I would argue. But the Buddha himself was not very interested in those, or interested in teaching those or advocating those, because it is hard enough to attain the goal. And it is very easy to get stuck on dead ends or by passes. And so he said, these things I don't teach those things because they are not conducive to the goal. So all I am going to teach is I am going to teach that which is helpful for attaining the goal. And what is disclosed by me? And here the Buddha refers to the Four Noble Truths. And this translation by Tanisirabhiku, he translated stress as dukka, as stress, and it could also be translated as suffering. More commonly, but he prefers stress because it has a wider meaning than the word suffering. And that is probably the word dukka. This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress. And why are they disclosed by me? Because they are connected with the goal, are fundamental to the holy life, they lead to disjointment, dispassion, cessation, calming, direct knowledge, self-awakening, unbinding. Unbinding is Tanisirabhiku's translation of nirvana, or nirvana. So there are a lot of different things you could be pursuing with your time as a human being, and you could certainly pursue a lot of great metaphysical questions. And the Buddha says that he is not interested in answering those questions, implying that for the purposes of the goal, the narrow purpose of spiritual practice, you are not going to be involved in these kinds of questions. You are not going to be interested in them. Yeah, please. There was the one story where he said, what I teach is like the leaves in my hand, but what I know is like all the leaves in the forest. Does that mean that he actually may have known the answers to all these questions, but it was useful to just tell people what the answers were? Yes, please. The same question has occurred to me. I think there is a tendency to borrow some of this reputation, and I am sure there are a lot of people who would say yes and no, the answers to those questions. My guess is, contrary not that he knew or didn't know, but that he had a deep conviction based on insights from meditation or whatever, that those questions were badly stated. They were even philosophically since incoherent. Cosmos is finite, the cosmos is infinite. Well, how do you measure it? It is a badly stated question. Maybe he had a time when the cosmos is closed, but it doesn't mean anything. These are questions that you could argue endlessly, but they really come down to being questions of language and semantics, and often just syntax, and therefore they aren't worth the process, at least in this form. Good. I don't know if that's what... It is hard to know what was in the Buddha's mind, but there are examples where the Buddha seems to be implying something, what you are saying, that certain questions are not worth being answered, they are not worth being engaged in because they are poorly stated. I forgot my exact parent writing, and then the Buddha said, you get to take my teachings as being clang to not anything mind, how is it that you had practiced that, you heard all my teachings? Right. Again, you see that you can understand the Buddha's teachings, the practice he was teaching, as having a very limited domain. The domain was simply what is conducive towards the goal of non-clanging, unbinding is the final release of clinging. The focus here is on the Four Noble Truths, which is also a teaching on how to relinquish all clinging. Let's move on. Lester? One thing, you know, he teaches at some point here about all the different family realms and all that, you know, just seems like how is that relevant? He's not going to talk, he seems to be relevant to the ending of something, how is that relevant? I don't know how much he taught those things. They were just accepted part of the worldview of the people around him, including himself. They were just taken for granted that those things existed. It wasn't that they were metaphysical speculation. The claim is that there were a lot of people, including the Buddha, who could see those realms. They could enter meditation or use their psychic eye and see those things. They were quite firmly believed in. The Buddha assumed or knew that when you die, you can be reborn in one of these realms. He would talk about where people were reborn. He allowed that people could certainly practice your practices that helped them get reborn in the heavenly realms, which was the goal of some people. He actually said, this is what you should do if you want to get reborn in those realms. But then he would often suggest, if he thought they had the capacity for it, that maybe you want to go further than that. Maybe rather than just getting reborn in heavenly realms, you want to become free. Because the heavenly realms are not that interesting, he said. Being a god is not such a hot thing. No, from our point of view, it could seem pretty good, right? It's better than a superstar. I'm curious why you picked this particular passage. What's this relation to self, the issue of self? First of all, the issue of self is often connected with all kinds of metaphysical questions. Not necessarily the same ones as these. They have soul and body and things like that. Many people are pondering when they think about the self. They speculate about that there is a soul and the soul is connected to the body, the soul is not connected to the body or whatever. But the self is often an exploration of self from many people as a metaphysical exploration. So the Buddha wants to get away from that kind of speculation. He has this criteria for what he's interested in exploring. When we look at the question of self and no self, to what degree is it conducive for leading us on the goal and to what degree does it take us away from the goal? Maybe there are ways of holding that question of what is self that is not very helpful for people. That we'll come back to later. The answer to your question will probably become clear as we go along. Was that clear enough for now? And then we have the Pali-layaka Sutta. I have heard that on one occasion, lesson one was staying here in Kosambi, Kosambi, like a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a person who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was scientifically driven in India, being an Indonesian in NV, or getting away from these Ugandan phoenician culture in our Licust occurredentry. We were born someone Gonzili who's a man who is half of Chuck Ginsburg State University littler and was sent to be Mitch, who lives in Crudney gold. Pali, Yaka, there he stayed at the root of the auspicious sound tree. A very large number of monks went to Venable Ammana and a arrival exchanged for these greetings. After an exchange of friendly, courteous, and greetings, they sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they sat to Venable Ammana and Ananda. They asked them to bless the ones of the presence. They wanted to hear Ananda talk and bless the ones of the presence. Then Venable Ananda went to those monks at the root of the auspicious sound tree, and on arrival after bowing down to him, sat down to one side. As they were sitting there, the blessing went instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged them at a top on Vamma. Now on that occasion, this train of thought appeared in the awareness of one of the monks. Now I wonder, knowing in what way, seen in what way, does one delay put an end to the influence? The blessing, when perceiving with his awareness the train of thought and the monk's awareness, said to the monks, I have analyzed and taught you the Dhamma monks. I have analyzed and taught you the four frames of reference, the four right exertions, the four bases of power, the five faculties, the five strengths, the seven factors of awakening, and the noble eightfold path. Yet even though I have analyzed and taught you the Dhamma, still there appears this train of thought in the awareness of one of the monks. Now I wonder, knowing in what way, seen in what way, does one without delay put an end to the influence? No wonder he walked off by himself. The word, effluence, is asa, and it's a very important word. I think earlier we had it as cankers. Sometimes cankers, sometimes effluence, sometimes effluence, effluence. Cankers, sometimes it's the outflows, sometimes the pollutants, sometimes the drains. Is it just physical or is it also could be thoughts or is it more just a physical? There are four asa-vas, sometimes there are three, sometimes there are four. They are attachment to sensual desire, attachment to opinions, attachment to a sense of self, and ignorance. Those are the four. Those are one of the primary categories that are understood to perpetuate the cycles of suffering. When you uproot those four effluence, then suffering comes to an end, then cycles of rebirth come to an end. These are very important. When a person gets liberated in Buddhism, in their early tradition, after a person has been liberated, the next stage of the spiritual practice is a clear recognition that these effluence have been eradicated. Sensual attachments. I might have them wrong. Let me make sure I have them right. They are listed here. Asa-saba, A-S-A-V-A. I have them wrong. It might be that there are different listings of them, so that's why I have them wrong. Here they are listed as attachment to sensual desire, attachment to views, attachment to self, and then the attachment to precepts. Here it has these precepts and practices. So that's kind of nice. Even your attachments to this wonderful spiritual practice you're doing needs to be uprooted. And to precepts. Isn't that great? No more attachment to ethics. I think that's what Adrian said at the beginning of the practice. Right. You should wait. It's the last thing you're supposed to do. I guess it's possible to practice them without being attached to them. Oh yeah, yeah, sure. The practices and things like that. Absolutely. Where are we? So the beginning of this next page? Can be attached to building a really statue of the Buddha, kind of a verbal evening, a focus that would be attached to practice. It could be attached to practice, it could also be attached to sensual desire, because you want to see something beautiful. It could also be attached to your views and opinions. Well then. Oh then, knowing in that way, seeing in that way, does one without delay put an end to the ethics? There is a case where an undestructed, run-of-the-mill person who has no regard for noble ones, is not well-versed or well-disciplined in the Dhamma, who has no regard for a man of integrity, is not well-versed or disciplined in the Dhamma, assumes form to be the Self. That assumption is a fabrication. Now, what is the cause? What is your intradation? What is the birth? What is the coming into existence of that fabrication? To an un-instructed, run-of-the-mill person touched by that, which is felt more in contact with ignorance, craving rises. That fabrication is born of that. And that fabrication is in constant, fabricated, dependently, co-erism. That craving, that feeling, that contact, that ignorance is in constant, fabricated, dependently, co-erism. It is by knowing and seeing it, seeing in this way, that one without delay puts an end into the act of it. For he doesn't assume form to be the Self, but he assumes the Self as possessing form. Form as in the Self, Self as in form, or feeling to be the Self, the Self as possessing feeling, feeling as in the Self, Self as in feeling, or perception to be the Self, the Self as possessing perception, as in the Self, Self as in perception, or fabrication to the Self, the Self as possessing fabrication, fabrications as in the Self, Self as in fabrication, or consciousness to be the Self, the Self as possessing consciousness, consciousness as in the Self, Self as in consciousness. Now that assumption is a fabrication. What is the cause? What is the coming into existence of that fabrication? To an uninstricted, burning-the-mill person touched by the feeling born of contact with ignorance craving arises. That fabrication is born of that, and that fabrication is inconstant, fabricated, dependent, and co-written. That craving, that feeling, that contact, that ignorance is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-rhizmed. By knowing and seeing this way, one that one without delay puts an end to death. Or he doesn't assume form to be himself. That he may have a view such as this. This self is the same as the cosmos. This will I be after death, constant, lasting, eternal, not subject to a change. This eternalist view is a fabrication. Or he may have a view such as this. I would not be. Neither would there be what is mine. I will not be. Neither will there be what is mine. This annihilationist view is a fabrication. Or he may be doubtful and uncertain if they come to no conclusion with regard to the true death. That doubt, uncertainty, and coming to no conclusion is a fabrication. What is the cause? What is the origination? What is the burden? What is the coming into existence of that fabrication? When an uninstrupted, run-of-the-mill person touched by what is felt, born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That fabrication is born of that. That fabrication is inconstant, fabricated, dependent, and co-rhizmed. That craving, that feeling, that contact, that ignorance is inconstant, fabricated, dependent, and co-rhizmed is by knowing and seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the other one. So there are a few interesting things here. One is that the Buddha shows perhaps a little bit of surprise that they haven't gotten it yet. They need more instruction. And what's interesting is the list of things that he's taught. Here the Buddha has this idea that maybe he's taught enough now. People should have gotten it. And what are the things that he taught? And what he taught is not beliefs, is not tenets, it's not a system of philosophy. But what he taught that he thinks is significant is a series of practices that can be done. He taught the Four Frames as a Reference. That's Tanisravikku's translation of Satipatana, which is the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. The Four Right Efforts, the Four Bases of Power, the Five Ficolites. All these things are either practices that a person does, or they are qualities of mind that arise from doing practices. So the Buddha wasn't teaching some doctrine here. He was saying, do these practices. And again, you can understand perhaps that the reason he did that was the Buddha was not interested in the doctrine that you would attain or have. He was really interested in what would be helpful for you to let go of the grip of clinging, of all attachments. And these are the practices that lead to that. And what you actually believed, aside from that, wasn't as important as actually doing the practices. And then if you go on to the next page, he wants to elaborate, since they didn't get it, they want more. And here, he talks about a person who assumes form to be the self, the body to be the self. And the important section here is he goes on to say, that assumption is a fabrication. To assume that something, that a form, to assume that something is a self is a mental action that we do. It's a fabrication, a construction of the mind. And any construction of the mind is to be questioned. It is temporary, it's something that's born, it's something that's dependently co- arisen. So, let's see. That assumption is a fabrication. Now, what is the cause? What is the origination? What is the birth? What is the coming into existence of that fabrication? To an un-instructed, one-of-the-mill person, touched by that which is felt, born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That fabrication is born of that. So the assumption here is that the fabrication, the assumption, the form itself, arises from some kind of clinging, some kind of craving. And that assumption is impermanent, fabricated, and dependently arisen. So, if we rely on an assumption to fabricate or construct the idea that form the self, that fabrication is different than the claim. Let me say it this way. If I say that this paper is white, that's a different statement. That statement exists differently than this paper itself. It's an assumption about the paper. It's a statement about the paper. So when a person says form is self, that's a statement about form. It's a statement about self. It's not the same thing as the self. Or as the famous Vipassana's teaching goes, the thought about your mother is not your mother. The thought about your mother is that fabrication is constructed. It arises because of different conditions coming together. You exist, in a sense, independent of that thought. You can think about your mother for a few minutes or a few days, and then sooner or later you'll stop thinking about it. You'll think about something else. I think what he's pointing to here is that he's questioning the sense we have of self, the sense of I am, which is a very common idea, a common movement that human beings have. We have almost an innate sense of I exist, I am. So people say, I don't really know what the self is, but I certainly have a sense that I exist as a self. I have a sense of the self. I'm just going to trust that. I believe what he's pointing to here is that any sense of self, any idea of what is self is a fabrication, is an assumption, arises as a dependent condition phenomena that isn't what it appears to be. So the question then is, if you take away the assumption, if you take away the sense of I am, what are you left with? Or, to put it a different way, do we need to assume that there is a self? Do we need to get involved with that kind of construction? In that it's a construction and it's really fabricated, do we need to get involved with that kind of fabrication? Do we need to carry that around with us, that kind of effort? I come back to my question. I'm stuck on my question. I have an effect on what I see today. But if you don't have a self, then what is the experience? So how do you define the self? Oh, I don't know. That's what I'm working through. It's something that's been taught to me. So what I'm suggesting is the Buddha in no place suggests that you have no self. Yeah, I got that earlier, that there's no self and that there's not no self. And the Buddha in no way denies that you have a self. That's a non-self. Because when you were saying why even go into the space of does it self exist? If you don't enter into that space, then how do you receive experience? You see what I'm saying? How does experience exist? Without a self. It's like if the tree falls in the woods, it knows that you're here. In the first readings we had, the Buddha is quite content to use the personal reflective pronouns. So myself, I'm over here, I'm the one who's talking to you. I'm not going to say that Brigette's the one who's talking to you while I'm talking. There's something, I'm here, that's quite fine to say that. But I don't have to posit a, so that's kind of like a general kind of system, kind of like a general category I'm kind of pointing to, something kind of abstract that's over here. But if I go underneath the abstraction, which is a useful one, and to say there is no self here or there is a self here, that's something which the Buddha, that question the Buddha doesn't want to answer. He's not interested in it. If however, if you ask, is this body self? The Buddha would say, no, the body's not self, you look carefully, the body doesn't qualify as a self. If you look at your feelings, if you look at your thoughts, no, that doesn't qualify itself. Okay, that's great. The body's not self, the feeling's not self, the perception's not self, all these scunders are not self. Then obviously we should take this next step and say, so there is no self, is there? The Buddha doesn't want to say that. So the question, since there is no self, who is here to experience something, is not a question the Buddha would have ever occurred to the Buddha. Because the Buddha nowhere posits there is no self. He's kind of, you'll get disappointed. No, it's, it's, um... Feel wiggling? Yeah. And I'm not even looking for, well, I don't know, I'll stick with it. Okay, let's see how it goes along here. He, he, I think the point is being this, here, I think there has to be a long, you know, you've said there's gotta be a self as I'm experiencing this. That's fine. He didn't say don't experience things or don't recognize that there's a point at which experience comes together as perceived, but all those things don't happen. He's saying there's, don't, don't have any allegiance to them. You don't, you don't depend on them because they're going to fail. You're going to let you down. Right. That's, that's good. So, so experience is taken as a given. Well, for example, I mean, when I'm really, one of my questions is rooted in is an experience I had in another patient. Right. Where it was sort of like I was experiencing the sensation of being taught about identity and self in different perspectives. And so if I feel, if I say there's no self in the, I mean, then it's like who, what received that experience? What contained that experience? How did that experience even occur if I was, if there wasn't something there to contain it or to receive it? Right. Right. But that's where, that's where my struggle is. And so the question then the question is, why, why, why, why is that an interesting question? Why is that a relevant question? Why isn't it simply enough just to relax? So whether I had this great experience in meditation and it happened and I learned. Oh, So, so, yeah. So the Buddha might say to you, that's maybe interesting question, but that question is not conducive to the goal. The goal being. Liberation. Well, but for me that's a different discussion. Because then, I mean, for me, a sense of knowledge, a sense of knowing is a form of, could be understood as a form of liberation and therefore the sense of knowing what or the knowledge of knowing what is containing that experience. Yes. But you could, knowledge is liberation, but you could go study at Stanford forever. If that's what the French were getting. I'm more than happy to get down with tangents. Well, let's see. Let's see. I think what you're, I don't want to seem at all disrespectful for what you're raising here. No, I don't want to dismiss or anything, but let's see how these readings continue and see if, especially near the end of the day, whether, whether, you know, you have a different perspective on this. I'm very interested in this. All these views of self are seen as a right of releasing and creating what your right is to do. You can hang on and get to the other end of the self and hang on. Right. So, so that's a very important point. Thank you. And so, so, so one of the possible implications of this is that all senses of I am, all, all conceits, I am, I am something or the self is something, is born not only of ignorance, but also born of craving. And so in the Buddha's teaching, there is no place for, as long as there's sense of I am, the person's not liberated. And the person who's liberated is freed from any sense of I am. Can I think of that? Yes, let's see. I am, I am, I am. Well, I think that it's not just simply I am X, but just simply even the sense of I am-ness. What's the definition of ignorance? I forget what that is. Well, I don't know here because I was, I mean, initially I would have said it's the ignorance about whether there is a self or not. But that doesn't work anymore with this kind of discussion. I think that ignorance usually is, I mean, one of the definitions of ignorance, ignorance in this text, is it's ignorance about the true characteristics of things. Is we don't, if we're ignorant to the fact that things are, that things are impermanent things, or I should say, the formula goes this way, ignorance that fabricated things are impermanent. Fabricated things are suffering and that all things are without self. So that's a formula, that's a formula of the three characteristics. And that's a fundamental ignorance. As you ignore, you're not aware of those three things. And born from that comes everything else. But it's a little bit circular then, according to this sutra here. So that's not very sad. So it means that you're unaware of the true nature of things. Right. That's the classic definition of ignorance, unaware of the true nature of things. But as we read this, it seems a little bit unsatisfactory in terms of, because it seems circular. So the three characteristics are very important in, especially, Theravāda and Buddhism. And they appear among some Theravāda and Buddhists, almost as their fundamental dogma of their religion. Some people have translated it as the three sthikmatas, because they're so central. And in short time they're usually described as being impermanence, suffering and not self. However, the formulaic teaching on it is a little bit more sophisticated than that. It says that all sankaras, all fabricated things, all conditioned things are impermanent. So anything that has the nature of being born, anything that has the nature of being created, and it looks around you, and pretty much everything you can experience is of that nature that's been created, has the nature of then being impermanent. Everything which has been created, fabricated, conditioned, has the nature of being stressful in some way, unsatisfactory in some way, having dukkha in some way. And then it shifts. The wording stops being all fabricated things, but now it's all dharmas, sabedhamma, anatta. And so the question is, why does this formula change? And the argument is that it says all dharmas are not self, because it wants to include, it basically means all things are not self, because it wants to include the unconditioned. It wants to include nirvana. It doesn't want to say that nirvana is self. Nirvana is permanent. Nirvana is not suffering, there's no suffering in nirvana. Sometimes it's talked about as being bliss. But it doesn't want to posit that nirvana is a self. So the formula is that all dharmas are without self. Now, all dharmas, all things are without self, is, for those who are kind of more precise in their language, is a different statement than that there is no self. And what it is, is all things. You won't find a thing that qualifies as a self. Which means, in Buddhism it means in your experience. You don't find anything in your experience which qualifies as self. And maybe for most people's logic it seems like the same statement. But there is a little difference, I think. I think the difference is significant. So, if nirvana is permanent and meets the criteria which is not such earth, the opposite of the definition of self, then what's wrong with saying nirvana itself? Why didn't you want to make that statement? You've met the criteria. Well, it meets the criteria of being permanent. It meets the criteria of being blissful. But it doesn't meet the criteria that you have any control over it. That you can control it. And also, in nirvana there is not any self-reflection, any notion of I am within it. So, to claim that nirvana is self is not inherent in the experience of nirvana itself. It would be something we add to it. It would be a fabrication. It would be a construction, it would be an assumption. And then here, according to this last sutra we read, the Buddha has some difficulty with fabrication. And his assumption is, his assumption I believe, or his knowledge, his understanding is that as soon as you create the assumption of fabrication of I am, or sense of I am, the craving is involved with that. So, in nirvana there can't be any craving. But you can't get to the nirvana if you have craving. Right. So, to what degree does it make sense to call nirvana self? If there is no self-awareness in nirvana. And since you have no control over nirvana, and since nirvana doesn't think for itself, does it make sense for nirvana itself? Yeah, I have one question. Well, thanks. So, let's pause for just a minute so I can figure out where we're going. What? Are you ready for lunch? Oh, that's pretty clear. All these cells need our lunch. Hunger has arisen, but there's no one who's hungry. So, I hope that this is proving interesting enough for you to read this. I think it's valuable to actually take the time to actually read these discourses for yourself and actually know what's being said and kind of get it under your belt, as opposed to reading secondary literature about it or hear some poor ignorant Dharma teacher try to hold forth on these things. So, let's have lunch. And how long should we have lunch for? 45 minutes? I think an hour, yeah, yeah. I was wondering if you wanted longer than that. Let's do an hour. So, let's start again at 1.20. And does anyone need to have instructions to Delhi or something? Pretty much people know the area. So, we can continue some of this discussion over lunch. I'll sit someplace in the sun. Oh, yes, thank you.
