 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDarma.org. Dharma. Here we go. Okay. Hello and welcome everyone to Happy Hour. Lovely to be with you and and hear your hellos, see your faces. So for tonight's practice, I wanted to bring in this framing, something that I learned recently. So it has to do with natural sciences. It has to do with the way that our minds work, our minds work, our brains work, our body works. So the visual system as an example of how we process information. In the past, scientists thought and when we do naive reasoning, we think that okay, there's an object in the world and the visual processing, you know, the cones and rods and we process the shapes and colors and lines and it's all sent to the brain for processing and we go, aha, it's a cat, right? That's the way in your biology. But it actually turns out that scientists have discovered that there are more, what is it called, not neurons, but these long, there's more information sent from the brain to the eyes instead of from the eyes to the brain. There are more pathways. That's the word I'm looking for. There are many, many more pathways from the brain sending down information to the eyes instead of eyes to the brain. Like, okay, so scientists first realized this, it's an interesting quandary, like why is that? Like that's surprising and yet when you think of it, it makes sense because if our information processing is humans, we have to process all pieces of information fresh and fresh and fresh, it would be so inefficient and nature is very efficient. So guess what? The brain actually is sending down expectation for what it expects to see, what it expects to see to the eyes and the eyes are just seeing the difference. It's actually very similar to many computer algorithms for image processing that you don't always process. If you're processing say video, you just process the differential. If there's a movement like, oh, you only process that or you don't have to process every frame over and over, it's just your expectation. So basically what the implication that this has for us as human beings is that we construct our reality. We know this and yet this is such an interesting example where our brain is constructing our reality through its expectations. We expect to see maybe a cat because we just perhaps processed the cat or this is the animal we expect to see when we open the door and not only with our visual system in the world, the brain sends us to our processing systems what it expects to see and then our processing system, oh, cleans the information to support the suggested delusion that our brain has. So this example of the visual system is so interesting and radical and yet it's the same. It's the same with how we process information otherwise in the world. So if we are looking at the world, the sense of, okay, this person is mean to me and the world is a mean place, an unfriendly place, an unkind place, well, guess what are we going to see? Guess what we're going to pick up and yet if we expect kindness, oh yes, the world is a kind place, this person is kind, I am kind, I see my own goodness, guess what we see, guess what we perceive. So our perception is based on our expectation, is in the most fundamental way in many ways of processing. I just bring up the visual system as an example. So we create our own reality and not only physicists and natural scientists, this is the new way of thinking but also of course philosophers and contemplatives, we create our own reality. So let's create a reality that is kind, let's set up these expectations that are kind, that are generous, that are onward leading. Let's set these expectations for kindness, for goodness, for goodwill. So that is the part of our training in this practice and happy hour. We train ourselves, our habitual patterns, our expectations, our set point, however way you want to relate to it, to be one of goodwill kindness. So that that's how we act, that's what we perceive, that's how the world becomes through our perceptions, through our set point. So enough of a framework tonight, so let's set the conditions for goodwill and kindness. Actually tonight I think I'll be able to do something, I want to do gratitude and appreciation, seeing the good in the world. So let's do that. So let's practice, let's settle, let's arrive in our bodies. Hmm. Arriving, settling. So always first with the breath, with the body. Arriving, arriving. So receiving the breath with appreciation. All the sensations of sitting, feet touching the earth, hands touching our lap, set bones on the chair. Let's be silent and just settle, relax the body, connect with the breath, appreciate it. So let's turn up their thoughts arising. Thank you, not now, giving my heart to this practice right now. Just letting the breath be received in the abdomen. How lovely to be able to sit and breathe, sublime. Thank you. And receive each breath in this body with appreciation. That's a new beginning. Thank you. And we receive the sensations appreciatively throughout the body. This feeling of being alive. Through these sensations, we know we're alive. And we appreciate every exhale, letting go a little bit into relaxation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now can we turn, expanding, expanding the sense of presence. As if our breath was a little wider, not just through our body, but a little wider. The breath is breathing us. We're sitting in this space, spacious, being calm, soothed through the reverberations of our breath. Beyond our skin. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And now as we sit, feeling the sensations spaciously, being breathed. The spacious container. Opening our heart. Inviting something that we appreciate to waltz in. Not going out and searching for it, but just opening the door. Letting it gently saunter it. Be something close, near, just maybe your breath. With the sense of being able to sit upright. Something we usually take for granted. Let this goodness of whatever it is as waltz to him, let it fill your heart. Relish with each breath, keep connected to the breath. Relicing, appreciating. Stay connected with the breath. And sensations. Let the spacious container relax the body with ease, inviting you something else that waltz in your heart. Spend time with each item, with each guest. So there's not too much switching here and there, which can imbalance the mind. Settle, stay with something for a little while. Then in your own time, invite another guest to come in and be appreciated. Another guest into your heart. And now we can invite something about ourselves. To appreciate. We often focus on what we don't appreciate. We judge ourselves, but turn and find something we appreciate about ourselves, what we're doing or not doing. Our being, not being. Seeing the good. This person always me doing their best and us appreciating this effort. Thank you. And now turning, opening up to perhaps aspects that are somewhat challenging or have been challenged. Maybe not the most challenging items, but some things. And I feel grateful for this too. Can I? Is it possible? And if the answer comes back, no, it's okay. Don't push it. We'll answer something else. But ask the question, can I? How possible. Imagine the situation that may not be the easiest for you right now. For someone else in a completely different situation, this would be an absolute blessing. For example, if your work is very heavy, very demanding, you're tired. Someone else doesn't have a job, would love to be in your shoes. And you appreciate the good. Not to condone the challenges, but to see the good. And as we bring this meditation session to a close, we appreciate ourselves. This opportunity offered the community through technology, all the amazing causes and conditions that have come to be. Appreciate all of this and are showing up. We open our hearts wide and appreciate all of that, giving it a big appreciative hug. Sharing our blessings, our goodness, our gladness with all beings everywhere. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Oh, you may still not have heard the, I think there was still a problem with the audio. Did you hear the bell? No, no. Okay, let's try that again. Yes. Lovely. Thank you all for your practice. So let's move things around a little bit. I'm going to open the chat, but what I'd like to invite us to do, actually, instead of sharing reflections, inviting your reflections now, let's move into the small groups now and we'll save space at the end for reflections. Just trying something a little different. So the invitation for the small groups is we'll do a round robin, going around and around. And actually this practice can be so joyous. Yes, thank you, Nila, also for posting the survey information again, in case you lost the previous link. So the invitation for the small groups is what are you grateful for? You can share one thing. What are you grateful for? It can be anything. What are you grateful for? The next person will share something and then the next person, they'll come to you and just go around and around. And this practice can be so happy making. So it's such a sense of abundance, both holding one's abundance and witnessing others, supporting others. And of course you can say pass, just hold space. Just offering from your own experience, not asking, not querying, not directing, but just offering something from your own experience if you wish. And let's do reverse alphabetical order just for the fun of it. And yeah, so going to create the rooms and take care of yourselves, take care of each other. Okay. All right. Check the rooms up. Maybe switch something around. Hold on a second and recreate them. Hold on a second. Okay. Let's try that. A moment. Okay. Here we go. Okay. The rooms are closed. Everybody's back. So the first question I have for you was, did that feel like enough time or not? If you feel like it was enough time, raise your hand and I'll go through. Yes. Feels like enough time. I see a few hands. Okay. If it feels like it, that was not enough time. Raise your hand. How many hands do I see? Not enough time. Okay. All right. I see half and half. Okay. We've got. All right. Okay, great. Ah, great. So we have time for reflections now. A few minutes, either about the meditation, if any aha moments, surprises, questions, or about doing this practice in the group, this gratitude practice around about what you might've noticed. Fred and Barbara. Fred or Barbara or both. Well, I'm the one who raised my hands. I'll jump in unless you want to say something else here, but there's just a feeling how well this practice goes with the loving kindness. It feels like a very natural fit. And the three of us who were together, I think we all really enjoyed just bringing to mind things we are grateful for. And it's like a little thumbtack note on the wall of consciousness here that, oh yeah, there's so much to remember. And you have to actually do it. You have to do it consciously. You have to remember to remember. And then there is so very much to be thankful for it every day. And it seems like it builds on itself. It seems like you erect a kind of pyramid of conscious thankfulness about the day, and that makes it a better day. So thank you. Yeah, thank you, Fred. And I appreciate the many observations you made, one being this sense of pyramid, this what I like to also call the virtuous cycle. Because when you start to precondition yourself to see the good, then you start to see the good, and then you see more good, and then it just becomes a virtuous cycle. And when you said that, one practice I usually do in the evening when I lie in bed, before I sleep, I think of a few things. I'm grateful for it for today. I can't go through the day from the morning, maybe to the evening, or this happened, and this happened, or that, oh, that's, oh, that was lovely. That was, oh, wow. So it really brings a lot of joy to my heart before I fall asleep. So I share that if you may want to try it on for size. Yeah, the reflections. And you can also type them in chat, as you know, if you type them to me privately, I'll only read the reflection, not your name, so it'll be private. And if you like to type it to everyone, you're welcome to. Any other observations about this practice? Shaping our own reality through appreciation and gratitude. Okay. Barbara. What I wanted to add to what Fred said was that he and another person in the breakout session said that they had done the gratitude email to someone else in the group that you get pitched as an assignment two years ago, and they're continuing to do it. And that was something that they were grateful for. And so this virtuous cycle, you got yourself to thank for that. Thanks for bringing that in, Barbara. That makes me so happy just to no end. Thanks for sharing that. Oh my goodness. Yay, Fred and whoever else they're doing this for all this time. Yay. And thanks for bringing that in. May it inspire other people to start doing that in the community, in the Narsanga. That is so awesome. Love it. Love it. Thank you so much, Barbara. That's so great. That's so great. Thank you. Diana. I was just happy and astonished to hear about the visual system and about the brain with many, many more pathways than the eyes. It goes a long way to explaining why, especially in the recent past, I've been looking for something, looking for something, an important document of this. And I can't see it. And it's absolutely right in front of me in an envelope with its name on it. And the next morning it's there. There's been nobody around. There's something else happening in the brain, tension wise, whatever we're looking for or not. And it's happened several times recently. Not seeing what's right there with distraction, whatever else is coming in the brain. That was an important scientific discovery. So yeah, yeah, it's it's. Thank you. You're so welcome. It's so remarkable, really, just the way that we actually shape our reality, the way we perceive it's not it's not what we think it is. And that's so many implications. Maybe actually what I'll share and there's so much more in this book, the book where I learned this. There's so much in this book. It's been it's been blowing my mind. Maybe I'll just share the name. It's called Helgoland. H-E-L-G-O-L-A-N-D. And I trust Neil will send it to the group by Carlo, Carlo Ravelli. And it's it's actually the book is about he's a physicist and the book is about the not string theory, but the. Anyway, without getting into too much detail, it's it's it's maybe I'll bring some other details about the book in the next few sessions, but it's it's it's pretty awesome. Pretty well, let's see if I'm trying to find. Yes, it's Carlo Ravelli. R-O-V-E-L-L-I. Anyway, so let's see, I think I saw another hand. I think that's it. I saw. Oh, yes, it's seven o'clock. Yeah. Oh, yes, it's about quantum theory. That's what I wanted to say. The book is about quantum theory and it's very accessible and it's it's pretty awesome and pretty wild, really pretty wild. So, so thank you all. Thank you for your practice. I am grateful for happy hour. I am grateful for you all. That's one of the things that was coming up for me as I was doing this practice tonight. Among the many things I'm grateful for. I am grateful for happy hour. So grateful for you. Thank you. Thank you for your practice. Thank you for being part of this amazing, beautiful community. May all of you, may all of us, may all beings be well. May all beings be free. Thanks everyone. Take good care. Be well.
