 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello and welcome. Hello and welcome. And here on Friday, those of you who have been following these 7 a.m. weekday sittings for some time will recognize that often there's an unfolding, a pattern of going deeper by Friday, kind of step by step, taking a step deeper, deeper over the 5 days. And today, the simile that's going to be, I'll talk about later, is a very simple simile that on the surface just seems very ordinary. And it's a simile for full awakening. And so I want to highlight the ordinariness of it. So when we do this meditation, maybe there can be for you an emphasis on seeing clearly what is obvious, what is ordinary here, and in that seeing the ordinariness of everything, maybe something releases for you, something relaxes, the searching, the wanting, the not wanting, the fixing, the trying to understand, trying to have something special, trying to recover some state of meditation that you used to have. Just very simply, a simple being with what is. So the simile is a person standing on the edge of a lake. And the lake is very clear, clearer than clear, just maybe so clear that you almost don't even know there's water there. And the person looks into that lake and sees on the lake floor, sees shells, different oyster shells, different kinds of shells, sees the pebbles and the gravel that's there, the lake bottom, and sees schools of fish both hovering still in the water, not moving, and also gently swimming around. So the remarkable thing about this metaphor is the clarity of the water. But what we see in the water, our natural phenomena, and maybe for that reason it's kind of special, especially for people who are not connected to nature so much. But very ordinary, just the gravel, the bottom of a lake, the shell that's down there, the shells. And little fish in schools swimming around peacefully. So just to look at this simple world, natural world, and let it be that simple. And what would it be like for this meditation where you are content to be present here and now for what is obvious? What is it that obviously is clear? Maybe what it is is you're confused. You're not clear about almost anything except the fact that you are confused. And you see that clearly. Or things are not clear because you're agitated. But what can be simple and obvious is the agitation. So maybe with an emphasis on breathing, what is obvious about breathing? What can you know with some clarity? Don't worry about trying to see deeply. Don't worry about how you're not seeing clearly. Just be concerned about how you do seek, what you do see clearly, what you feel and sense and experience. And let that be like looking into the clear lake and seeing the simple natural phenomena that's there. The simile is a simile for awakening. What is it about this radical simplicity of being with what is obvious, independent of whether it feels concentrated or feels like some great spiritual experience? What is it about just the clarity of knowing what's obvious, seeing it as a natural phenomena and letting it be that way? What is it about that that's so valuable? So to take a posture for meditation, relaxing the eyes by gazing down and gently closing the eyes. Gently taking some deeper breaths. And longer exhales. Relaxing on the exhales. Letting the breathing return to normal. And for a few more rounds of breathing, relaxing in the body, relaxing in the mind. Relaxing on the exhales. Relaxing on the exhales. And then relaxing more deeply. Maybe settling the attention on the body breathing. And maybe with breathing as a default where your attention lands and takes in more than anything else. For this sitting here, emphasize knowing what can be known clearly. What is obvious and appreciate the clarity of knowing that. If for example you're confused about this instruction, maybe what's known clearly is the confusion. If it's a sound outdoors that's known clearly, know that whatever is clearest, most obvious, know it as a simple natural phenomena. To emphasize the naturalness of it, maybe you can have the little phrase that goes along with it. Of course. Of course this is what's here. Nothing to fight, nothing to condemn, nothing to want. Just of course this is what's happening now. And in doing this way, beginning to appreciate clarity, simplicity, directness of knowing that is not encumbered by what is known. So to fully trace ninety-five times. What is getting in the way of seeing what's obvious here and now? And if there is something getting in the way, thoughts or something else, know that simply, clearly as the obvious thing. that we now male? Whatever you're aware of, how can you be aware of it as a natural phenomena, aware only what's obvious about it? How can you be aware of it as a natural phenomena as obvious about it in the present moment? How it is in the present? Not what you're thinking about, but just thinking. Not the story of what you're feeling, your emotions. In the present, simple awareness of the emotion. Whatever it is, what can you know? What can you know, how can you know it with clarity as a naturalEYE of the spiritual...... As we come to the end of the sitting, to settle back, release any extra effort you're making to be mindful in favor of seeing clearly, knowing simply, being present for what is obvious, without any tension or straining or wanting. And if straining and wanting is the obvious, let that be what is known clearly. And to do this to appreciate simplicity, clarity, the ordinariness of being aware. And imagine offering this kind of attention to others, not being aware of others with your desires and your aversions, not judging or without bias, prejudice, without preferences, just the simplicity, naturalness of seeing clearly, letting each person that you see be someone natural and simple and expression of nature. And to, through the medium of this simplicity and clarity, to gaze upon the world kindly, to gaze upon others with goodwill, to gaze upon others with simple care, ordinary care, that you care for them, you wish them well. May others be happy. May others be safe. May others be peaceful. May others be free. Thank you. Thank you.
