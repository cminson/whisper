Greetings everyone.
And just as we ended our meditation, I ask you to put maybe one word as to what's coming up in your heart right now.
And then I'll just offer a few things that you have offered.
So many, so many things in the space. Beautiful offerings, release, gratitude.
Love, perspective, confusion.
Generosity, entanglement, a lot of it.
Some sadness, holding lightly, gratitude for the teachings, kindness, softness of heart, humanity, being present.
Transformation, easing of difficulty, loosening, rumbling heart, understanding grief.
So yeah, loosening up.
Thank you all. Thank you for offering, for offering what's arising and bringing into the space.
So today we are continuing with the theme of, with the expansion of the cultivation, compassion cultivation.
As I've mentioned, I'll review. It happens, it's done systematically in concentric circles, starting with ourselves.
Then our benefactor expanding some more, dear friend expanding some more, neutral person expanding some more, and then the person we have challenges with.
And this part is so rich, this part is so rich, this expansion of the heart.
For those we have challenges with.
As I said, before the meditation, I like to not use, in fact, in the West, we don't use the traditional label for this category.
The traditional label for this category is the enemy, but in the West, we don't say enemy.
We say, often teachers say, the challenging person or difficult person.
And I don't like to say challenging or difficult person, because if we label that person in our minds as challenging, or that's my difficult person, like, oh, that they're difficult for.
Oh, ouch, already we're labeling them, we're already our mind, our perception, our perspective is already deciding that yet they are difficult.
I'm the one doing my best, they're difficult. And that there's no such a thing we are entangled with one another.
In fact, they might think that we're the difficult or challenging person from their perspective.
So, so calling them with this label of this mouthful of the person we are having challenges with right now, right now, because maybe in the past we didn't have challenges with them, maybe in the future we would not have challenges.
But right now we happen to be entangled, we happen to be entangled, and they happen to be entangled with us.
So, so compassion for the person we're having challenges with.
Even saying that, oh, that to me in my heart, there's some, there's some release right there, it doesn't make it fixed.
There's no fixedness that oh, yeah, they're the challenging person, they're never going to change, I'm never going to change.
But, oh, for right now, we're entangled, it's just, it's a fluid thing, it's impermanent, it brings the acknowledgement of the grace of impermanence, it brings that acknowledgement in there.
Right now, just something has happened or is happening that this entanglement, because of all the causes and conditions, many of them beyond our control, this entanglement is happening.
So, so it's very important as we cultivate and it is very important as we cultivate the compassion and open our hearts little by little as much as available to release entanglement and wish well for the person we're having challenges with is,
it doesn't mean that we let go of the harm that has been done, it doesn't mean this kind of compassion.
Some people don't, don't dip their toes because they're afraid that they're going to become, they become weak, they become more vulnerable to future abuse.
No, it doesn't work that way. So, so, so hear me out.
One is that we don't condone the actions, we separate the actions, the behavior from the humanity of the individual and we might still hold them accountable, of course, for their actions and,
and, and maybe even keep some distance between us and them. As I think Sylvia Borstein says, we, we may throw people out of our lives, but we don't throw them out of our hearts. So you may decide, okay, this person.
No, it's just not appropriate for us to have contact and, and it's just too hurtful and, and it's more, it's wiser not to have, not to be in my life, but you don't throw them out of your heart, you wish them well, you wish them well.
So, so separating the behavior from the humanity of the person. And if, if the circumstances are such that you continue to be engaged with the person, again, you engage from a place of common humanity, kindness, goodwill, they're doing their best,
maybe they're screwing up, maybe you're screwing up, it's, it's an entanglement together and kindness for both of you, goodwill for both of you, and not condoning the actions again, separating the actions from the common humanity of the person.
And in fact, it takes a lot of courage and strength to have this kind of compassion and this kind of kindness for the people we have had entanglements with. It is, it takes great courage and strength, and it also gives us a sense of uprightness and compassion.
Compassion, their nuances to compassion, compassion isn't just soft and, and, and tender compassion can also be fierce, fierce compassion is another way that it shows up. Again, it shows up with a lot of care, but with a lot of wisdom and what is appropriate.
And, and when we have compassion 360 degrees, including ourselves and other people, say if this is someone with home with whom we've been in say abusive relationship when we have complete compassion for ourselves and them.
There is a sense of fierceness compassion that comes in, in our hearts like, okay, I care for you, I love you. And for the sake of myself and you, I'm not going to allow you to hurt me again anymore.
So there is a sense of fierceness out of its and it's not out of hatred, it's not out of hatred for the other person, but it's out of love for ourselves and for them like this is not appropriate. So the love and wisdom really come in to create the sense of
appropriateness. And I, in the West, we tend to call it boundaries, but I don't like the word boundaries because boundaries is already creating separation like oh you over there, you know, you, you're separate but we see the common humanity.
But wisdom creates this, this, I don't know, the sense of, yeah, this, this, this strength, the sense of a brightness, this sense of fierce compassion for ourselves and for them to allow the, to allow kindness, compassion to flow, and not enabling,
not enabling say abuse, etc. So this is a very, very important distinction to make.
So, yesterday, I promised to say a little bit about the, to say or to say more about the enemies of the near enemy and the far enemy of compassion. So we've already discussed in the past few days that the two of the near enemies are the masqueraders things that
masqueraders compassion, but they're not compassion, one of them being empathic distress, or grief, sense of grief, you're falling into the waves with the person instead of having the stability to have kindness for them.
And that's a really important one, we discussed that, you can go back and listen to number two, to day two. And we also discussed pity yesterday, which is another masquerader which is a less than oh it never happened to me.
So the compassion from this high place of oh yeah I'm up here and oh poor you, poor you. And pity is not compassion.
Now today I want to bring in what's called the far enemy, which is another word for saying the opposite, the opposite of compassion, and the opposite of compassion is cruelty is cruelty.
So cruelty is easily recognizable it's not a masquerader but say it can arise. And when for example you're trying to to cultivate say compassion for the person you're having challenges with and, and if you're in your, you bring to mind you bring to hard to come in
humanity you bring to mind the way they suffer. And instead of your heart extending in kindness oh oh you too like me oh you too like me it's like oh feeling happy for their suffering out that is cruelty.
That is the definition of cruelty, taking joy and delight and other person suffering. So if that arises please recognize it.
And then turn and then instead of turning towards yourself with with no self judgment like oh how can I have cruel this is terrible like okay pause pause pause bring in kindness and wisdom to yourself.
Okay sweetheart what's going on here you must be really really hurt to be resorting to cruelty sweetheart this is this this is not good for you this is not good for your own heart development your own karma the way you feel the way you think the way you show up in the world.
So, so, can't so bring kindness understanding acceptance and start pushing it away and trying to make into an exile, but accept and understand it. And that's step number one step number two is consider the, the, the, the deterrence the heavy weight the
the, the, the negative aspects of, of, of cruelty it's it's, it's, in fact, it's it's almost like the cruelty and you know the other negative emotions externally like anger for example it's it's in the there's a simile that it's likened to, to you wearing a skin of a dead
that snake, which is kind of repulsive and ugly right it's like it's not very inviting so so you can like you can use similar you can use some similar similes and feelings like yeah I should cruel cruelty is quite unattractive the unattractiveness and in the qualities of the heart.
So, these are some ways to perhaps if if if the far enemy if the opposite of compassion arises, if you're doing this practice you can support yourself so.
So a lot more on this topic, a lot more on this topic, but we have one more day to practice together. And I want to invite you, if you will, for the rest of the day if it's helpful to consider you and the person you've been entangled with if it comes up to wish both of you well wish both of you in this entanglement wish both of
you and see if there can be some release you can be some release some letting go.
Yes. And, and, yeah, somebody also put in shot and foida shot and foida is this this great German word, taking joy in this in the pain and the sadness of others various yeah it's that's another far enemy here with cruelty so.
So, thank you all for for your engagement and I see there's a question about boundaries yeah.
Maybe I'll just take a moment to clarify that so for me, this sense of boundaries that we use this is such a sense of separation of our humanity, but there's a way that we can have this, this uprightness but with with kindness for ourselves kindness for others.
Maybe I'll say more about that tomorrow that time has run out. So, thank you all may you be well may you practice well with kindness with compassion if there are any entanglements for the rest of the day and looking forward to practicing with you tomorrow.
Thank you.
