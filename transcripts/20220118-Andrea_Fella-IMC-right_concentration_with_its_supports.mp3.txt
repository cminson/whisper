The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So continuing our reflections on the Eightfold Path, kind of stepping out again.
We've been exploring the wise mindfulness, the right mindfulness aspect of
the Eightfold Path for a lot of weeks in the last few weeks, and kind of began a
transition last week to the next factor of the Eightfold Path, right
concentration. And I think often there are some confusions about concentration,
ideas about it that come partly from our own culture, our own like Western ideas
of what concentration are, but also influenced by some of the teachings,
and the tradition that we have that we teach at Insight Retreat Center,
Insight Meditation Center, is the Theravadan tradition. And the Theravadan
tradition includes the texts, the polytexts, the words of the Buddha that
perhaps the Buddha spoke, and then a whole set of commentaries that follow
that the number of years following the Buddha's life. There were a lot of people
who thought about what the Buddha taught and wrote a lot of commentaries about the
teachings, and those commentaries have a slightly different emphasis on
concentration than the suttas do. So all of these things come together, and I'd
like to explore this topic of concentration from several perspectives
over the next few weeks. Today I'd like to explore concentration as it fits into
the Eightfold Path. The Eightfold Path is a whole, so just as a kind of stepping
back today, kind of stepping back and looking at the Eightfold Path as a whole,
because there's one sutta that I'd like to kind of frame my talk around, and for
those of you who like to know sutta numbers, this is in the Majama Nakaia,
sutta 117, and it frames concentration as being supported by the first seven
factors of the Eightfold Path. So the factors of the Eightfold Path are
wise view, wise intention, wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood, wise effort,
wise mindfulness, and wise concentration. So the first seven of those wise view,
wise intention, wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood, wise effort, and wise
mindfulness are said to be the supports for wise concentration. And in that sutta
it also describes how the factors of the Eightfold Path support each other. So
this is kind of the perspective I'd like to explore today. The sutta that
I'm talking about kind of both describes the path factors, the Eightfold Path
factors as being interwoven, kind of like strands of thread and a rope that
strengthen a rope, so they all kind of work together. And it describes the path
factors as being somewhat sequential, that one supports, the next supports, the
next supports, the next. So both perspectives are offered in the sutta.
And I think it's interesting that that is, because it does indicate to me a
very iterative kind of kind of process on the path, we may cultivate a little bit
of wise view, of wise intention, and wise effort, and wise mindfulness, and then
that will further support the cultivation of view and intention and effort
and mindfulness, which supports more. And so they strengthen, they both support
each other sequentially and support each other together. So the teaching
around the Eightfold Path really emphasizes this one in the Majama
Nakaya that I'm pointing to, really emphasizes right view as the head of the
path. Over and over it says, right view comes first, and it's first in the path,
so it's kind of just restating that. But as it's talking about all of these
path factors, it says right view comes first. And how does right view come
first? We understand what right view is, that's how right view comes first. We
understand what wrong view is, that's how right view comes first. So a
basic level of understanding of what right view is, what wrong view is. And then
in the second path factor it again repeats, it says how does right view come
first? We understand right intention is right intention, and wrong intention is
wrong intention. And then it goes on to describe what each of these is, what is
right intention, what is wrong intention, what is right effort, what is wrong effort.
And so the first step on the path is an understanding of what leads in the
direction of freedom from suffering, because that's the basic framework of
right view. What is right view? Right view is an understanding that points us
towards the release of what leads us into stress, suffering, struggle, and
over and over again there's the teaching that what leads us into stress,
distress, unease, dissatisfaction is greed, aversion, and delusion about the
impermanent, unreliable nature of experience, basically. Impermanent,
unreliable, not self-nature of experience. And so the a way in to
understanding what right view is, is understanding that greed, aversion, and
delusion, when we want to hold on to something, we crave something, we
want to push something away, we don't like something, that it's not what's
happening that's creating the stress or suffering, but it's the quality of
mind that wants it to be otherwise that's creating the stress or the
suffering. And the delusion is that we think we have to create a different
and otherwise in order to be happy, in order to have ease. So the teaching is
fairly radical, you know, it is that what is happening is not the reason why
we're suffering, the reason why we're stressed, the reason why we're not able
to have ease or peace is not because of what's happening externally, it's because
of our relationship to what's happening externally. And that's not to say that
seeing and having a relationship to what's happening externally where there's
peace about that. A misunderstanding often does happen with this teaching, it's
like well if there's ease and peace around what's happening, why would I do
anything? Why would I take action? But that's not the way this ease and peace
works. This ease and peace is around the struggle in the present moment to
acknowledge what's actually here. It's kind of an alignment with the truth of
what's here and then from that place of non-reactivity, of not fighting with
what's here, our the wisdom and the compassion and all of the the wish in
our the the the meta-wishes, the wishes for well-being can lead us to act
skillfully, to take a step to make a choice to act skillfully. So this wise
view that is being pointed to at the beginning around our relationship to
experience being where the suffering is, doesn't mean that we wouldn't, I mean if
greed, aversion and delusion are not present, we won't be acting out of greed,
aversion and delusion, but we will be acting out of wisdom, out of compassion,
out of generosity, out of care, out of kindness. And so the the the relationship
to what's happening becomes very different. And so through this
understanding of wise view, we begin to be curious about well what is happening,
you know, what is happening in my experience. Is there tension, tightness,
greed, aversion, confusion around experience and then being mindful of it,
being aware of it. So the factor of wise, wise mindfulness comes in and we make
effort to be aware, we make effort to understand, oh there's greed present,
oh there's aversion present, and we're mindful of it. And so the the the
exploration around each of the first seven path factors includes an
interweaving particularly of a view. What is the right way, what is the view
that supports moving away from stress and suffering? What is the effort that's
needed to align with that view and being mindful of what's happening in the
present moment? So over and over again in this in this sutta for the first seven
path factors, it does this repeated kind of refrain. It says for right view, it says
a right view comes first. We make an effort to see right view as right view
and understand wrong view as wrong view. That's right view. We make an effort to
abandon wrong view and to connect to right view. That's right effort. Mindfully
we let go of wrong view and mindfully we connect to right view. That's right
mindfulness. And then he says, so these three states wise view, wise effort and
wise mindfulness run and circle around right wise view. So wise view, wise
effort, wise mindfulness kind of are all needed to support the cultivation of
wise view. So wise view is needed to cultivate wise view. And this the
understanding of this of how wise view can support cultivating wise view is an
understanding of different levels of wisdom. So we have to start with some
kind of basic understanding, you know, hearing teachings and kind of
cognitively understand wise view. What I just spoke about this this kind of
understanding of greed, aversion and delusion leading to suffering. Non greed,
non aversion, non delusion will leading up leading away from suffering. That we
can act out of wisdom and compassion and not out of greed and aversion. This is
an understanding we can hear intellectually and maybe pick up maybe
decide to this sounds like it's interesting maybe maybe I can do
something with this. And that's then leading to the intention to engage. And I
think of the intention part of the Eightfold Path really as you know the
intention that follows from wise view when we understand something we might
want to choose to engage or act. And so the intention then leads to the
engagement leads to the effort. And with that engagement there's a little bit of
deepening of the understanding for myself you know early in my practice you
know the very first few weeks of my practice I had been I'd understood that
I it would be helpful potentially to look at my challenging mind states be
aware of them. I didn't understand how that would work but I chose to try it
because well basically because nothing else had worked so I thought well let's
see what this baby this will help and and so I began to just try that you know
just picked it up and it's like trying a scientific experiment some this is a
hypothesis somebody says this worked so I'll try it. And very quickly within the
first few weeks I began to understand something deeper the value of it. And so
that's a deepening of the wisdom. There was a kind of an experiential understanding
of why it was helpful to pay attention to my difficult states. So I was making
the effort to attend to the difficult states I was being mindful of them when
they arose and I was trying on why wise view. I was like okay let's see what
happens if I do what this do with this teaching suggests. And with that those
three together it strengthened the understanding of why it was useful. It
deepened the level it deepened it from just being conceptual to having a little
bit of experiential understanding why is this useful. And so then the wise view
deepens and there's more encouragement to make the effort and to be mindful. So
again these they're strengthening each other. So this this kind of refrain or
this repeated teaching around these three it's repeated for the first seven
path factors. So I'll point to it with with effort. So we right view comes first
again. We make the we make the effort to or we understand right effort as right
effort and wrong effort is wrong effort. Right view comes first we understand
right effort is right effort and wrong effort is wrong effort. So again looking
at each of these path factors what is the path factor potentially from the
beginning understanding it's a conceptually then beginning to engage
with it. So so the the right view looks at each of these path factors the first
seven path factors understand what the what right intention is right speech
right action right livelihood understand we're wrong intention wrong speech
wrong action wrong livelihood understand right effort understand wrong
effort. So right view comes first. We make an then about right effort it says we
make an effort to end to abandon wrong effort and enter into right effort
understanding what right effort is we explore letting go of wrong effort and
entering into right right effort. We mindfully abandon wrong effort and
mindfully connect with right effort. So again these three important factors view
effort mindfulness supporting the cultivation of these path factors. So I
won't go into the the detail of you know what right effort is what right
intention is right now right mindfulness what right mindfulness is what
wrong mindfulness is right now because we've been kind of doing that over the
course of weeks. But what I want to point to here is just how through that
exploration around right view how the progression through the path feel it
feels to me like it's a deepening we take something in conceptually we engage
with it with wise view wise effort wise mindfulness we learn a little bit more
there's a deepening of understanding and a deepening of understanding what right
effort is what wrong effort is what right mindfulness is what wrong mindfulness
is and so we engage more carefully more thoroughly and we settle into all of
these path factors supporting each other like that the threads of the rope. So
all of these together really support our lives moving in the direction of letting
go of stress of ease of peace of that place where we can act from wisdom and
compassion rather than from reactivity. It's notable to me in terms of right
concentration in this teaching in this sutta that we're looking at right
concentration does not receive this treatment of the refrain that is repeated
for the first seven factors it does not say one makes the effort to abandon
wrong on concentration and enter right concentration it doesn't say that it
doesn't repeat that refrain and I've been wondering I've wondered about this for a
long time I've been curious about you know why is it you know what's going on
here for the first seven path factors it points to the effort to kind of weave
and deepen these path factors together it doesn't do that with right
concentration instead the next thing it says in the sutta after it's gone
through the first seven path factors it says right view comes first in one of
right view right intention arises and one of right intention right speech
arises and one of right speech I'm sorry right action speech action livelihood
in one of right speech right action arises in one of right action right
livelihood arises and one of right livelihood right effort arises in one
of right effort, right mindfulness arises. And in one of right mindfulness, right concentration
arises. So it points to kind of the way I understand the teaching around right concentration
in this context is that concentration is a result of cultivating all of the path factors.
It's not something we do it explicit. I mean that the piece that I find very interesting
is that for the first seven path factors, it explicitly points to effort, make the effort
to cultivate these path factors. It doesn't do that with concentration. We make the effort
to be mindful, to support the continuity of mindfulness. And the effort that we make is
way different than what we think effort is often, you know, we think of it as really
picking things up and churning. It's much more about what I was pointing to in the guided
meditation, just this intention to receive, just this intention to be with experience,
not necessarily to hold on to any particular experience. But we do need to make the effort
to remember when the mind has wandered and we come back, we need to remember that it's
useful to be mindful. We make the effort to remember right mindfulness is useful and to
engage with it. So it's a very light kind of effort. It's light in the way that we usually
think of making effort. We usually think of gathering a lot of strength and doing a lot
over a long period of time. The effort we need to make in meditation is enough effort
to be present in this split second and then we do it again and again and again. So it's
a light touch over and over and over and over. So that combination of moment to moment connecting
with experience, being mindful, as we talked about last week, it's the continuity of mindfulness.
Being aware moment to moment. This, the continuity moment to moment, so the combination of effort
and mindfulness. When there's a momentum of mindfulness and the mind is present moment
after moment without reactivity, without pushing or pulling, just aware moment to moment. That
stabilization creates the conditions for the reactivity to begin to weaken. So there's more
stability of mind, more, more, more equanimity, more balance of mind, ability to just be with
what's happening without reactivity. This is a definition, one definition of concentration.
That stability of mind, the absence of the hindrances and many places concentration is
defined as the absence of the hindrances. So this continuity of mindfulness can create
the conditions for the mind to have more stability to be with what's happening without wanting
to hold on to something or wanting to push something away without confusion about what's
happening. So this continuity of mindfulness is a form of concentration. And the kind of
concentration we often think about, what we often define as concentration in our, maybe
our habitual way of using the word concentration is when the mind is really focused on one
thing. That's often what we think of when we talk about being concentrated. It's when
we're really focused on one thing and pretty much everything else falls away. There is
a way that that kind of concentration can happen in meditation. We can choose to focus
on one thing to pretend to the breath, for instance, and just, you know, anytime the
attention gets pulled away, we kind of incline back towards the breath. And a form of concentration
can arise that has a different flavor. It feels different when we bring our mindfulness
back to one object repeatedly. The way the experience, the whole experience feels in
that kind of focused concentration, things get very still. And it's very pleasant. It
feels really good. It's like, you know, the mind just lands on one thing and it lets everything
else go. So that experience can feel very good and it's very quiet. There's not a lot
happening. Whereas in the other kind of, well, one thing I'll say about this is that too,
that kind of concentration too, results from a continuity of mindfulness and effort. It's
like the mindfulness is continuous on one object moment after moment. It's aware of
the same object over and over, but it is still a continuity of mindfulness that creates
that concentration. And so the difference between what we can call moment to moment
mindfulness, that's a form of concentration is that there can be a lot of things going
on. What's happening moment to moment can change. We can be aware of daily life. We
can be aware of a variety of experience, changing experience. In the focused concentration,
we're more just stabilized with one thing. But in both cases, there's a continuity of
mindfulness. And so we could say then that the definition of concentration, of right
concentration, is a continuity of mindfulness in which there's not reactivity and not being
pulled around by pleasant and unpleasant, but just able to be with what's here moment
after moment. And in fact, in the descriptions, because another way that concentration is
defined in the suttas, we have this definition that I just gave from this one suttamajama
117, that talks about concentration essentially being the result of the path factors. Other
places concentration is described as what's called the four jhanas. They're kind of
successively deeper states of stabilization in the mind. And often the path or the practice
leading to that kind of stabilization of mind, and this comes through the commentarial readings
actually. The teaching, the instructions often emphasize pick one object, pick an experience,
attend to that experience, stay with that experience, stabilize with that experience,
and then just with simply staying with that experience, you'll enter into these deeper
states of concentration, successively. The commentaries are the ones that point to pick
a particular object. When you look at the suttas, the suttas describe the jhanas all
over the place. They describe them, and they connect those states with right concentration,
but almost never in the suttas. There's maybe one or two places in the suttas. They're hard
to find because if you just look up jhanas and go look at the states as they're described,
what it says is basically be mindful. It doesn't say anything about picking any particular
object. It just says, mindfully, be mindful, be aware of experience. And the expression
is secluded from sense pleasure and unwholesome states when it enters into the first jhana.
So it doesn't say that that seclusion from sense pleasure and unwholesome states has
to result from a focused attention. In fact, in some places, it really points to a variety
of mindfulness practices as leading to that place of being secluded from sense pleasure
and unwholesome states. So this again points to the secluded from sense pleasure, secluded
from unwholesome states. To me, it's secluded from, so it means they're not happening right
now. It means that the mind is kind of in a place where, I mean, it's temporarily in
a place where reactivity is not arising. And that happens with the continuity of mindfulness.
We can temporarily enter into, I mean, and that temporarily, in my experience, is very
interesting how, again, with concentration, we often think of it needing to happen over
a long stretch of time. And that's what the absorption thing kind of does with the focusing
on one particular experience. It can create the conditions where we enter into a state
that lasts for quite a long time. It's quite lovely. But that's not to disvalue or to deny
the value of moments of mindfulness, continuous moments of mindfulness that can happen for
us. And they might happen, you might end up with a little like burst of continuity of
mindfulness in daily life even. It can happen, you know, just in the midst of doing something,
that there's a kind of an arising of mindfulness and a very clear seeing, a very clear understanding
of what's happening in the present moment and seeing what's skillful and what's unskillful
in that moment and watching the mind abandon an unskillful direction and enter into a skillful
direction right in a split second. My experience, you know, little bursts like that can be
right concentration that allow for the seeing of what is helpful and what is not helpful
and clearly let go of suffering in a moment. Again, kind of a temporary freedom, a temporary
release from suffering that we understand following that kind of experience, you know,
we might experience this kind of seeing, very clear seeing of, oh yeah, the mind doing that,
that's that way lies suffering. I don't think so. And moving a different direction. That
really can support our understanding of this is useful. Gotta keep doing this. This is
helpful. So kind of an understanding of the path. The path is a whole. All eight strands
of the Eightfold Path, kind of being there in that moment, supporting each other and
showing us, yes, this is the direction. So right concentration can be understood, I think
really the definition of the continuity of right mindfulness as the basic definition
that when there's that continuity of right mindfulness, the greed, the aversion, the
delusion will temporarily be at bay. And there can be very clear seeing, very clear seeing
of what is suffering and what is not suffering and seeing the release of suffering. And we
can also cultivate concentration through the practice of mindfulness with a particular
object. So both are valuable. But we don't have to, we don't have to have that focused
concentration in order to be on the path. My understanding of this teaching from from
the the magama, that right concentration is the result of the cultivation of the first
path factors, a very deep cultivation of in particular wise view, wise effort and wise
mindfulness. So there is that continuity of mindfulness. We can open to comments and questions
if there's any comments or questions about about this topic. Yeah, Fred.
Can you, am I on mute? Yes. Can you say something about the relationship between concentration
and equanimity? So, yeah, they're there. There's several threads here. What I would
say is that, you know, so concentration itself is not equanimity. I mean, you can, you can
have a concentration. You can have wrong concentration, in fact, you know, the mind can be kind of,
you know, absorbed into something that's not that's not onward leading. So, you know,
concentration and equanimity are different qualities of mind in the way they're cultivated
in the Eightfold Path. Equanimity is kind of a result, also a result of the cultivation
of the stability of mindfulness. So the the, you know, equanimity, we could almost define
as non reactivity to what's happening in the present moment while it's happening. In the
focused concentration, there's not a lot happening to be a quantumist about. It's just, you know,
so, you know, in a way, there is an equanimity there, but it's it's it's not being tested,
we could say. And this is one of the one of the challenges in effect around the the kind
of concentration or one of the drawbacks, we could say one of the weaknesses, maybe not
really a drawback, but a weakness, let's say, of the kind of concentration that's developed
on one particular object, because it's so narrow that, you know, the kind of equanimity
that's there is not being kind of cultivated around a variety of experiences. And so the
mindfulness, the concentration that comes with mindfulness, moment to moment, the changing
experience, we really get to taste what it means for the mind to not be reactive. So
they're definitely similarity or differently. They come at the same in the same terrain,
you know, when the mindfulness is continuous, when right mindfulness is continuous, there
will be kind of this non reactivity. And that is the the kind of the mind that is stable,
the stable mind that's just able to be next moment, next moment, next moment, and the
mind that is not reactive to next moment, next moment, next moment, very similar qualities.
In a way, you know, it may be as like splitting hairs to say they're different, but we can
see slight differences between them. And the feeling of equanimity, I think it comes more
to the fore in that moment to moment concentration, you know, what the feeling of equanimity is.
The real, yeah, there's something and it's almost in seeing something that would have
created reactivity, not creating reactivity, that we understand what that equanimity is.
That's a great question. Thanks, Fred. Thank you.
Other questions. Yeah, Kate. I'm definitely going to listen to this dharma talk again,
because it felt very interwoven, like, but is one aspect of what what you were saying,
basically that kind of right new heads the field, because if we want to delve into any of the path
factors, we can we look at them and our and our understanding are living with them from the view
of the right view of does this lead to suffering or does this lead to the release of suffering?
Yes. Yep. Yep. And that this also points to in a few places in the in the suit as it does
point to the wrong eightfold path, you know, that in one of right view in one of wrong view,
one who doesn't understand this, you know, so somebody who goes around thinking that, yeah,
happiness is going to come from getting what I want, you know, thinking that greed is the way
to happiness. They're going to act on greed. So the intention is going to be to act on greed.
And you know, so that's wrong intention, which leads to potentially wrong speech, you know,
wrong action, wrong livelihood. And, you know, the effort that's cultivated there is the effort to
get more of what I want. And, you know, there's not the understanding of this actual pattern that
you're in, leading to the stress and suffering that you're feeling to try to get out of. So there
is a little bit of description in the suit as it's not mentioned too many places about the
wrong eightfold path. And so the importance of understanding for each path factor, what is helpful
and what is not helpful in terms of leading away from stress suffering, leading away from
greed, aversion, delusion. And that would be right mindfulness needed to under in order to
understand that. Exactly. Yeah. And so it's so interesting how they're connected and the right
and the right effort to, you know, be interested in knowing that difference. Right. Yeah. And it was
Majuma 117. Yep. Okay. 117. Yep. Anything else? We're almost at time, but something short maybe.
Okay. Well, it's almost time to stop. So we'll just end here.
