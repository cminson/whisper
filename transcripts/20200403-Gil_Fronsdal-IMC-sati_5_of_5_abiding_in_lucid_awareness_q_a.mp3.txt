Sati (5 of 5) Abiding in Lucid Awareness  + 
Q&A  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on April 3 , 2020  
 
 
This morning will be the last  talk of the five-part series 
on the faculty of mindfulness. Over these weeks , I’ve 
been  going through each of the five faculties , discussing  
one faculty per  week . I’ve done three now: faith, effort, 
and mindfulness. Those of you who ’ve been following 
along might have  picked up that these  five talks are 
progressive. I ’ve been talking about these faculties from  
the perspective  of different points  on the path of practice 
as it deepens or strengthens.  
 
For the discussion  of mindfulness, the first day was  
about  what I ca lled initiating mindfulness  -- the practice 
of simply  coming back, waking up, reconnecting to 
what’s  here. Th is takes a certain kind of effort  and 
engagement  – a commitment to keep coming back,  
waking up  and recognizing that we’re  here. As we begin 
to get more in the flow of the present moment, the 
recognition factor grows stronger . Clearly recognizing 
what ’s happening  -- recogniz ing sound s and sensation s 
for what they are – is a very important part of 
mindfu lness practice .   
Part of the art  of mindfulness practice  is simply  this 
recogn ition,  without our preferences, desires, aversions, 
complex associations,  thoughts,  and interpretations.  
Just let the recognition be very plain and simple, very 
clear, a clear acknowledgement of what’s happening . 
As we learn to do this, it’s possible  to have  more  
continuity with mindfulness and awareness  in the 
present moment . Then , it’s possible to observe, to 
simply settle back and observe , over time , how things 
are goin g. It’s possible  to observe breathing, to observe 
sounds, to observe thinking as it passes.  
 
You sit and watch  as if observing train cars going down 
the track or boats going down the river . You don’t jump  
onto the train or  the boat , you just watch them go  by. As 
observing gets stronger, it has more continuity . Then, 
it’s possible to see how things exist in the course of time 
-- brief moments of time. In particular , what I mean is 
that it’s possible to  see how t hings are inconstant. 
There’s a  flow of life and change, a constant coming 
and going , an arising and passing . Mindfulness enables  
us to see change, inconstancy,  and impermanence.  
 
One of the functions of this  seeing  is abiding in 
observation. As the practice develops and we see the 
impermanence of things , it helps us loosen the grip of  
our attachments, our preoccupations, our resistance to 
things. Then , that quality of abiding becomes stronger. Perhaps even the sense of  the observ er falls away  and 
there’s  just a sense of awareness. S ome people 
describe this as a field with things simply  existing within 
it. Things arise and pass , and  there’s a strong sense of 
a quality of awareness , or clarity , space , beingness , or 
restful presence. Things happen , but that sense of  
awareness doesn’t change.  
 
In the  Buddha’s teachings on mindfulness, he calls this 
paṭisati. It’s a rare word in the suttas . I think of it as lucid 
awareness. The renowned translator , Bhikk hu Bodhi , 
sometimes translates  sati as lucid awareness. But I 
think that this really clear awareness, in which we know 
we’re  aware, has a reflexive quality of , “Yes. I’m resting . 
I’m here . There’s awareness. ” The sense of clarity , 
awareness, and knowing , is so clear , peaceful and  
spacious , that it’s almost like its own thing, independent 
of what’s  known. This  idea of knowing something that is 
independent of what’s  known,  is getting close to the 
idea of how mindfulness brings freedom. In talking 
about  how it’s possible  to abide in  paṭisati, the Buddha 
talked about this abiding as synonymous with  not being 
dependent on anything in the world, not clinging to or 
grasping anything in the world.   
 
So, regardless of how we understand abiding in 
awareness , lucid awareness , abiding in presence or 
beingnes s – we know we are in its territory when we 
can feel that whatever arises in the moment is not something the mind  or consciousness  is in any way 
dependent on  or caught in.  It doesn’t rest on it.  The 
mind rests and abides in awareness.  There is no 
grasping  of anything . The awareness that’s present, 
when there ’s no grasping , no dependence on anything,  
when you’re  not being influenced by anything  – just 
here – is a profound state of peace.  
 
In this way, I’ve talked about mindfulness as a 
progression. There’s  beginning  mindfulness , 
intermediate  mindfulness , and more developed 
mindfulness. It might be easy to assume that  people at 
the beginning stage  are simply  beginners. Those 
who’ve  been practicing for some time are  into the 
intermediate stage. Then , there are people who’ve  been 
practicing for a long time who are at a more advanced 
stage. But I think that even those who are mature in the 
practice  are beginners most  of the time . There’s  no 
fixed number here , but for  the sake of discussion , 
probably sixty percent  of the time they ’re a beginner. 
They’re  initiatin g mindfulness, coming back and waking 
up. They might be an intermediate practitioner about  
thirty to thirty -five percent  of the time . Perhaps  they’re  at 
the stage I discussed on  Wednesday  – just being able 
to observe in a clear way , not interfering with things too 
much . Four or five percent of the time, t here might be 
some higher quality of awareness  – abiding  in or 
dwelling in awareness without much clinging or 
attachment . And, perhaps  one percent  of the time , there’s  a really high -quali ty feeling  of peace  and 
expansiveness . Whether  or not  these numbers are 
accurate is not the point.  
 
The point is that we’re  all beginners at times. The 
essence of practice is to be at the stage where you are . 
Practice with how you are. What I’ve seen in mature 
practitioners is a sense of ease , a willingness , and an 
acceptance of practic ing where they are. Practicing as a 
begin ner is just fine. It’s the practice of that moment.  
 
There’s  a wonderful saying about  mindfulness 
meditation: “The fastest way t o go from  point  A to point 
B, is to fully be at point  A.” Wherever you are,  whatever 
circumstances you’re in,  mindfulness is practic ing with 
what you have. Really do that.  
 
And i f you find yourself  as a beginner  over and over 
again, then that’s your spot to practice. That ’s the place 
to find your ease. Keep showing up . Keep waking up. If 
you’re able return  to recogniz ing, and you’re  able to  find 
some freedom in that recognition, that’s your place. If 
you’re able to rest back and observe, that’s your place. 
If you ’re able to see the inconstancy of phenomena, 
that’s your place.  If you ’re able to tap into the mind’s 
capacity to abide in awareness, to have lucid 
awareness with very little clinging, attachment, or 
dependency  on anything , that’s your place. Wherever 
your place is , it’s your place.   
I will end with what  is, for me , a lovely  and inspiring 
story, an analogy  that the Buddha gives about 
mindfulness practice. He talks about  the monkeys who 
live in the forests , in the  jungles of northern India, 
somewhere in the interface between the foothills of the 
Himalayas and the plains of the Ganges. The Buddha 
said that if the monkeys go f urther up into the mountains 
where there are steep cliffs and crevices, it ’s dangerous  
for them up there. If they come out of the forests into the 
plains where there are no trees, then they ’re susceptible 
to being caught by hunters. But if they stay in their  
home country, their  native land, in the zone between the 
high mountains and the plains, t hen they’re  safe. In the 
same way,  the Buddha said, the practice of mindfulness 
is a person’s native home, their home country. His 
original language is “ancestral lands.” If you stay there, 
then you’re  safe.  
 
The faculty  of mindfulness  is your native land , your birth 
place, the place where you most belong. It’s a home 
you can take with you wherever  you go. If you stay 
close to it, there’s  safety there. If you don’t stay in it, 
then you’ll encounter  dangers . 
 
Next week we’ll talk about the fourth faculty, which is 
concentration or samādhi. The last faculty  we’ll do  is 
wisdom.  
 If you ’d like to ask question s now, I ’ll stay and try to 
answer  them . 
 
Q1: "Does this abiding include the breath focus or can it 
release even that? ” Thank you. “How can you work on 
returning to not grasping in the breath or the pleasant 
feelings of abiding?"  
 
One of the very  important principle s in Buddhist practice 
is that we don’t focus so much on ‘doing’ the  ideals  that 
are present ed, ideals  such as not grasping at anythin g. 
It’s a bit dangerous to try  directly  to live up to an ideal , 
to hold ourselves in that position.  In mindfulness 
practice, we use the practice to see what’s  actually 
going on. If what ’s going on  is that we’re  grasping, then  
that becomes  what we pay attention to. The way to 
come to non -grasping is to understand grasping well. It 
might be grasping the breath , or grasping  pleasant 
feelings, or even  grasping  the idea of abiding.  That‘s 
suffering. That ’s beginning to  cause tightness or 
contraction or stress. The recognition factor – 
recognizing grasping , clinging, resistance  – doesn’t  
mean  that we’re  trying to dismiss what’s  there. Rather , 
we turn toward it to  recognize it and see it clearly. Then 
we learn the stress and discomfort of grasping. We 
become wise about what we’re grasping , and wise to  
the trickery of grasping. Over time, as we become wise, 
we begin to grasp less. Then , as we grasp less, what 
emerges is the ability to abide in awareness more. We’re not  forcing ourselves into abiding. We’re  patient 
and we take our time . We grow into seeing clearly  
what’s going on  and how we operate.  
 
Q2: Can you say more about staying motivated , 
especially  in the beginning and intermediate stages  of 
practice ?  
 
Great question. There are two sides of practice. There 
is the path that is onward -leading , the path that  takes us 
to freedom from suffering. Buddhism has a lot to do with 
going from suffering to the absence of suffering. There 
is the path, but at the same time, mindfulness can help 
take us on that path. There’s  something about 
mindfulness  – that moment of recognition of being 
aware of something  – that has, inherently,  qualities of 
peace , qualities of  freedom , and  qualities of non -
reactivity. I’d like for pe ople to learn , right from the 
beginning , to look for and experiment with  how a 
moment of mindfulness is a moment of freedom , or a 
moment of peace. It doesn’t have to be dramatic. How 
can it be useful and valuable , so that you’ll  never regret 
having been mindful , so, if you’re  a beginner for the rest 
of your life, you’ll  say to yourself : “That was a life well 
spent  – all those moments ”? Each moment of 
mindfulness is, in a sense, complete in itself. That’s the 
idea of going from  point  A to point  B by being fully at  
point  A. For a beginner , or for anyone,  I greatly value 
really explor ing, really  finding out  for yourself , how a moment of clear mindfulness is something you’ll  never 
regret  having.  Find out for yourself how  this moment  
was valuable to see and  be present  for. If you do that 
exercise, you’ll  probably  be much more at ease with 
where you are at any stage  of practice.  
 
Q3: “Aversion to aging, illness, and death, and 
judgment s about  things happening in the world right 
now make it difficult to find a place of calm abiding. How 
can you find this abiding out in the world? ” 
 
It’s a very good question, one  that I think many people 
share with you right now. There’s  a lot of uncertainty, 
stress, fear, and distress about what’s happening the 
world . This is the time to practice, more than any other  
time, I think. We want to bring a lot of compassion to 
studying our distress, our difficulties  and our challenges  
with what’s  happening right now.  
 
Begin looking at how you’re reacting  to it. What’s going 
on and w hat are you doing? Maybe first, it’s important , 
in certain situations , to allow your heart to break. These 
are difficult times.  There’s a lot of pain and suffering. 
People are dying. People  are up against really difficult 
and distressing circumstances  – in hospitals and 
elsewhere . There’s a lot of distress in families , and 
sometimes home is not a safe place to be.  People are  
cooped up with each other in ways that they usually 
don’t have to be.    
There’s  a way of practic ing in which we  radically  allow 
ourselves to be how we are. Let the heart break. Allow 
ourselves to  feel how difficult it is in the wake of all this. 
Feel it i n your body. Use all the skills of mindfulness you 
have. Do it in small doses. Touch in. Sometimes I like to 
give the instruction that when things are really hard 
inside , with a lot of difficult emotions, imagine that 
mindfulness is a soft cotton ball that  you gently touc h to 
the wound and then  pull back. It can be too much to  use 
mindfulness  to go right into the difficulties and  to stay 
there. Have the wisdom  to know  that it’s valuable to 
see, recognize, and acknowledge what’s there, and to 
make space for it, even if it’s  two moments  of space . 
Then pull back. Then, when you’re  ready, touch  it again.  
 
We’re  looking at how we can allow this beautiful heart 
we have to find its way to resolve what’s  going on for 
us. It takes a lot of honesty . It takes  a lot of discomfort 
sometimes. Mindfulness practice can be talked about in 
wonderful ly ideal istic ways  – in peaceful  ways . I 
apologize if I give that impression too much. A really 
important part of mindfulness practice is learning how to 
be comfortable wi th discomfort  – to learn about our 
reactivity, our beliefs, our sense of self  – all the things 
that come into play. I hope that you realize that 
practicing mindfulness with discomfort is actually  a 
really important part of mindfulness . This is not public ly 
advertise d! Don’t go looking for discomfort , but if it visits  you in your practice, that’s  an important part of learning. 
Learn how to be more equanimous, non -reactive . 
Become  wise about what goes on inside of you.  
 
A day will come when you learn to be comfortable with 
discomfort. The world is an uncomfortable place. It’s 
inherently an unsafe place  in many ways . The 
coronavirus  pandemic  highlights what’s  always been 
true: this world is a fragile place,  and dangers are ever -
prese nt. Sickness, old age and death come sooner  for 
some people than for others . What’s happening now is 
highlighting , in a way that’s distressing and  difficult , that 
now’s the time to practice.  Practice  begins with  simply  
caring for yourself, with compassion for yourself,  with 
getting exercise,  getting food,  talking to friends, doing 
what’s  needed to come into some kind of balance. Once 
there’s  some balance, maybe the practice can take you 
more deeply  into it.  
 
Q4: “Why does mindfulness seem to wax and wane 
over the days, only to be stronger after retreat and then 
fade away or be easier during peaceful times , and 
harder during stress? ” 
 
I suspect  that it has a lot to do with our preoccupations. 
We get involved and active , thinking about  things  – all 
sorts of things that come along . The more we’re 
concerned about things, the more active we are, the 
more pre occupied  we are  – the more the groove of thinking operat es. We’re caught in  our thought s, 
involved in our thoughts . There can be mood shifts, 
emotions c oming and going. We can have a  good 
night’s sleep,  or a poor night’s sleep.  There can be 
something physiologically going on with us. We might 
not be our best self. There are so many variables that 
go on in human life.  
 
Certainly , on retreat there’s  a calmness,  a steadiness,  a 
strong factor of concentration, a  sense that we have, to 
some degree,  clear ed the  table of a lot of 
preoccupat ions. When we return,  all of those things 
begin to wane.  Preoccupations come back.  
Concentration wanes. It’s hard to keep the same level of 
concentration in daily life that we’ve  had on retreat. But  
again,  really be at point A, and don’t be so concerned 
about the ideal.  
 
Learn how to practice with what is. If that’s  complicated , 
if we’re  preoccupied  or agitated, there’s  this wonderful  
art, this real  treasure , of mindfulness. In a certain way, 
accept what is . Don’t be in conflic t with any way that you 
are. See if you can start discovering how there can be a 
moment of mindfulness, a moment of recognition : “Now 
this is how it is. ” In that simple recognition  of: ”This is 
how it is ” – without fixing it or trying to make it go away . 
Things are  still uncomfortable , but there ’s a gap , a little 
crack  in our experience , where there  is some degree of 
peace, freedom, ease, acceptance, or non-conflict , in which t here’s  space for more compassion,  more wisdom 
– and w e can find our  way.  
 
Q5: How not to be afraid?  
 
How not to be afraid? Don’t cling to anything 
whatsoever. Most fear is a byproduct of clinging  to 
something  or being attach ed to something. My  short  
answer doesn’t really respect the complexity of what’s  
needed to be with fear , the care that’s needed to be with 
fear.  
 
One of the  wonderful  little instruction s that I give around 
fear is : when you’re  afraid, help your fear feel safe. If 
you’re  distresse d about your fear, then it won’t feel safe 
to be there. And your fear  will be more afraid. The whole 
system will be  more upset . If you feel that it’s wrong to 
be afraid , or if you’re  afraid of fear, this all makes it 
more complicated.  Your fear is a very i mportant part of 
who you are.  In a sense, f ear is an attempt  to take care 
of you. It’s a movement of self -care, of s elf-protection. 
Sometimes it may be misplaced . Sometimes it  involves 
acts of imagination  – fears of the future that aren’t 
realistic or  even  appropriate. But regardless  of that , fear 
is still a wonderful  movement of self -care and  self-
protection. Take that fear and hold it in  the cupped 
hands of awareness . Help it feel safe. A great  mantra 
for fear is : “It’s ok . It’s ok .” Do t hat, especially  in 
meditation , and see what happens to the fear. Fear will begin  to thaw  – fear will begin  to relax  – if it starts 
feeling that you’re  a safe person for it . It’s like a small 
child who’s  really afraid. You aren’t going to 
psychoanalyze the child. The child  will just turn off or 
get more afraid. You aren’t going to tell the child to be 
different. You may bring them  over and put your hand 
on the ir shoulder and say , “It’s ok . It’s ok .” Help the child 
feel safe , and maybe give them a treat or something to 
drink . Help your fear feel safe.
