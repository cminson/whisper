 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Good evening. Good evening and a really warm welcome. Wherever you are, whenever it is you're listening to this or watching this, a really warm welcome. So we'll begin with a guided meditation. Just arriving, arriving at this moment, this place, this occasion. And just feeling into this moment, feeling into the body, feeling into maybe that general mood. Is there some anticipation or maybe some lack of energy, some dullness? Maybe there's some brightness, some uprightness. Whatever it is, can we welcome, can we welcome it? Include it. Letting the attention rest in the sense of having a body. How do you know you have a body? What does it feel like to have a body? And then rest in the attention on the parts of the body that are breathing, the movements associated with breathing, feeling in the chest or the belly, feeling the expansion and contraction and then expansion, contraction, feeling into the rhythm of the breath. And then rest in the attention of the body. And when we notice that the mind wanders, as it's apt to do, apt to do, we just very simply, gently begin again. And then rest in the attention of the body. It might be that there are some sounds, maybe some uncomfortable sensation in the body. Can we allow these experiences to be there? After all, they are there. Can we not wrestle with them or push them away? Just allow them to be there without turning them into problems. There is sound. It sounds like this. There is throbbing, stabbing in the knee, perhaps, without trying to shove it away, the experience. But instead, having an openness, a spaciousness, allowing that experience to be there, it might be that with our allowing, allow something to shift, maybe the ecosystem of the mind, of the experience to shift. And perhaps the problem-ness of the experience drains away, or maybe not. For the purpose of this meditation session, can we soften any sense of having to fix things, make them be otherwise, and instead to allow them to be as they are, our experiences, not big conceptual ideas about the nature of society, but our felt experience in this moment, the experiences of breathing, the experience of hearing, the experience of having bodily sensations. Thank you. Thank you. Allowing doesn't mean that we agree or approve with our experience. It means we're not wrestling or struggling with the experience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
