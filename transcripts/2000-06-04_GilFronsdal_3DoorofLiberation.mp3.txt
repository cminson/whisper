 For those of you who have been keeping track of the series that I've been doing this year so far, in a sense I'd like to continue. Maybe you thought it was over. And so some of the themes and ideas that seem connected to it. Now one of the central purposes of Buddhist practice is the experience of liberation. I prefer the word release than the word liberation, but certainly liberation is fine. Liberation, freedom, release. And there are many different levels of release, of freedom. One of the common sayings in the Buddha Dharma is that the Dharma is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. And our encounter with ourselves and just even the smallest amount of letting go of the clingings, the contractions in our heart, the fears we have is good. And we do it at the middling level, that's good. And we do it all the way, that's good. It doesn't matter whether one person is a beginning person or intermediate practitioner or advanced practitioner, Buddhism. The same movement of release happens, can happen at any level at all. But in talking about release or liberation, there are what's known as three doors of liberation. And these three doors of liberation are the three doors, traditionally in Buddhism it's said that people step into this possibility of freedom. There's three avenues to step into it. Three ways in which we can encounter the world that are clinging and holding and our resistance and our fears and our things that kind of cause suffering for us can be released. And these three doors are not so well known. They become more important in a sense in Mahayana Buddhism where they pick up one of the doors and make it the whole door. And the three doors are the door of emptiness, the door of the signless, and the door of the wishless. So what's that supposed to mean? The signless, the emptiness, the signless, and the wishless. And now the emptiness is the one, the Mahayana. It's the first one in the list and it's the one which the Mahayanaists... If you study early Mahayana, you see that they started off referring to these three doors and emptiness was referring to the door of emptiness, this particular meaning of emptiness. And then they dropped the other two and then expanded there to become this very wide and rich and deep philosophy and practice. Now the three doors of liberation are these three doors and they are said to arise when a person encounters very honestly and very completely, very honestly, the three characteristics. Now three characteristics are so important in early Buddhism, in Theravada Buddhism, Vipassana, that sometimes in early translations into English, they were called the three signatas, did I pronounce it? You know, the signatas are kind of borrowed from Christianity, right? They're like, what are the signatas? What are they? Like stigmata, stigmata, sorry, stigmata. That's when Christ had this, you know, when they had the evidence of the nails in his hands. So they're so important that they have that kind of name. And I find in the American Vipassana community, sometimes the three characteristics, because they're so central, dealt with and talked about almost as if they're a dogma, that the belief system is based on these three things. And people are always often referring to them almost, I think, almost in kind of fundamentalist ways, which says something about their importance. Maybe we're not supposed to take them to that degree, but they're very important in the tradition. And the three characteristics are impermanence, suffering and no self. And these are all the characteristics. Sometimes you find them referred to as the characteristics of everything, of all reality. They have these three qualities, everything, the universal nature of all things is there, impermanent. There's something to do with dukkha, with suffering or unsatisfactoriness inherent in them. And there's no self to be found in them. I think that it's better not to make a metaphysical claim about the nature of reality. I don't think that Buddhist practice is trying to make some claim about what reality is like, but rather is focusing on the nature of our experience. And since that's very important, since we build our notions of reality on our experience, initially, to understand something about the nature of how we experience reality is very important. And the focus on meditation practice is not only to get calm and centered and peaceful in a sense, but to help us see very clearly the nature of how we experience the world and how we build a reality based on that experience. And the characteristics of every single experience we can possibly have is it has those three qualities. It's impermanent. I think it's very hard to argue against that. There's something about which is unsatisfactory. And that maybe needs some explanation why Buddhists say that. And there's something about all our experiences that it doesn't qualify as a thing to call ourselves. This is my permanent self, who I really am. Absolutely. Our experience is because it's fleeting and changing. It doesn't qualify some permanent sense of self. So these three characteristics then are very fundamental to Vipassana practice, is beginning at some point to move into seeing these universal aspects of our experience, which for some people can seem uninteresting because what's mostly interesting is their personal story. What's happening to my life, my particular challenges in my life, my particular joys and ambitions and all that. And so we often want to relate everything through the filter of what it's like, what it means for me. And I was concerned about coming down and giving this talk today because I didn't have any nice story to tell for the talk. And I've been told that you're always supposed to tell a good story because then people can relate it to themselves. And I think that's maybe a wise thing to do. But we always want to relate it to ourselves. And often that's to our own story, our own history, our own biography, which is a fine thing to do. But Vipassana practice eventually is supposed to help us look at that which it doesn't necessarily relate to our particular life story, but relates to that which is universal to all people. And this is the three characteristics. And these three characteristics when honestly confronted and met with lead to the three doors of liberation, which I'll talk about. So the three characteristics in shorthand, you can refer to them as things change, it hurts and don't take it personally. So that takes care of whatever bizarre philosophy you think is behind it. Things change, it hurts and don't take it personally. The first one impermanence, usually we start with the first one impermanence. And in some traditional forms of Vipassana, the unfolding of practices follows that sequence, first realizing permanence, then suffering and then no self or not self. So impermanence. Let me say this though, in all three of these three, these three characteristics can be each understood from three perspectives. I'm sorry for all the number of threes today, makes it easy though. And that is that there's an obvious ordinary level that you don't have to be Buddhist to understand. And then there's a practice level, the level of understanding them from insight, from intuitive direct seeing of the nature of things. And then there's a liberative aspect of it, the ways in which they open to doors of liberation and you walk through those doors, you have the experience of liberation. And I think it's a little bit useful to distinguish between those three different levels, because the ordinary level is something that we can talk about quite in an ordinary way. And it's not necessarily Buddhist to experience impermanence and get sick and old and die and to notice that mountains wear down and things change. But often in Dharma talks, that's the level in which teachers will often focus on is the ordinary level, the level of success to all of us, the level of our lives, the important level of our lives. And in thinking about how I didn't have stories today to tell you, I thought about how some of these wonderful talks I've heard about impermanence from Dharma teachers, some of the ones that were most impactful, the ones who talked very movingly about their experience of being with a dying parent and what it was like and what it was like to meet themselves and meet the parent and meet impermanence. And the very direct confrontation with the dying of a parent or a loved one or something. And it's very moving and it's a very important part of life to encounter that and see that and find out who we are and our priorities and the account in the face of that level of impermanence. I've told the story often enough, but now I have a story, of my friend who went over to Stinson Beach on a nice Sunday afternoon. We went to the beach with her bathing suit towel and her keys, Dharma's license, and came out of the home to find out that her fire had disappeared in the Oakland fire. And our home was also her office and all the documents and everything she had was burned in the fire, just a matter of an afternoon. And so we often have this kind of very direct encounter with ordinary, what we call ordinary, not so ordinary, but ordinary impermanence. It's so obvious to all of us, especially as we get older. And this ordinary level is the one that takes a lot of wisdom maybe to see and to deal with and respond to. And a lot of the wisdom that comes as people get older comes with actually negotiating, dealing with and encountering the ordinary level of impermanence that maybe when we're young we don't necessarily look at, we don't see, we don't accept, we don't even think about. As the Mahabharata says, as it's often said, is, what is the most marvelous, miraculous thing that exists in this world? Oh, it's that people see suffering and see death all around them, but no one believes they're going to die themselves. And certainly can be true for young people. When I was young, I had no, you know, someone asked me if I was going to die, of course, I'd say yes. But you know, how I actually operated my life, I was living forever. And I think a lot of wisdom comes as people get older, not just from life experience, but a lot of wisdom comes because as they get older, they can see their end. You know, it's harder and harder to avoid the fact that there's maybe only 10 years left or 20 years left or 30 years left, but you kind of begin to imagine or sense, oh, it's coming. And that kind of highlighting our life from the perspective of the possibility of dying, which is kind of the ordinary level of seeing impermanence, is phenomenally important because it, for many people, encourages them to really look at the priorities of life and what they're, how they've chosen to live their lives and what's most important. They have a phenomenal, important question that Jack Kornfield has highlighted. He said that many people that he claims and many people on their deathbed don't ask, you know, how well did my stocks do in my life or how, you know, what kind of bonuses that I get at work or what kind of promotions that I get. Rather they ask more central questions like, did I love well? How did I love? Was I able to express love well? And you find a tremendous emphasis in Buddhism on reflecting on death, this ordinary common experience of impermanence, not to be morbid, but to really highlight the value of our life as it's being lived and to focus on that value and to use it well. And this is a kind of inspiration in a sense. But this ordinary level of impermanence is something that, you know, you don't have to be a Buddhist to deal with and almost every, every tradition and culture has somehow addressed it and seen the wisdom of it. It goes back in the Western tradition, at least as far in our memories to Heraclitus, I think, who said, you can't step in the same river twice. And some of this, you know, the ordinary level has to do with our particular story. So I'm not discounting our story, but that's kind of where that level resides. But there's also the more important level. I don't know. I shouldn't say more important. I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't put these in a hierarchy. There's also then the insight level, the level of seeing impermanence that comes from mindfulness practice, deep, concentrated mindfulness practice. And this is not seeing the rising and falling of mountains and countries and people and whatever, but rather to see beginning to investigate the nature of our experience itself. And in seeing that if we bring a very careful attention to our immediate felt sense experience, that it actually is constantly changing. If I'm looking at someone and having a conversation, it's easy enough for me to have a fixed notion who that person is. They said something five minutes ago and I see them as being, oh, they're such a kind person, or I see them as a very unkind person, or maybe it was 10 years ago they did this one thing. And I see them through a filter of some attitude, some idea I have of who they are. Or things. One of the attitudes I used to have about money is that money was basically permanent value. It's like you look at a dollar bill and it's in God we trust and that means that I can expect to wake up in the morning and God is still providing. But my experience in Burma where overnight they removed most of the nominations of bills from the government declared they were invalid overnight. I woke up in the morning and I had these bills and my bill folded and they were no longer had any value. I said, oh, I guess these some things are not, you can't count on them being permanent. So we operate kind of under the assumption with filter of things being kind of permanent because we have these ideas, these attitudes, these dispositions about them being a certain way. But if we can get behind the veil of ideas and concepts of what we think things are and actually experience them directly, we see they're constantly in change. We look someone carefully in the face, you see their expression and feelings and attitudes may be constantly changing moment by moment, minute by minute. And it's quite fascinating to see that change and not to have some fixed idea of who this person is. It's very important for me to do that with my child who's changed changes every 30 seconds. Right. And if I'm kind of a little bit behind, you know, oh, that's what he was five minutes ago. You know, it's a recipe for problems. So I have to kind of be constantly looking at who is this person now? Who's a person now, as opposed to some minutes ago? So so my practice is helping us look behind any attitudes or fixed views or beliefs we have about what what's there and seeing how we actually see what happens when we see things directly in the moment itself. If we do that, we see our experiences are changing much more rapidly than our fixed concepts and ideas are. And this is very, very important element of mindfulness practice is to begin chipping away at the frozen concepts that we hold reality in. And it isn't simply a belief in impermanence in permanence that we have. There's a there's a kind of a dispositional attitude, a new saya, a kind of latent tendency, a dispositional attitude that's deeper than some belief or some idea that things are permanent. We relate to things with an attitude of permanence. So, I mean, it was really, you know, a week ago, maybe I said this here at some point, but it was a week ago where my son had a cold. And whenever he has a cold, he's pretty moody, pretty cranky. And my underlying attitude that day that he was cranky, even though I kind of knew better, was, oh, my God, you know, this is, you know, what are we what are we created here? This is it. You know, we have this cranky person. I'm going to deal with this for the next rest of the rest of my life, this person, you know, and where do we go wrong? You know, we do our childbearing methods, all mistake. You know, and it was just like he was just, you know, just one day, you know, a few hours. And and I think and then, you know, there are times when I had the wisdom to see that and I've turned to my wife and said, oh, we're having one of those days now. And that just makes all the difference. You know, OK, it's one of those days. But I have to kind of sometimes remember that piece of wisdom because this is kind of sometimes this underlying kind of subtle attitude as if, oh, this is it. Now, if you ask me if this is it, I'll say, of course not. But what we know and what we what our attitude is sometimes is not always the same. And that's why the mindfulness practice is so phenomenally important because it's trying to get down to a deeper level than our beliefs into attitudinal, dispositional level of who we are. And in order to do that, we have to begin seeing our experience in the details of how it's constructed, the place where it begins in the felt sense, the immediate sensory, sensory moment to moment beginning of experience. And that's the function of mindfulness practice is to help us do that. And as the mindfulness gets stronger with more concentration, you drop below layers and layers of these attitudinal kind of ways in which we keep ourselves kind of objectively in a in a in ideas about things. And as the concentration builds, what we find is our experience in strong concentrated mindfulness is that things are constantly changing. Not just second by second, but microsecond by microsecond, constant flux and change. And maybe many of you had this experience of going into something in your body, some strong physical sensation like a pain. And you get in there and zero in on it very intimately, very strong mindfulness to actually pinpoint where the pain is. And you find out you can't pinpoint it because as soon as you find the pinpoint of the pain, it flashes out of existence and reappears a millimeter to the side. And it's actually becomes this dance of sparking sensations that don't have any particular place that can pinpoint it or certainly not more than just for a flash of an instant. And wow, this thing is this pain that was so solid is actually constantly in flux and changing. And it could often be a little bit easier to be with strong pain when you realize it's actually constantly changing than it is to be a distance from it where we tend to see it through the filter of these attitudes and dispositions and ideas of what's there. Now, in stronger the mindfulness is the deeper, the more faster we see the impermanence of our experience. What's actually happening here is a little bit hard actually to know. And maybe I should maybe this is going into a little bit more complications than you guys need to think about. But it's the way I think kind of the the the investigatory mind. Some Buddhists then will say that impermanence is this level of impermanence is how things actually experience moment by moment. The fundamental building blocks of experience. I don't know if we can actually say that we can certainly say that's how I'm experiencing things right now. But to go one step further and say this is the nature of reality or the nature of nature of how experience actually is built from the very basis, I don't know if we can go that far. But it doesn't matter because we're trying to do once we kind of get below these attitudes and ideas we have and seeing things directly, then we have we have a very strong experience of impermanence. But one of the things we start realizing is it doesn't make sense to hold on to anything. There's nothing there. No image there. There's no fixed ideas there. There's no beliefs there that works as something to hold on to. Because in that moment, the things are flashing in and out of existence. If you try to hold on to something, it's already gone. And we also realize the degree to which our grasping to things or resisting to things is very little to do with experience, even though we think that's the case. But it has a lot to do with ideas and concepts of what's there. I believe we only grasp on concepts. We don't grasp on things itself. So as we begin seeing impermanence very clearly and seeing there's no concept there, no ideas there, no images there that we can actually grasp on to, then a very deep seated tendency, attitudinal tendency to grasp or to resist, begins to relax. And you can tell a person all you want, oh, there's no need to grasp, there's no need to resist with life and you can just be open and trusting. And the person can believe that at the belief level, but it doesn't really reach down to the attitudinal level, the dispositional level deep down inside. And that's one of the functions of very deep concentrated mindfulness is to really reach down there and massage, soften, relax these deep roots of dispositions that we have. And so when we really confront impermanence very, very powerfully, very deeply in this meditative way, this opens to the third level, the liberative level of impermanence. There's the ordinary level, the inside level, and then there's the liberative level. And that's when it opens up to one of the doors of liberation. And the door of liberation associated with impermanence is translated into English usually as the signless, which doesn't usually mean anything to anyone in English. What does a signless mean? It can be more literally translated as the the imageless. But I think it means we see that the experiences of life don't correspond to or don't fit nicely into some category or idea or image or sign of how things are. And so we realize that that reality is more mysterious or more elusive or reality is more fluid than any idea that we can have on it. So to see the signless, the imageless, the idealist nature of reality is not to say that ideas are wrong to have in their own place, but we see that the step into liberation, into the deathless, is to step into that reality, which we don't relate to through an idea or a sign or an image, animita, animita, which is signless, is imageless. So for some people, for whom impermanence becomes really highlighted, really pronounced, they will step through the door of the signless. Other people will step through the other doors. There's no you don't have to go through all three of them. Just different people based on their personality types or whatever experience will take different ones of these doors and have a little bit different experience than liberation, depending on the door they step through. So when those people, for whom impermanence is really strong, they'll step through the door of the signless and they'll have a very deep insight into the nature of concepts and ideas. Some people suffer a lot. That's their door. Maybe that's what you think you fit. I don't know because a lot of people suffer a lot. So the second characteristic is dukkha, suffering. And Buddhism can be seen as a response to the suffering, a fundamental point of Buddhist practice to help us not suffer. And the Buddha said, I teach one thing and one thing only, suffering in its end. And so there's certainly the ordinary level of suffering that we all see and we all know about so intimately. And as we get older, we know, you tend to know it more intimately than we care to. So many people that we know die. And so we get older, you know, slowly, slowly we find ourselves as being the last generation. Oh, it's, you know, everyone before us has already died. And there's all kinds of suffering. You can, you know, we can go through a whole litany of the kinds of ordinary suffering, so-called ordinary sufferings we have. And meeting and being very honest and meeting and confronting this ordinary suffering is a source of tremendous wisdom and importance. And is one place of release. Remember, dharma is good in the beginning, middle and end. So even at this ordinary level, it's good to meet it and be honest about it and understand it, the nature of our suffering and how it works. But there's also the insight level of this second characteristic of suffering. And the insight level is not, you know, so ordinary. And probably the word suffering is probably not the best word. As an insight level for translating Dukkha. But when the mindfulness gets very strong and we see our experience directly for what it is, we see the unsatisfactory nature of our experience in a number of ways. But in the primary way, it's often talked about that our direct moment experience of life is unsatisfactory as a place to rely on for security. Because if you're holding on for a moment moment experience for security and it's constantly passing away, then it's not reliable for that. It's not reliable as a place to hang your hat of self. This is who I am. If you see in your moment moment experience, you can't find the self because everything's constantly changing. Your experience is not reliable as a place to hang on yourself. And for some people, it can be very frightening to enter into this deep place of insight where we actually drop below all the ideas we have of things and see things more directly as as impermanent, the flow of things, a change of things. Because we rely so much on security to feel comfortable in life or so much on some sense of self that we can orient ourselves towards life. Then not to have that makes us feel very exposed and very vulnerable and very afraid. And it's very common in deep meditative practice for people to go through a period of that practice where they get quite afraid. Not everyone, but it's common enough experience. And then that's impermanent too, luckily, right? And we pass through that and go to some deeper level where the fear is not there. And there's another level of the insight level, and that is at some point we have the experience of all these different sensory experiences, all these basic experiences we build life out of as being so incessantly annoying. And this is very hard for someone who hasn't done deep practice to kind of appreciate because it's kind of like it just kind of agitating. You know, oh, it's like all this stuff is always being I'm always being impinged on. It's like living maybe with, you know, half a dozen. You know, teenage boys, you know, are constantly with teenage girls, I guess I don't know, are constantly playing their music and yelling and on the phone and, you know, just like, oh, my God, you know, when is there going to be some peace here? So at a particular moment, that doesn't last very long, but a particular moment in the in the sequence of inside practice, there can be this experience of, oh, my God, you know, I'd end up living with it. Well, just, you know, everything's just kind of so oppressive. All this stimulus I would like to I would like what I'd like to have is to go beyond all the stimulus to a place where I'm not impinged by all the stuff. So as the door of suffering, some people, the door of suffering, the experience, the characteristic suffering gets really highlighted, really strong. And it's not necessarily pleasant, but it's not, you know, it's not necessarily your choice about which of these characteristics are going to be strongest for you in your practice. And for some people, different points in the practice, different of these characteristics stand out for various reasons. And and when the experience of suffering is really unsatisfactoriness is seen very clearly. Some people then will step through the door of the wish list. That makes some sense, right? Is is wish list means you have you give up all wishes for things to be any different. You give up all you need for anything to be different than how they are. You give up your attachments. You give up. It's kind of like I don't know if I don't know if this is speaking or not. It's kind of like I don't know if I don't know if this is fair to call this, but it's kind of like this is what I'm saying. I was giving up, right? You kind of maybe the face of suffering. You kind of realize, wait a minute, it doesn't make sense anymore to resist. It doesn't make sense anymore to try to want things to be different. I'm just going to be really honest about this and relax into the suffering. Just let it be as it is and be wish list about it. Not try to direct myself or get somewhere because every attempt to get somewhere to make something happen just seems to make it worse. So I'll just relax into this wish list state and that sometimes then will allow the total release of all the different ways, dispositional attitudinal ways in which we still cling and we have the experience of non-clinging. Each of these three doors is a way of experiencing total release of clinging. Then the last door, the last characteristic is not self, non-self, which opens to the door of emptiness. And non-self is to realize that in my experience, I can't find something which qualifies as a permanent self, as something I can really say this is who I am. I can certainly back off from my direct experience and kind of get a gestalt idea of how things are and make that that's who I am. I can certainly get a sense of how many different factors work together and that's kind of the harmony of those things or lack of harmony of those things. It makes a sense of self. But if I look very carefully, I can't find a self the same way that you could. The classic example is that of a chariot. You can get a sense. We can talk about a chariot in very intelligent ways and useful ways and and. And it's maybe useful to know, you know, this chariot out there, it's going to take me home and go, can I borrow your chariot to race around the ring or whatever we do with chariots? And but if so, what is the chariotness of the chariot? Where can I find a particular thing which really is that chariot? So you take off the wheels, just the chair, wheels, not the chariot. Is this the, you know, is the axle? No. Is the box a stand? And is that it? No. And finally, you've left nothing that is there because, well, wait a minute. What happened? I lost the chariot. Or to make a little more modern example, if you take a friend of yours to Stanford University and you're going to your friend wants to really see what Stanford University really is. And you show me, go on for show them around for a while. So here's, you know, the psych building and here's the history building and here's whatever. Dingle spiel and whatever. And they say, this is great, you know, but where is Stanford University? I mean, it's all of this. All of this. All these buildings? No, no, the buildings don't really make Stanford University. The people are here. All the people are here. Well, not, you know, which people? Tourists like me who are wandering around, you know, or is it? I want to see the heart. What is the really the heart, the essence that makes Stanford University? Is it, you know, and you can't find anything, right? It's the Gestalt of all these different things. So a kind of similar way, the self in Buddhism is if you start looking for some experience, which is you, you won't find it. And then that shifts your relationship to the notions we have about who we are, not that they're invalid, but you realize the degree to which they're constructed and created out of our mind. They're just like it's very arbitrary what we say Stanford is. It's actually fairly arbitrary when we say who we are and we can construct and arrange ourselves in different ways, in different times. So so that so some of this, you know, an ordinary level, you can go study anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and it's very common these these last decades for early scientists to say we can't find a self. What do you mean? I mean, and they have better arguments than Buddhists do for, you know, why you can't find a self. I mean, if you want to really get into it, the Buddhists don't have, you know, it's a good one, but the Buddhists have, but it's not particularly not one of the great arguments for no self or non self. Just go go to Stanford University and take a few classes and you won't find anything. And so it's not just Buddhists who are saying this. So but so there's this ordinary level. But the inside level is to actually see a moment moment or experience. It doesn't make any sense to miss a moment to make this a self. And the people then who see this very clearly highlight is very powerfully. There's no self here. There's no self to hold on to or to cling to or defend or to make into some kind of way or construct or to hide or whatever we do with our notion of self. That's one of the ways to experience total release, to let go of clinging entirely is through the door of through the characteristics of seeing through self and no self. And some people will take that door and that door, that door is a door of emptiness. We realize that all our experience is empty of anything permanent and abiding that can qualify as a self. There's no self nature. There's no intrinsic nature behind or our experience, which we can call the self. So the experience of emptiness, then, is phenomenally important. Now, the reason for this insight practice, maybe I said already, is that we really need to address the deep attitudinal, dispositional level of our life. If we're only dealing at the level in which we think about things and how we organize life and things like that, you can get a lot of worldly wisdom. And actually, I know people who never done any Buddhist practice who have a lot more wisdom than some Buddhists because they've just been very honest about confronting life as it's lived in the ordinary level of suffering and suffering. And impermanence and self and no self and all these things. One of the people who, you know, I don't know, I didn't know her that well. And so maybe I'm projecting onto her, but I knew my great grandmother and I knew her, you know, obviously, at the end of her life. And I used to go sit with her and have Darshan with her. She would sit in this little apartment building, tenement apartment building in Norway, with wood burning stove and a little living room full of lace, every white lace everywhere. And she had this perfectly white afro. You know, these round faces, red cheeks, kind of like from Minnesota or something. And she would sit there in front of her, you know, sit there in her little chair and do her lace or crocheting, whatever she did. And we hardly ever talk. I just sit there with her. And I had a sense that this is someone who was not didn't need to be anything for anybody anymore. Just totally at peace with herself in life and didn't have to be anything for anybody, didn't have to prove anything to anyone. And, you know, she had discovered maybe, I don't know, maybe more than the ordinary level, but she had gone through maybe because of her life experience, come to a place where there was all this wisdom about who she was or wasn't, what she needed to do and not to do. And it was like this wonderful. Ambrosia, this wonderful drink that I would just imbibe just being in a present was so great just to sit there and just take in a person who was so comfortable with themselves. But the ordinary level doesn't always go and get down to the deep, deep, this divisional attitudes that we have. And that's why it's so important to practice. And that's why all kinds of wonderful books, philosophies and even intuitive kind of sense, oh, this is a really true teaching, whatever the teaching might be. We can have a very powerful, intuitive sense of truth and kind of intuitively can kind of enter us and kind of little bit kind of shape how we see things. But it doesn't really get down to the deep, this divisional attitudinal level of what really drives us. If we're really honest, we'll see it doesn't really get down there. And a person could spend a lifetime kind of feeling intuitively in touch from the start of the ideas that seem to work so well and not really get down there to the deep, this position levels of what's going on. And so that's why the mindfulness practice is so important. And over the years, as you do practice, you'll be able to settle more deeply below that level of your ideas. It's very great to drop below the level of ideas because you can drop below the levels, the level of those ideas that you're doing it right or doing it wrong. Isn't it great? You don't have to be concerned about whether you're doing it right or wrong because it's an idea. Anyway, they get down deep below these attitudinal levels so that then we can get down to the roots of how we cling and hold. And so we can have experience of release so that all that binds and restricts our heart can be dropped and the heart can shine and radiate freely and openly. We can let its nature radiate out to all the beings in the world. So the three characteristics are directly correlated to three doors of liberation, impermanence to the door of the signless, suffering to the door of the wishless, and non-self to the door of emptiness. So the last thing I'll say is that both American culture overall is generalization and Buddhism focuses on freedom. Somewhat the difference between the two as a generalization is that in America a tendency is to people to look at freedom as freedom to do. I want to have the freedom to do whatever I want. And in Buddhism the focus is on freedom from. Freedom from that which restricts us or inhibits us and binds us. Freedom too sometimes can very easily mask that we're not free. We're free externally to act whatever way we want, but we're being driven compulsively by the forces within us. We have not freed from the compulsive natures of forces within us. Buddhist practices focus on the freedom from the compulsion within us, the fears within us. And then what we do with that freedom is our responsibility. So that was a talk without any stories. Maybe that's enough. If we're running a little bit late, I apologize for not getting time for questions. If someone wants to have questions or comments, welcome to stay behind. And I hope I see many of you this evening and maybe next Friday.
