 So, in thinking about today, coming down here to our group and sitting with you, I thought that this might be a good day for me not to talk so much or not to start with talking, but rather to give you a chance to ask questions. I think it's a good thing for us to do periodically and we haven't done it for quite a while and it gives me a chance to hear what's going on and what concerns you have. I don't think people come on a regular basis to practice something like meditation or inside meditation unless it has some importance in their lives. A lot of people here in the room practice regularly every day and even if a person just comes weekly and I think it's a big undertaking to do and life has a lot of demand, a lot of things, a lot of other things you could do instead. So, I have a lot of much appreciation that it's very important for many people who come and I was wondering what kind of concerns or questions you might have about your practice or about the practice in general that somehow comes out of that sense of importance that it has for you. Yes, please, Hilda. Would you say your name before you start? Question? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm if you can… Don't be able to remember quickly and no one is good. You know, having wants is a two-edged sword. So, on one hand, I hear the sincerity of your want and how beautiful it is and I'd like to support that. And the other hand, maybe not for you but for many people have that kind of wish, it's also a setup to suffer more because we don't live up to our ideals or how we think we should live or you know and we come into situations where we think we should have been more present, more mindful, more compassionate, but we weren't and so then we measure ourselves against you know other ways of being how we think we should have been and if you come to a if you do a regular practice then sometimes you have a sense of your potential, a possibility of way that comes comes across much pure, greater compassion and presence and it highlights even more how we're not that sometimes and it can seem even worse you know worse often we started because and they have to be very discerning or wise about our wants and how we hold these things. I think that in times of crisis that which you know when you're using CPR it's time of crisis. Part of it is having done a lot of practice beforehand so it's kind of like it's kind of become a habit or you have certain stability that's already there and if you're expecting practice to call on your practice you don't practice in a regular basis and call on your practice you know in a time of crisis you don't have as many resources to call upon but if you practice regularly then it's there with you it kind of you're carried along with you some kind of strength, some kind of presence, some kind of skills of mindfulness and presence that are helpful and one of the skills that I find very helpful is to regularly check into my body, find out what's going on in my body. So there are times in my life where that's just almost automatic and so I find myself in difficult situations and I'll check into my body and my body becomes there's a very number of things for me. One is that it shows me what's going on for me if I've tightened up or gotten tense or anxious or whatever. My body also shows me it kind of by checking in with my body it kind of it's little bit tends to break the trance that I might have if I'm caught up in my thoughts, my concerns, my anxiety about certain situation it kind of creates a little bit sense of independence or I don't want to say distance because that suggests maybe the wrong thing but a little independent in the midst of it and it's kind of stability in the body and not so caught by it. The last thing I'll say is that your intention that you express is quite beautiful and that intention I think is there other situations hopefully than just you know a crisis where you need CPR and the more you the more you can act on your intentions the stronger those intentions become in your life or more those intentions are ready at hand in situations where you most need them. If we have good intentions we don't act on them then they don't kind of sink in as deeply and they don't take root as deeply so even it's even small ways to be in acting on our intentions to wake up be present and compassionate builds certain momentum and then carries over into times of crisis. Recently though I heard you suggest some other relationship that they have to each other and I remember when I heard it I was moved by it that it was something about moving putting your breath back to your attention or some other way of stating it that just okay okay was it's very common in meditative circles to talk about bringing the mind back the mind goes off and we bring it back and and it's you know it's in a kind of colloquial way of speaking it's fine but does your mind really go anywhere and that kind of image or idea of the mind going somewhere and bringing it back lends itself to being active with the mind actually kind of sense sometimes I'm moving the mind and sometimes people will pounce back at the breath you know jerk the mind and the mind goes off with the thoughts and you jerk it back and and sometimes people are actually quite harsh around how they come back and they could mind wanders off and the judgmental about that they're upset and and this is perfect proof that you're a bad meditator and therefore you know let's you know and all kinds of things happen that are all extra not that are not needed so so the idea of kind of moving the mind is kind of a strange and suspect vocabulary even though it's used a lot and and other things are just as valid way of talking so another way of talking is when you notice your mind has drifted off maybe or what you lost in thought and then bring your breath back to your mind so so when you've noticed that your mind has wandered off you know when you notice that you're lost in thought whatever the description you want to use at that point when you notice there is mindfulness there already and so to honor the mindfulness already there is so much unusual usually we then follow that by a little judgment I'm in the wrong place I shouldn't have been drifting off I should be with the breath but just before those judgments there was a moment of pure awareness oh here I am wandering off and to to appreciate that and then realizing that awareness is already there then invite the breath back into that awareness and then the mind is unmoving the mind is still and and it's actually the nature of the mind to be still so we're coming back to its true nature that making sense yeah I started sitting in 1984 with sister I came on it was essentially a little different style and noting Sati Patana and then I did some going and I did a variety of different loose practices roshi aiken and then because I was on my common Steve and kind of continued in that tradition of the noting so forth in Jack this whole sort of tradition most of us are teaching spirit rock teachers so of late I've been reading a lot of ajang sineido acham cha and there they deemphasize it seems the note in terms of practice technique and and emphasize because they're monks either precepts Selah you know those kinds of things that the precepts for us to if we live our life you know as attentive as we can with precepts and everything else will take care of itself that's ajang sas you know kind of let go of the little get a little let go of everything get everything and so it's a simpler practice and all the years that I practice there's been a sort of an earnestness you know like Adrian Ross talked about clobbering each thing that comes into awareness you know it's like it was funny because it's really it can happen to us you know we get stuck in this oh there's a thought there's a feeling bang bang bang you know like we're in a carnival you know shooting these things down and I'm late I've kind of given up the noting yeah just sort of I'm in the city well that brings me to the second I wanted to see what your point of view about that is you know first of all that sort of playing around with these different traditions the Thai because you know say it up who pandita is like boom you know you know and so that was one quick thing and then the last thing is personal I've had plenty of very loud sentences for a long time many years and it's being it's being supported right now yeah but it's a different frequency but longer teaches fashion you know come into play but it's late because of some other conditions I've got pretty serious and I was listening to a talk by I was on some made open armoureux saying that they listen you know they put their attention on that silence or on what they you know and I think this can't be my my mind this has got to be it's so loud that if I put my attention on it it starts to make me nervous because it doesn't tend to arise and pass away my attention to it arises and passes away which is the same in a way the same point right but I've been advised by other teachers Steve so forth not to make that my primary so that was that was my personal question to you what is your position on a loud predominant sound my position well I don't have a policy paper on this yet I'm working on it I'm working on it there is in there is in the tradition both in little bit in the Theravada tradition and certainly the Mahayana tradition the idea of non-abiding Nirvana non-abiding Nirvana and non-abiding has a sense of having no position have no place where we rest and the idea of having views and opinions is understood in the tradition to be very potentially dangerous and a source of suffering certainly for our neighbors if not for ourselves and and so the attitude we have with the relationship we have to opinions views about practice is very important in the tradition and not to cling to it not hold on to it not that fixed use the and one of the first fetter that's removed a classic description of what gets removed or what you're liberated from as you become liberated is is the clinging to virtue to precepts and clinging to religious practices so it isn't just an attachment of views and opinions that are pointed towards being a problem you can actually cling to religious practices also so there are you know scores and scores of different ways of practicing mindfulness and you live went through a list of some of the options that are around there's a lot of other options also and then how do you will how do we relate to all the different ways of practicing and I know some people will feel that you know there is the true way this is the best way and some of that's kind of innocent it's just there this is what they'd know and they're enthusiastic you know so you kind of you know listen politely and kind of appreciate their enthusiasm and sometimes it has a little bit of a fundamentalist quality and this is the other people don't do it right and this is the true way and and then the question is then how do we find ourselves how do we negotiate the all the different practices is being offered if we encounter let many of them and what do we do about finding our own practices whether on experience like your tinnitus and I think part of it is remember that the Buddhist tradition focuses on skillful means the word pāya kusala is a very important term in the tradition skillful means and skillful means is that means that that is skillful in any given situation what's helpful for you to move you towards greater liberation and to the fruits of the spiritual life and we need to recognize that different people have different doors to the Dharma different ways different means which are helpful for them and I'm very fond of the story of the Buddha where he was sitting probably under a tree sometime and he was pointing around to his very senior disciples who are around different places in the woods there and said oh over there is Shari Putra and and those people who are really into studying wisdom they sit there and practice with him and all those people who really into meditation they go over there and study with Mahamud Goyana and those over there who really like precepts and and living the monastic life following the precepts well they're over there with upali and the people over there you know and so you get a sense that the Buddha was appreciating how different different personalities are and different people are and appreciating that each of these people had you know their own way that they found and so maybe there are many doors and so to have some idea of a one way or the best way the only way I think is a short is is a problem for we talking to many people at once the mental noting is a technique that as you said that the Mahasi tradition made it made a lot of it becomes central feature of Mahasi tradition and that's the kind of primary meditation primary meditation tradition which informed the teachings at IMS and at Spirit Rock in my own teaching and so however the teachers in the West don't put the same for the most part their exceptions of course but as a group don't put the same level of importance for mental noting as some of the teachers in Burma do it's still emphasized but there's lots of leeway given to not to not to use it and often I once was going to give a whole talk at Spirit Rock on mental noting and the other teacher said they got kind of nervous you know people get the wrong impression or what about the people who don't do mental noting and they're gonna feel is not okay and and so so there's much more latitude here if you know to do different ways and recognizing it's not appropriate for everyone to do mental noting and also recognizing there's different ways of doing mental noting you don't have to do it every possible experience but some people only mentally note their thinking or and only use mental noting for their breath therefore the feeling to have experience kind of special ways of doing it so different skillful means different ways of finding it one of the principles that became very important for me as I was encountering Vipassana in Burma in Asia was it became very clear to me that the the development of the practice over time had a lot to do with trial and error that the teachers would give you advice you know teachers give you great advice you know you come here to IMC and I give you brilliant advice right and and and it really doesn't mean that much and it's it's good hopefully but what really counts is that you get some ideas of how to practice and then you try it out and you see what works and no I don't think any teacher can really tell you how to practice they give you kind of a broad brushstrokes for practice and then as you try to do it then you kind of find the nuances how to do it for yourself and how to personalize it and find out what works for you and there's a process of trial and error that goes on you try this little bit and that seems to work or that doesn't seem to work so you then you make a little adjustment and does that seem to work and and there's kind of a process of discernment that goes into the practice and part of the discernment is to is to notice whether you're being too agitated too agitated too exploring too much and never settling down and always looking and trying and being restless looking for all kinds of things there has to be a subtleness and relaxation as you go into the practice for tonight is I've heard various of devices advice about it one advice that I've heard is ignore it this is not a use you can eat I would never talk about tonight is but there are a couple of things that you find it does said don't pick even though you said even the rhetoric was pay attention to everything but don't pay attention to these things and so one of the things was don't pay he said but he said don't pay attention to your heartbeat don't let that be kind of so focused for attention might know it a little bit here and there but don't kind of focus on and I've heard people say don't focus on the tinnitus and I've heard people who who suggest taking it on as a practice and ajana amara was the person I know the most and he calls it the nada and he kind of finds support from it from a Hindu tradition this is not a text in Hinduism that focus on the inner sound and the fact that it doesn't change lens it is very supportive in his view and kind of is tending towards stealing of the mind and towards that that the unchanging reality of the banana and I have never followed the that sound myself I've had it sometimes very strong on retreats and was troubled by it and never I don't feel like I really was able to on retreat come to a place of great equanimity comfort or whatever just allowing that sound to be there sometimes it comes and sometimes it comes very strongly if you develop concentration then sometimes concentration will lock on to things that you don't want to lock onto you know we're trying to get our concentration focused and centered on something and and finally gets you know there and centers on the wrong thing you know you're trying to do your breath and it centers on this tonight as you know please or you know sometimes a little more commonly you know you get this concentration going and it locks on to writing the great American novel and you know you can't get off it because that's where the concentration is going and then some point that you get off it and you go on with your practice so I've got on and on trying to know I appreciate thanks funny three years and lots of events. So my kids' reaction is cursed. My kids' parents' curse. And I had such a different reaction that I've been holding all week, which is we're chosen. I feel like my family's been chosen to handle a lot of diversity. And I find it an anchor of strength. But as I shared it with people outside this community, people are kind of looking at me and responding about what kind of moving to my life I can share. I don't know how I'm going to handle it, or how can I have this kind of reaction, or what's going to shift. But it's about someone to get your reaction to that discussion. Is that a good way of knowing? It's holding me in a very positive way, not to deny the fear and the sadness, all that's for real. It might be a great way of holding it. It's hard to know for sure. The attitude that we're cursed seems unfortunate when to hold. And if simply the pendulum is swinging to the other side and it's kind of playing the same game of judging our experience in some way, or evaluating our experience in such a way that we overlay it with an understanding, a sense of meaning, that it's kind of playing the same game, maybe it's not useful to say we're chosen. And maybe not having any meaning at all, just meeting the moment as it is, is what's needed. We have such a strong meaning-making kind of tendency in the mind to make meaning out of it, and conclusions, large-scale conclusions, rather than just focusing on this is what's happening right now and let's just take care of this the best way we can. If the attitude that we're chosen is one that supports you looking for the... how to practice in this situation, how to purify oneself, how to find in difficult situations come forth for the best within us, how to value our capacity to meet situations with kindness and service and feel so unfortunate, it's unfortunate in circumstances, but here we're given the opportunity to be of service and be compassionate and this is really wonderful and to appreciate that as a kind of an opportunity. I think it's beautiful to do that way. In my own mind, I would probably be reluctant to go around telling people I feel chosen just kind of casually because I think people will hear it in funny ways. People won't understand what it means. You might say something like... Instead, I can imagine saying something like, yeah, it is unfortunate that these things are happening, it's hard and I take comfort, I find support, I find strength and understanding that there's also an opportunity here and try to meet this in a way that, you know, tries to help the world or help myself or help others or my family or try to cultivate my compassion, I don't know. That does sound different. So the second part is that anything can trigger what I'm about to say related to mindfulness, but after this news came, the next day, I had a silly but unfortunate accident in the shower because I wasn't conscious of thinking about it and conscious is constantly working on this thing. So I had an accident and I ran through a red light and I had no signal yesterday and that could have been very, very dangerous. So when we're working, the question is when we're working on something, both on the surface and very deeply, how do people really need to bring mindfulness to the floor because it can be very disruptive. Yeah, I understand. What I suspect is that it would be very useful to give yourself some quality time to let the deeper occurrence bubble up and work and process themselves so they don't necessarily have to process themselves in other times when you can kind of shower is kind of a time when a lot of the concerns of life fall away a little bit. So I can imagine things bubbling up or imagine your mind sinking into these concerns and dealing with them, kind of like with sleep sometimes the same way. But maybe daily meditation practice is one for example or journaling or there's various ways of giving yourself some quality time to let yourself sink into the deep currents of what's going on for you, deep feelings. And it might also sometimes be opening up to the difficulty, the horror, the pain of this kind of stuff. And only by doing that during quality time can you more realistically look for the opportunity in the situation as you address it in daily life, kind of on the surface of things. And then also if you take care of these things you know and your mind knows you have time to take care of these things in a quality way, then when you are driving maybe the mind is less likely to be pulled into that world to stay more attentive. Yes? My name is Jim. I was a practice Christian. I've been dealing with pain from the release of tension in the back. You described to me by my teacher the Dharma pain. And I know associated with the strong sensations there are also emotions put off of fear and a hatred. And I'm not sure that I can really find in my body the sensations associated with the aversion that seem different than the strong sensations of the release. So I'm wondering how, and I'm working on trying to see if I can see the aversion to fear and the hatred and the dislike of what's called time. To see that it's somehow separately or distinct from the strong sensations. Oh I see, so there are strong sensations in your back and that seems to be associated with fear and hatred. Those emotions seem to be in that environment. Specifically, I can be following a strong sensation in my back and then there will be a time when it will suddenly start to get a little stronger and I'll feel some contraction, which I think is like there's fear that it's going to get worse. Oh I see, so fear, I see. Yeah, not fear or hatred of something else. It's of the spirit. Oh great, good, I see that. How do you think, I've been working this for a while, how would one look, try to see those emotional reactions to the experience differently than the experience itself? Does that make sense? Well it makes sense now, yes. I remember times when I've had a lot of knee pain in meditation and watching the relationship between my mind and the pain and seeing how when I started having thoughts of self-pity that my muscles would tighten up around the pain and it would get worse. So I could see the thoughts, I could see the tightening around the pain and I knew that tightening around the pain was not the pain itself, but rather had to do with how the mind was reacting to it. And it was really clear, sometimes it's been really clear. So one way to investigate is not, the other thing I found useful sometimes when I've been spending a lot of time focusing on my body in meditation, body sensations, is periodically backing off from the body and noticing what else is going on, what are the feelings that might be there, what are the thoughts, the beliefs, the attitudes are going on also at the same time. Because sometimes if you're staying very close with the mindfulness of the body, it's very easy to miss some of the other things going on that need attention in order to kind of take in the whole situation. So sometimes shifting the focus a little bit can be useful to kind of get a bigger aspect of what's going on. My strongest sense of listening to you is I wonder whether it's necessary to be so diligent. Well, the reason that I demoted for that was that my teachers on the retreat were talking about seeing if you could watch the aversion all the way to exam, so kind of seeing it's thinking so that the sensation may still be there and the aversion to it would come and go. You could see it coming and going, but I couldn't, not sure that I could see something that I would call the aversion, distinct from the physical sensation well enough that I could see it kind of changing and going. That's kind of my motivation. It's a good one. Some things we don't see until we've watched for a long time. And so we have to be patient, just look and watch, and sooner or later something will be revealed and say, oh, that's how it is. And sometimes when we have an idea of what we're looking for, it turns out it's not that way after all. And so I spend hours and days and months looking for something that's not even there. So, you know, oh, wow, that was a waste of time. The next one is teaching. And certainly it's very valuable to explore and look and kind of study more carefully what you're doing. But you have to be a little bit careful also not to overdo it. And the way I was trained in Burma was there wasn't any real poking around like that or analytical way. You just were content to be very mindful of what was actually here without any idea that you're looking for something or looking for something different or looking for some way. So if there's pain right now, then become very attentive to that pain. And then if that reveals itself as being different qualities of that pain or different reactions to it, then great, then study those nuances that you notice. But you don't have to do anything but be relaxed about noticing what's actually here. And so the Vipassana question that Vipassana students would carry with them all the time is the question, what is this? And the question, what is this? What is this that's already arisen? You know, this that I've already noticed, you know, that's what's already here. Can I look at this more carefully? Can I see this more carefully? But not so much to kind of look behind it, but just to see it more clearly, if that makes sense. And then those things might be revealed, but... So I wasn't there, you know, at the retreat knowing how the teachers were advising you and what was happening to you. So it's hard for me to respond, but I know that generically my general approach would be to encourage someone to be very simple about the mindfulness, simple but very precise rather than be having that kind of looking too much for something. Could I make a comment? Because I'm wondering whether our attachment to trying to see this experience, the grasping, is an element that could arise as a result of that. So, you know, you look very deeply, you want to penetrate, you want to, you know, sort of look for the impermanence. But we can become very attached to that too, and our minds can wither, you know, in a sense around that. You know, we lose our freshness, you know, looking so hard at something. Right, we can be too diligent, we can be trying so hard, be attached to seeing a certain way. Or we can hear from some, somewhere from a book or a teacher that our experience is supposed to be a certain way, and we're trying so hard to make it that way or to see it that way, and it could just get in the way, make us tense and brittle. Yes? Could you say simple but precise? At times with mindfulness practice, you want to be very precise with the mindfulness. Sometimes, we talk sometimes about putting on different lenses in our awareness. Sometimes you have a broad angle lens, and you kind of take a panoramic view of what's happening, and that's how you are in the present moment. And other times you take a close-up lens, and you get very, very precise, and you're almost like, you're down to almost like the atomic level, seeming a cellular level of the experience. And that's what's called for in the practice. And part of the art then, this trial and error of the art is knowing which lens to have at any given time. And sometimes it's appropriate to switch lenses, like I was talking to Jim, that sometimes I'll be very much my body, very precise, but then after doing that for maybe five minutes or something, then I might take a broad angle lens for a few seconds just to check out, am I missing something here? Am I kind of focusing so much that I'm actually not paying attention to what needs to be noticed right now? So I just take a broad angle lens for a while, and sometimes something reveals itself that I should pay attention to instead. And sometimes it becomes clear I should go back to what I was paying attention to. Steve? I've also found that if you draft a low, a high magnification lens, really close, you have a tent of, if there could be something else going on using a very good effort. And so as soon as you sense that, you become intense, being a close, open the lens, and then really that pressure can't get you attention. Yeah. Yes, please. Hi, my name is Jessie. And I'm just more new at this, and I'm finding that I seem to be getting more isolated from my friends. You know, I really, at this time of my life, I'm kind of lost, and I'm like meeting the family, and, you know, the friends have been around for years. And I find that when I go to places, I don't want to, it holds nothing for me anymore, you know, the smiles, all of that stuff. And then when I talk to them, I say, well, you're not here, you know, you never invited me about it. Well, you know, you're into your own thing. You're going to these meditations, and you're like, what do you want? You want to become a God? And then for the last two weeks, that was, well, I go with them, you know, because I feel worldwide, I'm at home, especially the holiday time. And then I go there, and this part of me wants to come here, and say, no, I've got to balance myself. I'm finding that I'm proving more of a way problem. I'm not really interested in what the conversations are, and I feel that I'm finding it less uncommon. Yeah, yeah, the, I think what you're describing, I think a number of people have that kind of experience, and certainly I've had that experience, the kind of representative experience for me like this, was I was living on a small farm, and I started having a daily sitting practice when I was about 20, 21. And I would come down to breakfast after meditating with my two friends who lived on the farm, and it was kind of like Gil wasn't there, you know, I didn't have anything to, I was quiet, I felt pretty content, and felt no need to say anything at all, and just could sit down at the breakfast table, and just things were great, but I was quiet. And they expected the old Gil to be there, and I felt over the days this tension build up, because they didn't understand what that meant, and I didn't have the skills to explain to them what was going on, and so it was awkward for them, and maybe in their eyes, that kind of silence represents social awkwardness or tension or conflict that's going on, so it made it even worse for them. So at some point I decided with my, the poor understanding I had then was, I either had to give up meditation or give up my friends. So I gave up meditation for a while, so that I could stay living with my friends there, and not have that get in the way. Sometimes as we meditate, our values change, the way we like to be in the world change. Another story I've told sometimes like this, a little bit related to this, is when I had moved to San Francisco to be a Zen student at San Francisco Zen Center, I had a girlfriend, and at that time I was aware of how many people play social games, kind of they want to, they play games, back then the word that my girlfriend used was strokes. They want to be seen in certain ways, supported in certain ways, and support is they want support in their ego and their identity, in their egotistical way of holding themselves. And I saw many of these games and I wasn't really interested in playing them, so she wanted strokes, and I just didn't respond. And so that relationship ended pretty quickly. But many years later what I realized was that I had a certain kind of wisdom, where I saw these things, but what I lacked at that time was compassion, and that if I had understood her situation more from the inside, what motivated or prompted her to want that, the suffering underneath her, I probably would have responded to her differently, rather than been kind of distant or aloof or unresponsive. So your experience is something that a lot of people have. I think it's awkward. There are times when people get involved in meditation circles or in different circles, where they do pull back from their normal life, their other life, their friends and stuff, in ways which are not helpful, that are isolating in ways that I wouldn't recommend people to do it. And other times it just seems like it's completely appropriate to do it, because it's going so much in opposite directions from what we're trying to do with our lives, and it's so uncomfortable to be in certain settings. And so how you negotiate that, I don't know. I wouldn't jump into the meditative world too quickly. I like to do things slowly. Sometimes I think slow transitions can be wiser. And you might see if you can reframe how you understand your relationships with your friends. And it might be other ways of relating to them, or understanding their friendships, those friendships, that can bring value to you again. So like my example of not having compassion from my girlfriend, maybe there's some way of seeing them through the eyes of compassion, rather than through the eyes of what this relationship can do for me, or something. Or maybe you can tune in to the goodness that's in them, and then relate to them through the goodness, and talk to them about the things that are meaningful for you, in a way. And it's kind of art to find a way to have a conversation with them. We talk about things that are valuable for both of you, or deeply meaningful. If they want to talk about who the 49ers are playing today, then you can say something like, I don't know, you can say something like, I'm studying joy is an important part of the tradition and part of, what kind of joy is it that you have when you watch the 49ers? And then they can talk about that joy, and that becomes an excuse to kind of take the conversation, talk about all the different kinds of joy there might be. So maybe there are ways of keeping the friendships and changing the way. And they finish the conversation, and he says, wow, that was a great conversation. I didn't know there was, we could talk about joy in such a great way. And you've stopped talking about 49ers long ago in the conversation, so it works for you. So I don't know. So good luck. Having friends, or acquaintances who you know or share some of your new values and new ways of being, are very important. And that's one of the reasons why it's important to have a community like this where you come, and you don't feel like you're the only one who's crazy, but you realize there's a group of people who's crazy, or a group of people who are exploring the same thing, not alone, it's very helpful. And if you have a couple, just one or two people you have a little more friendship with, in these circles, it's helpful. Then kind of the caveat for that, at least my position paper on this issue, is that I kind of suspect that if all your friends and acquaintances are from a particular group, or from a particular religious spiritual tradition, then you should try to figure out some way to have friends and acquaintances outside of that. Don't just be only within certain bounds, so you get some fresh perspectives and step outside. So it's 10.45, and I appreciate a lot hearing those questions. I hope that this was a useful morning for the rest of you, and for listening to this, and hopefully people have asked the questions, asked questions that were relevant for some of the rest of you also, and maybe were useful for part of the discussion. I just want to express my appreciation for coming here Sunday morning and sitting with you all. I think it's really lovely and a wonderful thing to do, and it was nice to sit with you this morning. Thank you.
