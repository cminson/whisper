How does the air transform our body?
It brings something to my mind, something that I am causing a little stress or suffering, something that makes me uncomfortable.
It is enough without rationalizing, without editing, without looking for explanations or reasons.
It is enough without thinking.
How does this suffering feel?
Maybe it produces fear or anger, despair or agitation.
Let whatever is there, give it space, let it be there.
If these feelings, emotions and suffering had a form or representation, what would it be?
Smoke, fog, heavy load, hot air, ice cream, what would it be like?
The representation of this suffering.
Now imagine that the heart can transform this suffering, this energy, this vitality, this luminosity in you.
It can transform this suffering.
Then let it touch you.
Knowing that this suffering does not define you and simply something that is happening.
Let it touch your heart.
Let it transform.
And when it transforms, what representation would this have?
Light, a fresh breeze.
A good cup of coffee.
And it continues for a few seconds, receiving your suffering.
Inhalating, taking only what you can, you don't have to take everything.
Permitting your being luminous transforms it.
Being well-being, love, compassion.
Inhalating, heavy load, hot air, hot air.
And taking a deep inhalation, exhaling without forcing and opening your eyes.
