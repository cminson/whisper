Simplicity of Breathing?

I’m fond of these Wednesdays because they make  the 
day simple. At least, the morning is pretty simple – just 
sit he re, and not much has to happen. I think simplicity 
is one the important teachers in Buddhism . Not that 
everything has to be simple, but t o use the experience 
of simplicity as a reference point  can be a wonder ful 
teacher to help us question  and to look more  honestly at 
when the mind  make s our life more complicated than 
perhaps it needs to be.   
 
One of the interesting areas to look at is the role that 
beliefs have in making our minds preoccupied. We’re 
sitting here , and generall y the idea is to be very simpl e 
– just be here when you ’re sitting, to be here and  follow 
your breath  – to be in the present moment in a simple 
way. As you do walking meditation, just very simply be 
in the present moment with your steps as you walk. 
What you tend to find out is how muc h the mind d oesn ’t 
do that. The mind has it s own thoughts and 
preoccupations. So then we let go and come back, let 
go and come back.   
It’s also useful to look at the preoccupations . An 
interesting angle to look at this from is: w hat are we 
believing in tha t we are preoccupied? What do we 
believe is going to be accomplished by thinking and 
thinking, planning, remembering? Do we believe in the 
value of thinking, of imagining, visualiz ing? Chances are  
the mind believes in something; it  believes there ’s a 
value  there.  
 
In order to challenge yourself , see if you can believe in 
your breathing more than you believe in your thinking. 
During this morning , really believe in your breathing. 
Believe in the steps as you walk. Just believe – believe  
that this is really the important thing.  
 
It’s so simple and see how you complicate things. If 
your mind is not preoccupied but it ’s involved in 
commentary,  or interpretation of this moment, then 
you’re believing in the commentary, interpretations, 
evaluations: “I’m not doing  very well. ” “This is great. ” 
Whatever. Do you believe in that activity of the mind?   
 
There ’s so little activity of the mind that we have to 
actually do. The idea in meditation is to simplify the 
activity of the mind so as to know that we can 
experience some peace, a profound sense of well being, 
not needing to complicate our lives with th oughts, beliefs, past, future – all kinds of things the mind gets 
caught up in.  
 
For this  morning, see if you can believe in simplicity. 
See if you can believe in just br eathing, being present 
for your breath and trust ing yourself to your breathing. 
Or when you do walking meditation, be with your feet as 
they walk – the simplicity of the feet walk ing. 
 
If you can ’t do it, then become interested in why  not – 
interested  in what you believe in.
