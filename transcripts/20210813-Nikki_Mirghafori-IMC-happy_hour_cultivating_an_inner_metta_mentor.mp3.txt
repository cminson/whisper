 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Hello, hello and welcome everyone to this Friday or Saturday if you're in Australia or other places or if you're listening on audio Dharma later, anytime it might be a more good welcome to this moment of practice together. So, so today's practice, I'd like to invite us to to work with Metta, cultivating Metta, cultivating goodwill, cultivating Metta and compassion, as well as Muddita, vicarious joy, which becomes gratitude when we practice for ourselves. So as well as a little bit of equanimity, all of these four Brahma viharas practice all of those for ourselves with the support of our Metta mentor. So today, the theme is cultivation with the support of a Metta mentor. Okay, so. So this Metta mentor of ours is someone, it could be our inner Buddha for some of you might be in your inner Buddha that that you whip out comes out and ah yes looks at you with eyes of care and love and just sees all of your beauty, all of your goodness, all of your quirks, all of the ways you struggle and loves you completely, completely. So your Metta mentor could be a Buddha could be Kuan Yin for some of you. You have a connection with Kuan Yin the embodiment of of compassion. So, so she might be the one Oh yes, holding you for some of you might be a friend, a dear friend or a mentor or a coach or, or your fairy godmother. You can imagine, or a parent, or an angel and angelic being who's full of goodness. So, whatever, whoever, whoever this Metta mentor, just take a moment perhaps, and conjure up for yourself and you can switch later. It's not good to switch too many times but if one doesn't work later in the meditation you can switch and choose another but conjure up this being, this being, whether imagined, someone archetypal or being from your life, alive or deceased doesn't matter as long as the deceased doesn't bring off grief and sadness. Someone, or maybe again, is imaginary being who sees you completely sees you and loves you unconditionally sees your, your quote unquote flaws, your challenges, your goodness, your intention, and just wants the best for you. What's the best for you sees your goodness. So this will be your Metta mentor, your Metta mentor. And, come on, this is imaginary, right. So, how hard is it to imagine someone, of course, it could be challenging I don't want to belittle this, this this challenge also that some of us might have, but, but really conjuring up someone. And again, if it's hard to think of a personal Metta mentor think of Kuan Yin, think of the Buddha, maybe Jesus, maybe the being of light, whoever you connect with. It's, it's okay for this practice, it's perfectly okay. So, so with that, let's begin our practice, and I'll have invitations throughout. So as always we land, we land in our bodies. We land in this moment. Connecting with the breath. The felt sense of the body connected to the earth, each breath. Thank you. Now I'd like to invite you to connect with your Metta Mentor as described inviting this being, this compassionate being to your heart and to your mind's eye and to your space. This being there from your life or this archetypal being your inner Buddha, Kuan Yin, being of light, Jesus, Mother Mary, a friend or a coach, our friendly fairy, our Metta Fairy Godmother conjuring up whoever works for you, inviting them, inviting them and letting yourself be held in their gaze, taking some time to stabilize, still connecting with the breath and the body. Letting yourself be held letting yourself be held with compassion, with love, with care, loving eyes of this Metta Mentor, this compassionate being. And if there are challenges right now, are there any challenges in your body and your heart and your mind? Bringing them up and sharing them with this loving being, with this caring being, they know you, they understand you, they don't judge you because you're having difficulty, they see you just as you are. They know your entire history, all the challenges you've had, they know your goodness, they hold you, they hold the challenge, the heartbreak, the body pain, whatever it might be, the disappointment with you for you compassionately, they understand, they understand. Thank you. Thank you. Allowing yourself to just receive, receive, receive the care, the love, the compassion, being soothed. Thank you. Circumstances may not be ideal in your heart, in your life, in your mind, your body. May not be what you wish for, or you would have chosen in this moment in time. And this being, this being understands, understands the challenges. You don't have to explain. They get it. They hold it with care, with tenderness, without judgment. Maybe you feel that their care, their understanding, the unconditionality of their good will is healing, soothing, comforting. It gives you more resources, more resilience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And now as you are feeling care, compassion of this being, held in their care with this difficulty, whatever it is, this challenge, see if you can ask them a question. If they have some wisdom, words of wisdom with care and love they have for you, that can support you through this difficulty. So if you're putting your question gently offering, putting it on the altar, asking, is there something? Just listening. There might be something, there might be nothing. The answer might just come in the form of care, warmth, meta, compassion. Maybe that's all that's needed, no words. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Let your body, your heart be soft. Let's challenge the sorrow of being held with care. With care for you. With your particularities, well, you are the way you show up in this world. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You Letting yourself take delight, be gladdened by these resources, these blessings that you are reminded of. You You You You You And now Letting this metta, friend, metta mentor, being, metta being. You invite you to see your life, the challenges you're having right now, the goodness in your life, the context and the bigger context of the entire arc of your life. A bird's eye view which they have access to, and through them you can have a glimpse. Ah, and witness the arc of your life, how this current moment fits in with spaciousness and equanimity. And the warmth and care which they have for you, for you to have for yourself. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. May I be happy and joyful. May I be healthy and strong. May I meet my life with ease, the entire arc of my life in this moment as it arises, with as much ease as possible. And holding this period of practice however it was, with metta for yourself, whether it was distracted, sleepy, however it was, seeing it together with your metta mentor, with the gaze of metta and appreciation. Letting go of judgment, you showed up, you tried. Offering the goodness to all beings everywhere, including yourself. May all beings, all beings know their own goodness. May all beings be free. Thanks everyone. Thank you for your practice. So we have time for reflections, questions, comments. You can type them in chat if you like. If sent to everyone, I will read your name. If it's just sent to me, I will not read your name. And you're also welcome to raise your zoom hand if you wish. What was this like for you to bring up your metta mentor, see yourself? And did any of you also ask for support, for feedback, for advice, for wisdom? That's how we put it, how I put it. Words of wisdom. The forest says, kept falling asleep, but it was still wonderful to sit in the company of the Buddha. Oh, that's lovely. Beautiful. Thank you for that, Harsh. Allison says, I am so filled with gratitude for this sacred space. Thank you to you all for being here. Oh, thank you, Allison, for acknowledging the sacred space that we co-create for this wonderful event. Thank you. Nicholas, please. I'm going to start with the metta mentor because being held in compassion from the metta mentor helped me see, I don't see compassion as mine, but I do see presence or absence of compassion as my responsibility. And so, you know, when compassion is not available, there's a certain attitude of compassion, and I think I hadn't noticed that clearly. And so this sit was very tender because it was very tender to sit in that space of compassion isn't really felt in this moment. And what does it mean that that's not my fault? That was a very tender place for me to sit. I feel so moved, Nicholas. I feel so moved with what you named sitting in this tender place. Yes, it is not my fault. If there is, if compassion is not arising in this moment, it is the challenge in this moment and for it to be seen with eyes of compassion. Oh, I am moved. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. What a beautiful opening. Thank you. Mark shares, that was quite a special meditation. Thank you. Thank you, Mark. Thank you for your practice. And if you'd like to say more, if you'd like to expand, you are welcome to raise your hand, but don't feel. I don't want to put you on the spot. Yes. Let's see. I'm going to ask you to unmute yourself there. I was told that my final remaining. My second year old golden receiver has one to three months to live and will bleed out from a cancer moving off away. Asking my mentor, as it were, why is it heartbreaking how to handle this heartbreak? And what came was love is always the answer. Thank you. Thank you, Mark. Thank you so much for sharing that. Love is always the answer, isn't it? I feel soothed as you say this, as you share the wisdom of your metamenter in this situation. I feel soothed. Yes, love is always the answer. No matter what. Thank you for the blessing you shared. Thank you all for the blessing of your practice of this Sangha. Let us turn to practice in small groups, size three, roughly, and sharing with each other. Well, always, as always, we'll start with 15 seconds of silent metam. And there's so much that we can gain from each other, from what came up for us, from our metamenter, words of wisdom, or the challenges that we sat with, with tenderness. It's all invited. It's all invited. So taking the first 15 seconds of silence for yourself or others, with metam, with compassion, and then sharing as little or as much as you wish. So here are the rooms. They are created. And take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Come back. We have a few minutes for reflections, questions, comments. So please don't be shy, especially if you haven't spoken for a while. We'd love to hear from you. What did you discover? Any part of it. I just commented on the part with equanimity yet, or with gratitude. Richard, please. Am I unmuted now? Yes, you are. I mentioned this to my group, is that I've done this sort of thing before, and I imagine the loving presence smiling down at me. And when that happens, I sort of automatically return the smile. And that really sort of lifts my spirits, that kind of creating a real feedback loop of happiness. Nice. I love that the receiving of the love, the receiving of the metta makes you light up. It feels like a virtuous cycle. Instead of a vicious cycle, it becomes a virtuous cycle of smiling, giving and receiving this smile. Thank you. I love that. And you're smiling now, Richard. Yes. So are you. Exactly. It's the virtuous cycle. So are many other people in the Sangha I see in their videos. It's very sweet. Thanks, Richard. And he says, just want to say thank you to my small group for being so supportive. That is so sweet. So sweet. So, dear ones, we have come to the end of yet another happy hour practice together, an hour of cultivating meta compassion, gratitude and equanimity. So thank you all. Thank you for the gift of your practice. Thank you for cultivating your heart, showing up for the sake of yourself and all beings everywhere. May all beings be well. May all beings be happy. Thank you. And now.
