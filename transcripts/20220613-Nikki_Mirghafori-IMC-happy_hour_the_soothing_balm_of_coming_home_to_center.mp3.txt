The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
There. Okay, so hello and welcome everyone. Hello friends. It's lovely to be with you.
It's so comforting and really soothing and happy-making to come together in the Sangha and practice even if you've been away for a while or it's your first time, warmly, warmly welcome.
So for today's practice, I'd like to offer a practice of returning to our center, returning home, returning home, returning to our center with Metta.
So returning home, returning to our center to, especially this is especially important when we lose our balance, whether challenges of the day, challenges of the environment, external, internal, whether they're challenges or other events.
When we feel like we've lost our balance, we've lost our equanimity, we've lost our Metta, we've lost our center.
So the way I'd like to invite us to practice with the practice of Metta, loving kindness today for ourselves and for others is a way of studying, is a way of studying, nourishing, nurturing the heart.
And bringing this aspect of equanimity, bringing this aspect of equanimity.
So that is the invitation. There is not much more I'll say, because whatever you need to know will be offered to you in the guided meditation.
So whether you're new or experienced, as they say, relax and enjoy the ride. And whatever arises, whatever arises is what needs to arise, given all the causes and conditions of our hearts, of our mind, of our life.
And as long as you have kindness towards whatever arises, even if it's a crowd of sorrows that bring up for distraction or sleepiness, as long as you bring kindness to what's arising, that helps you cultivate Metta, cultivate stability.
Whereas if you get whipped out of shade, like, oh, I'm trying to meditate here and I'm distracted, ouch, that's even makes you even more unkiltered.
So whatever arises, as long as you bring kindness to it, it will help you find your center, find stability and peace, right here, right now, so that we can be of service to the world, to others, to ourselves.
This person knows me, just be of service. It's a much better place to be, a place of stability to serve our life, others, and a place of reactivity.
So that's all I want to say to set the stage for our practice today. So with that, I'd like to invite us all to shift into our meditation posture.
You need to lie down, that's okay, you need to sit up straighter or stand up or anything that this body needs in this moment in order to be comfortable for the next 30 minutes or so, the guided meditation.
So, landing, landing in this body, landing in this body, in this moment, let's find, let's find the center of our gravity, checking in with the body.
Let the center of the gravity be lower, not in our head, in our thoughts, but lower, lower, lower, maybe in our abdomen, in our sit bones.
And from our sit bones, from where we are sitting, and let there be a sense of verticality, a sense of uprightness.
As if there is the centered, the centered pull that goes through, that touches our sit bones, our heart, our head, connected to the earth, all the way, energetically.
Maybe it's just this brightness, this sense of subtleness.
And again, let the center of gravity be low, releasing, relaxing the body.
Maybe for a few minutes we'll just sit with the breath that's moving up and down through this axis, this vertical axis, connecting our heart to our head, to our gut, to the earth.
Finding our balance, finding our center.
Let the breath move on its own, along this axis, freely, if it needs to be, if it needs to hang out in the sit bones area, let it relax, release the sit bones.
Your seat, maybe it needs to hang out by the heart area, to release, relax the heart, the seat of the emotions.
Or if you're feeling sleepy at this point, maybe the breath gives a sense of uplift, opening the heart, the head, the mind, through the whole body.
A sense of vitality, uplift, more wakeful energy.
And if there's anxiety present or nervousness, then let there be more attention given to the lower part of this axis, vertical axis, your sit bones, your feet, the earth, grounding, grounding, settling, finding your center, your balance, your grounding.
Ah, touching the earth.
Let the body be relaxed, released, it's easier to be at our center, the body, the heart, the mind as it is, we naturally, naturally fall into our center.
Stop staring it up, just being breathed.
Stop staring it up, just being breathed.
Stop staring it up, just being breathed.
Maybe, like the Buddha, sitting under the Bodhi tree, when Mara distractions, doubts, challenges,
we're assailing him, he touched the earth.
His earth being my witness, I belong here, I'm here.
A sense of groundedness, stability, centeredness, home.
It's hard to be connected through this verticality of this axis.
And as we let our heart, our body be breathed, one breath at a time, with each breath,
we return home, we find our way home, we feel at home, at our center, in our humanness, with our goodness, our intentions to grow, to learn, to love, to serve.
To continue to be better versions of ourselves, better angels of ourselves.
With each breath connecting to our heart, to our center of being.
Our center, our home, goodness, kindness, goodwill as our home.
A place to rest, our tired mind, our tired heart, our tired bodies.
A welcoming, kind place, this chamber, this safe chamber.
And if challenges arise, sadness, or self-judgment, anything arises in this while you're home, in this chamber of safety in your heart, let them feel safe too, it's okay.
Oh self-judgment, oh the statement, it's okay, rest, rest, rest in the love, the care, the warmth, the complete acceptance here in this home, in this chamber.
This refuge of the heart, feeling nourished, feeling calmed, it's okay, it's okay.
Sit, rest.
Rest, be breathed, reconnect.
Be held.
Kindness.
Aspiration.
Goodness, love.
The essence of friendliness, for yourself, all of your life.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Can you welcome yourself wholeheartedly?
This lost beloved, who is you? Who is yourself?
As if reunited with yourself, welcome, or have you been sweetheart? Rest, relax, feast on your life, feast on the goodness that is here.
Holding yourself as you would hold a dear, dear one, with care, with appreciation, if you're tired, if you've been working hard,
provide yourself to rest in your arms, holding. It's okay sweetheart, it's okay.
It's okay, what do you need?
Welcoming yourself home.
What happens if you really welcome yourself home? With kindness, with complete acceptance, with just a moment, see what might happen, what might open up?
With kindness, acceptance, just as you are, in this moment.
Thank you.
Welcome home sweetheart, there's nothing you need to do or be.
It's hard enough, just rest.
May you know that you're loved and accepted just as you are.
Let your heart be nourished.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Safe, safe in your own heart.
A place of refuge, kindness, acceptance, maybe even forgiveness, if it's needed.
Can everything else feel safe in this space? The thoughts, distractions perhaps?
Bakes, pains, random sounds, it's okay, it's a place of refuge.
Everything touched with kindness, with an open heart embraced.
Thank you.
Home.
Kindness, metas are home.
Healing, soothing, centering, centered in kindness.
In generosity, for others, for ourselves, centered in aspirations.
Home, centered.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
By coming home, connected home, maybe a sense of trust arises.
Sense of stability, trust, confidence emerges.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And as we bring this sit to close together, connecting to your heart again, to your body,
to the sense of alignment, verticality, connected to the earth, rising up to the heavens, expanding,
with aspirations, with open arms, and offering generosity, kindness to whatever rose or did not rise
during this practice period, you showed up, you did your best, it had to be exactly as it was,
given the causes and conditions, together offering, offering our practice, offering our goodness,
if we're spreading confetti over the whole world.
Joyously offering this goodness to all beings everywhere, including ourselves.
May all beings everywhere feel centered, feel at home in their own heart, bodies, mind,
feel soothed, nourished.
May all beings everywhere, including ourselves, be free.
Thank you all. Thank you so much for your practice.
What a gift, what a gift that you show up, you show up, you show up again and again for yourself
and for others, what a gift, what a gift.
The Buddha says that the gift of the Dharma is the highest gift,
and some people think of that as teaching the Dharma or Dharma gifts or books,
but actually this showing up, this practice that you show up, this is the gift of the Dharma,
this is the gift of your practice, is the highest gift,
it's the highest gift that you make of yourselves, you offer yourself up, so beautiful, so beautiful,
such an expression, such a beautiful expression for your humanity.
So we have time for reflections, if you'd like to raise your hand, to share your reflections as a gift to the Sangha.
You can also type in chat, if you type it to me privately, I will only read your offering, not your name,
if it's typed to everyone, then I will read both your name and the offering.
Debra, I see your hand please.
I've been typing a lot, but today I just want to gush.
I just want to say that tonight's practice,
I was just so present to this balm for the soul that this practice offers and that you offer,
and it was particularly strong for me because I've had dental surgery,
and I went off the pain meds this morning, but whenever you finally lie down you realize the pain,
and so I jumped up at the beginning of the meditation and I grabbed a tile and all because I realized,
oh, it's coming back, and then as you were speaking I just held my jaw,
and I hadn't gotten down to that level of realizing I've hurt my body, this really hurt my body,
and so I sent all this loving kindness there, and yeah, just was like a balm, thank you so much,
and I've searched in other places, I used to go to Green Gulch,
and I always felt like I wanted to find a loving Buddhist practice,
and I hadn't experienced this until I started coming to the Insight Meditation Center,
which I'm sure exists elsewhere, but thank you.
Thank you so much, Debra, for sharing.
Beautiful, thank you, yeah, and surgeries, just trauma to the body, it's hard, right?
And when we sit we realize, oh, this sweet, poor body, you're traumatized, it's not just the jaw or the teeth,
it affects the whole nervous system, yeah.
So welcome home, Debra, welcome home, yeah, soothing balm, thank you, thank you so much.
Ah, Jessie, please.
Thanks, yeah, this was a really amazing practice.
I love the imagery of coming home, and you mentioned self-forgiveness, and coming back to center,
so timely for me, my mom mentioned to me about eight days ago,
and she's bringing up some end-of-life paperwork, my mom's 76 years old and in good health,
but I'm really grateful that she's being proactive about it,
but I just felt clenching and tightness in my chest and just feelings of overwhelm and grief,
and just this whole idea of coming back to center, coming home, self-forgiveness,
and you took our suffering that arises, and this is why I've been practicing all these ideas about
ambulance and recollection of death, you know, are coming to bear now,
and I just also want to share another gift that I have right as you said, something like,
you know, can you accept yourself as you are, some type of ambulance or emergency siren went by,
which is unusual for my suburban neighborhood, and these dogs started howling,
and it was just its evocation of impermanence, you know,
you have this grief and this overwhelm, this arises and it passes away just as you,
because you also mentioned sounds, you know, random sounds at the same time, so wonderful practice,
and thank you for getting tonight.
Thank you, Jesse, thank you so much, so beautifully, beautifully said.
Thank you.
Thank you for your practice.
Ah, balm for the soul, mima.
Hi, Nikki, thank you.
I think this practice tonight was like so rich.
I was like, like, initially, I've been learning how to rest, like, I've never known how to rest,
and so tonight when you were talking about resting,
and I've been learning how to do that, it was like, oh my word, this is like so perfect for me right now,
and what I really appreciate it was when you mentioned that about even inviting judgment to rest,
like, all of the things that could come up, you know, to allow it, come here, let's rest, let's just be right here,
and the kindness about how we approach it, how we can approach it with kindness,
and it reminded me something about Thich Nhan Han, something I heard this weekend was,
you don't have to know what it is, it's treat it with kindness, whatever it is that comes up, treat it with kindness,
so I really felt like it tied in a lot for me that I was able to even turn it on myself,
and my heart just walled up, I cried, it was like, yeah, be kind to me, be kind to me.
I'm tired, I am tired, and I need to be kind, and it just like released my tears,
and I was able to rest in that and let it go, so thank you.
Tonight was really, really rich, thank you.
Thank you, and thank you, Rima, thank you.
You thank me, and I thank you, and everyone in the Sangha for their practice.
Thank you so much for your beautiful reflections and sharing your practice, yeah, yeah,
and we're often tired, we're often, life is, life is life, right?
In the past, I've said that every one of us deserves a purple heart medal for being human.
It's not easy being human, this human realm, it's not easy for every single one of us.
I mean, of course, of course, there are their joys, there are 10,000 joys,
and then there are 10,000 sorrows and challenges, yes.
Yeah, sweetheart, you are tired, sweetheart, yes, yeah, yeah, beautiful.
Thank you, Rima, thank you.
So, dear ones, Bill has asked, was this coming home exercise the same as concentration?
Not necessarily, not the same, they're not equivalent.
There is an aspect of coming home, keep coming back, keep coming back,
that could be a part of a practice of Samadhi concentration.
But the way I was leading it today was more a coming home to sense of rest, heart, ease,
I was emphasizing that aspect of it.
So there was a little bit of, I think, with practice of concentration,
there is a sense of coming back, resting.
So there's a little bit of that, but they're not the same.
There was a Venn diagram, there's some overlap with the practice tonight, but not the same, yeah.
So, dear ones, dear Sangha, dear Happy-era family, whether you just joined for the first time,
you're part of this family, you're here.
So the invitation we have at this point is to connect with a couple of other members of this Sangha with kindness.
It's where the rubber meets the road.
So just offering kindness to yourself, offering kindness to others.
And the soothing balm, can we all rest in this soothing balm?
Can we all rest in this soothing balm together?
And the invitation is in the small groups to offer maybe one thing about yourself, how the practice was,
speaking from the first person experience, one nugget, then the next person will say one nugget,
and then the next person will say one nugget, and they'll come back to you.
Not a long monologue, but just one nugget, knowing that will come back to you.
And just from your own experience, not asking questions or directing or facilitating,
just offering your own humanity as a gift to the Sangha.
Here I am.
And also, if it comes to your turn, you can say pass and just hold silence.
That's perfectly fine too, if you want to offer witnessing and kindness, kind witnessing to the Sangha.
So with that as our intention for practice tonight, I will create the breakout rooms,
take care of yourselves, take care of each other, be kind, and enjoy.
Enjoy the few minutes of conversation at Sangha.
It's precious.
So here we go.
Okay.
All right.
The rooms are closed.
Everybody's back.
Welcome back, everyone.
So we have just about a minute for any concluding reflections or comments from practice tonight or sharing in Sangha tonight.
Any last reflections you'd like to share or questions or challenges, anything is welcome.
You can type in chat or raise your hand.
Dave.
Yeah, Nikki, thanks.
I was trying to remember there's a phrase you used for the.
So you make a mistake like I just did in clicking the leave breakout room button when I didn't mean to.
Then you start piling on yourself and injuring yourself.
There's a phrase you've used.
It's much more succinct of how you hurt yourself after hurting yourself.
Self-flagellation, I don't know, or something.
Second arrow.
It's not my phrase.
It's the Buddha's teaching.
So he gets all the credit.
I'm just repeating it back, but actually there's a whole sutta about the second arrow.
It's a beautiful teaching.
It's a beautiful teaching about how we engage.
And it has to do with the teaching of Vedana, actually, that beautiful sutta.
Vedana being the feeling to unpleasant, unpleasant, neutral when there's something unpleasant, which is pylon.
And we add the second and third and fourth arrows.
So yes, it's the second arrow.
And yes, Radha and Deborah and Neil, all of them are jumping in.
I love it.
I love it.
The song is jumping in with the answers.
I love it.
I love it.
This is so sweet.
Thank you for bringing that up, Dave.
That's great.
Second arrows.
Yeah.
Beautiful.
Well, thank you so much, all of you.
Thank you for sharing, for your practice, for showing up.
May you be well.
May you be happy.
May you find your home when it's been lost.
Come back to the center with care, with love.
Thank you all.
Let's dedicate the merit again.
May all beings be well.
May all beings be free.
Thank you all.
Take good care.
I'm going to stop the recording.
