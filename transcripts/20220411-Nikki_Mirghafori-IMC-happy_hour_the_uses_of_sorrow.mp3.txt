The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So the recording will go on. Here we go. So hello and welcome everyone. Welcome to
the rendition of happy hour. Lovely to be with you dear Sangha. It makes me very
happy to see you, to see your faces, your squares, sense of presence was coming
together and practicing. So for today's practice, I'd like to bring a paragraph
that I recently read from Joan Halifax as an inspiration for us practicing with
compassion this evening, Karuna practice. So here is here is the paragraph from
Joan Halifax and I'll share it with Neil so that he can send it to the Google
groups afterwards if you thinking, oh, I want to hear that again. You'll get it
later. So she says, in thinking about trauma and resilience, as I reflect on
what is unfolding in our world at this time, from the point of view of systems
theory, systems that break down have the potential to reorganize themselves at a
higher, more robust level of functionality. The experience of breakdown can give
one a very deep and optimistic view of the potential of others to grow from
trauma instead of being diminished. This is called post traumatic growth and
refers to the benefit from psychological changes that can be experienced as a
result of the struggle with challenging life circumstances and can foster
greater resilience. We have to remember that people who have survived trauma can
come back transformed by the experience and see that suffering has made them
more resilient rather than more fragile with the ability to thrive in the
present rather than being overwhelmed by the past. Beyond the ending of the old
way of being, there is hope for the emergence of the new and to imagine a
future in which the wounds are still there but in a form that makes one wiser
and humbler and helps one to thrive. So wiser and humbler and more compassionate,
I like to add that because another use of challenge, difficulty, trauma, suffering,
whatever you want to call it, is us are growing in compassion, not just growing
in resilience but also growing in compassion and wisdom and compassion
for ourselves and for others. So I like to use that as the basis for our
practice tonight. It's the use of, there is a poem by Mary Oliver called The
Uses of Sorrow. So I think of the uses of sorrow, the uses of challenge, the
uses of difficulty in our lives to refashion us in a more resilient, in a
more wise, not in a more fragile as she talks about of course but more
resilient through post-traumatic growth and growing in compassion is an
important part of the uses of sorrow, the uses of challenges, the way that it
helps us grow and become more fully human, more beautiful, more gracious, more
kind, knowing that all of us have challenges. Many lives look perfect
perhaps from the outside, from the outside. Oh yes, they don't have problems,
they have a perfect life, they're happy, perfect bodies and minds and jobs and
relationships and knowing what I know and actually our deep wisdom tells us
that suffering unsatisfactoriness, this word dukkha in Pali, is part of
everybody's life, is a mark of existence. As long as you live, you're a human being
or you're an animal, you're a sentient being, there is, there is dukkha, there
is challenges, there is suffering, there is not that everything in the world is
dukkha, definitely not, there are plenty of joys, yes, enjoy joy,
savour joy and yes, there's also challenges, there's dukkha which again
doesn't necessarily diminish us but it helps us grow in wisdom, in resilience
and compassion. So I've said enough to set the frame, I'd like to invite us to
now meditate together, so let's settle, let's arrive in our sitting posture so
that you can sit or if you need, lie down comfortably for the next 30 minutes, I
invite you to close your eyes, if that's comfortable for you,
arriving, arriving in the body, first and foremost embodiment,
turning away, turning away from thoughts, from entanglement, in this moment in time
to give our hearts to this practice, to give our hearts this practice, turning the
gaze inward, the gaze of awareness, it is so sweet, the peace within, we keep
mixing it up, shaking it up, no need, bowing to all the steering, thank you, not
now, please come back later, I'll be waiting for you and right now, can
relax, can we let go, release into this body, into this moment, feeling our
sit bones, hugging the cushion, the chair, you know there is a gecko that has
tiny little suction cups all along its hands, feet, imagine there are tiny
little suction cups like the gecko, on your bottom, on your feet, if you're
sitting on a cushion, the lower part of your legs, wherever there's contact,
really, really connecting to the earth, connected, yes, connected, stable,
stable, can release your weight.
Let the body release its weight, to the sit bones, to the feet, to the legs,
rooted, well-rooted, to the earth, and just as we are well-rooted, let there be a
sense of uplift, uplift in the heart,
and uplift through the breath, aspiration, the breath being breathed on its own.
Let it be received in the lower abdomen, to calm, soothe, settle.
If there's any tension in the neck and shoulders, your face, your jaw, your eyes,
anywhere else in the body, release with the next out breath, release.
One more time, taking an in-breath, maybe holding for a few seconds,
and release, landing more deeply, and a third time, intentional breathing,
holding, and let's go, release into the body.
Now let the breath be natural, no controlling, holding.
Let it be received, let the breath breathe you.
Continue like this for a few minutes, just to settle before we turn.
And as thoughts and entitlements arise, let there be no judgment, just clear seeing.
Smilingly, let go, let go, give up, offer up.
Thank you, not now, dear thought, come back later.
Turning towards the seclusion of the heart and mind,
this moment of cultivation, settling, peace.
you

And notice if it is possible, if it is easy,
to allow the breath, to have an image of the breath entering through the heart center,
the center of the chest, to warm up, to prime, a sense of kindness associated with the heart
center, the proverbial heart center, not on the left where the heart is, but the center of the chest.
And maybe if it feels right for you, invite you to put a hand in the center of your chest,
connecting with yourself, connecting with a sense of kindness.
Goodwill for this being who is you, who has the challenges
that you have had or currently have in this life.
Oh, dear, oh, sweetheart, I care for you, I wish you ease.
Holding yourself with care, with kindness.
Now I would like to invite you to bring to mind something that has been challenging for you,
stressful, perhaps not the most traumatic experience, not the hundred pound weight,
but maybe the 10 or 20 or even 50, but something that's challenging.
And recognizing that this is difficult, this is difficult,
this is hard, it's not easy, anyone, anyone going through the circumstance would find it challenging.
And yet, it doesn't diminish you, it doesn't make you small or fragile.
It is challenging, yes, holding it with care, with love, holding yourself with care,
with love.
There is strength in compassion, as you wish yourself well.
Phrases of compassion, I offer a few.
Use these or whatever feels appropriate for you.
May I, may I be free from this challenge, the suffering, this difficult pain,
or may I be with it, carry it, go through it with grace,
with ease, with as much ease as possible.
May I have ease in the midst of this challenge.
May I grow in compassion, in care, in love, in wisdom, with respect to myself and others,
with this difficulty. May it open my heart
to care and deeply love myself, hold myself tenderly,
preciously,
and to see others, caringly, compassionately, for their challenge, their suffering,
holding oneself, holding yourself, love and care, as a beloved being,
as a beloved compassionate being with no judgment.
Just as you hold yourself with care, with love, with tenderness,
also realizing your own resilience, your own strength.
Yes, the challenge is here, and yet you're not defined by it.
There is so much more beauty, goodness, mystery to you than just this challenge, this difficulty.
Yes, this challenge is here, and yet you're not defined by it.
There is so much more beauty, goodness, mystery to you than just this challenge,
yes, this is hard, this is challenging. I love and care for myself,
and yet, and yet, there's so much more to me for this being who is me.
Now let us invite, invite to our
mind's eye, others in the world who may know them, who may not know them personally,
who have suffered, or are suffering, or feeling challenged in the same way that we have, we are.
It's okay to use our imagination, imagine other beings, other people.
We know we're not alone in this.
So, inviting all the beings, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, millions,
of beings are challenged in the same way in sharing our compassion, our care.
May all of us, may all of us have ease with our challenge in the midst of our challenge.
May we be free from this sorrow, this pain.
May we be with it, go through it, with grace, with kindness.
All dear beings who just like me, you suffer just like me, I see you in my mind's eye.
There may be a child, an older person,
someone in another continent, different race, different language, nationality.
All of us siblings in this way, I may not know you.
And yet, we are connected in this way. I wish you well, I wish you ease,
just as I wish it for myself.
This is hard, friends, isn't it? This is hard.
They understand, they know.
They feel your pain, you feel theirs.
If we could make all the suffering be eased, the suffering for all, all of you,
all the beings who suffer in this way, all of us, I'm expanding the circle of compassion, of care,
to include not just those who are challenged in the same way you are, but in different ways,
all beings, all beings with their unique challenges, or not so unique challenges,
similar to ka. You may not know them, but everybody asks them, friends, family, loved ones,
strangers, people you have challenges with, everyone.
Oh, dear beings, trying to make it all go away, be eased.
May we all have ease.
And just as we hold everyone, all beings in this practice with kindness, with compassion,
wishing ease, freedom, grace, with suffering, also knowing that
none of us is defined by limited to, or pain, or sorrow.
There's so much more magnificence to each and every one of us
than our pain.
May our suffering, our pain open us up to compassion, more compassion for ourselves
and others, feeling with, feeling our pain, their pain.
May we all grow in wisdom, all of us.
And for the last moment of this practice period,
holding with kindness whatever arose or did not arise.
No need for judgment. You showed up and did your best. That's enough.
We're planting seeds, planting seeds. Don't know when they will flower.
All we can do is to plant them. We can't force them to flower under our timetable.
Offering the seeds you have planted. This goodness co-created all of us together in the sangha.
Offering this goodness may be a cause
for ease, for happiness, for freedom,
for all beings everywhere. May all things be happy, may all things be free, including ourselves.
Thank you all. Thank you for your practice.
So we have a few minutes for
reflections, comments, questions, aha moments, anything that might have opened up for you
or was challenging. It's all welcome. I'd like to share reports from the field
for the benefit of yourself being held witness and everyone's benefit.
We, as you already know, we benefit from each other's practice. So in that spirit of offering,
generosity offering, your practice to others, anyone would like to share. What did you notice?
What was different here? What came up? You can also type in chat. If you type to me privately,
I will not read your name. And if you type them to everyone, then I will read your name also.
One private reflection. I'm grateful for my compassion toward myself and others. Beautiful.
Two for one. Compassion and gratitude. Love it. Being grateful for compassion. That is
just lovely for self and others. Can you speak to the role of noticing the
feeling tone in holding difficult emotions, which I remembered during the meditation
session, that it can be a way of simplifying stories and bringing things from potentially
overwhelmed to something that we can hold because it is feeling tone and not all the
interpretations, stories, and other narratives that might come with it. But I don't remember
much more. It just occurred to me suddenly and it came in quite helpful, but I might be
representing that incorrectly. Yeah, I'm so glad you brought that in. Yes,
that is one way to simplify, especially if the mind sometimes might fall into, sink into the
storyline. And if it's a really heavy storyline, then one can stay with...
So I would say multiple things. There's the feeling tone, which is the Vedana, and that's
what you were referring to. So it's just unpleasant, just very ever so simply unpleasant.
This is unpleasant, holding the unpleasantness. There's also staying with the feeling.
Staying with the feeling. So I'm expanding on what you said. There's also staying with the feeling.
And the feeling, then there's the feeling in the body, the feeling of maybe heaviness,
contraction in the heart, sadness. There could be these various feelings or emotion.
Well, actually, they're too... bifurcating more. There's the feelings in the body,
and then there's the emotions in the mind. And of course, there's interaction.
Letting go of the storyline, yes, very helpful. But there are different levels one can attend to.
Instead of, oh, poor me. This is awful. This is terrible. Why me? Yeah, definitely let go of that.
I'm so glad you brought this up for everyone's benefit. And then it could be just like, oh,
this is hard. This is hard. This is sad, disappointed, whatever the emotion might be.
And then another layer of feeling in the body, what's happening in the body, or even
then going even one level simpler, which is the feeling tone. So all of these are available.
And whatever skillful to work with. Yeah, thank you, get done.
Jamie says, thank you for helping me touch the most tender, most wonderful parts of myself,
and see they can be gifts. Lovely. Thank you, Jamie. Beautiful.
Yeah. Mary Ann says, it was relaxing to think about how anyone would be challenged by a stressful
circumstance. Yes. Another question comes in YouTube. How can I have compassion towards
whom doing mean things and very egotistic? So how can you have compassion towards people who've
harmed you? That for that, one needs to separate the actions from the humanity because they've
done actions to harm, and you do not condone the actions. And yet they're hurting. It's often said
that hurt people hurt people. So you feel you open up to their hurt and you feel compassion for them.
And you don't have to condone the actions or even forgive the actions, but you can be in touch
with the humanity there. Fossil says, this was a challenging day at work with your instructions
at the end of the meditation though. What happened is okay. May the seeds of practice
bear fruit in life whenever they may. Yeah. Yeah. Beautiful. Thank you for sharing that.
Appreciate that for everyone. Yeah, it's okay. May the seeds of practice bear fruit in life
whenever they may. Yeah. It's all okay. Beautiful. So dear friends, let's transition at this point,
let us transition to small groups where our practice from the cushion with our eyes closed,
compassion for ourselves and others. Now we actually have a chance to live it, to live according to
these values, just for a few minutes with people who are on this path together with us. So the small
groups as I will making the breakout groups in a moment, remember, please speak just from your
own experience, not commenting, reflecting, managing the group or other people's experience,
not asking probing questions, just speak from your first person experience.
And each person, if you have five nuggets you want to share, just share one in the first round.
You'll say something, the next person will go in alphabetical order. The next person will say
something and then the third person will say something. There are three people, then you'll go
around and around again speaking just from your own personal experience and having a sense of meta
compassion for yourself and others. These are fellow practitioners in this space, practicing just
like you. You may not know their challenge, but can you and also if it comes to you, you can say
pass, you don't have to speak. You can say pass and you can just hold compassion at space. It's
perfectly fine if you're feeling quiet or if you want to witness for a few rounds. So
and remember, be kind to yourself, be kind to yourself, be kind to others. This is such a
precious opportunity to practice kindness and be embodied. Easiest way to actually monitor what
you're saying is to be embodied. See what it feels like in the body if you feel like, oh,
I'm saying this to impress. Oh yeah, maybe I don't want to say this. I just want to stay with my
experience, stay humble, stay close to your experience. So and again, you're speaking for
your own benefit, not to educate or impress anyone. Very important. So creating the rooms,
take care of yourselves, take care of each other. Here we go.
Okay, everyone's back. The rooms are closed. So we have just about a couple of minutes for any
insights. Any last words, maybe reports from the groups, any insights, can type in chat or raise
your hand. Don't be shy, especially if you haven't spoken. Nikki. Thank you, Nikki. Could you expand
a little bit on the feeling, how to bifurcate feelings and be authentic with how you're feeling,
not reactive? I was trying to process that a bit. Yeah, there are two different questions here,
Vicky. You're asking, so let me help me understand which there is not being reactive and there is
the question about bifurcating the feelings and say your question clearly again. So when you
were speaking before, it seemed that I understood it, but when I started to try to talk about it,
I realized I hadn't. Okay, okay. So what was I talking about? That's a clear question. Okay.
Maybe the person who asked it could say that it was about staying. I get it. Let me say
one more time. So the idea is there is the storyline. Oh, actually, let me change the
settings in the chat. I see, hold on. Here we go. The reflections. With what is happening,
there is often a storyline. Like, oh, I'm sick. This is hard. It's terrible. My back hurts.
Like, you're right. There's a storyline, right? There's a storyline. And then there's often
second arrows. Why me? Like, there's all that. And then there's actually, let's say your back
hurts. There's a physicality of it. And then there is a kind of a sadness. Oh, I really wanted to go
play tennis. Like, I can't do that, right? There's just these different levels. Right? So letting go
of the storyline and just feeling the physicality of the pain, right? Which is unpleasant, has an
unpleasant feeling tone, right? There. And also perhaps just the, so there's physicality of it.
And then there's the emotional sense. Oh, there's sadness. There's sorrows. Like, oh, this is heavy.
Oh, and that also has a feel, an unpleasant feeling tone, if you wanted to feel that.
But whichever way you go, which you can choose any of those, you can choose the physicality,
you can choose the emotion, you can choose the feeling tone or all of them together.
Let go of the story. That's the bottom line.
Clear now? Thank you. You're welcome. Great. So let's see. Ah, very quickly, I'll read a few
reflections. Lovely, lovely, lovely chat in my group. Oh, Daniel, apologies. It's a geriant bill.
My mic is not working. Just sharing that because the chat was to me, not to everyone.
Thank you for wonderful, beautiful groupies. Oh, that's sweet.
Going to take up the practice of not educating others with speech. I'm going to fail a lot. So
it should be fun. Oh, that is sweet. I appreciate the humility there. All right, dear ones, thank
you for practicing for yourself or others. May you all be well. May all of us, all beings,
everywhere. May we all be free. Thank you. And now I stop the recall.
