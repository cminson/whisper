Arriving with yourself, however you are in this moment, it can often be helpful
to just kind of, without any judgment or any idea that anything has to change,
just land with how you are. Sit back and just open up to check in. How is this
being right now? How is the body? How's the mind? Are there moods, ideas, feelings,
emotions that are here informing your experience, shaping your experience? Just
starting with where you are. This is what mindfulness does actually. This is the
function of mindfulness to open up our conscious awareness to recognize what's
actually here in this moment. And so often there are aspects of our experience
that are not seen consciously. So opening up to just being aware of as much as
what's available as possible. Starting with taking stock of how you are.
Not so much with thinking about, not with the ideas or not with words, but just
the feeling in to how you are. Feeling how the body is. Feeling what our
relationship to experience is. Feeling how the emotions are. This felt sense, felt
sense of experience. As we touch into the felt sense in the body in particular, we
may notice there are areas of tension and maybe areas where there's a little
more relaxation. If there are areas of tension, sometimes the very noticing of
them can be a support for their releasing. And sometimes we can, having
noticed there's tension somewhere, consciously relax that area.
Relaxation is a great support for our mindfulness practice. So if you are, if
you have noticed some areas of physical tension, maybe they can soften and
relax. And can you be mindful of that? Aware of what happens as there's a
movement towards relaxation. Sometimes as we relax one part of the body, we might
feel another part released too. Sometimes as we relax an area of the body, we
feel something let go in our, in attention in the mind. And so what's the
effect of relaxation? This exploration can actually be a wonderful support for
mindfulness and also a way we're cultivating mindfulness. Because we're
being mindful while relaxing. So relaxing doesn't have to be one thing in
mindfulness another. Can we relax the body and notice what happens? It can be
supportive to explore relaxation in a systematic way. For some of us that can
be really helpful. Scanning through the body, checking in the face, the head, maybe
that area can relax. Even if we don't notice tension, sometimes there can be a
little bit more relaxation that's available. So maybe the face and head can
soften. And again, as I was pointing to a moment ago, as there's relaxation in the
face, take in kind of the broader sense of what happens as that area relaxes. For
instance, in my experience, I find when I relax the face often very deeply
inside the body, in the area of the heart and the stomach, there's also a
softening or releasing. Maybe the neck, the shoulders, the arms can relax.
The chest, the upper back, all those muscles around the rib cage, maybe they
can soften and relax. The stomach, the abdomen, middle and lower back. And is
there a ripple as you explore relaxation in these areas? Are there like
ripples out where there are shifts that happen elsewhere in the body as this
area relaxes? And sometimes an area doesn't particularly seem to relax. That
can be okay too. Can there be a holding of, oh, there's tension there, or not
feeling any more relaxation? Just what's there? Again, using mindfulness to explore
this process. Noticing how you are in relationship to the process of exploring
relaxation in the body. Maybe the legs, the hips, the legs, the feet can soften and
relax. Depending on what's happening in experience, sometimes I find this
exploration of relaxation might be the entirety of a meditation period. Just
exploring where the body might be able to relax. And noticing what happens as
that shift happens, noticing when tension comes back elsewhere in the body,
exploring the possibility of relaxation. Sometimes this can be just what we need
in the middle of our busy lives. Mindfulness of relaxation. Mindfulness of
exploring relaxation, let's say, because sometimes we can't necessarily relax.
And then there's the mind. The mind too, there can be a sense of relaxation in
the mind. Sometimes we have a sense of the mind being tight or pushing at
something or pulling around something. Views, ideas, wantings, aversion, all of
that can be experienced as tension in the mind. Sometimes we can explore the
possibility of, can the mind relax? Maybe the mind can relax too.
Setting aside worries or concerns for this period of time while we're exploring
our present moment experience in a formal way. Setting aside our worries and
concerns in favor of just being with what's here. Exploring the possibility
of relaxation with what's here. Hoping to, seeing if maybe there can be a
container of softness in which whatever experience is happening can be held.
Perhaps there might even be a possibility of having some relaxation about not
being relaxed. It's okay. It's okay. And then for some it may be, it may feel like
the body and mind feel fairly relaxed and there's not much of a need to continue
with this process of exploring relaxation. So opening to, what's here in the
moment? What are body sensations, sound that's happening in this moment? What's
here to be received? The breath perhaps. Emotions or moods. And as the attention
may open to taking in a variety of body sensations or moods or mind states. Perhaps
there can be again that container of okayness, of being relaxed around what's
happening. Relaxed with body sensations. We can be aware and relaxed.
And the mind will forget the whole process of even being aware. We'll get
lost in thought at times. At some point the mindfulness will return and there'll
be the recognition. I'm back or I wasn't aware or lots of thought going on or
something like that. It'll be the recognition that we've been lost and
we're back now. In that moment when the mindfulness returns, can we be relaxed
with that? First of all, relaxed with the fact that we had been lost. We don't
have to kind of get all tense about that. There's nothing we can do about it now
and we're back now. So can we be open to and relaxed with what's here in this
moment as we return, as we have returned? This mindfulness has come back.
Relaxed and aware.
