So continuing the discussion about emotions. People have many attitudes
towards their emotional life. Some people are shy of their emotions, or
troubled by their emotions. Some people don't pay much attention to them. Certain
emotions are considered wrong, or inappropriate to have, or we have an
aversive relationship to them, or we're ashamed of having them, or and some
we're happy to have, somewhere delighted, and hold on to. There's a wide range of
ways of relate to it. In the Dharma, in practicing with emotions, it's useful to
respect all emotions, to all emotions in a sense that all emotions have a place,
and that Buddhism, Buddhist practice, is not meant to negate or squash or push
away any emotion. But in that more respect and openness to experience the
full range of emotions that we have, to come to healthy emotions, to come to a
healthy relationship to emotions, and a healthy source for emotions. And one way
to relate to emotions for this purpose is to see all emotions as maybe all, you
know, provisionally at least, all emotions to be a message. All emotions are
pointing to something. And so we don't want to kill the messenger before
we've seen the message. We don't even after we see the message. But to think of
emotions as pointing to something that's deeper. Some emotions arise out of
other emotions. Some emotions come together with other emotions. Sometimes
if the predominant emotion might be grief, but there might be mixed in there,
there might be a sense of guilt, there might be some shame, there might be
anger. And it's in in in part of the whole complex of how we're feeling at
a particular time. But maybe we focus mostly on the grief where we feel we
might sense the other ones are there, but we feel somehow it's wrong to have
those. But they're part of the complex. And maybe they're a needed part of the
complex. They all point to something. And if we see all these emotions as
being messages, messengers that are pointing to something, then we can be
easier to respect them and take time to get to know them more. If we take
emotions, some emotions like anger as being anger in and of itself without
being connected to something deeper, then we can have an inverse of
relationship to anger. We can feel a shame for having it or upset about
ourselves or something. But if we see anger to be a message and then we ask
what is going on here? What's it pointing to more deeply? And in the
broadest terms, the some emotions arise out of attachment. They arise out of
something we're holding on to and clinging. And so the message might be
the pointer is to discover what are we attached to here? And so rather than
caught up in the anger by itself and relating only to the anger, if we do
that, then we're missing the deeper message, a deeper understanding. But if
we look and see the anger represents something, it's a manifestation of
something that deeper, what might that be? So in terms of other emotions, it
might be that we're hurt and that the being hurt is a primary, more primary
than the anger which is secondary. And so the anger is pointing, allowing the
anger to point back to the hurt, that might is what might be what really
needs our attention, what we want to practice with. Because it's more
primary, that's somehow the source that's prompting the anger. It might be
that what underlies anger is fear. And so if we just stay with the anger and
blame someone and get angry with someone, we won't feel the fear. We won't know
to recognize that we're afraid as well. And recognizing the fear doesn't make us
weak. The anger makes us strong. Recognizing the fear can actually give us
a lot of strength if we learn how to be with fear in a useful, productive way.
But then we're more connected to what's primary. We're coming home to a deeper
way. And now we know what needs to be taken care of. We know better what needs
to happen. But both hurt and fear may be related to something even deeper. Those
are kind of messages too. And what's more deeply, what's going on that's more
deep here. And that's where there might be attachments and there might not be
attachments. If there are attachments clinging, then that's what we want to see
in this practice. That is really the heart of moving towards freedom, is to
see where we're caught. If we're not attached and caught, then below the fear
and the hurt, there might be something that's really precious. Something that's
tender or loving or appreciative or grateful about this life. What's going
on here? There might be some deeper place of being at home that maybe makes us
feel more vulnerable. And rather than avoiding the vulnerability or the
tenderness or the love, the task is, the Dharma task is discover how to find
strength in that, how to find ease with that, how to be wise about that so we can
stay in touch with that as we go through our lives. So whatever the emotion might
be, it should be respected. And what respect means is kind of how I understand
the etymology of the word, the etymology game, is that it's to look again, to
inspect again, to respect, to take a second look or a third look and really
spend time getting to know this experience. What is this? And then be
available to feel or sense. What else is happening here? What is it, what might it
be pointing to? What might it become, be coming out of? Not so much to analyze
what it is, but this is why mindfulness is so helpful. We're kind of like
available to notice what's going on in the cracks of it, what's going on
underneath it. If we open up the attention more widely and look beyond the
secondary emotion or the thing that's strongest at what it's pointing to, then
we might start seeing deeper and deeper sources and processes that are going on.
So in this way we're respectful. And so what's the message? As I've said
now a few times, even the most, you know, even, I'll say this differently, even the
most difficult, challenging, maybe painful, maybe even inappropriate or
emotions that we might feel, the more strong they are, the stronger they are,
the more they represent that there is something important for us to delve into
and see what's going on. There probably is some strong attachment, some strong
clinging to something. And the stronger the reaction, the stronger the despair,
the stronger the grief, the stronger the anger, the stronger the whatever it might
be, the more it actually is a messenger. It's hard to take this idea in sometimes
when the strength of our reactions, strength of our emotions has a lot to do
with the terrible things that are being done to us or happening in the world. And
I don't want us in any kind of way say that we're responsible for our
emotions because, you know, there's terrible things that happen to us, but
the stronger the reaction we have, the more, the richer opportunity, more
important opportunity there is to see where, like the bigger the reaction, the
deeper in our psyche, in our mind, in our hearts, is where the attachments might
be. And so the stronger the reaction, the more it can, it's a doorway into
understanding the depth of what's going on. I've seen this a lot of times on
retreats. The classic example on a meditation retreat is we try to make
these safe places for everyone, but occasionally something happens that, you
know, that is not so safe, not, you know, what, the right thing they were trying to
protect people from happens. I remember once there was a, we were at
renting facilities in a kind of a university and there was a fire in a
distant building in university and there were helicopter, firefighting
helicopters that came flying over really close to us. A lot of noise and maybe
some smoke. There was a woman at the retreat, this is many years ago now, who
still had a legacy, traumatic legacy from growing up with the bombings in
Europe during World War II. And the sounds of the helicopters and the noise
and everything seemed so much like what she was familiar with that had been so
troublesome. She got really frightened. And, but because she was in a meditation
retreat, she kept practicing with it and going deeper and deeper and discovering
where the knot was, where she was still knotted up, holding herself in fear and
protecting herself unnecessarily. And it began, it was able to let go. So on
retreat, it's a very special environment to kind of really, the stronger the
reactivity, the more points that can point something really, really deep.
Sometimes. And, and sometimes preceding the message of is, there's a respecting
emotions, is we're respecting our love, our kindness, our compassion, to give it
time. And when we connect to that and use that as a message to what's more
deeply, more deeper, maybe we connect that to our freedom. We feel, we see, ah,
this, this goodwill I have, this compassion I have, it's arising out of
freedom. And the freedom is maybe the greatest gift we can give to connect to
that sense of freedom that we've discovered and to let that be the vehicle
for our care of the world. So you might try this to whatever emotions you have
today. If it's safe, if it's appropriate, maybe to step away a little bit, be on
your own and reflect more deeply. What is this a message of? What is this
pointing to? If this is a messenger, what's more intimate, deeper, more
important here? What can I discover? And maybe all the emotions are pointing to
something deeper than themselves. So thank you and I'll continue tomorrow.
