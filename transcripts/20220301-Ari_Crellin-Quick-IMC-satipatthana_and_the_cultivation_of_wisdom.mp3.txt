We'll continue this exploration of the cultivation of wisdom in the context of our mindfulness
in the context of the Satipatanasuta, the main discourse on mindfulness practice given by the Buddha
that I know that Andrea has been leading for some weeks now.
So why do we practice mindfulness?
Why do we engage in an irregular awareness practice?
That there are many very deeply wholesome qualities of mind and heart that mindfulness cultivates.
And one of the most powerful and most transformative wholesome qualities of mind that our Satipatanasuta practice, our awareness practice, cultivates is wisdom.
And wisdom is this factor of mind that clearly comprehends what is actually happening in our direct experience.
It's what allows our minds to understand the nature of stress and its causes and its release.
And wisdom dispels the delusion that underlies the ways that our minds participate in our suffering and our struggle with life.
But wisdom illuminates the nature of our experience and the delusion is rooted in certain fundamental misperceptions about the nature of our experience.
On the deepest level, some of the deepest ways that delusion manifests in our relationship to experience is perceiving experience to have more stability and constancy than it does.
And believing that experience is more within our control and more governable than it actually is.
And believing and perceiving that it's possible to arrange conditions in our experience just so that we will be satisfied and no longer experiencing craving or greed or aversion.
There's this kind of this deep belief that it is possible if we try to get what we want and we can finally get it in line with all of our ducks up in a row that we won't experience stress or dissatisfaction or unease anymore.
And that's what keeps us going round and round in this kind of endless cycle of what the Buddha called samsara, this endless searching, endlessly searching for the next thing for release from this cycle of craving and dissatisfaction and unease.
In Guru Tarnakaya, the Buddha says, that gone astray with wrong views, beings misperceive with distorted minds, bound in the bondage of mara, those people are far from safety.
They're beings that go on flowing, going again from death to birth. But when in the world of darkness, Buddhas arise to make things bright, they present this profound teaching which brings suffering to an end.
When those with wisdom have heard this, they recuperate their right mind. They see change in what is changing, suffering where there's suffering and non-self in what is without self.
By this acceptance of right view, they overcome all suffering. This really points to the centrality of misperception and delusion in the origination of our stress and suffering.
And that when there is wisdom present, that suffering is overcome, that there is release. But it's not through the paradigm of greed and aversion which is having things be how we think they should be or how we want them to be, but rather in the relationship to however it is.
There's a profound freedom in not having one's kind of core sense of well-being and freedom be dependent upon what's happening in our bodies which we can't control.
How long can we keep aging and illness at bay? That's a sinking ship. If it's a losing battle, if we think that we can control and stave off all of these natural processes,
or thinking that we can control what we experience even, we do cultivate certain qualities of mind, and that's exactly why we practice.
We practice so that the conditions are set in place so that more wholesome qualities of mind which give rise to ease and well-being are conditioned into and patterned into our hearts and minds.
And yet it's a natural process, and it's a conditioned process. It's very clear when we sit down to practice, to meditate, if we can have the intention to really be mindful for 30 minutes,
and how many times during a 30-minute sitting does a mind wander off despite our intention to attend to the breath, or attend to the body, or just receive, or attend to open experience.
The mind is also not in our control, and wisdom is actually what does the work of letting go.
I think that sometimes we can feel responsible for the ways that we suffer, and we feel like we should be able to let go, and kind of double down on some of these patterns of resistance and stress.
And yet, as the Dhammapada illustrates in the opening lines, there's a really clear conditioned relationship between delusion and other qualities of mind on the one hand, and wisdom on the other,
and whether or not we are struggling and suffering or whether there's ease and peace in the mind.
The Buddha said, All experience is preceded by mind, led by mind, made by mind.
Speak or act with a corrupted mind, and suffering follows, as the wagon wheel follows the hoof of the ox.
All experience is preceded by mind, led by mind, made by mind. Speak or act with a peaceful mind, and happiness follows, like a never departing shadow.
Corrupted here means rooted in greed, aversion, and delusion, the opposite of wisdom.
The instructions themselves of the Satipa Tanasuta really do model the perspective of wisdom to an extent.
We are to observe our experience in a non-reactive, not unidentified way, knowing experience simply as experience, whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
And we are to observe its arising and passing, and the conditions underlying its arising and passing.
So it's really pointing to the cultivation of understanding these three characteristics of impermanence, conditionality, and unreliability.
We're to observe the experience through the lens of these dhamma teachings in the fourth foundation of the five hindrances, the five aggregates, the six sense bases, the awakening factors, and the Four Noble Truths.
These are all lenses that support or characterize the perspective of wisdom.
It's really easy to become identified with the process of meditation and what the mind is doing during our meditation.
I alluded to this a little bit during the sit.
And the instructions really encourage us to include all aspects of our experience and all of the activity in our minds in the field of what is being known.
So we may be trying really hard to be aware.
We may be noticing that we're trying to get it or do it right.
We might be judging ourselves for how our minds are wandering.
We may feel like we've, or we may feel on the other hand, feel like we've really got it and we're awesome, you know, kind of this inflated sense of having got it, having really achieved something.
And all of this is really just to be included as part of the unfolding of this natural process of the mind.
The instructions encourage us to simply, for instance, to know aversion as aversion, really struggling against this agitation, wanting it to go away.
You know, there can be a tendency to not recognize that aspect of the mind, but to be identified with it and then to feel like, oh, to then again, to doubly judge ourselves for being reactive or think we should be able to stop it or like kind of try to will ourselves into how we how we want to be.
And the encouragement is really to include all of that as just like a passing pleasant unpleasant body sensation, whether there's greed or aversion or wisdom.
We can simply know the natural unfolding of the mind and knowing that seeing that that's actually happening on its own and changing so quickly that it's so futile to try to identify or solidify any one moment of experience.
It's just this constantly shifting process of different patterns and experiences arising and passing and all due to many, many, many years of conditioning, many years of conditioning.
It's not not something that we ultimately control. And that can be really good news really relieving to to put down that burden of trying to be how we think we need to be in order to feel okay in order to be acceptable.
But really, this is a natural human process. There is no good or bad experience, no good or bad object.
Ajahn Sumedo is one of the primary Western disciples of Ajahn Shah.
He said that as far as meditation is concerned, people tend to see themselves in terms of either attaining or not attaining.
One thing I commonly hear is, I've been practicing for years and I don't think I've got anywhere. I don't think I've attained anything.
In that case, the basic delusion has never really been penetrated that I've not achieved anything yet is a created thought in the present.
By becoming aware that that is a created thought, one no longer believes such a statement or any thoughts about oneself being reality.
One begins to sense the infinite instead, the unborn, the unconditioned, the deathless in which one no longer limits oneself or binds oneself to the conditioning that one has.
One begins to realize that liberation is through letting go, through allowing life to flow, through openness and attention.
Wisdom is this quality of mind that understands that all of the experiences that arise are part of nature and are on some level deeply impersonal and profoundly not a problem.
This might sound like it borders on passivity, yet when there's room for our own experience to be okay, the qualities of mind that allows to blossom like compassion and kindness and clarity, discernment and wisdom,
allows for a profoundly attuned and effective response to what is happening in our lives and in the world.
The Buddha was completely free from aversion, from craving, from stress, and was not at all passive. He was engaged in peaceful protest and trying to stop wars during his time.
He spent decades traveling throughout India to teach, to help people really release their stress and suffering.
Wisdom is the quality of mind that understands that release from stress and suffering, that relief from dissatisfaction, from agitation is not found through getting rid of what's unpleasant or what we don't like,
or getting the things that we think that we need.
It also doesn't deny those, but it recognizes that it's a futile attempt to achieve security in the realm of conditions that is inherently insecure and unstable.
We can still navigate that in a responsible and caring way with foresight, with being good stewards for our lives and good stewards for the planet and for those around us,
without actually trying to hold on in this tight and grasping way, but that ultimately the deeper happiness comes through letting go through non-greed, non-aversion, and non-delusion rooted in wisdom and love and generosity.
This doesn't mean that we neglect the world, we neglect our lives.
I think that from the perspective of greed, aversion, and delusion, it can feel like if I'm not worried about these things, then surely I'll just be neglectful.
Yet, when we're freed up from these reactive patterns of stress, of worry, of identification, we can actually really effectively tend to things in a much more skillful and effective way,
and still really take care of all of the aspects of our lives that need to be taken care of.
And how is wisdom cultivated through our practice, through this simple moment-to-moment awareness of experience?
Wisdom is a direct and intuitive understanding of the nature of our moment-to-moment experience.
It's really at an experiential level that the wisdom that truly liberates us, that truly uproots these patterns of creative version and delusion that cause stress.
It's at an experiential level that this kind of wisdom is cultivated.
It's not simply a conceptual understanding or a knowledge-based wisdom.
And so it's through this interested and sustained observation of direct moment-to-moment experience, supported by the various lenses through which the Buddha encourages us to view our experience,
that this insight or direct understanding grows and ripens quite naturally without us needing to do it or get it or try to force ourselves to see things in a certain way.
We simply recognize how we're perceiving right now and remembering that it's just nature.
And all we need to do is reflect it in the simplicity of the Satipata instructions, knowing our present experience, simply as our present moment experience.
However, that is moment-to-moment.
But to read a passage from Saita Atajaniya on the process of cultivating wisdom through meditation.
With information comes the opportunity for wisdom to arise.
And with wisdom, the defilements will naturally get less.
The defilements, it's not a great translation for greedy version and delusion, but that's what that refers to.
So with information comes the opportunity for wisdom to arise.
And with wisdom, the defilements will naturally get less.
Whatever is happening in the mind, just let it be.
The objects have nothing to do with you.
They are not personal.
The things that you know, they are just happening.
Everything that happens in the moment is simply a result of past causes and conditions.
Because what you are experiencing now is just a result.
It also means that you can't change this because you can't change the past.
What you can do in the present moment is to act.
And your action will be to be mindful and bring in right view.
And this will mold future events.
So this is the work of a yogi, first to bring in right view and then to maintain awareness.
Often yogis come to me and say, I'm stuck in my practice.
What should I do? How should I continue?
All I need to say is have right view and be mindful.
Let any experience arise.
This is just nature happening.
Don't take it personally.
We need to observe objectively.
And from that we will learn a learning process will unfold.
That is the whole work of a Pasana or insight meditation, a learning process.
You're not trying to control your experience or make it go away.
You're not trying to have a good experience or avoid a bad experience.
You are just going to see what is happening now and see if you can stay with it.
Your only work is to be continuously aware.
So when Saita Otegenia says that when our minds gather the information that they need,
they learn about the nature of our experience and wisdom is born.
And so we are through this careful and interested attention to what is this experience of the body?
What is this experience of stress or what is this experience of having this thought about my life or the world?
We can begin to understand what it actually is in our experience.
And with that information, this kind of direct insight into its nature unfolds quite naturally.
And so we don't have to try to control or make that happen.
We can just simply attend to experience in a very simple way moment to moment.
And this wisdom is a natural result of the mind learning about how our experience works.
And that happens quite naturally as we attend to our experience.
We're encouraged to receive whatever is naturally arising in our experience.
As Otegenia said, not trying to create a good experience or avoid a bad experience.
In fact, every experience is a perfect object of our meditation, including feeling like we're not meditating well.
That's a collection of thoughts and emotions and those are simply natural processes of mind that we can observe and learn from.
So whether we're feeling confused or foggy, that foggy mind is being known.
Or this is confusion, this is confusion in the Satipata instructions and just knowing the qualities of mind that are present,
just as they are, not trying to create the ones that we think we should be having.
Simply recognizing how it is.
This points to this perspective of wisdom that there really is no hierarchy of experience.
Chasing after pleasant experience and pushing away unpleasant experience is deeply natural and human as that is.
That's actually not necessary and not something that ultimately supports our well-being.
Not that we have to feel bad about that, but that when we open to that,
when we begin to really understand that on a direct, intuitive level, that pattern naturally releases.
Whether we're feeling like we don't know what's happening in experience, it takes a little bit of awareness to recognize,
I don't feel like I'm very aware, although that can be the object.
Feeling confused or feeling some doubt.
Doubt is one of the hindrances and in the fourth foundation the Buddha encourages us to simply know doubt when doubt is arising.
Whether we're feeling tense, feeling sleepy.
These are often things that our minds react to, identify with and react to habitually.
And the encouragement in the Satipa Tanasuta is to include all of that as part of what we're being with,
part of what we're observing and learning from.
And the reactions in the mind related to that, which is really where the stress around them comes from.
So we're simply recognizing any of these experiences as such, no matter what's happening in our experience.
And there's no right or wrong object of meditation, which makes this a really profoundly flexible and portable practice
so that we don't have to just be silent in meditation, we don't have to feel quiet and peaceful.
We can be moving quickly and talking and working and on the computer and on the phone and cleaning up and whatever it is that we're needing to do.
And whatever is naturally available to us in our experience,
that's just the simple being with kind of accompanying ourselves throughout our day as we're being natural, just being ourselves.
Just this whatever level of experience is obvious, that's just simply what we can be with and know.
It doesn't have to be very subtle and refined like we might have some idea about how it needs to be very quiet and still in order to see deeply.
But it's possible to have very, very profound insight in the midst of chaotic, busy day-to-day experience just through this interest in attention to moment-to-moment experience.
And we're not grabbing onto the peacefulness that we might feel.
And the peacefulness that we might feel sometimes in our sitting is a pointer to, depending on what's happening,
that can be a taste of or a pointer to some of the fruits of wisdom, the qualities of wisdom when there isn't this reactivity.
And that can be a really powerful source of faith and trust that, oh, this is possible.
Because this practice really does lead in the direction of ease and well-being.
And through this simple observation of what our minds are doing, we begin to see how prevalent these patterns of reactivity and of greed and aversion are,
and how prevalent delusion is, and we begin to directly and clearly see how it is creating stress and suffering.
This is a really essential and powerful insight to begin to understand that it's the craving in response to our experience that underlies stress and suffering.
And it's not the fact that the initial experience was pleasant or unpleasant, which is the story that delusion tends to tell.
It's like, oh, this is unpleasant, so I have to get rid of this in order to be okay.
And yet you may have noticed, without the unpleasant or the pleasant thing changing, sometimes the resistance just falls away.
Or the wanting just falls away, and there's a moment of it not being a problem.
And that can be a real pointer to this possibility of there being the ending of stress without needing to arrange the conditions in the world or in our lives to be how we think they should be.
And as we begin to more deeply understand this, our minds really naturally begin to release this pattern and orient from a relationship of non-reactivity,
of peace, of love, that allows room for profoundly attuned responses that don't add stress and don't add suffering to the situations that we're responding to.
And as our minds begin to understand the impermanent nature of experience, that it's a natural and conditioned process, not something that we're ultimately in control of,
and that not understanding these aspects of experience as what underlies this tendency to hold on to experience.
And the mind only clings, that the mind don't really only clings because it believes there is something stable to cling to, and that there's a stable sense of self that can be satisfied by getting our experience to be how we want it.
The wisdom that develops naturally as we observe this process,
dispels that delusion that underlies these patterns and very naturally non-clinging, ease and well-being and generosity and kindness and love are what flow from the heart when wisdom is present.
When there's this absence of confusion and misperception, these are the qualities of heart that really naturally flow forth.
So this is really what we're cultivating through this very simple, very, it can be really surprising just how simple the practice is and feel like, well, maybe I should be doing more.
And yet, through this very simple, attending to moment-to-moment experience with interest in what it is that's actually happening, through this interest in where is their stress and where is their non-stress, where is their ease.
The mind learns on its own and naturally moves towards deeper and deeper freedom and well-being just through the simplicity of our moment-to-moment interest and awareness.
So those are the reflections that I wanted to start us off with this week and we can continue next week. And I wanted to leave some time for any questions or comments about this talk or about what's alive for you in your practice.
I had a question. Can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah.
You read a quote that had the phrase in it, turn your attention to the infinite.
And that really struck me because there's the observing all of this objectively, if you will, as it's arising, and there's the turning attention to the infinite.
And in my experience of turning my attention, then those things, they're still there, but they're just softer and lighter, right? Or they're in a mist.
So, but I wondered about the relationship between those two, this objective, mindful awareness of experience as it's happening, and turning attention to the infinite.
Yeah, great, great. Thanks for the question. Let me pull that up again.
So this, yeah, the language here, I think points to points a little bit to how I how I hold it myself.
So Ajahn Sumido says that by becoming aware that it's a created thought, one no longer believes it or takes it to be reality, and then one begins to sense the infinite instead, the unconditioned.
And I see this as not so much as something that we do. It's not so much an intentional thing, but it's really that when we start to see through the kind of seeming solidity of the constructions of the mind,
then the mind doesn't glom onto the contents or objects of experience so much.
And then there's quite naturally not so much as something to do as a practice, but quite naturally as a result of seeing through the seeming solidity of the constructions of the mind.
There's a settling back that happens, and other more primary aspects of experience can come to the fore.
These qualities that feel more infinite, that feel more vastly spacious, these qualities that feel deeply still and silent, and still right in the midst of everything still happening.
And that it's through, I think Bhikkhu Bodhi said that we realize the unconditioned through understanding the conditioned.
And so that when through attending to the just however experience is presenting itself, and when there's the insight that really sees through this sense of solidity and stability of experience, then these other aspects of the mind and other aspects of experience start to come to the fore.
I see that as just happening on its own more than something that needs to be directed towards intentionally.
Yeah, but if that's something that's available, like bringing up the, as a reminder, like, oh, can there be an orienting to some, to something, a soft and spacious container or soft and spacious background to experience if there's a reference point there then remembering that can be really skillful.
Yeah, as a pointer.
Thank you.
Fred, yeah.
I want to thank you for your comments about wisdom.
I am relatively new to open awareness meditation, but I have resonated with the idea that awareness alone is not enough.
And, and, and at least for me, one of the things that that goes beyond awareness is wisdom.
And, and I am beginning to have a sense of what you describe as an intuitive and direct experience of it, it is not something that you just think about enough, and it happens.
It is intuitive and direct and your comments around wisdom this morning have, have been very helpful for me.
Thank you very much.
Great.
Very glad to hear that friend.
Thank you.
Any other thoughts or comments or questions.
Kathleen.
I thank you very much. This is the first time I've heard your teaching and I'm wondering if there's a, do you have a regular Dharma talk website or something like that.
No, not, not yet, not yet. Still quite, yeah, quite new, new to the teaching scene.
And most of the teaching that I've, that I'm, I'll be doing, I think we'll be through IMC and IRC.
So there may be some, some more opportunities for me to, to join this and other of Andrea's groups, but nothing, nothing regular yet.
Thanks.
We'll be our at time.
Thank you all very much for your practice and attention and presence.
