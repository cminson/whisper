 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So, the relaxation of faith, the willingness of virya, mindfulness, this quiet impulse to know, certain kind of quiet hunger to know, faith, effort, mindfulness, samadhi, the gathered mind, unified mind. What's the relationship between mindfulness and samadhi? So, it's often distinguished by referencing that kind of aperture of attention. Concentration is narrow, just the tip of the nose or something. Mindfulness is broad. But samadhi doesn't refer to aperture. It can be narrow or broad. Tinnis or Obiku says, many people tell us that Buddha taught two different types of meditation, mindfulness meditation and concentration meditation. Mindfulness meditation, they say, is the direct path. Concentration is the scenic route you take at your own risk because it's easy to get caught there and you may never get out. But when you actually look at what the Buddha taught, he never separates these two practices. Mindfulness, we could say, requires some measure of concentration. Mindfulness itself requires some measure of concentration. Otherwise, we're getting pinged around from memory to image to future body sensations. We're glancing off the objects of attention rather than the sustained soaking, aiming and soaking, aiming, penetrating in the Mahasi lineage. Ajahn Sujito puts it differently of rather than aiming and penetrating the object with attention as pointing and then opening the hand. And the opening of the hand is a kind of samadhi, this sort of poised receptivity, even when we're doing quote unquote mindfulness practice. And Shinsan Yang defines mindfulness as a threefold skill set, working together, sensory clarity, the sense of making discriminating high level resolution on sensory phenomena, equanimity, this non-contention with phenomena and concentration. Samadhi. Attention, attention is the spotlighting function, bringing something to mind, mānāsikāra. And then we kind of brighten the object with attentional light, use that metaphor. And generally concentration, samadhi, it deepens when the spotlight becomes brighter and brighter, steadier and steadier. There's less and less light escaping. In other words, the rest of phenomena are unlit. And we come to live in a much smaller world, a very pleasant world, much smaller. And it's a capacity that supports the other realms of practice. So maybe we say samadhi is the object of attention is fully satiating for the mind. There's no residual hunger for other stimulation. And generally we think about samadhi as involving attention and it does. But a curious note that Ajahn Sajitra makes is that in samadhi all the intentions are aligned. All the energies of the heart-mind are moving in a single direction. That captures something beautiful about it. There's not different impulses banging into each other. It's a state of non-ambivalence, maybe we say. And all the impulses to grasp and push away, all the ways we cope, we just don't need to cope anymore. We're not in samadhi, we're not coping with samsara in the same way. We're not enchanted by samsara, by phenomena in the same way. And so many of our efforts to so much of our thinking, the kind of stories narrativizing our life, are these kind of thin attempts to cope, to grapple the intensity of the human condition with the ungovernability of samsara. And this settles out as the mind gets very comfortable. And so the hunger for sensory pleasure has faded away and there's sort of like nothing to do but offer our attention. And this is revitalizing, gives... Yeah, it gives us... it's revitalizing in the sense that we're secluded, the heart can actually rest and revitalize to meet the intensity of life. Samadhi, it has many functions in our practice, but one of them to my mind is faith, the first of the five faculties, it builds our faith. It's this sense of as we start to maybe for the first time in our practice get really settled, it's like, okay, something's happening here. Before it's like, I don't know, yeah, I'm mindful, yeah, I'm trying to be careful with my sila, my ethics, yeah, maybe I've learned some things, but Samadhi is like, okay, wow, there's something, this is not usual, this is not ordinary. And that is... invites us into a deeper kind of faith, like the Buddha was talking about you, you are not the exception to the Buddha's rule. And that's important because some part of us pretty, I think, maybe deep into the past sometimes thinks that maybe this whole Buddhist thing is another con, some kind, or it is promising way too much. And then as the mind settles in, it's like, wow, I don't know what this is, but this is different and this path is definitely something and I can do it, I can do it. This is the fruit really of letting go, of letting go, not of engineering. And so we can't really cling our way into stillness. And if we try to cling our way back to stillness, it doesn't work. There are stories, tales of people suffering enormously trying to get concentrated or these things, but this is a pleasure born of letting go. And so Samadhi is kind of protected in the sense that we cannot cling our way into it. So it reinforces of letting go. When we really gather when there's strong sense of Samadhi, there's not a lot of learning happening. There are many other wholesome things happening, but there's not a lot of learning happening. In the same way, you wouldn't learn about architecture by staring unwaveringly at a small patch of concrete. The images came the Getty, you know, the Getty in Los Angeles or something. A grandeur of that. But if we were just looking at a patch of the foundation, we wouldn't learn so much. The insight unfolds when the stability of Samadhi is directed to understanding how experience is put together, the architecture of experience, the architecture of self. Samadhi is the quivering quality of mind. I associate it with a kind of... Yeah, usually we use the word quivering for compassion, but this is a different species of quivering, but very, very receptive, very porous, very impressionable, very, in other words, fertile for learning. And so in the penumbra of Samadhi, where maybe there's very little learning, we start to become more attentive to Anicca, to the architecture of experience. And in that stability, the learning, the kind of mind is very fertile for learning, and the Dharma lessons that we experience, they make deeper impressions on the mind. And so sometimes we have some kind of insight or, excuse me, understanding, but what kind of legs does that insight have? What kind of legs does it have? How long does it last? How long does it stay in our bones? How long does the retreat we sat stay in our bones? How long does our understanding about self-love stay in our bones? How long does our understanding about letting go stay in our bones? There's some evidence that exercise, for example, enhances neuroplasticity, the kind of the learning that happens in the wake of cardiovascular exercise. Maybe the altered, the kind of deeper learning, more learning that happens. And if I had to guess, I would say the same for Samadhi. Samadhi makes our mind, brain more malleable. What we've learned leaves a deeper mark. It has more legs when we've learned it on Samadhi. So offer this for your consideration and pick up what's useful. Leave the rest behind. And please know if this causes more suffering for you. That's not what I meant to do. People have their own predilections around Samadhi. Some people just glide path for them. And most people have to grapple, self-included. And so we keep going. We see what the path offers us. Okay. See you tomorrow. Wish you a good day.
