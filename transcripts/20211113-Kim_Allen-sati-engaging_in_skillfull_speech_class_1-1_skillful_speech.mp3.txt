 So warm welcome, a really warm welcome, everybody. What a delight it is to be here all together, practicing together. And what a delight it is for me to be teaching with Kim, Ying and David again. So a deep bow to my current teachers, just sometimes as you guys might imagine with four teachers, we have to plan, right? Before what we're going to say, okay, you say that, I'll say this. And it's such a, at the end of our planning meetings, I had my heart is like so full and I was like, this is so great to work with you guys. So we're hoping that our enthusiasm, our love of this study and practicing together is a little bit contagious and that we can share it with you all. So with that, I'll turn it over to one of my co-teachers, maybe Ying who can introduce herself. So just a warm welcome also for everybody. Yeah, I want to also expand the enthusiasm and as I was sending out this email, I just noticed that the ever expanding list of people who are interested in the Suta study and the practices can really warm up my heart. And I do hope that as we explore this topic, my speech, we can expand our enthusiasm and the warmth all around, even including people who you contact with and you meet in some ways. So I'll pass it down to David. Thank you, Ying. Good morning, everybody. Yeah, lovely to be here. We'll say it several times today and then also repeating as we go forward, just how integral a part of the practice, the attention to speech can be. And so we're just really happy to be engaging in wise speech in the community of practice here at the same time that we sort of study it from the outside. We hope to be able to explore it a bit from the inside. Kim. Yeah, I'll just echo what my colleagues have said in terms of the beauty of our opportunity to teach together and just the wonderful work and just the warmth of having a growing community of people who are interested in engaging, particularly with these polycanon teachings and seeing how they can inform our lives even so many centuries and millennia later. So I have the good fortune of being able to, being asked to summarize all of the many wonderful registration forms. We check where you're from and we invite the opportunity to say something about your interest in the class. And so I'm always inspired to read these and we do actually read them. So I thought I'd share just a few of that, of those, because we asked so many people, we're not gonna have a chance for everybody to introduce themselves, although you'll get to meet each other in breakout rooms. But just wanna share a little bit about what this group expressed on their forms. So, well, just first of all, sort of demographics of location at least, we have people here from nine countries and 20 US states, at least among the registrations. I don't know if everyone made it. So that's impressive. So we have quite an international and broad group. And then I wanted to start with a quote from one of the forms that kind of sets the tone, which said, speech in my experience is highly impulsive. Anybody relate to that somehow? Yeah, so, you know, speech is conditioned and we see how it comes forth. So then some of the other areas that people mentioned as interest in this topic are the aspect of CELA that would be speech as the precept of the fourth precept. And then also people pointed out that they knew that speech was part of the eightfold path. And you know, it's the third step of the eightfold path. And so that frames it as an action that's skillful or unskillful, you know, that can move us toward or away from suffering. And so there were many kind of sub areas, maybe summarized into a few, the intention to reduce harm through speech, the wish to increase kindness through speech. So both sides of those understanding that unwise speech is a cause of strife in the world. And so not wanting to contribute to that. And then maybe the flip side is to live a more peaceful and harmonious life. And I also came to my awareness that some of you are in the eightfold path program being run by IMC right now. And I know that you're on intention this month, but speech is coming next month. So you guys are really prepared to go do this ahead of time. And then you'll get the review when you do that path step next month. And then people had some nice questions about speech. So maybe a broad question asked by a few people was, what do the Buddhist teachings say about wise speech? I think this is a great question because speech being such a challenging area for us as humans, there are a huge number of systems out there and many of them are good. There's nonviolent communication, there's various other ones that have names. And so what we'll be asking or focusing on in this course is what do the early Buddhist teachings have to say about this area of speech? And if one is engaged generally in a mindfulness or early Buddhist practice, you might want to use the form of speech training that's offered within that system in order to be kind of consistent and harmonious. We'll explore maybe some sutas that are less known about why speech also. And then we had some kind of insightful observations. Some people had commented that they had seen the link between mental patterns and what gets spoken, how our thoughts affect our speech. This is very wise and speech comes from what was happening in the mind. So we will need to be looking at that also. And some people pointed out that listening is a key support for wise speech. Well, that happens to be one of our themes for this first class. So we're gonna address that one directly. And then many people pointed out also that they have an immediate practical utility for speech practice right now in their work or their family situation. So some people have very specific areas, maybe they're caregivers and are in a situation where they need to speak very carefully with the kind of a delicate situation, people with children, people with work colleagues that they're working with. So we hope that the teachings we're offering in this course will not just be abstract, but very pragmatic for these specific situations. And a few people said that they wanted to practice speech with others. How else do you practice speech? So this is an opportunity, this is a great opportunity to have a class like this, because we'll get to do practice in the breakout groups. And if you want, you could even bring in principles of wise speech if you're asking a question of us, you could be mindful of that. Okay, so that's great. So this is who we are. And then we'll maybe I'll just move right into talking sort of an overview in our aims for the course before we get into the specific teachings. So this course is called Open Heart, Open Mind, Open Mouth, which we happen to notice has the acronym OOMOM. So I don't know, maybe that's gonna be relevant somehow. But it gave us a good laugh when we realized it at least. But more seriously, we did mean to suggest that there's an alignment between the heart and the mind and the body when we're speaking, right? We have all of these factors coming into play. That's one of the reasons that speech is so hard is because it involves many different aspects of our being. But at the same time, that's also very unifying. You know, if we can speak well and be aware of the mind and the heart and the body, that is a harmonious kind of way of being. And so speech is a very important practice for unification. So then I guess I'm leading into the point that wise speech is a powerful practice in and of itself. It's not just a side practice. It's not something that's just about the personal realm and so it's not as important as cushion practice where we're silent, for example. That's not true. There's actually the potential for genuine Dharma insight to come from speech practice as well as fruitful personal understanding of ourselves. It has both of those dimensions. So, you know, we can understand, maybe you've already seen that speech can bring great dukkha and it also has the potential for great good. So we have four classes on this amazingly powerful topic. So that means that we'll have the chance to approach it from many different angles and also delve into some of the more particular or specialized aspects of this speech practice. Much of our teaching will of course be based on the early Buddhist texts. The Buddha actually offered a lot of teachings about speech. Some of them kind of just slight variations of each other. So we'll do that. And then he also though offers examples of why speech in his own interaction with people, right? Most of the Buddhist teachings are somebody comes to the Buddha and asks a question. And then he uses that as an opportunity to explain something about the Dharma. And so, but there's often a little hint of, or sometimes more than that, sometimes there's a whole story about how it is that he's interacting with this person. And so what if we look at the teachings with the lens of the Buddha was doing why speech. So what can we learn just from how the Buddha was talking with people about principles of why speech? This is maybe not always the way that it's approached, but it's all over, that makes it all over the teachings. Almost every suta has something to say about it then. So we'll go beyond, you know, maybe the kind of basic risks that you often hear in talks, although we will cover those also. So you'll get the kind of general teachings. So if there were to be a top level framing for the course, I don't know that we have anything, you know, really overarching, but we could look to a suta called MN61, which was a discourse where the Buddha was talking to his son, Rahula, who was a boy at the time. And in this teaching, we're asked to reflect, very carefully, around our speech, before and during and after we speak, in order to consider whether the speech is bringing affliction to ourself, to others, or to both. So that's kind of an overarching principle, that we want to avoid affliction, but we are included in the mix of that. You know, it's easy to think about, well, let me check what's happening with the other person. Let me make sure I say something that is the right thing for them, but wait, it has to be right in our own heart also. And for both of us, for the mix, you know, the combination of the two of us. So speech is aimed at non-harming, it's aimed at mindfulness in the moment, and it has some contextual sensitivity. We'll go over all of those as we go through the course. So then I want to also just say a brief word about the wide variety of communication media that we have in our modern world. So in the Buddhist time, speech meant that you were talking to someone, you know, they didn't have phones, they didn't have computers, social media. Now we have non real-time communication, like email. We have many opportunities to speak to people that we are not seeing at that moment, on the phone, on social media, et cetera. We're not in somebody's presence when we're speaking with them. And research has shown that these more distant or less directly connected formats, when we're using them, we are not as careful. We would say, we are willing to say things when we can't see a person's face that we wouldn't say in their presence. Social media isn't therefore problematic, I think, in this regard. So it means more mindfulness on our part because the speech that we do is an action that impacts our karma, even if, and if we're being less careful because we don't see the person, it still has that impact. So in this SUTA MN61, the key step is to be mindful as we are speaking, to see if what we're saying is having an appropriate impact. Now in email, we can't do that step necessarily, but we can still feel the impact on ourselves am I speaking kindly, am I speaking what's true? So just to be aware that for us, maybe it's a little more challenging with the wider variety of media that we have, but we can still be in line with the guidance of the Buddha that he gave on why speech. And of course, we also share some commonalities with people of the Buddha's time. I don't wanna emphasize just that we have vast differences. Actually, there are still many internal and external conditions that shape our speech that we can pay attention to and have some control over. So today's theme for today is speech and listening as integral practices. So the two go together. And so Ying is now gonna talk more about the ecology of conditions that support practicing wise speech. And where I started out by saying speech is conditioned, well, what are those conditions? And then later Diana is gonna talk about listening. So with that, please Ying. Thank you, Kim, for this beautiful overview of the unfolding of our course and wide range of topics related to this. I love the Kim's word ecology of the conditions. So what I'm about to share, maybe using an analogy that wise and skillful speech as the fruit, then there's lots of conditions that we're putting place for the fruit to come about, planting the care, planting the seeds and watering and the sunlight and everything. And so what the ecology, the word ecology, stimulating my mind is the wide range of conditions. So what I'm about to name is only a small handful of them. And so this part of the conversation is meant for you to maybe use this as a pointer to begin to have some reflections of your own. And maybe you have observed other conditions that are conducive for wise speech and wholesome speech. So don't take this as a comprehensive list, rather these are pointers and stimuli for you. Okay, well, the first one Kim mentioned mindfulness. Dada, right? We all know this, cultivation of mindfulness. I wanted to maybe talk about three dimensions of mindfulness cultivation that are particularly relevant to wise speech. We often talk about mindfulness on and off cushion. And in this part of the sharing, I want to also really emphasize off cushion practices. We often associate mindfulness with formal meditation, kind of turning internally and that's wonderful. I mean, don't take me wrong, but this is not important. Rather what I'm inviting is to expand the off cushion mindfulness practices as well. Can we bring mindfulness in our daily life activities? What this does is as we began to tone our mindfulness muscle, remember to be mindful when we're brushing our teeth, washing our dishes, eating. As mindfulness began to spill over in various aspects of our lives, so mindful speech, mindful communication become more natural. And so allow ourselves to expand that mindfulness cultivation regime to include the daily life activities, whether it's related to our speech or not. The second aspect is mindfulness internally, externally and both internally and externally. And so again, often we associate what mindfulness is with turning within, wonderful, that's great practice. But also I'm inviting you to expand mindfulness to include our external dynamics. And the stage and communication is a relational field that we can tune in to. And as we cultivate mindfulness, including the external environmental dynamics, we began to have increasing sense of maybe sensitivity to what might be needed and whether our certain speech and communication might be timely. But this requires cultivation, gradual cultivation. And so as we engage in mindfulness, can we begin to expand to include wide range of what's happening in our environment? And so cultivating that myself. I remember sometimes when I take my son to school in the morning, I would really sense his mood, how he's at, where he's at before I say anything. Because there are times that I would notice that he, he's appearing, he has some sort of intensity in him. And it could be that he's got four tests going on that day. And so if I'm not careful, anything I say that's related to school can just kind of, boom, set the fire out. And so I'm just gonna really be careful, kind of tuning into what might be needed. And then could be on the way back and he's totally different. Maybe he feels he's very confident about his tests and he's very happy and he's chatting himself. And then that gives me a different sense of what might be needed. And so allow ourselves to cultivate that capacity to, to include our surroundings and the dynamics around there. And then the third aspect of the cultivation is the embodied mindfulness. I think as Kim was mentioning, that some of you noticed that a mindful speech is really hard. Maybe relatively speaking, mindfulness of our bodies embodied mindfulness, relatively speaking might be slightly easier. So as we began to listen and sense, feel our bodies more and more, we can use how our body to guide our speech, guide our communication. So if you're typing in, email feeling the body very intense, maybe that sends a certain message in terms of how you are. And so really tuning into the body as we speak, as we share, as we listen, even now, maybe just dropping in a few moments, how is our bodies? With the felt sense of it right now. And so the embodied practice is quite powerful in guiding many things that's going on in our mind, in our hearts. And the second aspect of cultivation as a conditions that are conducive for mindful speech is to explicitly cultivate wholesome qualities of heart and mind and body. And for example, cultivating Ramavi Hara's kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity, on and off cushion and cultivating ease and compassion and cultivating the ease and contentment in our beings. Cultivating ethical conduct, cultivating the ease and contentment in our beings, ultimately cultivating ethical conduct. And as Kim was mentioning, these are the ecosystems dynamics in us. When our heart feels all unkind, we can trust what flows out of it. And so there can be a lot of trust in that overall flavor of our being. And that those kinds of practices can be done both on and off cushion formally and in our daily life. And so engage in this exclusive cultivation and become a potent conditioning for wise speech. And the last thing I will mention has to do with what Kim also talked about in the title of our course, open heart, open mind, and open mouth. And that is stay open, maybe even refrain from jumping into grand conclusions in our speech too quickly. And I say this because many of us are living in an environment that are increasingly diverse. Many people maybe do not have the same mother tongue language for me. And I grew up with Mandarin Chinese. And I'm keenly aware that even when we're speaking English as a common language to exchange my relationship to the same words, maybe quite different from others. I often notice how certain words seem to have a quite strong emotional relationship to certain people. Or for me, I don't quite get that kind of emotional sense with the words, maybe because I didn't grow up with that conditioning. Instead, with Chinese language mentoring, there's a lot of rich emotional connection with the words. And so we can kind of begin to open ourselves to this wide diversity of associations with our exchanges and communication and allow us to come through, through listening, through tuning in carefully and stay open. As four of us were putting this course together, we had a reflection about how the Buddhist teachings came from very different culture and different times. And all of us probably had a situation where we feel like the analogies and similes in the suttas kind of like this, we really don't get it. But as we stay open, we all know this teachings offered tremendous values to so many people down through generations and centuries. And so I want to end this part by saying that why speech is definitely not easy. And, and, you know, no wonder so many of us were really kind of curious and wanting to learn about this. Yet to the wise speech, a wholesome speech is a gradual cultivation, it's a practice we all can engage in. And little by little we learn and we reflect. So may we all grow in this dimension. So I'm gonna invite Kim next. Okay, so now you'll have a chance to discuss a little bit among yourselves and a chance to meet a few other people in the course in some breakout groups. And you'll have, you know, maybe 10 or 12 minutes in the groups together, probably. Yeah, we'll have time for 12. And the question that you'll be contemplating together is, in your experience, what are the internal and external conditions that most support you to be mindful in speech? So kind of an application of what Aang was talking about in general, you could bring it into your specific life and situation, and your understanding. What are these some of these conditions that most support you? You know, like, for example, I think being in a really noisy disco tech is not a really good external condition for me to be mindful of speech. So maybe you can think of things like that and also ones that are more supportive. And we'd like to suggest a particular way of going around and doing the sharing so that you can have a chance to be reflective and be mindful, you know, begin practicing actual mindfulness while the mouth is open during this breakout group, which is that if you could have a brief silence between each person sharing something, so you go around, you'll just go around each person sharing one condition, you'll get to go around a number of times. And when one person shares something, if you could just pause in the group for two or three seconds, and then the next person can share another internal or external condition that supports mindfulness of speech. So you'll get a chance to observe in real time how that is. And I know it's a little bit artificial way of speaking, but since we're planning it that way, you can understand that you're all doing that together. And then maybe just to be clear about who will start, the person who is just the person who is Zoom name is alphabetically first can begin. And then you can go around from there, maybe you can go around in alphabetical order. So are the groups set up, Diana? They are. Okay, so we'll see you back soon. Take care. Okay, people are starting to come back. Okay, I believe that would be everybody back. So how was that? This is now a time for comments about the process or sharing any of the wonderful wisdom about the differing conditions that support you. Oh, and just as we get started, let me also mention that something came up for David. And so it's just going to be Diana and Ying and me for the rest of this session. But yeah, we just wanted to let you know. And you can raise your Zoom hand. That's the best like Tina has modeled for us. Many of you know where that is. It's on the reactions button at the bottom, or there's a couple other ways to get there. Okay, great. So Tina, why don't you go ahead. Yeah, good morning, everyone. It's just wonderful to be here. It was wonderful to be in the group with three other people. And after we have gone on this round of sharing and realizing how much we have in common, I mean, everything that the other person have felt before, I think was shared by all of us, but I think what was even more powerful, as we noticed at the end of the session was just us sitting there and just being with each other in silence that was just as powerful as, if not sometimes even more powerful than the sharing sometimes. So that was just heart, you know, just heart tenderizing, just to be with these lovely women. Oh, beautiful. Yeah, there's the speech and then there's the silence. And they're not really opposites in terms of mindfulness, they each support in various ways. Thank you for pointing that out. And yes, we were hoping to create some connections through those groups. Eileen. Oh, okay. Thank you for this opportunity to have our small group. I think I learned a lot. And one thing that I was very aware of is I was never much of a talker. It took a long time for me to be able to speak up much. And now when I do, I'm so nervous that it's not an embodied experience, as he was talking about, it's like out of body almost until I finish. But I'm also tending to not listen to well when I'm thinking about that and being nervous. So the nervousness kind of overrides a lot of things. And so practicing mindfulness and taking a breath would be a good technique, I think, for dealing with that. Beautiful. And sometimes, you know, we worry that if we pause in a real time conversation, that it will just look too weird. And, you know, three or four seconds might be more than people can understand socially. But there is often a space for a short pause, that it doesn't feel out of the flow. And in fact, it can even help the conversation if one person is being somewhat careful. So if you want to put in a one second pause, you know, to support your own mindfulness, even in everyday conversations with folks who are not practicing, don't be shy about that. Anybody in this group, I think it can really work and be supportive. And I invite for any of these, my fellow teachers to add anything they would like. So Jeff. Yeah, I think that that's a very good important point that you just made, Kim. And I can just think back on probably many circumstances, but very recently, one contentious discussion that really got out of hand. And several times I said, Well, I think we need to, I think we need to pause right now. And then he'd say something. And I'd have of course have something else to say. But with that moment momentary pause that you just mentioned, I think it would have saved a lot of grief for both of us or for me, when I even said, I think we need to pause to really have done that. And that's and that's hard to do. But just that one second thing, I'm going to try that I think that would be very valuable. I know that it makes common sense. But do I do? No, but I can. Thanks, Kim. Thank you, Jeff. Yeah. Crystal. Oh, he wants to add something. Thank you. And I just want to say one point about this pause and slowing down, maybe carrying over in our communications in other modalities, like social media, emails, sometimes it's worthwhile to write something down and save it as a draft before you just hit the button and the send. For me, it saved a lot of grief. As Jeff said, oftentimes, I find myself, oh, I don't need to do this anymore. So I use that as a part of the multimodality in communication as well. Yeah. Okay. Crystal. Crystal. This didn't come up in my group because I forgot about it because I was listening. But when Ying was talking about taking care to be aware of what's going on with others, I had a question. I don't know if we'll talk about it, but just to put it out there with regards to those of us who maybe had to do that out of dysfunction when we were growing up. So my experience is that I'm not super embodied because I'm spending a lot of time making sure I know what's going on with everyone else and where they're at. And so my practice will be to figure out how to shift that. So yeah, this points to one of the things we mentioned early on is that speech practice is a little bit of a mirror for what's going on in our mind. And we can learn a lot about ourselves through our practice of embodying, being mindful of speech. We learn also about our body and our mind and how to unify those in some way. And so maybe this openness that Ying brought up is so important is that we don't need to think that, oh, if I were mindful of my speech, I would look like X. We have ideals in our mind of what we think we should be like. And maybe to be open to the surprise of the Dharma is that what the wholesome way for you to be embodied and body, heart and mind might not look like what you imagine it would, but it would be good. Don't worry, but just have that openness so that we cannot constrain ourselves through what we think we ought to be doing. Thank you for bringing that up. And I guess we have, yeah, we have time, Jerry. I'm not fluent in insight, dialogue, but I do remember their first step is pause before you say anything is pause. That's true. Right. For me, this is brand new. It's somewhat also came from what you was talking about is if I call it speech, then it feeds my, my dysfunction in speech. But if I realize it's communication or dialogue or interaction, it brings the, the, the receiver to the same status as the me, the speaker. And I think that that in and of itself might modify and maybe contribute to more wise communication versus wise speech. That seems too much selfing when I say that why speech for me. Very nice. Yeah, so much depends on our framing of situations. So there's a suggestion that you can, everyone else can see if that lands. If we frame it as communication instead of speech, does that help you in some way? And well, we're right at the, at time. So we are going to have a chance for some more Q&A later. So maybe we'll go on with Diana at this point.
