Dharmette: Healing Inner Division

Some years ago, I learned that in the rules Buddhist 
monks follow, they’re allo wed to defend themselves if  
attacked . I was surprised because  of the idea  that they 
are supposed to be non -violent , and that means  not 
doing anything . However , what they’re allowed to do is 
block or push back if someone attacks them . They are 
not allowed to have weapons , so that limits how much 
they can do . But if someone is going to hit them, they 
can put up their hand to block the hit. T hey are not 
allowed to hit back , but they can  defend themselves in 
that way . If someone tries  to push them off a cliff , they 
can push back to pr event being pushed off .  
 
It seems pretty basic and instinctual to defend one self in 
that way . But there is an additional caveat, which is  that 
they’re  allowed to strike or block as long as they do it 
with loving -kindness. That is a higher level of 
requirement . How many of us could say we can do that? 
The training for monastics then is to cultivate and 
develop their loving -kindness to such a degree  that they 
can be relaxed, open, peaceful, and secure e nough that 
they won’t have hate  or anger when involved in self -defense.  
 
I think i t’s natural for people to want to defend 
themselves . When something wrong is going on  in the 
world , it’s natural to want to do something about it . We 
have to be very careful , however, not to use  the 
approaches we  may have for living in the everyday 
external world when we are  dealing with our internal 
world . In the external world , if your dishes are dirty , you 
clean them . If your house is a mess , you clean it up . If 
there’s a big storm in your nei ghborhood , you go out 
and help clean up so that the cars can get by . If a 
neighbor breaks her foot , you take her a meal . You do 
things . This idea of doing and taking care is often 
appropriate in the external world.  
 
However, for our inner world , that same idea can 
sometimes lead to additional suffering , beca use the 
inner world may be less amenable to be ing fixed in the 
same way . The inner world works best if it’s whole . If 
you start dividing yourself against yourself , it doesn’t 
work so well . If some part of you is the problem , and 
some part of you is the judge of the problem , it’s very 
easy for the two to be at war or at odds with  each other . 
If you have the  idea, “This is thing inside me is not 
acceptabl e,” then a part of you is judging.  The idea of 
fixing , changing , and defending in the internal world 
lends itself too easily to a kind of inner divide  – the 
absence of  being whole.   
In our Buddhist scene, o ne reason  it’s fairly popular to 
emphasize acceptance as an important  part of practice 
is to heal that divide. It’s not 100% popular – some 
people don’t like this overly accepting Buddhist attitude 
of holding ourselves as whole rather  than divided . But a 
lot of people have found that when you can turn towards 
your inner life , and meet it with some kind of 
acceptance, some kind of ‘okayness, ’ a number of 
things can happen.  “It’s okay , I’ll just be here, s how up 
and be present in a loving , open,  kind way.”  
 
Not be ing against , not fighting, not fix ing things  quickly, 
make s space  for things  to happen . One is that whatever 
the issue  is, it begins to soften . Maybe it can entirely 
dissolve th e divide between right and wro ng, good and 
bad, one self versus another self.  That can be  very 
profo und. Some people ’s primary suffering is that they 
are trying to fix that divide. T hey don’t realize that  the 
divide is theirs , so they ’re always trying to fix the other  
side of the divide  – not realizing  that the divide itself is 
the problem . The problem is  not what’s on the  other 
side. And acceptance begins to heal the divide.  
 
There seems to be a natural intelligence, a natural 
wisdom inside. P eople describe it in different ways . 
Another thing that can happen when you accept rather 
than try to fix is that this  natural process in which the 
inner life can unfold probably  has more wisdom to it than you would ever figure out . So, if you are on one 
side of the divide deciding , “This is what has to happen,” 
as if you are wise and all-know ing about  the intricacies 
of you r psychology , life, and heart, chances are you 
have only a minuscule picture of all that is  going on .  
 
An analogy I like is when  you have a wound  or a cut . 
The process  of healing that cut is phenomenally 
complex . The antibodies , the hormones , the cellular  and 
the neurological stuff  all get marsh aled together to heal 
that cut. I t’s a very complex physiological process. M y 
guess is that – even if we knew everything that is 
required – none of us have the intelligence to really 
orchestrate that  healing . But it can be orchestrat ed 
inside  – the system knows how to do it . I believe that’s 
true with our heart  in the same way. O ur heart is 
probably more complex than we can track and take care 
of ourselves . There’s something very respectful of our 
physiology about just keep ing the wound clean , and 
letting the system take care of itself . In the same way, 
there’s something respectful of our heart, our inner life, 
if we kind of keep it clean and allow some inner healing, 
unfolding, or inner growth to happen on it s own .  
 
What is that that needs to happen? We don’ t know 
what’s going to happen , but the willingness to trust the 
unfolding is something  a lot of people have di scovered 
through doing “accept ing mindfulness ” – being present, 
accepting , and turning towards what’s here. T he inner life needs something different from us than what the 
outer life may need . Acceptance in t he inner life doesn’t 
mean that you have to  automatically be  accepting of 
everything in your external life . Not everything should be 
accepted .  
 
But in meditation practice , or quiet times , or at various 
points in your life,  it’s a really profound thing  to spend 
time with yourself and not be at odds with yourself in 
any way . Instead, open to who you are as if it’s okay  – 
as if it’s complete ly fine – and then make space for 
whatever it is . In this way, you  allow for  the unfolding  
and healing of this deeper dis covery because it  can 
show itself and unfold as it wishes.  
 
Part of the wisdom of this is th at sometimes when you 
turn towards the inner life, accept it, hold it, and are  
present for it , what unfolds is  not very endearing . It 
doesn ’t look particularly wonderful. However , what’s 
unfolding inside sometimes is what needs to happen . 
The great diffi culty can be  the challenge s of the backlog 
needing  to surface . Put yourself in a situation where it’s 
safe and appropriate to allow that to arise . Continue 
gettin g out of the way , and trust the process . Hold it with 
acceptance , which is  not naïve – not sinki ng in to it, not 
believing it , but just holding it in acceptance where you 
are the adult . And, as the adult , you can hold it all and  
be with it all as it is. I hope you will try this.  
 It’s a little bit like aikido or judo where you go w ith the 
force of your opponent . You kind of accept it , take it , 
see where it goes , and use it  – not fight it. It’s the same  
with our inner life . I’ve done this with my thinking mind . 
There are times in my practice where , rather tha n letting 
go of my thoughts and  distractions when I’m meditating, 
I notice I’m distracted , and think , “I’ll go along , and just 
keep th inking. ” It’s like I sid le up next to it , go along with 
it – not fight ing or block ing it, or say ing it is wrong . Then 
when we are there together , I bring my thinking mind 
back to the present moment . That works much better for 
me than, “ I can’t do this. This is wrong , and I have to let 
go and come back. Gil , what are you doin g?”  
 
I hope this gives you a flavor, a sense, of something 
that might be called “acceptance practice ,” or “receptive 
practice ,” or “open practice .”
