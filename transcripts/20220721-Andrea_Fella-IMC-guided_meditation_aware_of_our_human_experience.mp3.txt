 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. In a simple way, just connecting with how you are in this moment. This doesn't have to be a detailed diving in, but just simply sitting and knowing that you're sitting, aware, whatever is obvious or most available, whatever is easy to connect with in this moment. It might be the body. Often the body is a pretty obvious aspect of our experience. And yet sometimes as we just arrive with ourselves, what we notice perhaps is kind of the busyness of the day, of whatever we've been doing, a momentum of whatever's been happening, a kind of an energetic tumbling. And sometimes I find at the beginning of a sitting, connecting with just knowing that. Yeah, lots of energy here, a tumbling on of energy and thoughts and moods, nothing kind of specific that I'm noticing, but just more the quality of how I am right now. And it is possible for mindfulness to just allow that, just notice it with a sense of friendliness, of interest, of kindness. Oh, this is how I am right now. That's okay. Allowing the awareness to feel kind of like a resting. The awareness can rest and be aware of whatever is happening, a tumbling energy, body sensations, thoughts, motions. This resting awareness is supported by relaxation. And so once I've kind of connected with my experience, just kind of acknowledged this is how I am in this moment, I'll begin orienting towards a relaxation of body, exploring the possibility of allowing the body to relax. We might do this kind of consciously or systematically, scanning through the body and noticing where there may be is tension, consciously relaxing or releasing tension where that's possible. So maybe the face, the head, the neck, the shoulders can relax. Maybe the arms and hands can relax. Maybe the chest and upper back can relax, all those muscles around the rib cage. Maybe the muscles across the stomach and abdomen can soften. Sometimes letting those muscles kind of hang forward a little bit, kind of subconsciously or habitually hold them in to let them hang forward, see if there can be a softening there. Maybe the middle and lower back can relax, the hips, the legs, the feet. And then sometimes it's available or possible to check in kind of more deeply inside of the body and see perhaps if the inside of the throat can relax. Maybe the heart can relax the area around the heart. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. And then perhaps exploring the possibility, seeing if there can be a releasing or letting go of mental tension that may be there. Worries or concerns about the past, the future. Thoughts about what's happening now. Kind of loops that our minds get in. Maybe that can be softened and relaxed. Maybe the mind can relax a little bit. With even a little bit of relaxation of body and mind, there's a little more ease and capacity that we have to quite naturally just be aware. And the body's relaxed and the mind isn't caught up in worries and concerns. What it does, what the mind does is to notice what's happening. Here and now, it's very natural capacity process that is available. And so, noticing whatever is easily available, obvious, whatever is already being noticed in this moment. Maybe that's hearing the sound of my voice or sounds in your space. Or maybe it's body sensations. Or feelings, emotions, thoughts. Exploring the possibility of settling back and not having to look for anything. Just being willing to receive what is naturally showing up to be known in this moment. Something is showing up to be known. It may not be what we think it should be or what we want it to be, but there is something that's available easily to be known. What's already known in this moment. Moment after moment, what is easily available to be known is the attention may linger with something for a little while. With a body sensation or sound or breath. Or the attention may shift. Connecting to a sound and then drawn to a body sensation and then drawn to a feeling and then another sound. Kind of a flow of different experience just tumbling on. And that's what's happening for you. That flow of changing experience. Can you relax and just let that be? Being aware of this changing flow of stream of human experience. Relax and receive this human. This humanness that is showing up. It's available to be known. It may seem simple or mundane. A pressure or attention or a breath or a sound. What is happening isn't so important actually. The practice unfolds and deepens through a curiosity about connecting with our human experience. Whatever that is, whatever human experience it is, every experience is worthy of our curious attention. Every experience. And in relationship to this tumbling on of different experiences, we'll have different ideas, agendas, views, opinions. And that too is part of our human experience. That too is worth becoming aware of. And so in the opening to this tumbling on of whatever is happening in this moment, every now and then it's useful to check in. What's my relationship to what's happening? Do I like it? Not like it? Think it's boring? Think it's interesting or fascinating? Whatever that relationship is. Exploring the possibility of allowing the awareness to also know that. No, thinking this is boring is happening. That's another part of our human experience. Not liking this is happening. Or maybe there's appreciation or interest that's happening. That too. That too can be open to. Our practice is basically really, really simple. Relaxation is helpful to start. And then recognizing what you're aware of. This tumbling on of human experience. Changing perhaps dynamic flowing. Sometimes stabilizing. Just aware of moment to moment of what this experience is. Simple. Simply knowing what this is in this moment. So occasionally having the curiosity of how am I in relationship to what's happening? Or the attitude or way that the mind is looking at experience. Simple awareness. Each moment. Receiving our human experience. This is all that's happening in the moment. And in this moment our relationship to what's happening. Either creates a sense of struggle with what's happening or an allowing and ease with what's happening. And opening to all of it. Slowly moves us in the direction of more and more allowing. More and more ease with the unfolding experience....................... you you you
