Dharmette: Impact Versus 
Reaction

In the practice of mindfulness, it is useful to pay 
attention to the distinction  between impact and 
reaction  – the impact , and our response to what 
happens . The impact is how something affects  
us. Someone says something, or we hear 
something, or something happens to us, or we  
see or  think something, or we experience a 
feeling or emotion  – something occurs. A nd that 
which occu rs has an impact on us  – it makes a 
difference to us . Based on that impact, we then 
have a response or a reaction.  Generally , the 
word ‘reaction ’ refers to something that is more 
automatic , while ‘response ’ is something that is 
more intentional or consciou s.  
 
Still, there are two things: the impact and the 
response. Someone might poke you in the ribs , 
and the impact is that it hurts  (or you get tickled ). 
The response might be to punch that person  out. 
As far as you are concerned, t hose two things might happen almost simultaneously. You don’t 
really experience the impact – you just punch 
the person out.  
 
But with mindfulness practice , it is possible to 
tease these two  apart – so that we become 
aware that th e impact is one thing , and the 
response is another. This allows us to have 
more ch oice about how we respond to a  
situation. When we don’t see the difference 
between the two, there is very little choice,  and 
we just react . We may reflect later about why we 
did that.  
 
With mindfulne ss practice, it is helpful to learn 
how to pause , and take in the experience of the 
impact  – to really feel and sense the impact 
something has on us. This is especially useful 
when we don’t have to respond right away. If 
nothing is required immediately, there is a 
tremendous advantage in  taking your time , not 
responding as quickly  as you could  – but rather , 
just take your time and pause , and hang out with 
the impact.  Feel the impact. There might be 
layers and layers of impact. Then, not only will 
you have more choice, but also you will begin to 
be wiser about the nature of the reaction itself. You’ll see what is  the impact , and what is the 
reaction.  
 
Sometimes people assume that a cer tain 
reaction or response is the impact. An example 
might be  that you might hate something , or be 
afraid of something , or love and desire 
something , and you might think that is the 
impact. This is desire  or aversion . I experience 
this, and I hate it  – and that’s the impact. But if 
you learn how to linger , stay with the impact , 
and feel it  – you might learn what that impact is 
actually like. What you might see is that the 
hate, the fear, the love, the desire are all 
responses that are being triggered by the initial 
impact , which is u sually fairly simple.  
 
The impact might be that the experience is quite 
unpleasant. You can feel th at unpleasantness. 
To linger with that is to linger with the 
unpleasantness.  Just take that in.  If you learn 
how to do that , then you might see that the hate 
or fear was not a reaction to the event outside, 
but rather was triggered by the unpleasant 
impact that experience had on you. If you see 
something really  beautiful and you want or love 
it, what you might see is that some times the 
desire or the liking is not necessarily for the event , the thing,  or the person  – but rather is 
about the pleasant sensations of the impact on 
you.  
 
It is quite amazing how often our emotional 
reaction is not directly connected to the events 
around us , but rather goes through these steps  
in response to the impact of our sensations  – not 
on the event itself .  
 
To see the difference between the impact and 
the reaction allows you to see how this causal 
chain works. To linger with the impact permits  
you to see the layers , the way of processing , 
and the unfolding of it. If you allow for it and stay 
with it, t his is very different from immediately 
translating the impact into reaction.  
 
Staying with the impact allows you to develop 
wisdom and process , and to deal with it and its 
effect on you  – which is different than if you just 
have some reaction to it . But also, i n that pause , 
you might also have time to reflect on what is 
the wise response to that impact . It might allow 
you to get in touch wi th yourself in a deep way , 
and to recognize that some of the responses 
don’t come from being grounded in oneself . So, take time to get grounded , and then  ask, “How 
would I like to respond? ” 
 
If something unpleasant happens, we might get 
angry. You might think the  anger is from 
someone saying something  [snaps fingers] . You 
might think that anger is the immediate reaction. 
But as mindfulness gets stronger , and you track 
what is going on, you see that what the person 
said was first experienced as somet hing very 
unpleasant. Then you see that it was that 
unpleasantness that trigger ed an emotional 
response .  
 
You can learn to linger with the impact  – and in 
a wonderful way,  get comfortable with feeling 
how unpleasant  it is. Isn’t that great , feeling 
discom fort in this way ? You might have a 
chance to explore how you really want to 
respond . What’s the wise way to respond to 
this?  Is it wise to be angry? Perhaps it is  – in 
certain circumstances like n on-hostile anger. Is it 
wise to avoid the anger?  Or is it wi ser to come at 
this from another angle  – to deal with the 
situation in other ways than being angry ?  
 
With t he exercise of lingering with the impact,  
learning to  stick with the impact and stay with it , you can l earn to really sense and feel the impact  
thing s have on you . It could be as simple as  the 
impact of : sounds as you sit , the sun on your 
skin as you go from the shade into the sun , or 
what it’s like to breath e in meditation. What is 
the impact like to have tens e, shallow breathing 
when you first sit down?  Rather than rushing to 
the judgments or reactions about that , e.g. : “I 
should have a different kind of breath. This is 
terrible. I’m  a hopeless meditator ” – the training 
is how you are  impacted by this kind of breath.  
 
What is the impact? T he breath is shallow when 
you first sit down, and you notice that you are 
being impacted by having a particular kind of 
breath. What is that impact? You might have a 
deep pleasant breath , and think you are the best 
meditator on Birch Street. Rather than rush to 
the conclusion, hang out there, and note what 
the impact is with th at long pleasant  breath 
reverberating through the  system. Take time to 
allow yourself to feel the impact, the 
reverberation.  
 
This is a very important foundation in 
mindfulness practice for living wisely . It’s one of 
the reasons that pausing  – taking time to fee l and s avor what is going on  – can be very helpful 
as we go through our lives .  
 
It is quite remarkable all you can discover in 
your response  to this very simple question: “Is it  
pleasant or unpleasant ?” It is humbling for some 
of us to realize how much of our life is being 
triggered by reactions to the pleasantness or 
unpleasantness of the impact , rather than the 
great sophisticated nature of what we think it’s 
all about.  
 
So learn to stay  and notice the simple  feeling 
tone – is it pleasant or unpleasant ? Learn how to 
be comfortable with that . To be open and 
receptive to feeling it can give lots of insight into 
your life.  
Impact and response: two separate things.   
 
I hope that had a good impact on you.
