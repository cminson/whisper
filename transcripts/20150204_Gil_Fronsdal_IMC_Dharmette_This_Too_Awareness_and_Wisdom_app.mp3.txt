Wisdom

In practic ing mindfulness or awareness, or  practicing 
having our hearts be free, it is usef ul to make a variety 
of distinctions. O ne distinction  is between what we do , 
and how we are. Both of them have a role in our lives, 
but they are distinct. It is possible in how we are, to be 
completely open and receptive to what the present 
moment experience is. But o ur actions might say , “No.” 
Our actions might say : “Well this ne eds to be clean ;” or 
“this needs to be done ;” or “this needs to be said .” If we 
confuse those two  – if we think they are the same  – we 
prevent the ability of the heart and mind to be open and 
relaxed. If we think we have to do something, 
sometimes the awareness, the mind , becomes 
contracted, tight, or gnarly with what’s going on. It is 
possible to have the heart, the mind, the awareness , be 
open and receptive, while at the same time taking care 
of you rself, doing the things you have to do to live a 
wise life.  
 
Some people have a hard time listening to mindfulness 
instructions because they feel like they can’t take care of their lives , or can’t do the things they should to be 
doing. For example, naïve mi ndfulness instructions 
migh t be to be  completely open and accepting of what is 
in the present moment.  Maybe that’s nice when it’s a 
beautiful sunset. Maybe it’s not very nice if someone is 
yelling at you,  ready to beat you up. The idea is, that if 
we tease apart what we do and how we are , then our  
most important resource  comes to the fore. T he most 
important treasure we have is our own heart ’s – our own 
mind’s – capacity to be free, open, present, and 
uncontracted.  We become the custodian of that.  
 
The task of mindfulness is  to find a way to stay open, 
receptive, accepting, in a certain way, of our 
experience. The task of wisdom is to know what to do. 
The task of mindfulness is  to know how to be present 
for the  experience. The task of wisdom is  to know what 
to do about the exper ience. Part of wisdom is to know 
when not to do anything at all , and p art of wisdom is to 
know when to act and when to do.  
 
A lot of the training in mindfulness has to do with 
learning how to be open to  “this too.” So the mantra 
“This too” is a nice mantra for mindfulness meditators. 
This too, I have to be mindful of . This too, I’ll be present 
for. This too, I’ll open to . This too, I’ll accept.  
Sometimes, you might think , “Really? I have to accept 
this or be present for this? ” But if you want to have an 
awareness that is uncontracted, unreactive, unlimited  – not limited by the experi ence of what goes on  – then 
yes, y ou have  to have an awareness that says , “Yes, 
this too I’ll include .”  
 
If you are in a difficult social situation, and it’s very hard 
to know what to do in this social situation, does that 
have to  translate to your mind getting  contracted?  Does 
that have to translate to,  “I’m not g oing to pay attention 
to that ; I’m going to resist that , hold back from my 
awareness, put on blinders ”? If you do that, then you’re 
not ver y free. But you could respond with, “ This too, this 
is uncomfortable . I don’ t know what to do. But this too, I 
have to include in my awareness ”.  
 
When you sit to meditate, you might end up with knee 
pain. You are sitting th ere. Your knee hurts a little bit. 
It’s not what you had in mind for your meditation. You 
thought you were going to get to the third samādhi , or 
some really important  thing was supposed to happen 
with your meditation practice. But if you want to learn 
how to be mindful, you have to learn,  “This too, I have to 
include : the knee pain .”  
 
Or if there is lot of noise around you in the meditation 
hall: “This too, I have to include .” You might think, “ My 
meditation is so precious, and my ability to sit and be 
quiet and present and accepting and open to everything 
is so important , that t hose people better be quiet. Tho se 
people are interfering with my ability to accept everything because they’re talking .” It’s kind of silly, 
right? The  idea is,  “This too, I have  to accept .” 
 
Then you have your wisd om to decide what to do. This 
is a very important disti nction to make. So you can start  
safeguard ing, working on , and cultivating the ability  to 
be more  present and available to the experience you 
are having. I think it ’s a way of touching into, preserving, 
highlightin g, discovering your own beauty and the 
preciousness in your own heart.  
 
In addition, it’s also a gift to the world. It’s a great gift to 
have a presence where – this too  – you have the ability 
to stay present for . This too, you are willing to hold in 
your heart . This too, you can be with , rather than turning 
away from someone , or arguing quickly with them, or 
wanting to defend yourself, or thinking “not this ,” or “this 
person is h aving too hard a time f or me  – I can’t be with 
this person t oday ,” or “this person is angry  – I can’t be 
with this angr y person .” Instead, c ultivate and  learn the 
capacity to include  “this too .” This too, I’ll in clude in my 
awareness . This too is a great gift . They can be held in 
your field of awareness , your presence, your attention, 
in a certain kind of acceptance. T hen your wisdom will 
hopefully tell you what you actually should do in that 
situation.  
 
Do you tell them , “You’re so angry right now,  it’s hard 
for me to  stay with you . I care about you ; I’m here with you; my heart is open to you. But this is too challenging 
for me , so, I need to go take a break ”? That may  be th e 
wisdom side. Or you could say , “I’m here with you , and 
I’ll sit here  with you . I don’t know what’s supposed to 
happen. I don’t know how to help you , but I’m here with 
you.” I have known people who have felt profoundly 
helped, not because we helped them, but because of 
our willingness to stay present with them and open to 
them.  
 
So, th is little mantra – “This too, I’ll be present for ” – is a 
great thing to experiment with , and see , “This too, I’ll 
open to ; this too, I’ll offer myself to .”  
 
It’s one of the primary skills  we try to teach to people 
learning Buddhist chaplaincy. When you see people in 
the hospital, for example, they may be dealing  with 
tremendous emergencies  and crises in their lives , or 
facing death . The chaplain’s purpose is not to go in and 
fix things, or to offer advice, or tell them what to do, or 
counsel them in some way. Rather,  the first and 
foremost thing is to have the capacity to be with  
someone who is going through a crisis – and this too, 
you’re willing to hold in your awareness or heart – this 
too – and you pull up a chair to be there with them.  
 
It’s a real gift to people. It is the gift of letting them be 
themselves , and helping them make space for who they 
are, so something can begin to shift and happen within them –this too . I’ve had people angry with me , and in 
my mind – “this too ” – I’ll be present for now. It’s not 
easy , but this is my practice. I’ll be here. I’m not going to 
defend myself. I’m not going to turn the blame around. 
I’m not going to run away. I’m not going to  shut down. I 
don’t know what to do here , but at least I can be present 
and listen. I’ve seen people change when they finally  
realize , “Gil’s just going to listen to me. He’s going to be 
there for it .” I know  one person who said to me that they 
had never h ad anyone in their life who didn’t run away 
from them when they were angry. That is quite 
something. I didn’t run away ; I wasn’t troubled by it ; I 
offered my presence ; I listened and was there  – with 
this  capacity : “This too, I’ll open to ; this too, I’ll include .”  
 
Sometimes your inner  voice is more like : “This too? You 
gotta be kidding! ” This too . The idea is for your heart’s 
sake, yes. For your mind’s sake, for your wisdom’s 
sake, you might say no. Absolutely. The idea is,  “Can 
your hea rt be big en ough to hold it all? ”  Some people 
like the language of the heart. It me ans that you  can 
receive  what is happening – in the field of awareness  – 
without getting contracted, without resistance, without 
closing down, without pushing away. The awareness 
can hold it all.  
 
What you do with your wisdom – what you do with your 
body and your voice  – that’s a whole other story.  But 
your awareness can stay open.   
Make some sense? This too, we’ll includ e. And if it 
didn’t make sense,  this too, we’ll include  [laughter ].
