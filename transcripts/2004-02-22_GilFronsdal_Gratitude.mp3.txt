 Good morning everyone and welcome. The inspiration for today was to celebrate our two years here in Redwood City in this building and I feel quite amazed by what has happened here by our community, the growth of our community, the amazing people who are parts of our community and I could never have imagined 10, 12, 14 years ago that we would grow to what we've become here in the peninsula and so it feels like a nice time to just remember what we've become and celebrate it, enjoy it, be thankful for it. On Friday I was at the Zen hospice in San Francisco and one of the person who's the volunteer coordinator, they're one of the people who runs the Zen hospice, explained to me that they had two patients at Zen hospice right now at the Page Street site and she talked about one of them who had appeared, who showed up two weeks ago and she did it in the context of talking about how the idea of spiritual care at the Zen hospice had evolved over time and she said the old model of like hospital care I suppose or maybe at the hospice was that of that spiritual care, not the spiritual care but care of someone, healing care, health care, taking care of someone, medical care, they had kind of operated in the model of a pie and different people had responsibility for different segments of the pie and you wouldn't cross over from one piece to another pie piece and so different people had expertise and so you'd bring in different people who knew different pies and you had enough people you'd have the full pie. The model that evolved then at Zen hospice was from that to the idea of a circle with a patient in the middle and that everybody who was around the circle focusing on the patient was you know flowing around the circle, moving around the circle, picking up responsibilities in the circle as it was needed so it was much more fluid among the caregivers and then how it evolved at Zen hospice was eventually was they kept the idea of a circle as a model of what they're doing there but they they bumped the patient out of the center. She didn't use that language. I think she had a much better way of expressing it but they moved the patient from the center to become part of the circle and so no longer so it wasn't always only focusing on the patient but everybody was in it together including the patient. The patient was responsible for the care as much as anybody else and everybody was working together as a team without the kind of self-centeredness of just or the centeredness of kind of only on the patient and so she talked about this patient who came two weeks ago who came to die and that's usually what you do when you come to hospice and he showed up with a 12-foot moving van and six friends and started to unload the moving van and fill up this room at the hospice and now it could be quite you know understandable that someone wants someone's going to die they'd like to have some of the things that are dear to them around them some of the things that used to bring them comfort but I walked by his room the door was open and it was rather packed and and he asked them for so and then he got there and he had all these ideas of you know that kind of like they were supposed to take care of him as in hospice and he was like the center of the circle and he started asking for things well can I put my things out in the hallway I need more space and and I need to have my you know room painted or I need to get you know my meals at certain time and you know you know you know expecting everyone to kind of everything to focus around him and and in the two weeks that he's been there the person who's telling me this said it was quite remarkable that he began to shift from the center to being more part of the circle with everybody else and he wasn't he was well enough so that he could offer he offered to kind of start helping a little bit at the hospice with some of the activities they were doing there he started to ask about how he could maybe get some boxes because he didn't need all the stuff and maybe move it all out and so the shift for the patient from being kind of self-centered there to them participating in being part of the circle and I think it's a beautiful idea and I think of it that way for our center here that there's no one at the center there isn't and none of us hopefully see ourselves as the center of our own practice but rather we see that our practice is integrated with other people within the community and the world in a sense and that we're all participating in the circle of practice and there are times when we get more help or care or support then we offer and there are other times when we are offering more than we get and that it's a dance it's a give and take it's a wonderful kind of moving back and forth and to only show up thinking that it's for me and myself and mine and what's in it for me I think simply doesn't work as a model for Buddhist practice I think that the way that the mind moves the heart moves towards liberation it cannot stay fixated with itself at the center only but rather has to be some fluidity and moving back and forth in and out or being in the circle and flowing around the circle offering support receiving support all of it it reminded me of a story that goes like this about a Buddhist nun who had a statue of a Buddha that was gold plated and gold kind of heads gold flakes stuck on it all over so it's quite beautiful and she spent had it for many many years she carried with her everywhere she went and she was very proud of this Buddha she had and and and then she came to a temple and where there were burning incense and she went and offered incense to her Buddha she put it there in the altar and offer incense but you didn't want the incense to be shared by the other Buddha statues they were there because it was her Buddha and it was so special so she took this towel or some kind of something funnel and just make sure all of her burning incense was funneled into her Buddha and the results the results of that is that all the smoke from that incense darkened up the nose and the face of that Buddha and it became quite ugly so be very careful again about what you what you put at the center and how you what you keep at the center and again the me myself and mine approach the Buddha gave a very important teaching nearly it's recorded in the discourse in the Buddha's final days maybe it's I didn't manage to bring it along here it is and in preparing or thinking about very coming down here today I kind of looked over some of the newsletters and letters fundraising letters various kinds of things we published over the years and sent out to people and and then I was I saw some of the stuff was on the you know quotes at the top that we'd selected and we had a community meeting in November 8th 1998 back in st. Mark's and it says our song guys in the process of an exciting challenge one that is new for our tradition developing a community-based Buddhist practice center in an urban setting we would like to gather as a community to explore our future our thoughts about the growth of our Sangha and to find out what kind of opportunities for spiritual growth Sangha members would find helpful and then at the top of that letter it has its quote from the Buddha as long as the followers of the way as long as followers of the Buddha hold hold regular and frequent assemblies they may be expected to prosper and not decline as long as they meet in harmony break up in harmony and carry on their business in harmony they can be expected to prosper and not decline so to gather together periodically many different ways and today we gather together to celebrate and we're expected to prosper if we do this and come together in harmony another letter that came out then in October of 1999 and this followed a community meeting community meeting we had in September of 1999 where we talked about the possibility of buying a church in Palo Alto that was maybe going to be available called the A and B Zion Church it hadn't been used in about 30 years or so 25 years and and looked like it hadn't been used for 50 there were balls kind of coming down and holes in the roof and it was quite a sight to see and people thought that was a little bit crazy when I suggested that we buy it but but we went ahead thinking very seriously about buying it and looking into it and we had this community meeting to see what would our community would our community be interested in this crazy idea and as we presented the various options and scenarios around buying it and looking into it and and we kind of which is kind of a kind of a thank you a kind of a brainstorming or kind of a kind of a testing the waters kind of thing to see if there was interest and to our amazement at the end of the meeting people started giving us checks we wouldn't come expecting money or we're going to ask for money and within a few weeks without even sending out a fundraising letter anything we had received $40,000 and it wasn't we weren't saying we were going to buy this because it wasn't clear that we could in the end we couldn't because it wasn't made available to us to a sigh of relief many people and we probably still be there with hammers and nails but it was a very important catalyst and for our continued growth that meeting and that possibility of buying it and I certainly was deeply deeply moved by the enthusiasm and the goodwill of people who then stepped forward without us asking to offer funds and support for for that so then a few months later we sent it send a fundraising letter out and this time this time the quote on top of the letter said this liberation is sustained by seeing clearly seeing clearly is sustained by joy serenity and concentration these are sustained by confidence confidence is sustained by association with good spiritual friends so here we see a chain of support and that's from the Buddha and then we added in the letter the following below that quote association with good spiritual friends is sustained by a place to meet a place to meet is sustained by the support of its participants and so here we were still fundraising we're still hoping to have a place and suddenly it got loud and now we have this place to meet and we've had a tremendous support from our community to have this place to meet and I think of in my life what things I've seen this what's happened here in Redwood City what's happened in the peninsula is one of the more inspiring most inspiring things I've seen and I'm certainly phenomenally grateful for the people's practice who come here all of your practice to come here and practices here one of the advantages I have over some of you is that I talked to a lot of people in our Sangha and I more probably more the more people than any one of you and I see the tremendous dedication and sincerity maturity of people here and I wish I could just kind of broadcast what I see because it's a really phenomenal thing but you can see it for yourself very clearly tangibly here physically here in the building our owning this building having this place here is part is a result of the goodwill of many many many people in a way that I think becomes clear if you understand that all the money that went to buying this building came from people making voluntary donations so I think we've had a relatively soft approach to fundraising that's been certainly my dedication to have that I hadn't haven't wanted the Dharma Dharma being offered in ways that seemed like we were charging for it or seemed like there was pressure and so the way that the kind of the funds for this has come is then been hopefully in that spirit of relaxed generosity of goodwill and people being inspired for it so one tangible expression of this wonderful maturity and goodwill and beauty of this community has been in owning this building another expression of it is have been taken care of this building it's really amazing to me that so many people have stepped forward to be volunteers and the I think it's some last time I there was a count I think there were some like 60 volunteers 70 volunteers and you know if you add up all the little all the things that people do and there probably things people do that we don't even know about because I've noticed I've come down here and found things done that I didn't even know needed to be done or I didn't know anybody had thought about of them or you know I hadn't thought about it myself and people just taking the initiative and beautiful initiative on their own and and part of the vision the spiritual vision that I've had for ourselves as a community is one as a community that was based on everybody participating in sharing and responsibility for our practice together everybody's in the circle together and so I haven't had I hadn't wanted someone to be an employee someone working here because then there's a number of problems arise one is that then that person becomes the person is supposed to do things and so easy then to kind of expect more and more of that person because that's the person getting paid and the main problem of that is that it takes the opportunity away from all of us to be volunteers to take responsibility for the very place that we're practicing in and I don't want anybody to feel like they have to be responsible but to have the opportunity to take responsibility I think is a very important avenue or channel for people to mature in their practice I don't think it's possible to mature spiritually in the Buddhist tradition without somehow feeling that our practice is connected to others and helping others involved in others if we are only we only put ourselves at the center of the circle at some point the practice gets interrupted or truncated so the vision of being kind of volunteer based community is one that really allows that circle to spin smoothly and completely and not having any gaps in it and then I'm very grateful for everybody's practice here I mean the practice is really what we're about here all the different forms and ways in which people do spiritual practice the practices of liberation the practices of being aware being present the practices of compassion of loving kindness there's a whole range of practices that people do and it's just really amazing that people want to do this there are a lot of other things people could do with their lives and now people a lot of people choose to do this and I think it's one of the most beautiful things a person can do in their lives is to practice and to practice together I was talking on Friday with Paul Haller who's the abbot at the San Francisco Zen Center and we were talking about where to die what we know where's a good place to die you know how to die there was a context for it was we were at San Hospice and and he had just he just led this meditation guided visualization on on our dying you know imagine that you had wake up you have to go to shower and you feel slumped and you go to the doctor and doctors I think we need a biopsy and biopsy comes back and you see that oh you know he has bad news you know I think it's cancer it starts chemotherapy but doesn't help and slowly you know you get sicker and sicker and there's a whole visualization you know to carry you along right up until the moment when you die it's very evocative for people and it teaches people a lot about themselves and so after doing it we had these conversations came out of it and so I was talking with Paul about it and he said that he if he had if he could choose where he was going to die he would die within a practice community in a place of people were practicing together that was the most important thing for him and the most beautiful and the most profound thing for him and to have that happening in the context of him dying was the most important thing that he could think of but to have a practice community even when we're alive or still living and death seems far away it's really really helpful I know for my own spiritual practice Buddhist practice I could not have done it if I didn't have community around me people supporting me and people practice with and I still feel that way in my own practice is very much supported by all the people who sit here and practice here and I feel encouraged I feel inspired I feel like I learn from people here in many different ways that sometimes is quite maybe a little bit humbling because I'm supposed to be the teacher here and you know I'm supposed to kind of be the model of the person who you know does it all or does it right there's head of you all of you and then I see people here who have a greater spirit of generosity than I have wow and that inspires me isn't that amazing or a greater spirit of you know all kinds of ways in which they people I feel like wow I'm really impressed by that and I feel supported encouraged and in my own practice to kind of go further and deepen myself in the context of it all I sometimes feel that you know our community our building our practice opportunities we have we have here are very simply a catalyst for people being inspired in their own self in their own hearts to engage themselves in something which at times can be quite difficult and times are quite quite easy to find out how to clarify their hearts their minds how to live by their best intentions that they can find in themselves and how they could try to help free themselves from that which gets in the way of their freedom of their best intentions gets in the way of their compassion and love and so we're a catalyst for this all this is happening and we come here and we share that work together we do that work together and I think that's really a fantastic thing we've been doing it here now for two years in Redwood City in this building and I feel in many ways very content with what we've come to what we are right now and the same time I feel this momentum that's happening that's not even for me not for me just the momentum because of growth and development and going further because that's what happens when people grow the growing is a process that deepens or goes further and further and and so you know as I'm feeling people's growth here I feel a responsibility and need for us to kind of meet people's growth or offer the next level of growth people get to a certain level and how do we offer the next how do we expand the opportunities and all that and so it's wonderful to feel this momentum it feels you know I read yesterday a little news a newsletter from the from the kind of a national Soto Zen Association newsletter and they were talking about a conference happened 30 years ago in Hawaii a kind of a Buddhist conference or no it was a conference happened happened recently this year but it was at the conference someone spoke up to introduce George Santinabe who's a professor at the University of Hawaii in Buddhist studies and he's kind of a skeptic and cynic and doesn't really like religion and he was my professors I studied with him and so I don't him well and 30 years ago he told a visiting Buddhist priest from Japan he said Buddhism is dying in America there'll be a funeral for it soon and now here I think he was mostly talking about the kind of the ethnic Japanese community it was quite strong in Hawaii 30 years ago it was for the last hundred years and it kind of was a shock to this visiting Japanese priest they hear this 30 years later they had this conference and they invite George not be to give us a little talk or at this conference or and then he was and the person introduced George Sanabe was that priest from 30 years ago and he reminded George maybe that's why they invited the conference 30 years ago you said and and look what's happened in America in 30 years so I feel this momentum of growth and development happening and even right here and we'll do our best to keep that in a healthy frame healthy direction going going well and a healthy way and but I hope all of you will participate in helping us move forward in a organic way natural way as we all mature and develop as practitioners in this wonderful light bright light in Redwood City here will shine brighter for more and more people everywhere there is a practice in Buddhism concept called Anumudana and Anumudana means something like to rejoice to be thankful to be appreciative one person translates it as jubilation and and it's a considered sometimes I think was a very innate India in ancient India was it was a very vocal and active celebratory kind of expression to do Anumudana it was sometimes done with drums and trumpets and whistling and dancing and probably you know active very loud chanting and flowers being thrown in the air and and parades and you know and and we get the sense a little bit of the Congress some protestant like flavor you know of often be passing the Buddhism in the west and and you know I was born a Lutheran so what do you expect but but there was a you know certainly a much more kind of revivalist kind of spirit sometimes you know I don't know if that's the right word but kind of much more celebratory and exciting and happy and this Anumudana was part of that and the thing about Anumudana is that it's considered very meritorious to do that it's a wonderful beautiful quality it develops the goodness it develops our merit to celebrate in the goodness in the world around us and to offer thanks and appreciation and there's a Mahayana sutra called the perfection of wisdom at 8,000 lines section wisdom literature that has a whole chapter about Anumudana and it has this visualization that it's done as part of it it says you imagine all the goodness all the merit all the beauty all the power all the force that comes from all the Buddhas all the bodhisattvas all the practitioners all the Sangha all the people around you practice imagine all the goodness that comes from their good ethics their virtue from their meditation practice from the generosity from the living kindness from their compassion from their good intentions from their endeavourings and you imagine all you know you know all these people are practicing and engaged in practice and having matured themselves all over the world and all through time and you take and you roll it up into one big baton big lump and then you rejoice in all that goodness and then you take all the merit from all that goodness and you dedicate for the liberation and enlightenment of all beings including yourself isn't that a great thing to do one of the practical ways to do it here is to imagine you know you're sitting here and you imagine all the people sitting here in this room and imagine all the different conversations and and life experiences they've had and and books they've read and practices they've done that's kind of led them to come here it's kind of like you look think back in time and you see this this these lines porking out and out and out and out and out and there's a tremendous amount of fortuitous things that have to happen for all the people in this room to have come here to today right now the right kind of influences and everything and so just in this room here there isn't just the goodness of this community this building and everything but there's also the goodness that goes back you know not just in our experiences in this lifetime but all the different goodnesses and practices back through the ages they made it possible for us to come here and the Buddhist tradition there's often that appreciation and thankfulness of the lineage of teachers that goes back because without this being teachers of teachers of teachers and teachers and teachers and all the goodness that fed into them we wouldn't be here either we wouldn't be supported and encouraged so it's really a marvelous thing and I hope I haven't overdone it with talking about how marvelous it is and wonderful and you know religious people sometimes overdo these kinds of things but that's you know maybe okay a little bit occasionally but I do in my in my I'm really expressing what's in my heart and so I really feel really amazingly grateful and inspired by what's here and and I hope that it's that way for all of you or that you find a way that each of you find a way that our community and our practice center here is a place that supports you and if you have ideas of how it can be more supportive then please let us know and we'll try to find ways of making this place more supportive place do you guys have any comments and if you want to say something thoughts ideas about the theme of today please thank you I had a little bit of mine it might be nice for some of you to talk say the some words about what this community has meant for you nice to hear yeah I I moved here from Hawaii in 1998 and I was fairly active in the positive community there and moving here from a very small community to a vast what sort of felt like a wasteland for me this was here you were here and it's amazing that you've held this space for all these years you know just by your commitment to the practice because you've had you could have taken many paths and you chose this one and for me this practice has been a refuge that I've taken dealing with my own life and it's enthrals of karmic and so to have you know the little friends place and St. Mark's and all this little space it was amazing that at least I could come here for this refuge and it's not like I've you know I went away for a while and I left coming here as consistently and during that transition this place was purchased I was in those meetings but I haven't been actively involved in this place and coming back it's just amazing to see what's happened what's transpired and I told Diane there wasn't potlucks like it's a you know the other place because it wasn't a community or the social and the thing I noticed there wasn't much socialization there that was one of the things I commented about and this now has provided that opportunity Dharma friends hikes you know all these things and for me it's just been amazing I told Diane I said I'm almost ready to come to a potluck and you know and she laughs I told her I clearly appreciated her holding space but you know sort of a little human phobic and so I brought the dish today you know it just feels to me I just want to appreciate you and all the people that you know I've known throughout the years and you're still you know coming to my recording friend over there you know just a lot of people that have really touched me I'm grateful you're all coming thank you and I took special grateful board members community members who in the late 90s really galvanized the energy with lots of skeptics it wasn't doable and kept on driving the vision to what is to me the most inspiring part of my life thank you to all of those people and all of the volunteers yes I feel like in this world so much rationalism and denominationalism that I think it's important also to just recognize the very spiritual disciplines that happen in part of this building itself Christian we built it yes it kind of comment on the skepticism that Don mentioned back in the late 90s I was president of the board a lot of people feel this crazy and we never get the money and the ultimate plan we have forgetting a place eventually dying will all our and now I hear what people thought I was very very surprised with the end of the side church I wasn't so crazy after all one of the predictions I had was that it would take us five to twenty years before we would have a building of our own and it took five I think it came around and see so many people how much of a building and how inspired that is individual people taking the time to volunteer to see all of what we are looking at and then the sound of your voice and how my ears responded to what you were saying which was full of gladness and then the last few minutes you were even smelling something and you were all good and pretty soon anticipating taste it might seem like a small thing but on the subject of the potluck part of my practice has been just for myself has been trying to eat them and it's been really nice to have a place where I know that the practice that I'm trying to move towards in terms of my eating habits is supporting here nice Hilda as we look at various properties some of us who have been involved in the business community might have taken a more aggressive hey we've got to really get in there and call the Evansons or whatever it was with these various options and you seem to hold a quiet faith and presence that is going to work out the right thing will come about and certainly a lot of the attentionality of the broader community supported that because we all wanted the right circumstance not this one or that one or whatever and I found that very inspiring some of us have talked I talked with you and other people before about perhaps having some sort of a residential community where communal living circumstance whether it's buying an apartment building together or condos in one location so that we could have more of a living together practice and I don't know what form that might take but I'd certainly like to continue putting that together continue putting the idea out there to the community and kind of just like Phil was saying in terms of a community as we get older I lived in that circumstance when I was in college and big family in the Air Force and even after graduate school and I found it to be a very supportive environment in lots of ways and it certainly fits with the Sangha practice because as we all know in a family or circumstance like that all your stuff comes up so I wanted to say how much I feel that the Sangha has not changed in this transition to buying a building that my experience with the Sangha before with your teaching with others guest teachers at various places in the Valley and Prince Center and St. Mark's this continuity between transition to owning our own building has not spoiled that we're a community where we are focuses on about the Dharma and having a practice and that's to me has been the most important thing in this whole process of having a place to work. Can you hear okay in the outside side. We can't hear the here. Ken said that he appreciated a lot how much we haven't changed that since getting the building from the time we were in Palo Alto and we met in different in Portola Valley met in different places and having the community and support and the teachings here. There's been a continuity that hasn't been spoiled by having a building and the growth we've seen. You. It becomes everyone in the world. Could you hear out there now? Thank you. Yes. I found this place. So curious. I was only here several weeks and I walked in one of these. Alan. There's a huge. China. So. There are very much. So. That means that. Here. So. Extremely. Get an earner. Like. To buy the. Selling. You. The. And I guess. I don't know. Anyway. I feel like. Also. Thank you. Did you hear out there. She said that she's returned from Burma. Being a traveling around and she came across a big temple there with a big Buddha statue. The Buddha statue had was on its way to China and fallen off a truck and they interpreted that to mean that the Buddha statue didn't want to go to China. So the local people who were quite poor brought their pool their money together and not only bought the Buddha statue from the person who's selling it but also made this beautiful temple around it. And she was impressed in Burma. That occasion also in Burma in general that so much was happening without any expression of greed. And she feels also that here our community the growth of our community in the building was also an expression. Without. That's that. That's that's an expression of generosity. That's so different than what often happens in many cultures or many places. Regreed is the operating force. So maybe we should stop and. We can have our lunch and enjoy ourselves together and talk and. And. Susan as a cow is our current president and Susan has. Started volunteering on a very small way. Kind of my first time kind of got to know her really was she started helping me editing some of the fundraising letters. And that grew very quickly her involvement until she became into became part of the board and then became president of the board. And she became president board at a time when we were going to go through the buying of this building here. And she put in a lot a lot of time. Making all this happen here in many many different levels and had the responsibility of going to title company and signing the documents for all of us. I don't know how that felt to do that. And now and she spent a lot of many many many many many hours staying in touch with people and connecting with people and supporting people and making sure the growth of our community is has been in a healthy way. And she's about to step down as the president. But as she's still president. She'll have the last word before we go. Well I first want to say how grateful I am for all the time energy that many of you bring to the center. I think our volunteers are just a very special gift to the Sonda and the fact that we can operate our center completely through volunteer efforts is very special. Like ours that is so driven by material material compensation. And I wanted you also to know that we as a community are inspiring other song that's elsewhere in the country to fund centers. We had lengthy conversations with Robert Beatty who's with the Portland in psychology community. Talking with him about how we can purchase this building sharing our founding documents with him. And I learned that in January just last month they they have purchased a permanent home for their song. And Tara Brock's community in Washington DC has been in touch with us. And so we've been supporting them in that same way. They're working very hard towards also finding a center in our nation's capital. Have a great need. So it's kind of like the blood vein that Blanche Harbin was talking about a Monday night. I don't know if that's exactly the right words that she used but this blood vein that's sort of connecting from practitioner to practitioner. You know throughout history and eventually flowing back to the Buddha. I don't know if that's the right term but it's a Zen thing. She described just this flowing and continuity. So that's very special. And I wanted to thank you all for playing a role in that. And I wanted to share also something very personal. You know three years ago or so when we started all the work with preparing and planning to purchase this building. There were some of us you know there was the board and myself and Gil and other volunteers involved in that. And some of us were just not sure that this was going to work out. I mean I didn't you know we were rooting our community from Palo Alto to Redwood City. We were taking on financial debt to buy this building. And I just didn't know if enough people would show up here or if we'd be able to take in enough funds to make our mortgage payments and our operating expenses. But through it all I just sensed in Gil a faith and a trust that it would work out. And so this really sustained me and gave me confidence to move forward. And you know the center has worked out more beautifully than I ever could have imagined. We're financially secure. We have programs here wonderful programs almost every day of the week. So in the end this whole experience kind of awakened in me a really deep faith and trust in the Dharma. So I just wanted to end by reading two short excerpts. The first one is from a book called The Way of Wisdom. Among the five spiritual faculties faith is called the sea and without it the plant of spiritual life cannot start at all. And the second one is from the millen-d'opane. Faith makes serene and it leaps forward. When faith arises it arrests the five hindrances and the heart becomes free from them. Clear, serene and undisturbed. So thank you all. There is an expression that's used as a part of Anumadana, this rejoicing and celebration. And we could all do it together and then we could go out there and have our meal together. It's a Pali word. It means something like excellent, great, great or far out or cool. And it's pronounced Sa-du and it's usually said three times Sa-du, Sa-du, Sa-du. So let's do that further. Sa-du, Sa-du, Sa-du. Thank you.
