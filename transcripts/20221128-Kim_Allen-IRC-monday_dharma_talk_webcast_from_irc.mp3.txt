 So last night Gil introduced this language of a journey and we've begun our journey together this week and each one of you and really all of us will have our own journey, very individual, but in a way we'll be having an individual expression of this journey that's about our relationship to Dukkha. Gil also said that you wouldn't be happy if we talked about Dukkha today and tomorrow and Wednesday, but I'm afraid we are going to do it for half of today. Hopefully that's okay with you. So this word Dukkha, it's significant that Buddhism begins with this idea of Dukkha. It begins by acknowledging right up front that the human condition is challenging. This word is often translated as suffering and sometimes that's appropriate. We may be facing a very difficult situation with our health or the health of someone we love or our financial or our living situation, the challenges of getting old, the grief of someone's death, and if it's not you then it might be that the person next to you is carrying something quite heavy or devastating on this retreat. But Dukkha has a wider range than what we would typically call suffering. It also encompasses the stresses of life, the challenge of balancing a lot of responsibilities, trying to keep up with work and family and our own interests. We live in a high-pressure culture and it is hard to manage sometimes and that's actually not a personal failing. It is hard to balance a human life. And Dukkha also includes something like a pervasive sense of not enough or unsatisfactoriness. Sometimes I just feel it as offness so things are not quite aligned somehow. So Dukkha has kind of an existential dimension also. The Buddha pointed to all of this as quite fundamental to human life. It affects old and young, wealthy and not, educated and not, and everything in between. Some people feel that Buddhism is actually respectful in a certain way because it says this right up front. Luckily we are going to go on to better news about how to reduce or end Dukkha, but it's good to acknowledge, you know, starting with Dukkha gives us a chance to really open to that. And then that means that also we get to see right up front what our relationship is to Dukkha. For a while there was a traveling exhibit called Body Worlds that consisted of human cadavers that had been preserved with a kind of plastic material that made them look quite lifelike, you know, but they were actually bodies. And they were displayed in various postures like playing baseball or sitting at a desk. And then they had been dissected in various ways to show certain organs and body systems. It was quite a fascinating exhibit actually. Maybe some of you even saw it. And there was a thing though that as you approach the exhibit, before you even had your ticket punched, there was one body in a display case outside, kind of as a sample. And it was clear that it was there so that people could realize what they were getting into going into the exhibit. They would get a glimpse of their initial response to seeing the cadavers. So this is important to examine how we relate to Dukkha. Another part of the human challenge is our tendency to have a less than straightforward relationship to difficulty and suffering and stress. People do all kinds of things to avoid facing the realities of the human condition. And maybe that's even skillful if we don't have any tools for dealing with that. But here on retreat and learning mindfulness and insight practice, we have lots and lots of tools. Some people go through life hoping that they're going to make it into an endless party, going from one pleasant experience to the next. And then meditation is supposed to play a role in perpetuating this sort of ongoing high. There's a story actually about some students who came to Suzuki Roshi, who was a wonderful Zen teacher of the last century. And they wanted to know how to use meditation to get a natural high. So I have an account that was written by one of them. It's from a book called Naked in the Zendo. Suzuki Roshi led us upstairs to the Zendo meditation space. He showed us the meditation platform and motioned us over to the black cushions, perfectly spaced with yellow woven tatami mats. The sight of this orderly clean space sent a wave of aesthetic appreciation through my mind. Was this how you got high? Then we received our first Zen meditation instructions. We spent what seemed like the next two hours meditating with him over the next ten minutes. This discomfort in my undisciplined mind was running away from me. Would this work? Would I get high? What was taking so long? When we finished our meditation, we turned towards Suzuki Roshi for our personal map to getting high. He knew he had our full attention. We hung on his every word. The more you come to practice, the more you practice Zen, the more you know, the more you realize. And then he concluded, the more you know that life is suffering. We were too stunned to react. Suffering? The more you practice Zen, the more you realize that life is suffering? We were so horrified that we didn't have time to react. All we could manage was getting out of the Zen Center as fast as we could. I doubt we even said thank you or goodbye. My sister and I raced back to the East Bay. We were definitely not going to discuss what had happened. But my mind kept reviewing the events. How could he seem so light and be so heavy? Was he joking? Why would anyone practice Zen if realization of suffering was increased? Suzuki Roshi had set a hook in my mind. I couldn't figure my way around the dilemma his comment created because he beamed so happily when he said it. So I want to make it clear that we don't typically say that life is suffering. Suzuki Roshi was playing up the language to wake up the person who was in the story there. So it's probably more accurate to say that there is duka. There is suffering. And this is you know, this is a statement of the first noble truth. Surely there is duka in life and we're not going to just be able to live in a dream world and avoid it. But there are other kinds of avoidance. Another typical kind of avoidance relationship that people bring to duka is overwork and overachievement. So this is for a Majan Tsuchito. It's also a little bit long which is for effect. Are you sure you're doing the right thing in your life? Maybe you're missing out on a really great opportunity somewhere else. Then these multiple options become a strain. Can you develop shamanism, play classical guitar, study ecology and cybernetics, have a successful fulfilling relationship with your partner, your parents and relatives, and your children, come to a mature understanding of the political arena, grow your own organic food, and hold down a suitable job with the right kinds of people for the right ends all at the same time. But if any of these go wrong or you miss out on a really fulfilling experience, you're likely to feel disappointed or personally to blame. So cram it in and hold on tight. Okay so I think you get the sense. There's a lot of cultural avoidance of duka. And then there are other relationships. You know we can be angry about the duka of life. Personally angry, politically angry, or we can try very hard to work out some philosophy about why people suffer. Or we could take on some religious views which might turn out not to be fully satisfying. So all of these responses to duka have a way of just perpetuating the challenges. There's a circular feeling to patterns of avoidance or anger or intellectualization or other forms of grasping or pushing away. They just go round and round. When we don't see clearly we create duka and when we're caught up in duka we further obscure our vision. And so at some point all our various machinations to manage the relationship with duka fail. It doesn't work anymore. I read an essay recently by a woman who had a leaky pipe in a wall of her house. And she noticed water seeping in on the floor in one room. And she started by moving the couch out of the way and getting some towels to sop it up. And then she got the mop to push the water back. But soon enough it was obvious that there was something bigger going on in the wall and pushing the water back was not going to be sufficient. So she canceled her plans for the day and shut off the water main and got to work opening the wall to find the issue. But being a reflective person she also noticed in this experience a metaphor about dealing with issues in her life. She says, I thought about all the times in my life that I tried to push back the water or the times I did not alter the perpetual motion of my days to address what was seeping under the baseboards. Sometimes my attempt to push back the water looked like over work or a selfless form of not taking care of myself. It has also looked like a wide variety of well-honed survival techniques and distractions. But there comes a time when there is little left to do but open up the wall and start working on the real problem. So here we are on retreat. And sometimes you know sometimes we know explicitly that our various strategies are no longer working. We run into a health problem that's very real and we have to just have to deal with it somehow. Or we just can't go on with our work the way it is or a relationship ends. Many people come to the Dharma with a specific challenge and a sense that what they're doing is so far is not working. Or sometimes we don't quite know explicitly what's going on. Maybe there's a sense of tiredness or unease, a vague longing. Maybe we even frame it in a generally positive sense like stress reduction or finding support in a community. But underneath those wishes there's typically some kind of difficulty or struggle or insecurity. Fortunately it is possible to have a healthier relationship with Dukkha. Even right from the beginning, even right from the get-go. And that begins to happen when we touch into what it is in us that seeks the end of Dukkha. It's something in our heart whether or not we quite articulate it that way. Our heart knows the feeling of Dukkha whether it's suffering or stress or dissatisfaction and it senses that there are other possibilities. The sequence that Gil named last night is called Liberative Dependent Arising and in it a Dukkha conditions what is called Sada. We'll talk about that more in a moment. And then it goes on to gladness, joy, tranquility, happiness, samadhi and seeing clearly. And this is a healthy and onward leading response. And so we'll spend some time now unpacking what this Pali word Sada means. But first let's just note that moving from Dukkha to Sada is a huge difference from meeting Dukkha with anger or avoidance or fear or grasping. It sets in motion an entirely different unfolding. We're starting to address the water leak instead of continuing to get flooded. So this word Sada, there is not a single word English translation for this quality. So I want to talk about it in terms of a wide range. Almost a world that we can enter from many different points and a world that changes as we get to know it in our own practice. So I encourage you to listen to these different aspects with an ear of hearing what resonates for you. So the range of ways that we could talk about Sada includes words like trust, confidence, faith, conviction or even openness. What it does not include is blind belief or throwing ourselves at something without consideration. And it doesn't include not questioning. So it's a kind of a healthy form of faith or trust. So when we're talking about how to meet suffering, often the first glimmer of a healthy relationship is the thought there must be a better way. This is a very simple form of Sada, simple willingness to open to something different that isn't known yet. The first residential retreat that I went on was 10 days long and what I told people was that I just wanted to see what would happen if I meditated for that long. But inside I knew I had a lot of Dukkha. And in retrospect I would say that it was Sada that drew me to go on retreat. This sort of underlying idea that there must be a better way somehow. So we could also translate Sada as faith or trust like the way we took refuge last night in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. And in the suttas we have some specific phrasing that goes like this. A noble disciple places faith in the awakening of the tathagata. That means the Buddha. The tathagata is the Buddha. So the wording is important there. We have some trust, some inner sense that yes a human being can awaken. We have this faith in the awakening of the Buddha. And if we're not maybe not quite ready for our own faith we can have what's called borrowed faith from a teacher or from teachings. It can be very down to earth. The first time I went to a local Sangha to sit with a group I noticed that the experienced practitioners seemed to be very comfortable with themselves. That was what stood out for me because at the time I was really not comfortable at all with myself. And my mind said something like, I want what they've got. I don't know exactly what it is but I want that. And so that's you know that's a basic kind of inspiration or faith. And this kind of faith has the property that it can generate energy for our practice as well as gladness. And we'll get to the gladness and the joy tomorrow. But another aspect of faith is that it leads to a healthy form of energy or application of ourselves to whatever it is that we have confidence in. So we can feel this kind of uplift, this uplift of sada in the form of faith. And then another dimension is confidence. We could call it maybe more like confidence. And this begins inside of us when we see our practice starting to work, even in very simple ways. You know we can start to have it quite soon into practice. And over time what this does is that it generates momentum that can carry us through various rough spots. And when we have some momentum then our confidence can return even if it gets temporarily shaken in some way. I recently watched a new film that was made about the founding of the Insight Meditation Society. It's not widely available yet but I think it will be eventually. And IMS is the mother institution let's say of insight practice in the West. I think it's fair. I think it's fair to call it that. So we have several long-standing institutions now but IMS was the first one that was aimed at training laypeople in the practices that the founding teachers learned in Asia. And it was formed in the late 1970s. The founders are Joseph Goldstein, Jack Kornfield, Sharon Salzburg, and also Jacqueline Mandel. And what's what's striking about the film is how much trust and faith and confidence were needed to create IMS and the insight retreat form which is what we're doing here when there was nothing like that in the US before. So these were young people in their 20s, essentially hippies who had gone to Asia for a while and practiced and gained something there. And they wanted to come back and share it but they were you know they were buying a Catholic novitiary for a lot more money than they had really dealt with before. It was for sale for more money than they had really thought about when they were backpacking across Asia. And as they were pondering hmm should we buy this? They went into the town square in Barrie, Massachusetts which is where IMS is. And they noticed a statue of some revolutionary war hero that had the town motto on it and the town motto of Barrie is tranquil and alert. So they thought perfect this is a this is the place to put a meditation center. Let's go for it. So that was that was how they decided to buy that particular building. They had looked at a bunch of them and then once they had the building and they were learning to operate it and keep it going they found that it had three massive oil tanks in the basement about 60 feet long and apparently they had been the room that they were in had been built around them so there was no way to remove them from the room. And when they tested them only one out of the three was working. So the poor facilities guy was a little worried about this and he thought what are we going to do with what if this one goes also. But Joseph simply asked him well is it working now and he said yes and Joseph said not to worry there will be a way don't worry about it it's working now. So you know repeatedly in this in this film people referred to Joseph's faith and confidence in slowly growing IMS and to him it was just doing the next thing doing the next thing and somehow it all worked out you know this kind of sincere confidence is often behind institutions that actually endure over decades or longer and I would suggest we can see some similar things in the evolution of IMC and IRC also. So there's a way that honest openness to the Dharma connects us into some larger flow. I've heard Gil call this hidden pathways in pathways and sometimes the approach of simply having confidence is a way to meet the uncertainties that we encounter in practice and whether on the cushion or in daily life. Maybe it's not even that we have confidence or trust in some thing but we just have trust. It does have to be done though with sincerity and humility we can't really rely on this from a kind of cognitive perspective or from a place of demand or expectation and we might not get the exact solution that we're imagining but I would suggest that if we meet things with confidence there will be some kind of beneficial shift in the Dharma. So one way that we can bring this into retreat practice is to commit to just sticking with the practice. Just sticking with the practice and then later on as practice evolves we come to have what is called verified faith and that's a that's a different Pali term of Vetcha Pasada but that's kind of a transformation of Sada into something deeper so this quality itself evolves over time it can shift and change as we keep practicing. I once heard a Tibetan teacher translate faith as the willingness to experience anything in awareness. So we can see that this quality maybe goes quite a bit beyond the idea of faith as we might understand it in English. So I often use the word faith for Sada and I hope from this explanation you get the sense that it's it has all these different facets. And maybe all of these facets come together in some way in a phrase that captures the linguistic roots of the word Sada we could say that it means to place the heart upon to place the heart upon. So where do you place your heart? So now I'd like to continue exploring Sada in a more classical division of it into three components that relate to how it actually works in our mind and our heart. There are three aspects of Sada that you might notice as you're as you're touching into it in yourself. So one of them is actually cognitive. Are you surprised? There is kind of a mental understanding behind what the Buddha called Sada. Part of trusting something is that it makes sense at some level. So this cognitive side for example includes giving weight to the word of people that we respect. So maybe the Dalai Lama for example if we have some respect for him then when he you know when he offers teachings or he said something gives advice we would put some weight on that in our mind. And also this cognitive side includes being willing to provisionally believe things that we don't experientially know yet based on having some kind of prior limited knowledge. So for example I have not been able to personally verify everything that the Buddha talks about in the suttas but what I have been able to experience works pretty well and is in line with the teachings. So I have some willingness to accept the things that I haven't verified that those might also be true. Just makes sense to me. So in terms of responding well to Dukkha, using this cognitive aspect we might decide that even though we would really like to have a long session of planning our revenge toward someone who we find difficult we will instead try to be mindful of what ill will feels like because that's what the instructions are for this week. So based on the cognitive side of Sathā we bring some intelligence to our practice and I don't I don't mean a lot of thinking but intelligence in the sense of some consciousness, some investigation, some experimentation with the instructions. And then the the second aspect of faith is devotional or emotional you know that heart feeling of having resonance with something. It can be quite embodied you know maybe an energetic feeling in the body. It's not cognitive and it it doesn't have to make sense in the way that modern Western culture tends to demand that things make sense. So the devotional or emotional side includes feelings of reverence. It includes maybe a sense of a heartfelt connection to something larger than ourselves. It can also have an intuitive side like an intuitive sense that practice is benefiting us in some way. So this devotional aspect has has to do with how something makes us feel. I practiced at a retreat center in Sri Lanka that was next door to a monastery and every day the monks would go by on their alms around walking neatly and mindfully in a row and it was really beautiful the way you know every morning when they were coming by at the same time the Sri Lankan lay retreatants men and women were they were so happy to see the monastics go by. They would kind of line up on this little ledge that overlooked the street where the monks were going by and you could just sense their uplift that just came from seeing the monastics. It was sort of contagious for me to to watch that since we don't have quite as much of that so explicitly in our culture. I really appreciated that there was I found it a great support from my practice at that retreat center. So this emotional side often comes forth in moments of happiness of course but it can also support relating well to Dukkha. There's a way that we can feel a sense of refuge in awareness of Dukkha so we can have the sense yes this is hurting or this is difficult in a certain way but I'm so glad I'm seeing it. I feel the wholesomeness of the practice in meeting what's challenging and this can actually lead onward to to joy even amid Dukkha. I remember a time when I was practicing on retreat and I had something coming up that was you know some memories or some difficult memories I think and I was I was just meeting them kind of moment to moment it was a fairly long retreat and I was relatively mindful at that time and I didn't expect it at all it was maybe it stuck in my mind because it was such a surprise that this wave of joy came up while I while I was feeling this painful emotion it didn't change the emotion exactly but I realized that joy could coexist with a difficult experience simply through being mindful and having this devotion to the practice. It's quite momentous actually to realize that there can be joy in the middle of Dukkha. So the the third aspect of Sata is motivational and so this is an inspiration that can lead to action. Sata can be a verb remember that one of the phrases for it is to place the heart upon so there's some active component to Sata. When I first went on a three-month retreat it was something of a leap of faith. I'm going to sit for how long? 84 nights but something in my heart knew you know yes this is it I'm going to go and do this. So this this motivational aspect of faith or trust can get us onto a retreat. It can get us up early in the morning, can remind us to keep going to keep trying and not in a you know not in a grim or resigned way but in a genuine and sincere way. This aspect you know brings to mind the quality of sincere effort. In my own practice I've found that these three dimensions the cognitive, the devotional, and the motivational really can't be completely separated. They're just different aspects of how the quality of Sata can operate in the mind and in the heart. So I hope by offering this broad range that everyone can find themselves within this world of Sata. So maybe reflecting now for a moment of you know what feels meaningful. Is there an image, a feeling, an understanding that pulls at your heart and sits at the foundation of your current practice? And if that doesn't feel so clear that's fine also. Perhaps there's just a simple willingness to see what unfolds from this week together. So there's a story from the suttas of a monk named Baddiya who was some kind of royalty, perhaps a king when he was a lay person. But then he became a monk and he was meditating under a tree and he was exclaiming, what bliss, what bliss. And the other monks assumed that he was fantasizing about his former wealthy life and you know he must be imagining that. And so they went and told the Buddha what they had seen. And the Buddha called Baddiya and asked him, have you been exclaiming during meditation what bliss, what bliss. And Baddiya said, yes, yes I have. And so then he was asked why and he explained that in his lay life as a ruler he had lived with a lot of guards. He said my guard was well organized within and without the royal compound, within and without the city, within and without the country. And although I was guarded and defended in this way, I remained fearful, scared, suspicious and nervous. So in other words he was meeting the dukkha of human life with fear and building up defenses and all that just generated more fear. He didn't feel any safer. So then he goes on and he says, the monk goes on and says, but these days even when alone in the wilderness at the foot of a tree or in an empty dwelling, I'm not fearful, scared, suspicious or nervous. I live relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, my heart free as a wild deer. So instead of closing, he went the opposite direction and he opened up. So he now lives with faith out in the open as a monk doing the practice that his heart loves. And he doesn't, he got rid of all of his guards and he's standing there open, openly and he isn't fearful. And so then he says, it is for this reason that I frequently explain what bliss, what bliss. So we move from having an unskillful relationship with our challenges to having some form of satah, some kind of faith or trust or confidence. And this starts a process that goes in a whole different direction. So may your practice begin to open by trusting in this quality of satah. So let's sit together for a few minutes. Thank you.
