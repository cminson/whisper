Practice Note: In the Body

One of the advantages of meditating when it’s hot, is 
that it puts you in to your body – you are much more 
likely to feel connected to your body , and your body 
sensations are somehow more connecting. You can 
fight that and complain about it , or you can relax into it. 
Relaxing into it can help, and s ometi mes in the present 
moment, you feel much more grounded or connected  to 
your body.   
 
Being in you r body is really helpful for this practice. It’s 
strongly encouraged that you try to come back to your 
body, to be in your body, and to feel yourself grounded 
in your body. When you’re walking, feel it in your feet , 
and feel connected to the ground.  When y ou’re sitting , 
whether in a chair  or on the floor, try to  feel like you 
have a low center  of gravity. Really feel the weight and 
the contact , because the more you’re grounded or 
connected  to your body, the easier it is to let your mind 
do nothing.  To say it in a differen t way: when you’re in 
your body, it’s easier to let go of your involvement with 
all your mental interests.  
 Some of you have a lot of interests  that you don’t even 
know about [laughs]. It’s not wrong to have the mind 
thinking and wondering about things , but the idea is to 
step out of that so that our interest, our involvement, or 
our attention, isn’t feeding into those thoughts and 
ideas. In a sense , we let the inner landsca pe of thinking 
come to a stop, which is certainly easier s aid than done . 
You have  some sense of being centered  within, where 
there’s a feeling of not doing, even though there might 
be all kinds of feelings and thoughts swirling around.  
 
The body is a great help to come to that inner place 
where you’re just here , and not doing anything. Then 
with the ‘here’ – this centered  place  – a lot of things can 
just fall off, relax, fall away, unwind, or not be as 
bothersome as they might  be.  
 
I hope you ha ve a nice morning of practice.  Thank you.
