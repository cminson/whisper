The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So it's nice to be here and see all of you. Is the sound okay? You hear the okay?
Great. So I'll start this morning with a proposal and it's something that can be
verified with mindfulness and that is that the human mind has a lot of
desires. So what I'm calling desire here is quite broad. Let's say that it refers
to any kind of wanting, whether gross or subtle. So you know we have a desire for
food when we're hungry. We have desire if we're hoping to get home in time to get
to an important zoom meeting or I had the desire to drive to Redwood City this
morning at some level. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have gotten here and
sometimes desire comes in the form of not wanting something, right? Maybe we
want the neighbor's dog to stop barking or also this morning while I was
driving here there was a squirrel crossing the lane in front of me. There
were no other cars coming but halfway across the road it changed its mind and
came back and so I slowed way down. It wasn't clear which way it was going to
go and I definitely I felt my mind narrowing which it does through desire
but I didn't want to hurt the squirrel. I had a strong desire not to hit the
squirrel with my car and luckily it headed back into the grass. So you know
there's a lot of desires and then there can be more subtle desires like while
we're while we're sitting often it's hard to sit in the same position for a
long time. We actually will subtly shift our weight even when we're meditating
sometimes but also on the computer and that's just because you know there's a
desire to move or shift the body isn't meant to be in the same position for a
long time or we can sit in meditation and subtly be holding on to a state of
calm for example we want that to continue now that we've got it. So there's a
lot. So let me ask a question then. How many of you would agree if I say that the
second noble truth of the cause of suffering says that the cause of
suffering is desire? Yeah and that's often what we hear I see some hands not
not all the hands. So you know there's a lot of wanting in the mind and what's
going on with that and so another proposal that can also be checked is
that at some level we tend to think that fulfilling our desires is going to
bring happiness or at least it's going to make things better than it is now. So
we fulfill desire after desire to try to get things that we like or get things
that feel pleasant so that we can sustain a sense of some kind of happiness or
ease or safety or well-being whatever word we use for it. So it's actually not
such a ridiculous idea to want those things in our life but it may not be
complete you know to have the idea that we need to keep wanting things and
getting them in order to be safe or happy or have well-being and if we
practice mindfulness we will start to see more of the picture. So if we keep
looking with mindfulness there's a couple things we might see there's a lot
of things we might see but I'll just highlight a couple of them. One of them
is that it is not entirely the case that we can become happy by fulfilling
desires. How many would agree with that? Yeah so nearly all the hands went up for
that one so you know it's it's tiring to constantly be going from thing to thing
to thing and we have to keep at it right because each one lasts for a while but
not forever so there's always and then there's always one more thing coming one
more refinement one more next thing that we want and all of this is not entirely
in our control is it? You know at some level we understand that the things that
we want we don't have complete ability to get. Some things it's easy sort of it's
pretty likely you can take your next breath but not always right but that's
pretty likely that one's pretty likely but other things that we try to get that
we have to buy or that we have to go and acquire or get from somebody else there's
a whole other set of conditions out there that are not in our control about
whether we can get that right if we start looking more clearly so we may not
be able to get what we want or get rid of what we don't want. How about that? What
does the mind do with that? So our quest to find happiness by fulfilling desires
gets more and more suspect as we practice mindfulness and then maybe the
second thing that we would realize is that not all desires are actually
harmful for us not completely. I deliberately painted a little bit of a
complex picture at the beginning with all the things that I pointed toward so
some desires might be useful on the spiritual path maybe right and some of
the very real happiness that we get from fulfilling desires because there is a
kind of happiness we get from that some of that might be good for us you know
how about the piece that you get from coming to IMC or watching on YouTube you
know that seems useful doesn't it settle the heart and mind better than doing
something else with this hour hour and a half so we're gonna have to look more
carefully at these issues of desire and wanting so I'll just say clearly so
it's so it's stated are all desires bad no no but we have to have a lot of
wisdom about that so you know the Buddha was actually quite nuanced in his
teachings on desire he taught in different ways at different times he
taught different people differently knowing where they were on the spiritual
path but basically he noticed I think he was brilliant that he noticed that
there is in the mind a tendency to move toward things also a tendency to move
away which is related you know we're here and we want to move toward there
let's broadly call that desire and so he thought well you know people have this
tendency of wanting to move toward in a way which is to some degree a quality of
the unawakened mind but we have it so why not use it why not use it on the
path to move toward things that are actually helpful so I want to talk about
this desire that we have this movement toward I like to say that there's a
broad range of desire or a diversity of desire kind of like a spectrum of
desire but it's not really linear it's not really a linear sequence it's more
like a space so I'm going to frame it today as five aspects of desire or five
classes of desire this is not a canonical list from the Buddha but all of
them are talked about in the teachings and I've just kind of gathered them
together you can see if it's I hope it's a useful way of classifying things so as
we get in touch with these I'm going to talk about each one you might just sense
for yourself oh okay is that present in me how does that operate in my life how
does that resonate for me so the first kind of desire clearly in the unwholesome
part of the space is the one that's called a tanha that's the Pali word
tanha and it literally means thirst but it's usually translated as craving this
is a kind of grasping kind of desire that is obviously painful obviously harmful
you know it it's a gripping essentially it relates to lust or greed or kind of
extreme wanting that we have and you know we've we've probably we've all
experienced this actually and when this kind of craving is about the world of
the senses which it often is we call it comma comma tanha which means its
desire for sensual things sense desire or sense pleasure like the Kamasutra
you may have heard of very much about sensuality and so kamatan has strong
grasping of sensual objects it's not really about the object itself it's in
the mind you know so we might have strong grasping at ice cream at a certain
time and not at another time right it's not about the ice cream it's about how
much me we want it at a given time or we might be caught up in how we look you
know our clothing our hairdo or various sexual fantasies and desires a particular
form of this kind of desire is addiction to alcohol or drugs so tanha generally
causes trouble for us and it's a clearly a troublesome one it can also really
relate to things that aren't sensual I emphasize that one but there are other
things we can have lust for power or for having a certain identity being a
scene in a certain way that can also be the realm of tanha so it's obvious that
these kind of desires don't support the path to liberation right they are
themselves binding for the mind and then maybe a second class of desire is
basic desires that are related to bodily needs we all have these two need to
eat the need to drink the need to use the bathroom so these desires are not
usually seen as inherently harmful but they are somewhat stressful aren't they
how we relate to the desires and needs of the body influences how happy or
unhappy we are even awakened people still feel physical hunger and they still
have the need to pee that still happens there's one Sutta that says that even
arahants who are fully awakened beings feel sensations that are according to
the Sutta dependent on the body and conditioned by life so there you go you
don't you're not going to overcome those basic things even the Buddha had back
pain you know they're not all pleasant these things related to the body but
there is some distinction between beings regarding whether or not these bodily
desires bring any dukkha any suffering then there's a third class of desire
very big one that's related to the desires that it takes to fulfill a human
life you know trying to live a typical human life among other humans we have
desires that go with that the desire to find a livelihood maybe the desire to
have a partner the desire to be part of a community to secure a place to live and
have access to food that we like all of these desires this is the world many of
us live in from day to day these desires take a lot of energy a lot of our
attention and effort and their myriad I can't even name them all I just named a
few relationships politics family life all these worldly desires Gil sometimes
says that we should call ourselves instead of human beings we should be
called human desire links which I think is that's always struck me I've heard
that from him years and years ago and it's stuck with me so these kinds of
desires are very interesting for the spiritual path because they're the ones
that we tend to defend as normal and even necessary you know if I didn't have
those desires what would I do I just sit on the couch all day I'd be a you know
I'd be a couch potato I wouldn't do anything I couldn't accomplish things I
couldn't help people I couldn't serve my family so we tend to mark these desires
off as off limits this is necessary we don't even you know how can we even
question those the Buddha asked us to put a few question marks on those as to
whether or not we have to pursue them with any kind of grasping so it's a big
realm for Dharma practice because this realm of desires occupies much of our
day these are the ones that we go from one to one to one throughout our day
right so many of them are mild forms of what I called comma before the world of
sense desires and sensual pleasures not all of them are tanha that grasping kind
of desire but they're comma this this world of the senses and we don't have
to have deep pathological grasping in order to be somewhat enslaved to our
desires and the Buddha asked us to question that enslavement and see if we
could find other ways to live our life such that it doesn't have that
inherent stress associated with all those things so then continuing with the
five classes of desire with a fourth one I would call our more elevated human
wishes there are various words for this wholesome skillful refined elevated
spiritual choose the word that works for you but these include wishing to be
ethical wishing to be kind wanting a peaceful and happy life where we are
able to care more about how we're living than about money or status wanting to
learn to meditate wanting to learn the spiritual teachings desire for the
well-being of others these are nice desires these are generally very good
desires these are the kind of wishes that can serve our spiritual development
if we engage with them right so the these are the ones where the Buddha used
our let's call them elevated desires as part of the path he encouraged us to do
these kinds of skillful wishes in order to uplift us or draw us along the path
so when we allow these wishes to be felt in our heart they encourage us towards
skillful and wholesome action and the happiness that comes from fulfilling
these kinds of desires this fourth class are nourishing they bring a nourishing
kind of happiness to us so these are the wishes that can support confidence ease
brightness a certain kind of refined joy not a bubbly kind of joy more
associated with the sense world but a tranquil kind of joy and that's the kind
of pleasure that the Buddha approved of this is from this is actually repeated
in several suttas this is called the bliss of renunciation the bliss of
seclusion the bliss of peace the bliss of enlightenment I say this kind of I
say of this kind of pleasure that it should be pursued that it should be
developed that it should be cultivated and that it should not be feared how
about that the Buddha says there are kinds of pleasure that should be
pursued so there's also the famous story of the Buddha realizing that all of
the efforts he had done up to now this is the bodhisattva before he was the
Buddha realizing that everything he'd done hadn't brought awakening yet and he
was frustrated all of his ascetic practices all of his practices of the
formless jhanas and then he thought back to a time in his childhood where he
entered meditative absorption as a child sitting under a tree peacefully and how
easeful and joyful that felt and he recognized that that was the way forward
that was the path this kind of meditative pleasure that he had first
felt somewhat spontaneously he then cultivated that under the Bodhi tree and
was able to awaken so these kinds of pleasures and happinesses are part of
the path it's important to note that even though that quote I read included the
bliss of enlightenment these are not the goal actually so this kind of
meditative pleasure that we get that comes kind of as a fruit or a byproduct
of calming the mind and calming the body and having bright awareness that is not
actually freedom yet there can still be some delusion in there such as a sense
of self or pride but if we keep up with the mindfulness practice that will be
those kind of side points will be seen and addressed at some point and this
this happiness this meditative happiness will allow us to awaken so that's the
fifth class of desire which I think is worth separating out is specifically the
aspiration to awaken to be free to be liberated that can take various forms you
know what kind of wanting is that so it's wanting to know to discover to
investigate to see to touch into to realize to release these kinds of
wishes often these desires and aspirations feel very beautiful very
clean very wholesome a little bit distinct from that fourth class where we
want to be ethical we want to be kind etc sometimes at certain points on the
path this fifth kind of desire to awaken can get very strong and then it's
called some Vega or some Vega which is often translated as spiritual urgency
and maybe you felt that one also for some people there's a resonance with the
Western idea of a calling a calling to practice a deep sense of wishing to be
free sometimes it can be a little bit unpleasant even so these desires feel
beautiful and clean and wholesome and then there can also be get me out and
that's part of the process to sometimes this wishing to be free can come
really straight from the heart so we have these five we have tanha grasping
kind of desire we have basic desires related to fulfilling bodily needs we
have the desires at a company living a human life among other humans we have
our more spiritual wishes for kindness for ethics for meditative
development and then we specifically have the aspiration to be liberated so
they're not quite a linear spectrum I hope you see they kind of define a space
but nonetheless there is a clear division between unwholesome and wholesome
right between unskillful and skillful some of them are blatantly painful you
know and those are the ones that we can feel that contraction other ones we tend
to make a trade-off you know we say I want this and the benefits of it are
going to be better than the detriment so I'm going for it you know like when
we're working a certain job that has some stress associated with it but we
need the income so we make these trade-offs in the kind of the middle realm
and then you know there's some of them that are really quite beautiful and we
can fulfill those as much as we want clearly helpful and it will support us
on our path so I want to delve now a little bit into that realm that I called
the skillful desire because it's not talked about as much as in that way so I
hope you're seeing at this point that you know there's a lot of different
kinds and we're gonna need to be careful about you know which one which side
we're on we'll talk about that so what about these skillful desires these
wishes that can support the path so in that scheme of five they were the fourth
and the fifth but actually I'm gonna take a step back into that third realm
and say that it's important to realize that in order to support our more
elevated spiritual refined kind of desires we have to do some work in the
realm of the third kind of desire the everyday wants and needs of creating a
human life we have to do some preparatory work in the realm of our life in
order to bolster our ability to fully develop these more refined kinds of
desire so in other words we have to set ourselves up we have to set up our life
everybody in this room and on YouTube you have set up yourself such that you
could be here this morning that's not bad that's already an accomplishment a lot
of people haven't done that so we can work in the very ordinary realm of the
sensual world the stuff of our life in order to create conditions that we'll
be able to move forward on the path with the more refined kinds of happiness so
there's a couple things I want to say about that first of all we need to
simplify we need to simplify our life in certain ways in order to support
practice so this is aligning with our our lifestyle with that and I want to
read some lines actually from the metasuta from the suit that's Buddha's
discourse on on meta on loving kindness or goodwill that are they're right at
the beginning and they point toward a way of being that has an air of simplicity
to it that I find quite touching a way of being that's kind of straightforward
and uncomplicated so this is from the Amaravati translation of that suta some
of you may recognize it because it's done in a chant this is what should be
done by one who is skilled in goodness and who knows the path of peace let
them be able and upright straightforward and gentle in speech humble and not
conceited contented and easily satisfied unburdened with duties and frugal in
their ways peaceful and calm and wise and skillful not proud and demanding in
nature doesn't it feel nice just to hear that people who are like that are
really nice to be around and this has to do with generating the conditions for
loving kindness in our life but it points toward a simplification of how we
are simplifying our actions simplifying our speech to be straightforward and
gentle probably even simplifying our thought processes so that we're not
always caught up in a million theories and speculations and anxieties about
what other people are thinking about us not necessary and not so supportive of
our practice so we want to live in a way that has some spaciousness to it to the
degree that we can that can be I support creating some outer spaciousness if we
can reducing the amount of running around that we do simplifying our
activities bringing in more spiritual friends into our life but even if you
you know those aren't your life conditions you have busyness you have
many people you have work that's complex there can be an interspaciousness in
relating to that you know this phrase unburdened with duties there's a lot to
be said for not having too many duties and if you do there's a way of being
unburdened by them right there's a way of relating to them such that they
aren't heavy and difficult and stressful for us if we create interspaciousness
around those so if we want a life of practice that includes a life of meta
and goodwill and kindness these are these words that I offered give us some touch
stones straightforwardness gentleness humble contented unburdened frugal and
so then that leads in to finding ways to relate to the sensory world the
material world skillfully so that we can create a sense of refuge you know of
all the vast realm of skillful and desires and wishes I'm talking about
just one here but the the desires that help us find refuge and some of those
actually come from the sensory world from the material world so the five
physical senses seeing hearing smelling tasting and touching can be used or
related to in ways that nourish our heart and mind these are often associated
of course the sense realm and Buddhist teachings is often associated with the
need for restraint that's the word used and I would agree with that generally
because often we're not restrained in that realm and that only leads to stress
and so forth but not all sense stimuli are to be avoided how can we and we we
have these sense organs so we don't have to avoid everything we can use the sense
world in ways that evoke faith that evoke refuge that evoke nourishment for
us when we're properly attuned we can even use the sixth sense which is our
cognition our mind in ways that are nourishing sometimes people have the
idea about spiritual practice that anything related to thinking is bad
anything related to you know cognizing is very suspect it should all just be kind
of I don't know coming from the heart coming from emotions but it's not the
case we can use our thinking mind we can use the fullness of our of our mind and
heart to nourish us so I want to name a number of ways that we can use the
ordinary stuff of our life our six senses as to encourage refuge and a sense of
faith and ability to go forward with our practice to align our life with Dharma
practice I guess I'll say them somewhat quickly not with a lot of
elaboration with the idea that you might just kind of feel which ones
resonate for you and maybe you'll also get some new ideas if you let me name a
lot of them you'll get some new ideas and say oh you know I'm not really using
that realm using that form in a way that could be helpful for me so for some
seeing seeing certain objects such as the Buddha Rupa for example or images even
monastic robes going to see monastics can be deeply nourishing that's
interesting there's a way in which our visual senses can resonate with something
in us the posture that the Buddha is in when sitting in these Buddha Rupas I
don't know if you can see from where you are but there's kind of a elevation of
his chest and this is actually deliberate it's meant to evoke a sense of
confidence that posture has an uprightness to it you remember that word
from what I just read in the metasuta and there's a way in which we can you
know we're not going to necessarily literally imitate what a stone figure
is doing but there is a way that if we sit up straight or feel the mirror
between us and this Rupa there's a way that we can actually feel some of that
confidence in ourselves the posture of the body is not irrelevant in how we
feel so there's that and then there are there's the beauty of a retreat center
it's not an accident that the aesthetic in this room is simple there's this
meant to evoke simplicity so that we have simplicity in the mind also that
doesn't mean our mind is simple when it comes here but we can be inspired by
that can be uplifting there's a subtle sense of calm and it might also be that
you can feel if you have a certain sensibility when you walk into a room
like this can you feel the stillness in this room because a lot of people have
meditated in here there's been a lot lot lot of hours of meditation in here and
so there's a way in which that I mean that's a sense coming in through our
sense doors and yet it can be nourishing for us if we open to it
hearing the Dharma has long served as a gateway to profound insight and at a
more ordinary level it's inspirational so you know being here this morning to
hear the Dharma and there's also you know a vast number of talks and guided
meditations available online and in other forms so listening can be a ready
source of support for our practice is that a sense desire to want to hear the
Dharma yeah but it's it's it also goes in that elevated realm reading the Dharma
is also good you know reading using the mind using the cognition I recommend
reading the original texts if you're drawn to them of course in English
translation there are good English translations available now and there
are also some very good modern interpretations by teachers Dharma
books of various kinds the Buddha encourages reflection on the teachings
you are allowed to think about what you've read think about whether it makes
sense to you think about how it might apply in your life have questions about
whether it's really the case what that really means you probably wouldn't want
to do a lot of long thinking while you're sitting in meditation just because
we want to separate those but you know outside of sitting on the cushion please
do think about the Dharma reflect on it for some practitioners the first re
taste of kind of real confidence in the Dharma comes when we read something that
is exactly like what we've experienced you know we've been sitting for maybe
even just a short time but we've experienced something or we felt
something or our mind shifts in a certain way and then we pick up a sutta or a
teacher quotes something in a talk and we realize the Buddha said exactly what
I've experienced and that was 2600 years ago huh maybe this guy did know
something about how the mind works so I'm joking a little bit but there's
really can be a profound resonance when we see that some of the sum of what's
in the suit as reflects what we see in our own mind and body right here in the
modern world and we also understand all the mind can be trained the process
works when I'm even when I meditate it's not an exception I'm not the
exception oh it works for everyone else but not gonna work for me but it does
when we see that it does so that can be very nourishing and I think it also
helps on a more emotional level it really it's really nice if we hear
stories about people who overcame their suffering you know in the suit as there's
a wonderful story about a woman named Kisa Gotami who was very distraught
because her her baby died and she carried the child around she just couldn't
grok the death and brought even you know when everybody was like you know not
able to help her really and she came to the Buddha with it with her dead child
and he said okay you know there's help there's help for you if you can get a
mustard seed from a house where no one has died so she set off on this quest
brilliantly skillful teaching on the Buddhist part because house after house
after house was willing to give her a mustard seed it's tiny little thing but
there wasn't any house where nobody had died so she got it you know she got it
over time and we can be inspired by these more subtle ways that the Buddha
taught people he didn't always just talk about the five kinds of desire but
there were you know he really could touch into people's deepest emotions and
find ways to connect that into the Dharma so you know we can learn from this
also we can resonate with her grief and also with her wisdom and
understanding through that practice the Buddha's compassion and then also being
in nature that's a decidedly sensory experience but being in nature can give
us a glimpse of the Dharma in certain ways that sometimes can penetrate more
deeply than things that are explicitly spiritual sometimes you know just seeing
the trees the bees the clouds the streams did you guys see the blooming
dogwood on the way in amazing so you know these things tell us about in
impermanence in personality conditionality in a very straightforward way we
see the cycle of life happening and we understand how we're part of it this
too is the Dharma and the truth of nature can heal and clarify things for us and
then there are certain devotional actions this isn't for everyone but if
you've never tried it you might certain devotional actions that can uplift our
heart and mind that maybe make it more easy for us to connect in with these
refined forms of happiness so for some people bowing you know maybe before you
start meditation or chanting or ritual these things can connect us in with the
spiritual dimension of life I guess there's a fortunate resonance in the in
that this afternoon at IMC there's going to be a session on chanting and talking
about some of the devotional practices of Asia with a wonderful scholar and
that's his profession is to be a Buddhist scholar but I would say he's really
quite a deep practitioner who has studied this so if you're at all interested
one to three o'clock this afternoon there will be and I think it's online also I
think it's a hybrid so even for those of you on YouTube it's possible so that's
not everyone's cup of tea but for some skeptics like me originally some
skeptics have been stunned at how deeply these kinds of simple devotional
actions can go they can really touch the heart so are there ways that you could
express your spiritual desires through your material life it's a question for
all of you just to consider you know is there some way that you could shift
maybe take some of the energy that's going into ordinary desires like food
comfort various pleasures I mean we devote a lot of our attention to that
how am I going to get this or that or that get the next one that's going to be
good how could we convert that into elevated desires for simple surroundings
that support practice for trust and confidence in practice for learning the
teachings for spiritual community there's a way in which we can elevate our
wishes along the you know toward the upper end of those five classes of
desire and sometimes we're able to literally kind of convert the ones that
are a little bit more worldly focused oh it would be even more nourishing if I
could want these deeper things these things that are part of the path so we
started by talking about how desire first of all is very prominent for us but
also that it has some subtlety to it clearly a lot of the desires that we
chase don't really help us they're exhausting we don't have control over
them they're pretty temporary when we get them you know they don't last and we
have to do the next one and yet some things are good to want I don't know if
you can get awakened without wanting that at some level it's not going to just
happen so we have to do something we have to want something along the way so
these spiritual wishes for goodness and meditative development are good ways to
direct that movement toward in our mind movement toward to be movement along the
path eventually I think we will move into the complete release of maybe all
kinds of desire except for those bodily ones but definitely we move into the
release of tanha the grasping part of this desire that is the cause of
suffering in the second noble truth it's not desire it's tanha it's the
grasping kind of desire but then that leads to a natural question how do we
know how do I know if I want something is that a good want or a unhelpful want
it's a little bit of a trial and error there's a need for discernment there we
have to keep checking we can check our wholesome states in the mind increasing
and unwholesome states decreasing or the reverse you know if we want kindness we
will tend to not increase our tanha when we do that if we want to be kind it can
still creep in we can want to be kind and then we can say I'm really a kind
person you know we take it on as an identity and that's when it becomes
unskillful slips into that but if we just keep checking you know is there
wholesomeness is what I'm wanting helping me to be come more wholesome more
skillful that's probably a good kind of desire and also we can check if we're
more you know felt sense meditator we can check if there's tension associated
with a certain desire if we want something that's you know grasping or
you know more in the sensory realm tends to bring some tension some stress with
it whereas other kinds of wants have a more open feeling to them there's still
a little bit of tension maybe but it's more subtle and we can also check
whether what we're wanting will help others or only us that's a good clue if
it would help others then it's more in the realm of skillful so developing this
kind of discernment is part of the path also we are not perfect at first at
knowing whether we're having skillful unskillful desire so we'll have to
develop that over time but one implication of thinking in this way is
that the whole world becomes our realm of practice you know every moment every
encounter every wish that we have in our mind right here in the tangible world
is a doorway to taking a step on the path if we can see it in that way so
there's a completeness there's a fullness to our relationship to life
and especially when we've undertaken a spiritual path then we start to see the
ways in which some of what we do supports that and some of what we do
doesn't support that and we can start to prioritize move toward this movement
toward move toward the things that are actually helping us that are then
propelling us along the path part of the subtlety of this knowing about which
desires are helpful and not is that it shifts over time so something that was
helpful for a while might become unhelpful later you know we have to let
go of certain desires that were okay at the beginning but then they become
burdensome so be prepared for those shifts over time so I hope I hope what
this is done is maybe clarified a little bit this realm of desire so that we
don't have an automatic sense of oh it's all bad I've got to get rid of all my
desires and then the reaction against that but I don't want to get rid of all
my desires and I shouldn't have to and blah blah blah we can sweep all of that
aside and consider instead this dimension of wholesome unwholesome
skillful unskillful which desires are supporting the path and moving more and
more toward having more of those in our life and then letting letting the
mindfulness take care of the rest of it letting the ones fall away moving us
