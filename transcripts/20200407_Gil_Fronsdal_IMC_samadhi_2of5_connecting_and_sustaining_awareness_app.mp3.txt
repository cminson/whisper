Samādhi (2 of 5) : Connecting , and 
Sustaining Awareness  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

Good morning. Today I will continue on the theme of 
samādhi, the fourth of the five faculties. I have a lot of 
reverence for samādhi . Somehow samādhi  represents a 
wonderful state of being, of settle dness, wellbeing that 
makes me feel whole in this world , or peaceful , beyond  
or wider than anything I could imagine . At its very best, 
samādhi  is kind of like entering into sacred ground. 
Maybe it’s a little dangerous to treat samādhi  in such a 
lofty way , but I do have that kind of feeling for it.  
 
Yesterday I talked about two aspects of samādhi  – both 
as our preparatio n for developing concentration , and as 
part and parcel of concentration.  Thinking of it as a 
preparation is to arrive, to initiate the process of 
concentration, to relax, to let go into being centered, 
and to find a center within yourself. The idea is to 
compose yourself on that center , to be settled . This is 
an alternative way of talking about be ing focused. Many 
times concentration is associated with focus, such as 
focus ing the mind on the breathing. That is fine , but it 
lends itself to being in the control tower of the head , with the mind’s eye looking down with a laser beam.  
 
In the Buddha’s t eaching, samādhi  is a state, a fully 
embodied state. The whole body is suffused with the 
qualities of concentration. It isn’t only a mental act. So 
to talk about composing ourselves is a physical 
language. We compose our whole body. We settle our 
body, ali gn the body , and settle. In that aligning and 
settling , we begin the process of concentration. It works 
particularly well if we compose ourselves on the 
breathing. Or compose ourselves on some center of 
gravity within. It is like reorienting ourselves from  how 
we usually think , or how we are in the world into 
something that may, for some people, feel 
counterintuitive or even foreign – the our idea of 
composing the body , and being here and now  - rather 
than thinking , wanting , or avoiding . It’s a kind of 
relaxing, letting go, centering on the breathing.  
 
Then after that beginning, there are two movements of 
concentration practice that are  the initiating and 
engaging parts of concentration practice. The y can go 
hand in hand with mindfulness practice. In the anc ient 
language they are  called  vitakka and vicāra. In the way 
my brain plays with words and sounds, vitakka  to me 
sounds like a knock. It is a way of showing up and 
connecting. “Knock, knock, I’m here. Open the door. ” 
And with vicāra , 
I like to stretch the ā. It’s more like lingering or staying . There’s  continuity.  
 
Vitak ka sometimes is called , “the initial application of 
mind or attention.” It’s bringing the attention to the 
focus. So if we are focusing on the breathing, if that is 
the center of gravity for meditation , and the mind 
wanders off, then the very act of bringing the mind back 
and reconnecting to the breathing – knocking on the 
breath, “Here I am” – involves a little rudimentary 
thinking. The word vitakka  in Pali can also mea n 
thinking. If you notice that the mind has wandered off, 
there is a kind of cognition that says , “Let’s come back ; 
let’s reconnect to the breathing. ”  
 
How we have those thoughts , and how we do that 
coming back to the breathing is actually very important. 
It may  be more important than returning to the breath. 
We want to make the return something that is 
welcomed, enjoyable , and calming in and of itself. 
Sometimes I have jerked my mind back, kind of 
violently, feeling bad about drifting off  – and that is more 
agitating. I have also sometimes pounced back on the 
breath , “Now I’m really going to bore into it .” That is 
more agitating than calming.  
 
So, how can we come back in a calm way , and 
reconnect to the experience of breathing? In the ancient 
language of the Buddha’s teachings , there is no 
equivalent idea to our English idea of coming back to breathing, returning to one’s  breathing. It’s a bit of a 
metaphor to bring the mind back. The mind doesn’t go 
anywhere. The mind is always here. And t he met aphor 
of bringing it back may lend itself to a certain kind of 
agitation  or movement. Maybe vitakka  is noticing that 
we are drifting off, then having the thought , “Where is 
the breathing? ” Then allow ing the breathing to knock on 
you: “Here I am. Knock, knock. ” So it’s more relaxing 
and opening  in making that initial connection . It’s a 
conscious, somewhat intentional movement. “OK, I’m 
back. Here I am. ”  
 
Some people are very good at coming back , and 
reconnecting to the breathing or to the focus of  
meditation. But o nce there, they don’t apply themselves 
as much anymore. So, the mind wanders off again.   
The second aspect of concentration, vicāra , is 
sustaining the attention on the breathing , or on the 
object of attention  – lingering, hanging out ther e. The 
analogy in one of the ancient texts is that vitakka  is like 
placing a cloth on a bronze bowl , and vicāra  is rubbing 
the bowl, polishing it. A more poetic image is that of a 
bee landing on a flower ( vitakka ), and vicāra  is the bee 
walking around pick ing up the pollen. The word vicāra  
comes from the word to walk, to wander. So the idea is 
that we are staying with, wandering with  our object of 
meditation . Some meditation teachers translate the 
word as ‘evaluating. ’ It’s a little like being there and 
discovering the experience, getting to know it better, letting it register more fully.  
 
Vitakka  is connecting to the breath , or allowing the 
breathing to connect to you in your awareness. Vicāra  is 
sustaining that attent ion over time, lingering there, 
resting in that, letting go into the whole experience of 
exhale. So you are really there “vicāra -ing” – cruising 
on, resting in, being polished by the exhale, staying 
aware in the whole length of the exhale. Then the same 
for the inhale. Connect ing to the inhale, the whole 
inhale. This factors, vitakka  and vicāra , are to some 
degree relevant at the beginning of each breath  – each 
inhale and each exhale. There is a connection , and then 
there is the resting  and sustaining. The sustaining will 
always come to an end. There will always be a time to 
do it again , and again. Sometimes sustaining can last a 
long time , but more often, especially in the beginning, 
the mind  wanders off more quickly , and sustaining 
doesn’t  have much momentum.  
 
The analogy I like for vitakka  and vicāra  is that of a push 
scooter. One foot is on top of the scooter and the other 
foot is pushing you along. If you give yourself a good 
push, then the momentum will carry you and you don’t 
have to p ush for a  while. Unless you are going down a 
steep hill, the momentum will fade away , and then you 
have to push again. Then you glide along. When I was a 
kid on a scooter, I never complained about having to 
push  again  to get the momentum going .   
When w e start developing concentration practice with 
the two movements – the tap of vitakka  – and then 
allowing ourselves to glide  along , or to be carried along 
with vicāra . We will need to do the connection, the little 
push , again. Here we go. Push again  – and ride it, ride 
it, ride it. As the practice deepens, become s intentional 
to connect or to allow the breath to connect to us . And 
it’s intentional to linger and ride it  – or let the whole 
experience wash over us. As we do that and settle into 
the practice mo re and more, at some point this need for 
vitakka  and vicāra  – connecting and sustaining – falls 
away. And then we’re just really right there. We’re 
cruising along , with no intentionality or thought needed 
to keep it going.  
 
Finally, what I’d like to say is that these two things I 
have talked about today – the initial connection and the 
sustaining of the connection of awareness – can be 
experimented with. See if you can find a way to do it 
that is calm, relaxed, spacious  – without expectation or 
demand  that it be any certain way . See if you can make 
it fun , nice,  or enjoyable , so that you might like doing it , 
and will want to do it. It doesn’t feel  like work. Just lik e 
for the kid , pushing the scooter  is not work.  
 
Thank you very much for being here. I’ll continue the 
theme of samādhi  tomorrow, and maybe take it to the 
next level. I’ve said it many times, but I feel very appreciative and a lot of gratitude for being a ble to do 
this with all of you. Thank you.
