The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So, hi everybody. Nice to see you all.
So, I've been enjoying
receiving the questions that people submit during the week.
That's kind of fun. It's a new thing that I've tried to
put this form out there to make it possible to participate through a written question.
It's been fun getting the questions.
And I also will, I thought I'd start with one of the ones from the
that was submitted online and then see if there's any
here. And there's two, there were two
submitted. But they're both really great
questions. And I was thinking about taking them in separate weeks.
So, we'll see how it goes.
So, the question that I thought I'd start with is,
how can I be more mindful of the suffering of others?
And I love this question because it really
speaks to the heart that wants to be connected.
It's addressing that
wish to have a connection with others.
And that was the only sentence in the question. So, there wasn't any
elaboration. So, I'm going to talk around it for a while.
And hopefully it will touch on
some of the pieces that this person
had in their question.
So, how can I be more mindful of the suffering of others?
To me, there's a couple of qualities that are
...
They both support our capacity
to be mindful of the suffering of others.
And they are developed as we connect with the suffering of others.
So, it's kind of an interesting way in which these qualities,
these two qualities that I'm thinking of right now, compassion and equanimity,
that they...
we can't expect to just have them right off the bat. And yet they do support us
in connecting with others. So, there's a way in which
we maybe aspire to have equanimity
and compassion in relationship to meeting
the experience of others. And also
a way in which we may begin to
taste or touch into those qualities in our experience.
And so, I thought I'd speak a little bit
about working with
cultivating compassion and equanimity in relationship
to the suffering of others.
Now, paradoxically in some ways, there's different ways into this.
There's different ways into how we can begin to open our hearts
to the suffering of others.
The more classical way is through using
reflection practice,
formal Brahmavihara practice, formal compassion practice, where we're actively
calling up in our minds other people.
And in particular, with compassion practice, we are calling up
ways in which they are suffering.
And so, the proximate
cause for compassion is said to be the sight of a helpless person
in distress. That that is a kind of a proximate cause
for the quality of compassion to arise.
And so, the question is about mindfulness of the suffering of others,
but I really feel like the quality of compassion
is what allows us to be mindful of the
suffering of others. Equanimity also supports
that. The compassion quality is the quality that allows our heart
to stay open
when we are witnessing suffering so that it doesn't contract or constrict.
And the quality of equanimity is the quality
that allows us to not kind of get lost
in the suffering of others.
Our mind can stay balanced even as it meets
suffering. And so, the
kind of the classical way to cultivate compassion is to bring people into mind
using reflection practice, bringing people into mind
and reflecting on ways in which they might be suffering.
And then expressing the wish
may you be free of that suffering. That is the
compassion wish. May you be free of that suffering. So I think
to some extent being able to be mindful of the suffering of
others means being able to be in touch with
the suffering of others.
That we don't shut down,
that we don't
turn our heads away or kind of turn
inwards or feels in some way like they deserve it, or that's not
me. It's like, thank you, pour them, it's not me. And so
the being mindful of the suffering of others means that our hearts
stay open and can feel
that others are suffering. That is the quality of compassion.
The quality of compassion is the heart that
when it meets the suffering of others
it actually resonates kind of an empathy with that
suffering. Jack Cornfield calls
compassion a kind of a querying of the heart.
And that's like the resonant quality, the querying of the heart as it meets
suffering.
And so this is one way to cultivate this connection
is to look at
how our minds are when we bring up, when we kind of consciously reflect
on the fact that others suffer
and are not free to be free of that suffering.
The wish to be free, them to be free of that suffering is
what the movement of compassion is.
Compassion is a very active quality. It not only
is open in connection with the suffering of others,
it also wishes to act to alleviate that suffering.
And so that wish, may you be free of this suffering, is that wish
so we can use reflection practice and this could be formal, you could do it in a
formal way. But I find
there's a lot of opportunity for compassion practice in the world, especially
like right now, you know, just reading the news
this is an opportunity for compassion practice, you know, can you take in
this is another human being that is being
described in this, in this article, this is another human being that is
suffering. So sometimes
you know, in reading
about the suffering of others, we kind of create a distance or a separation.
It's like, well, it's happening to them, it's not happening to me.
And this breaking down of this barrier or breaking down of the
sense that it's happening to someone else, it's not happening to me,
that is part of the work of the
compassion that we
realize that whatever happens
to someone else could also happen to me.
You know, that it's circumstance
that it's happening to someone else and not to me. And I think this is actually a really good
time to be reflecting on just this kind of thing
because the
virus that we're all, you know, the entire planet is living
with this virus right now. And we don't know the next person it's going to hit.
The descriptions of people who are suffering
and the healthcare workers that are really struggling to take care
of the amount of people suffering.
These are, these could be us.
We may be the next person
to get the virus. We may die of this virus. You know, we don't know.
And so to realize
that the suffering of others, and this is another way to reflect
on compassion and to open to and be mindful of the suffering of others
is to, in the taking in,
this other person is suffering to reflect it might be me.
It's not.
I am not immune from this kind of
suffering as a human being.
I am subject to aging to illness to death.
I am subject to separation from what is loved. We talked about this, I think, a few weeks ago.
These reflections
on impermanence. And there's a real connection
between the impermanent nature
of our lives, of our health, of our
lives, of the things that, the
connection that we have with things that we love and the,
and suffering. Because the
loss of things that we love, the association with things that we
don't want to be associated with, that's just the nature
of being human. And that nature means that
we will lose things.
We will become sick, we will age, we will die.
Some of that separation that happens when we're
maybe not so able to be mindful of the suffering of others
comes because we're denying, not only are we denying
that the other person, oh, it's a them, it's not me,
but we're actually in ignorance
in denial of the truth of impermanent
unreliable for ourselves.
And so this is another way in, and for me this was actually
the bigger way
in, or the more natural way in, I think there's different ways people
have to connect with
not only the practice, but with specific aspects of the practice. So in particular
around cultivating compassion, loving kindness,
cultivating these Brahma vaharas, for some there's
a very direct connection or possibility with using
this reflective practice and
bringing to mind people and how they may be suffering
and that that softens the heart and opens the heart. For me that was
very challenging. But another way into this
is to, from the side of
beginning to recognize our own mortality,
our own
the ways that we suffer,
that we kind of can connect. And for me this was
the way in that I had a lot of trouble connecting
initially with
the sense of empathy with other suffering. I mean
I could, but it was more like pity or it wasn't
and there was some aversion in there.
You know, it's like, oh, you know, I don't want to see
that or there was a railing against the world
that's wrong, that's not the way it should be as opposed to really
acknowledging the truth. This is how it is in the heart staying open.
But as I started to meet my own experience, to look at my own
experience and see the ways in which I suffer
you know, the ways in which this being gets all caught up and
reactive and angry and confused and pain
in the body and beginning to see that that is all conditioned.
That's all nature.
It is the nature of being human for these
bodies to ache and the hearts to ache and
so it began to kind of
dawn on me through the practice through
being mindful of my own experience and being mindful of my own
suffering that this was the
human condition. It wasn't about me
that the way that the Buddha encourages
us to be aware, to be mindful of our own
suffering isn't a poor me kind of reflection.
It's holding it with some balance of mind and so this is bringing
in the equanimity. The practice for me
the practice of looking at my own suffering
began cultivating the quality of equanimity, began cultivating
that balance of mind that could be okay with suffering that
was arising here, not rejecting it, not trying to fix it or change
it, but just opening to okay this is what it's like to be a human being
that's reactive right now, that's in pain right now, that hates
what's happening right now. This is what it's like to be a human being
that's experiencing the suffering and something about that
began to kind of
help me recognize that
what was happening here, the reactivity
that was happening here in this being, was not that different from what was
going on in other people and that began to
soften my heart for other people, that the touching
into suffering here in this being began
to allow my, through
the recognition, this is conditioned, this isn't personal
this is, you know, the arising of this
frustration, this anger, this
bodily pain, this is the condition of being
in a human body, this is the nature of being human
and with that the mind began to kind of extrapolate in a way
to recognize that the
suffering that I was experiencing was not
this mind. I remember so clearly one time
I was seeing anger in my mind, I was seeing
the way anger worked and watching it
come up and then also seeing how the mind
not only, you know, had that
feeling of being hurt by someone, but also
wanted to hurt that person, there was a way in which I wanted
the other person to
to suffer and seeing that, you know,
seeing how the mind actively wanted somebody else to suffer, when I
could feel my own suffering, that was, that was humbling
but it also was kind of, was humbling
for me, but it also helped me to understand, it's like, oh, this is
this is not just the way my mind works, this is the
way billions of minds work
and the war that's out there, the countries
that are fighting with each other, you know, it's like, this is the seeds of
that, this is the root of that, and it opened my heart to a
kind of a compassion to recognize that
that the ways in which my mind gets all
tied up in knots, I can't, it's kind of like
I can't judge somebody else's mind getting all tied up in knots because I can see how easy
it is for my mind to get tied up in knots, and so the
that created a sense of connection
with other beings, it created a sense of, like
an odd way, it created a sense of community in my
heart around the feelings
of all of the messiness, and that for me
was probably the early doorways into
compassion and connection, is through
looking at my own suffering, and recognizing
that it's the way everybody is,
the way everybody's minds work similarly
that there's something about the way that the Buddha encouraged us to watch
our experience that helps us to see that it's not just
us. The other piece
that's useful in terms
of this exploration of cultivating compassion and equanimity
for the suffering being mindful of the suffering of others
is to begin to be kind
of curious about what's in the way of being
able to be connected with other suffering. What's in the way of
that? So I mentioned some of the
qualities that might come up earlier, pity, or
a sense of aversion, a sense of
fear, confusion, those kinds of qualities can get
in the way of that kind of connectedness of
part of the feeling of compassion. Now those
qualities, the fear, the aversion, the pity,
the confusion, those are all reactions.
It's kind of like our system is
when there is suffering, our system
understands that as painful, and we don't like it.
So we want to step away from it. And these are habitual ways that we've
learned in our lives to step away from things, to deny
that it's true to flee away from it,
to get angry and lash out at it, to blame somebody,
to blame the world, to feel it fault ourselves.
There's all kinds of ways in which we kind of put up a barrier
so that we don't have to feel that suffering.
So this is another thing that just to be really honest
with ourselves, not try to force ourselves to step into that connection
to feel the suffering of others, but if there's a block there
there's something keeping us from feeling the suffering of others,
that's worth exploring. And that's a way
that our hearts begin.
So we look at what the relationship is, we look at that
fear or that confusion or that denial, and
recognize what's there, the beliefs
that are there with it, the underlying
sense of betrayal or
a belief of some kind, so that we see
how our minds are denying what's
true actually. Because I think all of those reactions
are some way denying the truth of suffering.
So those are a few
thoughts about that.
One more piece,
and then I'll see if there's any comments or questions about
or thoughts about this, other thoughts.
In reflecting on the experience of others,
I talked about using newspapers or stories
that we read, as you bring those in
kind of like this is in one of the Mahayana traditions
there's a talk of exchanging self for other.
And this is a useful kind of practice,
just to remind yourself, this might be me,
how might it be if this were me,
to really acknowledge that shared humanity
that
we are not immune from this kind of
suffering that we're seeing. So those are just a few
reflections on exploring being more mindful
of the suffering of others. Any thoughts or comments
or reflections
that brought up for you. And let me just make sure
I can make sure you unmute yourselves now.
So you can unmute yourselves if you want
to say something.
Or raise your hand.
Yeah, Ali.
Hi, Andrea, thank you.
Would you say the practice of Lu Zhong,
Lu Zhong is taking the suffering of others in,
is that the more progression of what you were describing, or is that like separate?
I think, you know, the
I'm not, I've not
really done the Tibetan style of practice, the
Mahayana styles of practice, but to me it doesn't seem that different
from what the Buddha talks about in terms of
the development and cultivation of compassion.
So I think they're different, we could say that they're different practices
and there's different ways in for different people.
So, yeah, I mean, if it resonates for you
to explore that kind of exchanging self and other,
that kind of taking in the suffering, I think there's
breathing in the suffering of others and breathing out ease and peace
so that you're really doing that exchange.
But I think also the exchanging self and others, the recognition, yes, that could be me.
I think that's a powerful reflection in the mind.
Yeah, thank you.
Yeah, Drake.
Hi, thank you very much. I was wondering if you think the
I always get tripped up over the
big mindfulness sutta where we're supposed to see these things
internally and externally. That's relevant to this sort of stuff.
That's great. I'm so glad you brought that up. It is relevant.
That's not specific to compassion, but it is
relevant in terms of noticing what's happening internally, noticing
what's happening externally. Although it's not completely clear what it means,
the commentaries do mention noticing
how others are. In terms of mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of
breathing, you can notice how other people's bodies
are, how they're holding it, how they are, and there
can be an imputation of recognizing somebody else's
suffering. That is noticing the mind states of
others, noticing how other people are. We know these
things by how they express it. We see how people
are, how they're engaged. I've actually found this to be powerful
when I've remembered to be
almost like how I do mindfulness for myself. I notice, oh yeah,
there's anger arising here. Oh, anger. That's what
that feels like. That's what the experience of anger is internally.
When I remember to recognize when somebody else is expressing something
like that, oh, that's anger arising externally. It actually
is helpful. Again, it helps the mind
to remember this is an impersonal thing. Likewise with
suffering, well, anger is a form of suffering. I think that
that's a beautiful connection to recognize.
Because we feel when anger arises internally, or
any kind of reactivity, any mental reactivity
arises internally, we can experience it or feel it as
suffering. And then when we see and recognize, oh, somebody
else, they're experiencing frustration, that might help us to connect
to the fact that that's suffering because we've experienced that as suffering.
So that's a beautiful connection to that
piece of the sutta. And it's an interesting one to play with. Oh yeah,
there's, I've done it actually even watching
somebody do walking meditation, stepping, stepping,
it's kind of fun. So yeah, thank you
for that.
Yeah, Ek.
My question is around
what will you
suggest when there is a denial of
my own suffering?
The denial of your own suffering.
Is it an unawareness?
Or is there a kind of an awareness and a pushing away of it?
I think, yeah, pushing away of it, yeah.
Yeah, okay, so there is the, there is the recognition that it's
suffering, but then there's a kind of a
I don't have time for this or
I shouldn't be feeling this or something along those
lines potentially. So some kind of relationship of
you know, it sounds like an aversive
kind of relationship to it. And I would say
it's really important to recognize
that that is happening. Sometimes
it is an almost a defense mechanism
because sometimes
as we become aware of our suffering,
being aware of it almost like takes us into it or takes us into the rabbit hole
of it. And so sometimes that kind of pushing away
is a kind of a defense mechanism or a kind of a
way to keep us from getting like overwhelmed by it.
And so, you know, to hold that perspective sometimes
can be useful to
recognize, okay, well there is the suffering and there's a not wanting to see
it happening. There's a kind of a sense of
not being okay with
being with it right now. And can that be okay?
So can there be a little bit of compassion for yourself? So again, it's kind of
working at it through the equanimity and compassion door that
that's what's happening for you. If you could change it,
if you could have that denial be gone, if you could have
the suffering be gone, you might do that, but we often can't.
So sometimes we have to open to what is here.
And so that might be having a heart that can
stretch to hold, well there's that suffering and there's the
not wanting to see it. That's what's happening.
Can I be okay with that? Can I know that that's what's happening?
Not deny that the mind is denying
the suffering. So that's
one way to explore.
And for me, that feels like a very respectful
way to explore because
the denial or the resistance to the suffering
is part of what your system is doing. That's part of
what's happening for you. And so it's opening to that.
Now you may want to explore the possibility
of
seeing. Can I touch that?
Recognizing that there is that denial.
Can I kind of maybe
look at it a little bit from the side, just touch it really
gently, that suffering, let myself go in a little bit, see
what happens. And then not force yourself to
stay with it, not try to dive into the middle of that suffering
and the denial or the resistance be
damned. It's like that is not
helpful. But you might with the holding of both,
holding, yeah there's resistance and there's this suffering.
Maybe holding both I can let
myself touch a little bit that suffering. And then take some steps
back from it. So that you're, you know, you're kind of
pushing the edge a little bit, but respecting that there is that resistance
and see what happens. You know, that maybe it may be there's a little
more capacity to touch into that suffering
than you give yourself credit for. And some of that resistance
can be habit. So it's worth
respecting it, but also potentially
you're just kind of like, can I
just touch that suffering just a little bit.
And there's a lot more to say about that, but it's time to stop.
