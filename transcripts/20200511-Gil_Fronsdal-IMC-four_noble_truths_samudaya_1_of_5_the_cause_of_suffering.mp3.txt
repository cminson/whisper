This Monday, we begin the second week on the topic of 
the Four Noble Truths. This topic  for this week  is the 
Second Noble Truth , the noble truth of the arising of 
suffe ring. So there ’s the noble truth of suffering, the 
noble truth of the arising of suffering, the noble truth of 
the cessation of suffering , and the noble truth of the 
practice leading to the cessation of suffering.  
 
These Four Noble Truths are often considered to be 
central teachings of Buddhism  – maybe even the 
central teachings of the Buddha. The myth or the lore 
Buddhism is that the first  sermon, the first teachings the 
Buddha gave , were on the Four Noble Truths. There ’s a 
long history in all the different schools of Buddhism, to 
make a claim about what the first teachings of the Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits JAS -mg - 2 - Buddha were, and this  probably reflects what ’s very 
importan t for that school of Buddhism.  
 
In Theravada Buddhism, these Four Noble Truths are 
really at the center of it all.  I take , with tremendous 
appreciation and respect , that there ’s this Buddhist 
tradition, the Theravada  tradition , which has a 
wonderful, dynamic teaching o n the Four Noble Truths , 
which we can use as a framework to better understand 
our lives.  
 
One of the advantages of this framework, especially as 
a foundation of a whole religious tradition, is that it 
doesn ’t assume , posit , or require one to believe in 
something that cannot be proven, or seen and 
experienced for oneself. This is  not a supernatural 
belief. It ’s not an abstract , metaphysical belief that we 
have to believe in, or a tenet that comes down from the 
Buddha , which  can’t be proven, but that you have to 
believe.  
 
This is something that we can really discover for 
ourselves in our experience. T he Four Noble Truths are 
eminently a practical framework, through  which we can 
look at our lives , and this is done at the place the 
Theravada  tradition says is most essential, most simple. 
It’s pared down to where the heart of it is , and the heart 
of it really has to do with the third noble truth, the topic Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits JAS -mg - 3 - for next week : the possibility of the cessati on of 
suffering , the nirodha  of suffering.  
 
One of the meanings of nirodha  is ‘non-obstruction ’ – to 
come to a place where we ’re no longer obstructed by 
suffering . We are  no longer obstructed by all the 
different aspects and ecology of suffering that migh t 
exist, so that who we are and how we are, can unfold, 
move, develop, and grow on the path to greater and 
greater freedom. That ’s the core aspect of Buddhism.  
 
It’s like the good news of Buddhism. It does it by a very 
simple framework , which  doesn ’t require a lot of study, 
and doesn ’t require metaphysics or supernatural things. 
It’s just: “This is the essence of it. ” And if you stay close 
to that essence, all of Buddhism will unfold. One ancient 
teaching is that a ll the footprints of all the animals in the 
forest can be placed inside the footprint of an elephant. 
And all the teachings of Buddhism can be put inside the 
Four Noble Truths. Everything else follows from this.  
 
The Four Noble Truths, being such a very i mportant 
central teaching, has been interpreted in many, many 
ways. It ’s changed now, but 10 years ago I looked up 
the Four Noble Truths  on Wikipedia . There w ere some 
eight different modern definitions of what the Four 
Noble Truths are  – and they were wild ly different from 
each other. Some of them I  would never even recognize 
as being part of Buddhism. They’re all modern Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits JAS -mg - 4 - explications . I was surprised by this, and then a little bit 
surprised  again that t hey didn ’t attribute any of them to 
anyone . One of them  was mine. I thought that was 
interesting, that something I had said in some little 
paper would end up in Wikipedia.  
 
So it’s been interpreted in many different ways. And 
probably all the different interpretations have value for 
the people who have come u p with them. In Asia, down 
through the centuries, there  have  been many 
interpretations.  
 
I’ll talk over the next few days about some of the 
interpretations , or some of the applications of the 
Second Noble Truth : the truth of the arising of suffering. 
The literal meaning is ‘arising ,’ but one of the most 
common understandings , especially in the modern 
world (but maybe also in much of Theravada  Buddhism ) 
is that the Second Noble Truth has to do with the cause  
of suffering. We want to understand what ’s causing it, 
what ’s bringing it about, what the source of it  is. Some 
translators have called this truth  the ‘origination ’ of 
suffering .  
 
Often modern books will say, “There’s suffering , and 
there ’s the cause of suffering. ” This can be  a very 
practical and useful teaching. In some ways, it ’s 
applicable to so many different areas of our lives , Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits JAS -mg - 5 - available to us in everyday experience. It doesn ’t 
require meditation or the mind getting still.  
 
Some of the ot her, deeper interpretations of the Second 
Noble Truth do  require a depth of meditative 
experience. But here , looking at the cause in everyday 
life, you can see that we get impatient . You can ask, 
"What ’s the cause of that impatience? Oh, I ’m in a hurry 
to get somewhere. Maybe I don ’t have to be in a hurry . 
That desire to get somewhere quickly is making tension 
in the system."  
 
The question , “What’s the cause of this distress I ’m 
feeling  with regard to what  is going on ?” – this simple  
question opens the field, and can reveal something we 
can do about  it – sometimes. We can have a different 
relationship with the cause ; we can let go of it ; we can 
let it be ; we could not pick it up. We could put it aside , 
so that whatever the cause is , it no longer becomes a 
cause. It just becomes something  that is happening .  
 
In modern interpretations,  it’s very popular to say that 
the cause of suffering is desire, but that makes all 
desire seem like a problem. It could be that we 
understand that not al l desires are a problem. But if 
there ’s going to be suffering, there is some desire 
behind it. And there can be desire without any suffering. 
That may  be more interesting than making all desire a 
problem.  Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits JAS -mg - 6 -  
In the teachings of the Buddha, th e word used to 
characterize the kind of desire that is the emphasis  here 
is a metaphor. As I said last week, a lot of Buddhist 
teachings are metaphoric. And the metaphor for the 
Second Noble Truth  literally means ‘thirst ’ in English.  
It’s a kind of desire that occur s with the characteristics 
of being thirst y. Imagine someone  who is parched, 
really thirsty, and desperate for water. The compulsion 
that drives the preoccupation with getting something to 
drink can be quite strong  – it could be all that the 
person thinks about.  
 
This thirst is the cause of suffering. So ‘thirst ’ means 
that the suffering has a compulsive quality. There ’s a 
drivenness . It is  not, "I’ll take it or leave it. It doesn ’t 
really matter to me." When desires ar e really strong, it’s 
like there ’s an addictive force, which  sometimes is 
impossible not to give into. It ’s an addictive, compulsive 
force  – and that ’s part of the reason why there ’s 
suffering involved  – because the desire ha s tension . 
There is a loss of freedom  in this compulsive desire. 
Anytime we lose our freedom, we suffer . We feel less ; 
we’re limited;  we have a burden. There ’s a challenge , 
an inner  burning, which is  not pleasant at all . We feel  a 
painful burning sensation that we have to have this  
suffering .  
 Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits JAS -mg - 7 - In mindfulness practice, we learn to look at the nature of 
desire , and at the nature of our suffering . We look at 
what the cause  is. Can I identify anything that ’s 
conventionally called the cause ? And if it ’s desire, or 
whatever it might be, we learn to look at it more 
carefully. This is where the meditation this morning  of 
letting things be is so useful  – because when you learn 
to let it be, you learn to see it more clearly. You let it 
evolve , and show itsel f.  
 
Not all cravings are problematic  only. Sometimes what 
we crave and are addicted to represents a deeper need  
we might have  – perhaps a deeper desire for something 
good , but which is  directed in the wrong way. The deep 
need we have gives it compulsion . We have to have 
this! If we let go of the unwholesome desire  without 
taking our time to let it be , to study and see it, and to let 
it relax, then we might not discover the deeper things 
going on  – the deeper, maybe wholesome desire that ’s 
there  – not always , but sometimes.  
 
So stop and take a good look . Ask the question, "What 
is the cause of my distress, my sorrow , my grief ?" 
Appreciat e that there might be multiple causes. The 
cause of the Four Noble Truths that we are interested in 
is our con tribution to our suffering  – how we thirst, how 
we have compulsion, how we have very strong desires 
for something to exist, how we  want  something , or want 
to push something away , to get rid of  it. That deep drive Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits JAS -mg - 8 - of desire that human beings have takes many forms . 
Some of them are quite beautiful , necessary , and 
profound.   
 
In the freedom, the cessation, the non -obstruction of 
suffering, Buddhist practice reveals  something  beautiful , 
as it releases more and more of the wholesome desires 
within us. The Fo ur Noble truths are not an 
abandonment or a release of all suffering. But as we go 
through our lives , and live our lives, it does purify our 
desires so that anything that is compulsive  or addictive  
– or any desire we have in which we lose our freedom  – 
is shed . This is such a beautiful thing.  
 
So the first task with the Four Noble Truths is to just 
carry with us the question , "What am I contributing to 
this suffering?"  As w e recognize our suffering, our 
stress , our distress , we ask ourselves, “What is my 
contribution?" There might be other people, who 
conventionally can be said are the cause of our 
suffering. Not to ignore that, b ut the place where we can 
have the most impact, the place of Buddhist practice , is 
to ask, “What is my contribution to this?” And then we 
take a good look at it, and hold it in awareness , and 
understand it deeply. And in so doing, we find our 
freedom.  
 
Tomorrow we ’ll continue with other meanings of the 
second noble truth. Thank you .
