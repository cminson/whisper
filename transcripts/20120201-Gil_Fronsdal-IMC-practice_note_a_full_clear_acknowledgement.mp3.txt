Acknowledgement

Sometimes we’re mindful;  sometimes we’re not . And 
sometimes we are somewhere in between, where we’re 
kind of mindful,  on automatic pilot.  Maybe we’re trying to 
be present and mindful of the breath,  but the mind is 
thinking about something else. An interesting thing  to do 
with mindfulness practice is to notice , as clearly as you 
can, what it’ s like to  not be mindful, what  it’s like when 
you are drifting off in thought, or when you’re caught up 
in thought.  
 
When at some point you wake up enough from being 
distracted, rather than being discouraged , or coming 
strongly back to the breath or the present moment, turn 
toward the very distraction s you have , and try to 
understand  what’s going on there . It’s interesting to 
acknowledge  very clearly and definitively  what you are 
up to. What is it  you’re distr acted by? What are the 
thoughts, t he concerns you have?  
 
Do it really clearly and definitively . “Oh, this is what I’m 
doing! I ’m involved in this in some way.” I f you only halfhea rtedly acknowledge thinking about  the future, 
about planning, and then  come back, the momentum to 
keep  think ing is still intact. So  stop, clearly and fully , and 
say, “I  am thinking about later on today ; I’m p lanning ; 
that’s what happening.”   
 
A defin itive, clear acknowledgment does a couple of 
things: O ne is that you’re  no lo nger caught in what 
you’re thinking about ; you have taken  a little step back 
from it . The other is that the  fuller acknowledgment 
sometimes  makes it  easier for things to settle down . In 
the full acknowledgment of something , it is easier to 
disentangle your self from it. I t’s easier to see that you 
don’t really  want to be involved in this , or don’t really 
need to be thinking about this.  
 
As you go about your practice today , if it should happen 
that you g et distracted by a thought , you might want to 
expe riment with turning toward it for a moment and 
acknowledging it f ully and  clear ly: “This is what I’m 
doing . This is what I’m t hinking . This is what I’m up to.” 
Then see if that full, clear stopping and acknowledgi ng 
makes it easier to come back and be pres ent.
