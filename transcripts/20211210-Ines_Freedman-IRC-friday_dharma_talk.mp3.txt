So good afternoon or evening for some of you.
Maybe even morning for some of you, I'm not sure.
I hope your day of practice has been nourishing for you.
So I'm going to talk a little bit about faith and wisdom, two of the spiritual faculties,
and just to refresh ourselves, their faith or confidence, energy, mindfulness, concentration,
and wisdom. And the reason we talk about them in pairs is because they tend to balance each other.
So I'll be doing faith and wisdom, and Shelley will be doing energy and concentration.
So these are, as Shelley said, these are factors of mind that deeply affect everything we do
in daily life and in our meditation practice.
The effect of formal meditation or mindfulness in daily life and in relationships with others.
We all have these faculties. In anything we do, they're there to some extent.
Getting to know them and developing them are an integral part to deepening our practice.
We refer to them as spiritual faculties when we develop them for the purpose of freedom of
being at peace with liberation.
The practice is often referred to as the middle path.
It's a path that befriends both from the extreme asceticism of deprivation to the other side
of complete sentiential indulgence. It encourages balance and moderation.
Just when we're meditating, you hear us say we aim for a posture that's upright and dignified
but completely relaxed. So just a really nice balance between the two, not the tension of
a military posture or the relaxation of the couch potato, but somewhere in the middle.
And it's similar when we consider these five faculties.
Mindfulness is seen as the neutral faculty, which is helpful at all times.
So the poly word for faith or confidence is sada. For some of us, the word faith has the
negative associations with blind belief. So for some people, confidence or trust might be more
come closer. But the word sada literally means to place your heart upon, which I really,
I love that. When we place our heart upon the moment, it's that we're wholeheartedly present,
fully present, bringing our heart to every moment. That's the essence of faith, of confidence.
Sharon Salzburg defines it as trusting our own deepest experience.
And this process of confidence, of developing a faith and confidence in ourselves
and in the practice is the same process we do in learning anything else. For instance,
when I was young, I watched people playing tennis and I thought, oh, that looks like fun.
And I decided to try it. So borrowed a racket, so enthusiastic. I got on the court with a friend,
the racket in hand. But within minutes, my enthusiasm completely waned as I found that I spent
most of my time chasing these balls. And it wasn't so much fun. I was exhausted. And I had
all sorts of doubt that I could learn to play. But a friend encouraged me and I tried again.
And the second time, you know, some of the serves got over the net. And I began to have a sense of,
oh, maybe I could learn to play. And as I played regularly, I saw that the more I played,
the better I got, and the more my confidence grew. And the process is similar in practice.
You know, maybe we meet someone as, you know, when I met one of my teachers, you know, who's far
along the path, and they deeply inspired me. And it's a wonderful feeling that we can have
with our initial inspiration and practice. Or maybe we read a book that deeply inspired us.
When I was 14, I read Siddhartha, and I was just so, so inspired by it. And they call this initial
inspiration a bright faith. It's a faith that gets us started. And that's what gets us beginning
the practice. But this beautiful bright faith is inherently unreliable. It might get us started,
but maybe the next day we meet someone else inspired us, but they teach a different method.
And so off we go in a different direction. But we get distracted by whatever influence
comes into our lives next, the last wind. We fall experienced having an initial enthusiasm for
something fade away. Sometimes we've joked about this tendency, you know, we've called,
I've heard people called nightstand Buddhists, they get inspired by book after book,
just keep reading books about practice and another book about practice, but never actually
doing it themselves. And the reason this bright faith fades away is because it's not based on
anything solid. It's not based on our own experience. But as we practice, a deeper level of confidence
can develop. And this is called verified faith, which means it's grounded in our own experience,
rather than coming from somewhere or something outside of ourselves.
Maybe we learned that the practice is helpful to us.
Maybe we noticed that breathing has calmed our anxiety or helped us be more patient.
Maybe we're less angry. And with each of these experiences of confidence
in both our ability to be mindful and value mindfulness grows.
With practice, we can develop a heartfelt confidence in the possibility of our own awakening,
of our own deep happiness, of peace. Deepening of this verified faith based on our own experience
doesn't mean that we don't allow ourselves to be regularly inspired by those we meet,
by books we read, or talks we listen to. When inspirations triggered from somewhere,
someone outside ourselves, you can get folded into our own experience and just supporting
our own faith and confidence. It can be a pretty strong change in the orientation of our lives
when we go from an intellectual appreciation of the path to a deep, heartfelt confidence that
says, yes, it's possible to awaken. It's possible for me to be free.
On one particular retreat, I was really delighted when my mind spent extended periods
of peace and calm that never experienced before. And it just strengthened my confidence in the
practice. And when my mind got restless again, there was just a deeper trust that, oh, that's
okay. I know it's possible. But at another point in my practice, my mind was filled with really
deep suffering. I touched something incredibly painful in myself. I think it was close to the
worst I remember feeling in my entire life. And it took all the courage I could summon to
actually stay present for the painful thoughts and feelings that were coming up.
But I kept reading it, showing up for it, knowing that it was incredibly difficult to be with it,
that to turn away would be a mistake. And when it was over, even though I was pretty exhausted,
I was surprised that instead of being discouraged, my confidence in the practice
felt stronger than ever. Confidence that could meet whatever I rose, whatever I had to deal with
in my life. So by being present, faith develops, regardless of whether our experience is wonderful
and enjoyable or difficult and challenging. The opposite of faith can be seen as doubt.
But there can be a doubt that's very positive. And the doubt that I very much appreciate.
It's the inner voice that says, I want to know for myself, not because you say so.
Not because somebody worthy says so. Not because everybody thinks it's true. Or because it's in a
book. We can put into practice and find out for ourselves from our own experience.
It's a practice we're doing leads to less greed, less anger, less hatred or fear. We can trust that.
If it leads to clarity, we feel less cut off and more connected. We can trust that.
Another form of healthy doubt can rise during meditation.
Probably one of the most free things for me was when I began to doubt that the negative thoughts
that arose about myself and about others were true. I had all sorts of ideas about myself that were
not friendly. And when I started questioning them, is that really true? It was pretty transformative
for me. I learned to not believe everything I think, to doubt that my thoughts were the absolute
authority. Excuse me a second. I need a little technical adjustment here.
Okay. A little techno bumps we get unexpectedly.
But there's another aspect of doubt that can hinder the practice. This is when we have a
doubt about the practice or about the method we're using or own abilities during meditation,
which keeps us thinking about it and not actually practicing. Maybe you've done that before.
I've spent plenty of time thinking about whether I'm doing it right and not paying any attention
to what's really going on, but just endlessly speculating on maybe I should be doing it this one,
maybe I should be doing it that way. And instead of really paying attention to what was right in
front of me. During meditation, this is the hindrance of doubt. As with all the hindrances,
when doubt arises, we're no longer applying ourselves. And there's nothing wrong with
doubting the practice with having questions. It's just not useful during meditation.
So we put it aside. And if it's important, something we need to explore, maybe we ask a
teacher after. But in the process of meditation, we devote ourselves to paying attention to the
present, however it is. And just an example was before I began practicing Vipassana,
I spent some time practicing Zen. And when I started practicing with my first Vipassana teacher,
I found it really confusing. What do I meditate with my eyes open or closed? How do I do this?
And I just kept going back and forth, back and forth, trying to figure out what was the right way
of practicing. And finally, after kind of ruining my practice, one of my teachers said to me,
it's not that either method is better, but they should stick to a single technique for at least
two years, and really get good at it first. It takes time to develop the skill. Then if you
want to try something else, then you can have a real comparison. It didn't mean that the doubt
disappeared suddenly. And I was like 100% all my answers, you know, very clear. But I just stopped
getting in the way. I just put it on hold.
So we cultivate confidence by doing things, by focusing on what we can do, not on what we
can't do at this time. We all have the experience of confidence, right? We learn to walk. You know,
we fell on our bums so many times. I think we fell on our bums more times when we were babies than,
you know, we lost track of our breath. And somehow we figured out how to do it and to walk
around confident in our ability to walk. In some of us as we get older, you know,
we may notice that our bodies aren't quite as reliable. Maybe we can't walk the way we used to.
You know, maybe it's slower or we need to use a cane. And confidence comes from meeting
what's here as best as we can. Okay, I can show up for this too. I can adapt to this and to this.
In my youth, I spent many years developing my yoga practice. I was really limber and strong.
And I really valued the, you know, I just, you know, I thought it was fantastic. I was, you know,
strong and balanced. And then I had an accident. And so much of what I was used to doing,
I couldn't do anymore. I just made everything worse. And I was really discouraged. And my friend
who was a yoga teacher, she said to me, don't stop, just focus on what you can do. And there wasn't
much. It allowed me to move, to connect with my body and to relax instead of being stuck and
resistance and loss. So focusing on what we can do. And forgive the pun, you know, I live with them.
Compulsive punner. And he says, this is confidence. So instead of confidence,
confidence, we can do. And we don't usually try to scale mouth with me if we've never climbed
a small hill. And so as we develop our confidence, it helps to have small little goals.
Maybe we managed to sit 30 minutes without moving. Or maybe we managed to follow three
cold consecutive breaths. Then maybe it's on point four or five. And gradually we develop
the confidence that we can be mindful of breathing. Maybe we can show up fully for an emotional storm.
You know, feel some pain that shows up and not shy away from it, not run away from it.
Not get lost in the story of it. Just allow it to come to us.
Maybe we can meet boredom with confidence.
What do you think of that? Meeting boredom with confidence. Okay, I can be with this feeling.
How about restlessness? Do we meet restlessness with confidence?
Without trying to fix them. Just to allow what's happening and be there for it.
When practice in life are difficult, we can develop a deep trust in this power of mindfulness.
That it's enough just to pay attention to whatever is in front of us in this body,
right here, just in this moment. It's simple. Just simple.
Now talk a little bit about wisdom. And as I mentioned, these two qualities of trust
and faith and confidence and wisdom or discernment, they balance each other.
Sometimes wisdom is a vague word for some people.
One general way of describing wisdom is the clarity of mind and understanding of the situation
that lets us distinguish what decisions are helpful and which decisions are unhelpful.
A little bit like I think most of us have heard of the story of Solomon. He was,
you considered very wise. I won't go into the story, but that's basically what he did. He made
choices because he saw the situation very clearly so he could make helpful choices.
So wisdom is this capacity in us to see a situation and choose wisely.
The poly word for wisdom is panna and or panya. It's also often translated as discernment
or understanding. So sometimes the word discernment points a little bit more to the
this or that, noticing helpful or unhelpful, to discern that difference between the two.
But when we talk about wisdom in this way, it refers to wisdom in relation to the path of freedom.
In Mahayana Buddhism, there's a powerful image of the bodhisattva,
Manjushri, holding the sort of wisdom in its right hand. And a bodhisattva is someone whose
life is dedicated to helping others become free. Manjushri is shown often sitting like a ferocious
lion and holding a flaming sword in his right hand. And in his left, there's often a manuscript of
the Dharma. So sitting on a lion represents how he has tamed his mind. And the sort of wisdom
is the sharp tool he uses to cut through ignorance, to cut through the entanglements of the mind.
I like that image. I like the image of the sharpness of clarity of mind that lets ignorance be cut
through. In inside practice, the tool we use to cut through these entanglements of the mind
is called investigation or investigative wisdom. It's this aspect of attention that sees simply
the differences between things. It's really fascinating. It's a very simple, simple tool.
It just sees this or that. And it's the capacity of the mind to see what's helpful,
it's not helpful. Wisdom is as simple as, my shoulders are up by my ears. That's not helpful.
And it's helpful to relax. So that tool should play often. But as we practice, it becomes much
more refined, that tool, and much more subtle. We use it to see the difference between a fantasy
and being aware of the present moment. You can easily tell the difference between those two,
right? And so we keep looking at our experience and noticing, ah, that's helpful. I'll go that way.
That's not helpful. I won't go that way. The difference between an attitude of kindness
or one that has the flavor of ill will. So those are all things that we can all do.
They're very simple. Wisdom is right there for us. The path of wisdom is right in front of us.
And so we just keep taking it towards the helpful, towards the helpful, towards the helpful.
This path is a forward-leading path.
If we keep making the choices that are helpful, that takes us forward into the path of happiness
and freedom. If we keep getting sidetracked by the fantasies and the stories about how we've
been wrong, the stories or how they're doing it wrong, it takes us away from this path of happiness.
So the teachings refer to three levels of wisdom. Each of these levels has an important place in
our spiritual life. And those three levels are wisdom acquired through learning,
wisdom acquired through reflection, and wisdom developed in meditation.
So the first kind of wisdom is wisdom acquired through learning. And that includes meditation
instructions or learning about the Eightfold Path, listening to dharma talk, studying, reading.
These can give us what we need so we can develop or continue to deepen our practice.
It's the cognitive side of wisdom. And these ideas and perspectives can be very helpful for helping us
to engage in practice. For instance, learning about karma can inspire us in practice.
Karma points out that our actions make a difference and have consequences.
For example, if you want to learn to draw a figure, we need the confidence that our training will make
a difference in our skill over time, otherwise we wouldn't persevere. I personally don't have
much artistic talent, so I was really surprised when I took a drawing class and saw my drawings
transform from something that looked like it was drawn by a four-year-old to something that
looked a little bit like a human body. So, you know, that's the love karma play, you know,
or neuroscience, same thing. It says that whatever we practice is what we develop. If we practice
meditation or concentration naturally strengthens, if we practice distracting ourselves with our
devices or habits of distraction get stronger. This is the love karma. This is the way the brain works.
So, the second kind of wisdom is wisdom acquired through reflection.
Now, reflection is essential to make many of the important decisions in our lives
for developing a deeper understanding of the world we live in.
You know, this is a reflection we might use when we want to
we want to move, we want to change jobs, we want to get into a new relationship,
all sorts of ways that we use reflection in daily life.
In terms of the practice, for instance, I was reflecting, well, what does non-harming really
mean to dedicate my life to non-harming? And I realized that first I needed to notice when
I was causing harm. So, I started to pay attention and, you know, just really keeping that question
close to my heart, you know, am I causing harm? And I started to make some choices in my life,
such as minimizing actions that harm the environment.
To be more honest, you know, those kind of choices came from reflecting on non-harming.
It was reflection that led me to prioritize Siddharma, to place in the center of my life,
of my priorities. Over the years, I regularly set time aside to reflect on connecting with my deepest
intentions and motivations and practice. Some form of the question, why do I practice?
Or what do I value? What's most important in my life? What's most important to me?
It can be a very rich practice to reflect, to think about these important themes in our lives.
We can give ourselves time for reflection and value the process,
maybe going for a walk or sitting in a garden or sitting on the sofa looking at the window.
But I think it's important to keep it separate from formal meditation practice.
It's useful to reflect mindfully, but not to use it as a distraction from meditation
when meditation feels challenging. Not to think about meditation instead of meditating.
The third kind of wisdom is the insight that comes from developing meditation.
And this is the kind of wisdom we can prioritize when we sit retreat, when we do formal practice.
When I first learned about the Four Noble Truths, the idea that clinging or grasping
causes suffering, it resonated with me intellectually. It just felt it was right,
that it wasn't real to me. It didn't start becoming real until I began to have the direct
experience of the relief one can feel when we release or grasping.
From little releases, like relaxing along with tension. I had tensions in my body
that are no longer there. And to the tension in the mind of long-held ideas.
One of the ideas that caused me tremendous suffering, and those who know me, you've heard
this before, but this idea that life should be fair. And life isn't fair. And they're constant
holding that, well, it should be fair, it should be fair. It just kept me angry all the time,
because it wasn't fair. You know, you've seen like the little child that says,
that's not fair, you know. And, you know, my mind was living there much of the time.
And these little releases, what they may seem like little releases, these little letting
go after a while, they have a deep cumulative transformative effect on us. And they prepare
the mind for deeper and even more profound releases. You know, thinking, you know,
Shirley did a beautiful job this afternoon, you know, leading us on mindfulness of thinking,
you know. And thinking can be useful in practice, you know. I mean, this is how we recognize we're
distracted when we bring the attention back to the breath. You know, there's often a thought there,
noticing if there's tension, if there's resistance, you know, these are helpful thoughts,
noticing we're relaxed. It can be very skillful to use thinking this way.
But when the mind gets quieter and quieter, mindfulness practice becomes more non-discursive
and non-discursive investigation of our experience. And when the mind gets that quiet,
and the thoughts begin to be really spaced apart quite a bit, and we stop being,
our experience stops being filtered through ideas and concepts without judgments and conclusions.
We're just here in the flow. And we begin to see the three universal characteristics of
experience. Because we see things coming and going, just everything arises and goes away.
We begin to see impermanence, but not as an idea. But we just see them see it happening right in
front of us in a very deep, felt way. We see the unsatisfactoriness that everything that comes and
goes, none of it's going to give us lasting happiness. Everything comes and goes.
And it becomes clear that nothing we experience can be seen as a stable self we can point to as me.
Am I that thought? Am I my pinky? Am I, you know, so there's nothing really stable that we can point
to as me, not our bodies, not our feelings, and not our thoughts. And as we meet these three aspects
directly, without any filters, wisdom grows. This is the deepest wisdom that we refer to in practice.
We can see the suffering that comes if we resist this constant change.
We can't stop everything from changing. So resistance is futile, like if any of you are
familiar with the term, we can't resist change. When we resist change, we suffer.
We can begin to know a happiness that's not dependent on our changing conditions.
We can seek our limitations or imperfections non-judgmentally
without believing that they define who we are. The full development of wisdom, of insight,
comes when the heart and mind don't cling to or resist anything.
When we can allow experience to arise and pass through just as it is.
And from this place of wisdom, we can make choices, wise choices in everything we do,
because we're not grabbing onto anything so we can see clearly.
We can learn to do what's needed, even in a challenging world,
without the mind and heart becoming contracted or tense.
This full development of wisdom comes from within ourselves, not from a teacher or from
anything we learn, but from the development of our mind.
So they said, faith and wisdom balance each other as do energy and concentration.
And we often hear the wise advice to learn to trust the deep inner voice within us.
And that's a really wonderful advice to really listen to that quiet voice deep within us,
but just as important is to not believe everything we think.
And that's a voice within us, not everything we think is true.
And so that's the balance between faith and wisdom, the trust that we have of that inner voice
and the wisdom that says, okay, no, no, let's see what's really wholesome and what isn't wholesome.
So that's the balance, that middle path between blind belief and wisdom.
Faith, there's something very comforting to blind faith.
You know, it's trusting with that understanding, trusting blindly.
And for some people, that's really seductive because it gives us a false sense of security.
So we need the wisdom, the penetrating wisdom to really see clearly so that the trust and
confidence doesn't come from the fantasy, but from really seeing life as it is.
It's so easy to see how sometimes people are inspired by a teacher
after hearing some wonderful wisdom, and then they put so much trust in the teacher
that they ignore ethical transgressions.
And we've all heard of all, you know, many of these scandals, you know, in spiritual groups.
And it comes from putting faith in someone else other than ourselves.
And sometimes you see the fanaticism, you know, of the fundamentalist side of religious movements,
where there's so much faith without too much questioning.
You know, so blind faith leads to this, you know, blind to not seeing clearly.
It's not a wholesome faith.
And wisdom without faith can lead to like a spiritual arrogance.
You know, the belief that our understanding is the best understanding, you know, or this is the only way.
So there's that trust of the heart, the quality of heart that comes from a real confidence and
inner confidence that's based on really both qualities in ourselves, and the wisdom, the ability
to see clearly that still has the heart in it, that isn't just some intellectual disconnected
piece, but really connected with that very deep connection of faith and trust.
Sometimes discernment without trust can lead to being too nitpicky,
tends to ignore intuition, or we might call leaps of faith, which is often how we grow in new ways
and discover new things.
Albert Einstein said, I never came upon any of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking.
I think that's amazing.
That's amazing.
You know, you think of like his discoveries of being so left-brained.
You know, so systematic.
You know, this is math, science, physics, you know, but never came from rational thinking.
So that combination, that balance between the two, the sort of wisdom is an image of strength,
and it takes confidence to wield a sword.
Sometimes in meditation, we may emphasize the receptive aspects of attention, opening to what
is just as it is.
But when investigative wisdom is applied, it balances the receptive, calm aspect of mind,
and brings a strong presence to the moment.
It allows us to engage in the moment to be full.
Fully there.
So it's not just receptive.
It's engaged.
It's that middle path, neither doing or being completely passive.
It's just that full engagement with the moment, being tranquil and alert.
Well, we're fully here now.
There's a sense of vitality in us.
I like to call that balance as joyful tranquility.
So really, to me, it brings the quality of play, the joyful tranquility.
It takes away some of the seriousness.
You know, sometimes we get too serious in practice.
And, you know, enlightenment, it's a, you know, it's about lightening up.
And so I like to include that quality in nurture, that lightness that comes with that.
So I'd like to end with a poem by Ashon Cha.
Peace is to be found within oneself in the same place as agitation and suffering.
It's not found in a forest or on a hilltop, nor is it given by a teacher.
Where you experience suffering, you can also find freedom from suffering.
Trying to run away from suffering is actually to run towards it.
So let's share a minute of silence.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
