So welcome, welcome everybody.
What a delight to be practicing and studying together
with all of you and with my good friends here.
For those of you who don't know me, I'm Diana
and the four of us have been teaching together,
I don't know how many classes we've done,
more than a dozen or maybe around a dozen classes together.
And what a delight it is to some of my favorite things
to be poking around in the suit does
and hanging around with beautiful people.
And maybe with that, I'll pass it on to Ying.
Yeah, I'll just add my welcome voice as well.
So good to see many faces that we've seen before
and some of the new ones joining.
So such a delight to start to the day
for me in the morning here.
Yeah, welcome.
Hopefully we'll have fun in this class.
I'll pick up from where Ying leaves off just,
I can't begin one of these classes
without a pretty large size smile.
It really is, we do have a good time, we do have fun.
And although that may seem sort of counterintuitive
when combining study with anything,
the four of us have found, in fact,
this began as conversations among the four of us
about bringing the study of the Buddhist discourses
into our practices in a live, awake way.
And we loved it so much, we wanted to share it with others.
So appreciate you joining us in this exploration.
Kim.
Yeah, I would also like to add my welcome to all of you.
And this was a particularly interesting course
for us to talk about, think about design
because we knew that these suttas
that we're going to be looking at,
these two are clearly related.
And yet there are differences
that start to emerge between them as we look at them.
We wrangled a bit on the title.
And finally, when it was suggested
getting to the heart of practice,
it just settled, it's like, yes, that's it.
And that's a lot of what we're aiming for here.
So what's the heart?
What's the essence that we can get to?
So as usual, I have the joy of saying a bit
about the group that's joining us.
We are from nine countries and 17 US states
that I could count.
We didn't manage to ask on this registration form
your motivations for joining or interests
or things like that.
And those of you who have seen that
on multiple of our other forums,
maybe you were glad for that.
I'm not sure.
But I thought I would take the opportunity
to just kind of ask a couple of questions
with maybe a show of hands.
So first of all, how many of you have done
one of our study and practice classes before?
Who has done it before?
Okay, so we see some hands,
but that means we also have people,
how many people have not done this before?
Look at that, we have some new ones.
Yay, welcome to everyone.
We are delighted both to be sharing this with old friends
and to introduce these kinds of classes to new people.
And now how many of you feel that study is already
at this point an important part of your practice?
You had something that you incorporate.
Yeah, great, look at that, almost everyone.
And yet, so that may give some encouragement
to those of you who didn't feel
like you could raise your hand there.
Maybe you'll find an inspiration
to fold the sin in some way.
So welcome to everyone.
Welcome to all of you who are joining for various reasons,
whether it's for the interest in these particular suttas,
whether it's to learn more about the suttas,
whether it's to learn how to apply what this is
in your life, how these teachings really apply.
Maybe you just like to do this with a group
and you're into the community.
So all of those and more, yeah, so with that,
maybe we'll go ahead and get started.
David can say a bit of an overview to kick us off.
Yeah, sometimes at the beginning of these classes,
we like to say something about our aims
or objectives for the classes.
And these are loosely held or lightly held.
Those sometimes shift as we go, as we explore together
in a pretty alive way, these discourses.
We don't have our minds made up about how they fit
into all of our practices, you know?
But in this particular exploration of these two suttas,
two suttas from the Majama Nakaya 29 and 107,
we wanted particularly to sort of,
I guess our overarching aim may be to
appreciate the fullness of the path
that is outlined in the suttas.
It's not a simple thing.
It's not just about mindfulness.
It's not just about the meditation practice
or establishing good, virtuous conduct.
In this gradual training, a gradual training
that we've explored in a previous class
and gradual training you may have met elsewhere,
at various points, challenges can arise,
challenges do arise.
And the suttas themselves, these two and others,
give us some suggestions about how to meet
the kinds of challenges that come up probably
in most of our practices at one time or another.
And we characterize these two in this class
as veering off the path and falling short
of the aims of the path.
And we'll explore them by talking about the,
or looking at them through the similes of the heartwood,
the search for the heartwood,
and the following instructions from one location to another.
And these suttas give us some tools for recognizing
and gently assessing our progress on the path
or how the extent to which we're close to the path
and assuring ourselves that we're practicing
in ways that are onward leading,
that keep us moving toward the goal of liberation
or being more awake in the world.
So those are aims both general and specific,
general then specific,
and to move back out to the general again.
Maybe one of our most important overarching aims
is just to encourage us all to keep practicing.
These discourses really recognize that
for the vast majority of us, the path isn't linear,
it doesn't unfold easily from point A to point B.
And in very specific ways, suggest how we might meet,
meet these challenges in our practice.
So there are some of our overarching aims.
We'll see as we go forward,
whether we add additional objectives,
but that's where we start.
Ying.
Yeah, thank you, David.
Can you all hear me okay?
Okay, all right.
So I'm going to start off with the first sutra
that uses the simile of the heartwood.
I was very delighted to reading this sutra
because I know very little about a heartwood.
And reading this sutra,
I really kind of did a little research about the heartwood
and really kind of enlivened this teaching for me.
And so I thought maybe what I would do
is to show you some pictures about the tree anatomy
and as we kind of look at the pictures of the trees
and we'll talk a little bit about
how in this teaching using the simile of the heartwood,
that Buddha pointed out various ways
that one may stop short of the final go,
kind of like what David was pointing out for short.
Because maybe we got caught,
maybe we ran into difficulties
and in various ways that this may happen.
And the sutra encourages us, as David was saying,
keep practicing, that's kind of the underlying message.
But it's interesting to kind of look at
some of the points that the Buddha mentioned
in terms of where people could get caught.
And what maybe we find in different ways
that we get caught in our own practice
and it's worthwhile for us to reflect and understand this.
So let me see if I could share a screen here.
So, well, the sutra started out
by offering the simile of someone who's
interested in going to the forest to find a heartwood.
And this is like us who may run into difficulties
in our life and looking for ways to end stress
or find freedom in our heart and mind.
And the heartwood is the innermost part
of the tree trunk, usually.
And in order to find a heartwood,
the first thing is you have to find the tree
that has the heartwood.
So not all trees has heartwood.
In the sutta and the Buddha spoke about
people heard that the Buddha offers teachings
that has the potential of ending dukkha.
So they join the monastic sangha.
They come to meet the Buddha
and they wanted to join the monastic sangha.
And that's the first step.
And so similarly here, one would have to first
find the tree that has the heartwood.
And so, for example, pine trees, ash trees,
those are the trees that has heartwood.
And so maybe for us, then we come to sati center,
insight meditation center, where the teachings
are offered and that has a potential
to allow this end goal to be fulfilled.
And so that's the first step.
Now, once we find the heartwood,
the next step that is highlighted
in this gradual training based on the sutta
is that when them begin,
I'm very as a ways to engage with the practice in some ways.
And the assembly is used to kind of in this outside in way.
And so the outermost part of the tree
is twigs and leaves.
They're quite fragile and they're very easy to follow apart.
The heartwood instead is something that is very durable
and strong and they're usually used to make houses,
long lasting furniture, for example.
And this similarly spoke about,
well, some people come to the tree that has heartwood,
but they end up only grabbing some twigs and leaves.
And they said, that's it, I'm done, this is the heartwood.
And you can imagine, use this to build a house,
probably won't last much.
And this analogy is as if for people
who are joining the monastic sangha,
especially if you think about joining a famous sangha,
like what the Buddha led,
maybe they have some fame or they have no trouble
getting alms food, their belly is full,
they are happy with just that much.
And they are not engaging in any form of a practice.
And this way it is considered as stopping short.
And we can think of modern day Palau in this way as well.
And so for example, we may read a few books
and maybe we had read a lot of books,
but we don't really put in our effort in practicing it
to offer possibilities of shifting and changing
in the embodied way, in our heart and mind.
And so maybe some people may get,
may feel that we accumulated a lot of information
based on the book reading.
And so we can think of it as a way of thinking
but we haven't really practiced with the way.
And this is more or less staying at this kind of chat GPT
level, so we can have a lot of information spitting out
but doesn't really change us in any way.
So that's the first step in this gradual training.
It goes from outside in and for some people
and they're not satisfied with just the outer layer.
And they began to do some form of a practice.
And in this tree anatomy, you see there are outer layer
of outer barks and there is inner barks.
And there's still kind of outside of the tree trunks
and they're stronger than the leaves and twigs
but they won't be possible to be used
to build something long lasting.
And this analogy of outer and inner barks in the sutta
is that some people may start practicing in some way
by maybe following the monastic rules.
And the sutta used the word accomplished in virtual.
Maybe they think, oh, you know, I'm not no longer
breaking any monastic code.
And they're happy with that
but they haven't really turned inward.
So they turned inward into the inner trunk or inner bark,
the heart of our practice.
And they can stop short by simply hovering in that level
and not keep going.
We can probably see sometimes we may end up
doing this ourselves.
You know, we think that, you know, we're good people, right?
You know, quite ethical and maybe that's good enough.
But without looking inward carefully,
there can be ways that we get caught
and that leads to suffering that we don't quite notice.
We don't quite recognize.
So if we keep going in the sutta,
it is spoke about some people may keep going
and knowing that the outer barks are not sufficient
and they'll look at,
they'll grab the inner barks.
Well, that takes a little more work, right?
I think I kind of have to shed the outer layers
and get to the inner bark.
And this is like one began to cultivate samadhi.
There is the inner cultivation that's going on.
And some people may stop short right there.
You know, oh, you know, I'm able to sit quite well
you know, I'm able to sit quietly for half an hour.
That's good enough and that's pretty good
and offers me some ease, some happiness.
At the moment you get out of the meditation,
you know, going about, you know, driving on the highway
and somebody cut the line immediately,
getting angry and the dukkha comes again.
And so if we just stopping at this,
this will be called as a stopping short.
It can go even further inward and there's a tree.
So Kim took this photo on a hiking trail.
So can see that there's this inner trunk
that's called sapwood or softwood.
They're more moist and they look very much similar
to the inside of the trunk.
In fact, for this picture, I can't even tell
exactly where the boundaries of a hardwood is
versus the softwood.
But the softwood and sapwood,
they are prone to insects, bugs
and they're easy to rotten when there's moisture
or when there's a rain.
So they're certainly more long lasting than the other parts.
And this is like some people may have gained
a certain knowledge, a certain insights in the practice
and not stopping short like previously,
but they haven't finished.
They have not completed the training.
If they're stopping short, the house may still rotten.
And so the hardwood, which is the inner most part
of the tree trunk is that is durable, strong
and resistant to decay.
This is like the training when it really matures.
It offers a long lasting wellbeing.
And so I wanted to maybe summarize by saying
what this Sutta is pointing to is not so much
about when we stop, but rather we keep practicing.
In the way the practice does not stop.
At some point, the practice because of become our nature.
In a way we're kind of becoming hardwood.
And so thank you.
And so that's what I will say for now.
I'm going to.
Thank you Ying.
Really wonderful.
Really great to see those images.
Yeah, so now we'd like to do sort of a brief
small group exploration.
We're setting this up carefully.
Ying has, instead of diving right into the Sutta
and its passages, we've sort of taken a visual look
at what this simile that dominates this Sutta
looks like, what it means.
And maybe for those of us who've,
and that's probably most of us have seen twigs
and leaves, seen branches, seen bark,
seen trees, possibly even into the inner core.
We may have never thought of it quite this way.
Perhaps we're a little less intimate with trees
and their characteristics than the Buddha
and his followers were.
And we'd like to sort of ask a couple of questions
in the breakout room that will, in a sense,
put us in touch with that hardwood
in ways that we can feel.
Looking to why we began practicing
and what keeps us practicing.
And with the understanding that these questions
point two directions, they sort of point inward
to the hardwood, you might say, of our practice,
to the heart of our practice.
And at the same time, they're onward leading.
They point forward.
They help us motivate us and maybe keep us moving
in search of the hardwood and not stopping
at twigs and leaves, not stopping at the outer bark
or even that inner,
what lies within the first layer of bark,
but keeps us focused on the goal of practice.
So I trust that Diana has set up the groups.
Let me give you two specific questions.
We're gonna be in groups for about 12 minutes.
And we can, we suggest maybe kind of going around
in a spiral fashion, each person just contributing
one thought that comes up making this sort of practice.
Making this sort of a listening exercise
as much as one where we're sharing our own practice.
And perhaps as each person adds and the circle goes around,
there will be some additional things that come up
for each individual and for the small group.
So the two questions, take them up maybe in order,
we'll maybe drop the second one all the way through.
And possibly one of my colleagues
is entering them in the chat are simply,
why did you start practicing?
What brought you to practice?
Why did you start?
What was that early motivation?
And then what keeps you practicing?
So those two questions, why did you start practicing?
What keeps you practicing?
Are ways to explore in an early way,
kind of touch in with a heartwood of practice.
So Diana, when you're ready, send us off into groups.
Enjoy.
Any questions emerging?
We'd love to get a sense of how this is landing for you
and possibly get a sense of,
yeah, why you started practicing,
what keeps you going in your search for,
in your search for the heartwood of the practice.
Joni.
Hi, thank you.
I'll tell all the teachers for being here.
I'm loving this.
The thinking about my beginning of my practice,
I've been in recovery for 33 years
and that was the beginning,
when I began going to Spirit Rock
with the questions of what's this all about
and looking deeper.
And I'm realizing, I come from a family of lumberjacks,
a history of people cutting down trees
and sawing them up for various reasons, building houses.
And part of that was the teaching that for every tree
you take, you plant three in its place,
hoping that at least one of them will take root.
And I've always treasured that visible.
Part of the path that I'm seeing
is I feel like I'm one of those beetles
that bores into the bark
and then realizes there's more
and bores into that and realizes there's more.
And I just kind of, the more I bore into this,
the more I realized there's more and there's more.
And it's so rich and it encourages me to keep pouring through
to find out what's more, what's more.
How can I apply this to my life?
And it becomes the practice.
It becomes the continuing boring
that opening up of the new information, the new sapwood.
And hopefully eventually I'll get to the heartwood.
And though I see glimpses of it, it's very exciting.
It's very exciting to actually experience it
and have it open up as I bore into this.
So thank you so much, Ying, for the visual.
It helped me open up to what was my story.
And I wasn't really realizing it
until we started talking and I thought, thank you.
Thank you so much, Joni.
What a wonderful perspective.
And an expansion of the metaphor.
It's actually really quite nice to have someone here
who is of lumberjacks, you know,
comes from that experience.
And that metaphor of boring down deeper is so useful,
particularly if we imagine you're not, you know,
a destructive species of beetle,
but just a beetle in search of heartwood.
But that, yeah, finding the next depth, the next layer
and knowing that there's a center,
that there's, you know, that there's heartwood.
So very lovely.
Maybe I'll add on to it, Joni, while you were speaking,
you said you were a beetle
and then I started to think, oh,
and maybe sometimes we're like woodpeckers
that we're making nests, we're making homes
and these little holes, right?
Also can be used by other creatures
that get used when the woodpeckers leave.
And so like there's a whole,
I mean, there's so many different ways
in which we can interact with trees, quote unquote, practice
and different, it's not just us, I wanted to say, right?
It's just a whole number of organisms.
I don't know what word to use, like creatures,
just this generic word.
So thank you, Joni.
And I would just say, I see,
I see handle your hand up, give me one second.
I just reflecting on what Diana says.
The metaphors we make our own,
these similes are there for us to practice with.
They're suggested in the suttas
because they invite us in.
They invite the imagination in.
They create a role for imagination.
And so the suttas are very rich in similes
and sometimes we pass right over them,
but I love this opportunity to dig in deep
like Joni's beetle.
So yeah, a handle, I saw your hand.
That's a legitimate way to raise it.
If you're off, you might also use your zoom hand,
anybody else, just because we might not see it,
but go ahead.
Yeah, really, just as someone
who's identified with trees,
you know, this is the leaves and this is the bark.
There's a, and it's known in some somatic modalities
is the center line, is the heartwood.
Yeah, nice.
And that relates to it, to also an effortlessness
of sensing the heartwood being,
about listening and sensitivity, you know?
It's not, it's not, and yeah,
the sap flows for us at, you know, around 98.6 degrees.
So it's so visceral, it's so much about being alive.
Nice, thank you for that.
And again, I see Kim on muting, but I'll say first,
just yeah, another way to make use of this wonderful metaphor
to see ourselves as the tree and recognize in the simile,
some of our own way of being in the world,
perhaps there's ways we're not that different from trees,
and certainly we're linked with trees as other beings.
So quite lovely, Kim, yeah.
Oh yeah, I just wanted to say what a beautiful analogy
and we'll be doing a meditation later
that may have a few echoes of what you said, thank you.
Yeah, any other questions, reflections,
those are very lovely and kind of get us into the simile
in a couple of different ways and suggest
that there's a lot of different ways
for each of us, perhaps another way
to explore the simile.
Eileen.
Good morning, everyone.
It's making me aware of the fact
that my picture in the background is a tree
that I kind of tree here that I love very much.
Beautiful tree that has, some people call it flame tree,
we call it Ohai'ula, it's a tree that has pretty hard bark.
So on the inside, but it's also the question
why we continue is really what stuck with me
and why I feel that I continue is most largely curiosity.
I wanna know what the death list is.
I wanna know what is that doesn't arise and pass
that doesn't, yeah, that basically what is it
that doesn't arise and pass?
And I wanna know what that is
and I'm not gonna stop until I find out what that is.
I don't have any idea what it is,
but that's what I wanna know.
So thank you very much for this opportunity.
Thank you, Eileen, for that question or that comment.
Yeah, you point out the, in a way,
how lovely it is to let curiosity be something
that keeps us from stopping short, right?
Wanting to just wanting to know more
and maybe that is part of the Beatles search for Heartwood
or the way we stand in our own practice.
But yeah, the curiosity that keeps us moving forward
is that it can be for many of us a way of not stopping short.
Ying, I see you on me.
Yeah, I really celebrate that.
I also wanted to say that the curiosity is also a form
of being humble that we don't know yet.
You know, in the Sutta, the folks who grabbed the tricks
and leaves and they left the Sutta's language used
that they departed, imagine, thinking, this is it.
I thought they knew.
So this being curious, being humble and keep going
and really it's very important on this path.
Yeah, yeah.
I think we have time for one more question
or reflection if there is one.
And let's just see if another hand pops up.
There we go, yeah, we're all.
Yeah, I have a question, and I don't know
if that's something that we'll discuss later.
I'm understanding the Sutta is presuming that,
you know, when we grab the, let's say, the quigs and whatnot,
we are aware that that's what we're doing and kind of,
but we're not aware that there is more to it.
I wonder if sometimes, you know, we stop without being aware
that, oh, we stopped or we're not.
Look, how do I even know whether I'm going on
or I stopped?
Who is there to tell me that?
Or is it a sense that I'm supposed to be feeling?
Yeah, those are great questions.
And Diane is going to answer them in just a minute.
Diane is going to talk in just a minute,
and she'll probably address some of them.
But you point out that there's a lot of different ways
that we can be variously unaware and aware
of what we're doing.
Maybe we feel satisfied with twigs and leaves
because it's enough or we feel for the moment that it's enough
or we don't have Eileen's curiosity moving us forward.
Or perhaps we're totally unaware
that that's what we're doing.
And as Ying pointed out in her visual,
it's only when we go to try to build a boat or a house
or something out of twigs and leaves that we go,
oh, this isn't at all.
There's more.
Or this isn't sufficient for the practice
to find its full expression for me.
So very nice that you discriminate and distinguish
between at least three, if I heard them correctly,
ways and possibly more ways in which we might stop short.
So let me all kind of bring it to a close there
and pass it to Diana, who's going to get into some of these,
some of the more details about why we might stop short
and what we might be thinking when we do so.
Thank you.
Thank you, Akbar, all just for setting things up.
Really nice for me to talk about this now.
So this question, well, what stops us?
What keeps us from going further?
And we can look at some of what's in the suite
as maybe for some guidance or for some ideas.
And if you'll allow me, I interpreted
some of what we read there and some ways in which we could
use as some clues or suggestions or support
as ways to go forward.
So I'll read a little bit from the beginning of Modema 29.
Probably some of you read this suit.
I thought, oh my goodness, there's a lot of repetition in here.
And maybe some of you didn't even read it at all.
And that's perfectly fine.
We'll work with that here.
But I'm going to start here that in the second section,
the Buddha is giving instructions.
And I'm doing a Bikusu Jatos translation.
And he says, mendicants.
So monastics, his followers, take the case of a gentleman
who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.
So this is somebody who is ordained to go from lay life
to homelessness means to ordain.
Gone forth from the lay life to homelessness thinking,
I'm swamped by rebirth, old age, and death,
by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
I'm swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.
So it's the idea that here's somebody who has a lot of suffering,
not described in a number of different ways.
And this is why that they have started practice.
For me, it's a little bit interesting
that a Bikubodi in his translation,
he's using the expression, I am a victim of birth, aging,
and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.
So just this idea like feeling overwhelmed.
So that might be a way in which we
are stopping in the practice is
because we're feeling overwhelmed.
And we're feeling like, OK, we just
don't have the capacity to do more.
Or maybe because we're overwhelmed,
we're not seeing clearly, quote unquote,
that we are thinking like, OK, these twigs and leaves,
they're, it's from a tree, it must be hardwood.
Or maybe we feel like, oh, it's too much work
to get to that with I'm feeling overwhelmed.
I can't do more.
These twigs and leaves are going to have to work.
And for me, I was thinking about taking the Buddha's metaphor
and turning it into like a contemporary one.
And I was thinking like, well, maybe it's
like when you go to one of those big box stores
or maybe one of those home improvement big box store
and you have this idea, OK, if I get this,
it'll make something in my kitchen work better.
But then you go to the store and it's not so easy to find
what you need.
And then you realize it's way up on one of those top shelves.
And you're like, oh, my gosh, and now I have to find somebody
to get it.
And I can't find anybody to get it.
And OK, I'll just get this.
This is easier.
And you go home with something else,
but just because you were feeling like overwhelmed
or like you didn't have quite the capacity.
So sometimes we might use this expression as like having doubt,
having doubt in our capacity.
But something with this is not recognizing
that our capacity increases with practice.
So we just feel like, OK, the version that I am today,
we're thinking is the same version that
has to get the heartwood, but not recognizing
that every time we practice our capacity is growing
and maybe not really gaining the appreciation that the version
that's going to get the heartwood, the version of ourselves
that's going to get the heartwood is not the same version
of ourselves right now.
So then the Sutta continues.
So the Buddha is describing again this person
who has gone forth.
When they've gone forth, that means when they've ordained,
they generate possessions, honor, and popularity.
And they're happy with that.
They've got all they wished for and they glorify themselves
and put others down because of that.
I'm the one with possessions, honor, and popularity.
These other mendicants, they're obscure and insignificant.
So there's a way in which one way, there's probably a few ways,
but one way we might interpret this
and why we stopped going further is maybe we're doing
on something like what's called maybe spiritual bypassing.
Like we're using this practice that is supposed
to help us work with difficulties as a way
to avoid working with the difficulties in our life.
Difficulties also maybe are this unfinished business
of the heart and of this expression
that Jack Cormfield calls like this, recognize
that this unfinished business.
So we're doing something that makes us feel better
in the short term and neglecting things
that will help us to gain the capacity
and to find the heartwood.
So this putting others down, poofing ourselves up.
These are ways that we might like use spiritual practices
like to cling to these views and ideas instead
of doing the hard work of looking at ourselves
or learning to calm the mind
or to understand ourselves or something like this.
So maybe this way of lauding ourselves
and disparaging others.
Maybe it's a way of the spiritual bypassing.
We're holding on to this
so that we just make ourselves feel good
and maybe even we think look good
so that we don't have to do any more work.
We don't have to do the dirty, messy, difficult work
of getting towards the heartland.
So then Nasuta continues.
So let's start.
I'm the one with possessions, honor and popularity.
These other mendicants are obscure and significant.
And so they become indulgent and fall into negligence.
And being negligent, they live in suffering.
So maybe there's a way in which we could interpret this
as there's getting distracted or forgetting.
This becoming indulgent and falling into negligence
is another way we might even say getting intoxicated.
That's how Bhikkhu Bodhi translates this.
So we're just getting distracted by what's happening.
Maybe we have what we've touched into
or discovered with practice
is so much better than what we've had before.
I mean, there's certain amount of calm that we've had before.
Makes me feel like, okay, this is so much better than what I had.
I'm just going to stay here.
Or maybe we found some beautiful states of mind,
some meditative states that bring,
they just naturally bring some little bit of happiness
or gladness or joy or delight with them.
I feel like, okay, that's good enough.
I'm just going to stay with that.
So we're kind of like getting distracted
or thinking that that's good enough.
Or maybe it's enough to forget the reason
why we came to practice.
And for me, I was thinking like, okay, well,
what would be a modern day kind of like contemporary analogy,
like reinterpreting the Buddha's analogy
of being happy with twigs and weeks
and twigs and leads and not going to the hardwood?
I thought to me, it's like, well,
maybe it's like going to the grocery store
and you're looking for milk and pasta
and you come home with milk and crackers
and sauerkraut and a candy bar.
Like whatever was on sale and had these big sides
and look, this is great.
You know, when we like, oh, okay, I'll get this
and I'm in a hurry.
So I'm going to go home and then or just pick this up
and realize when we get home,
oh yeah, I got part of what I needed,
but not realizing that I didn't get everything
that I needed.
And when we go to the grocery store,
the grocery store is not designed to make it as easy
as possible for us to get exactly what we want, right?
They're putting the things,
they put things on the end of the aisles
or have big signs or sales or this kind of stuff
to try to distract us or try to have us forget what we want,
but instead to do or buy what they want us to buy.
So we're so often having this pressures
to do something else.
So maybe we might think of it as a way
of getting intoxicated.
You know, not literally, maybe literally,
but this way of getting like, oh, okay, this is great.
This sauerkraut's on sale
and I heard that I should eat fermented things.
So I'm just going to get this,
buying that instead of what we need.
So, but we might also say that this is kind of like a losing
sight with what brought us to the practice to begin with.
Kind of like allowing ourselves to be disconnected
or distracted from that.
We might even say it's a way in which we hear
so many Dharma teachings go to so many classes,
read so many sutras that we get disconnected
from the foundational teachings and thinking
that more of these obscure ones
or these detailed ones are really what's important
and they seem easier or funner or something like this.
And I say this right as a Dharma teacher
and somebody who does a lot of teaching and Sutra study,
but it can, we can fall into this trap of thinking like,
okay, just more information is what's needed
and losing sight of some of these foundational teachings.
There is suffering.
There was a cause of suffering.
There's a ending of suffering
and there's a path leading to the ending of suffering.
We might lose touch with those types of things.
So getting distracted or forgetting might be
one of the reasons that we lose or we stop short.
And then, and then maybe there's this one we could say
that we've overestimated our practice.
Maybe we have touched into something that we,
that is noteworthy for us.
It may be different and new than what we've experienced before.
We're thinking like, oh, okay, this is it.
This, or we might think that we have some big attainment
or experience that's not quite the whole way,
but because it's so different than what we've experienced before,
we think it is the whole way.
In this Sutta, it's described as the,
the Buddha is describing somebody who takes the branches and leaves
instead of the heartwood.
He says, passing over the heartwood, softwood, bark and shoots,
he cuts off the branches and leaves and departs,
imagining they are heartwood.
So we're thinking that this is what we're looking for,
but not realizing that they're branches and leaves.
So this way that we might overestimate where we are.
And one thing that I will say that I say this from my experience,
both in my role as a practitioner and in my role as a Dharma teacher,
there's an odd thing about this path of practice.
And we're using this language, path, which suggests like a linear
and a beginning and an end.
There's other language we could use,
but for this course, we're going to do with this idea of a path.
An interesting thing about this path is pretty much guaranteed.
Any assessment you have of where you are in the path is wrong.
It's not until later you realize like, oh, that's what was happening.
I thought it was this, but you can't,
you don't really understand where you are until you're in a different place.
So it's a curious thing that happened.
So just like hold any of these ideas of where you are on the path just lightly.
I just want to like throw that out there.
So maybe I'll talk a little bit now just about this encouragement to continue on this path,
to not stop.
We have there's perfectly legitimate reasons why we might stop.
Things about our own personal life.
Things about just in the booting and recognize these things about doubt or not having equanimity,
you know, feeling or having feeling like grabbing or clinging to lots of things.
So much of the teachings are about this.
But I want to point out something that when the four of us were planning and talking about this talk,
it's so much fun for us because we like brainstorm ideas and there's something.
I don't remember which one of us said this, but it got captured in our notes.
Again, if we use this idea that this is a path,
then it's kind of like you go from one end to the other.
And I do want us to hold this lightly.
But to keep in that idea at each phase of the path, there's a hint of the next phase.
It's not like we go step one, completely stop, then go to step two, completely stop.
There's three and completely stop.
It's like, oh, there's like maybe we have this.
Sometimes I use the language of there's a hint or maybe like the scent,
the fragrance of what's coming next before we've completely embodied it or experienced it.
Or maybe we just have this intuitive sense.
Oh, yeah, there's, I can feel like there's something deeper available.
I can feel like there's some more collectiveness or some more well-being.
I can feel like there's some more settledness available.
There's something that makes me feel like that.
And even often we don't put this into words and we don't use these sentences to ourselves.
But part of this path is learning to hear or smell the next step.
And maybe a little bit of our intuition or something like this.
So I'm just offering this as kind of like an encouragement to continue.
And then I'll just in that brief minute that I had here.
I'll just say that after going through all these different steps in the sutta,
it ends with this idea that we can achieve irreversible liberation and unshakable freedom of heart.
Irreversible, unshakable.
These are the words that are being used.
And these words are not always used as the end of the path.
But I think they're being used here.
This is my interpretation.
Just to highlight the difference from, oh, yeah.
Okay, we've had an ending maybe of a little bit of suffering.
We might think it's the end.
But there's a way when some there's this irreversible or unshakable.
There's a way in which we can recognize, oh, yeah.
Now I just can see that this is no longer possible for me to think that stealing things is a good idea.
It's no longer possible for me to think that harming others is fine.
Doesn't matter, for example.
So just to recognize that there is this way in which there's this irreversibility and unshakability.
And I'd like to suggest that we can sense that.
Maybe a modern day analogy I'll use for that is like when we learn to read.
At first, it's just gobbledygook on the page, right?
At these marks on a page that don't make any sense at all.
And then we learn the letters.
And then we learn that the letters make words and then we learn the words make sentences.
And never again will you be able to look at something written down and not being able to read it once you've learned how to read it.
And you have that sense.
Oh, yeah, this is irreversible, barring some mental dysfunction.
And I know that I will always be able to read this.
Okay, so with that, I'll pass it off to Kim.
Thank you. So perhaps we have a sense of this Sutta and the idea of the art would and the engagement with the different steps so that we keep moving along from a couple of different angles at this point.
We've heard about it.
We've seen pictures.
We've talked with people.
So now we're going to try a meditation together.
So please find a posture or a position where you'll can sit for, I don't know, 15 minutes or so.
Allow yourself to settle in.
Perhaps closing the eyes if that's comfortable for you to bring the attention or inward.
Maybe consciously balancing the body so leaning back slightly sometimes we lean forward into the screen so making sure that you're actually in an upright and balanced position.
Maybe feeling into the places of contact to your seat against the cushion or the chair or maybe you're lying down and sensing what is supporting you.
Just softening into that and allowing yourself to be supported while also maintaining an upright or straight relaxed posture.
Perhaps consciously softening the eyes and the eye sockets. Letting them expand rather than be focused tight.
Letting the shoulders soften, drop a bit, bringing some ease down through the chest and the belly.
Perhaps on the outbreath releasing any obvious unmade attention and softening the arms and the legs.
We may notice in the mind that there are some thoughts or emotions perhaps kind of fluttering in the breeze like leaves.
We can sense that these surface disturbances are just the activity of the daily life mind.
We can direct a bit more energy and attention to our mindfulness. Letting go of our engagement with the fluttery thoughts.
As we do so we connect into the posture more clearly.
We can have a global sense of the body in the sitting posture.
Perhaps we have a general sense of the surface of the body.
We may feel the skin itself or the heat so we broadly know the shape.
We can incline toward settling, keeping the body somewhat still.
As the body comes to rest, often the breathing is the clearest sensation connecting now with the sensations of the in and out breathing.
Breath draws into the body, into the interior.
On the outbreath there's a softening, easing, relaxing, if we allow it.
Using the gentle in and out breathing, the rhythmic stability of that to also stabilize the mind further.
Sensing the mindfulness, simple awareness of the present moment.
For now there's nothing else to do.
There's nowhere to go.
Just sitting.
Lowing the tissues of the body to soften further, releasing the more subtle forms of tension that we may carry in the chest or the arms, the back.
And we sense that the breath is connected to a subtler energy of the body.
Breath is not only in the lungs, is it?
It's as if it comes in as energy that can flow down into the belly.
Maybe the breath even flows into the arms and legs and head.
That vitality is spread throughout the body.
Letting go of our anatomical sense of the body, touching into this simpler flow of energy.
Sensing the deep rest available when the mind and the body harmonize.
Sensing that the breath isn't something we need to do.
It just arrives.
We allow the in-breath.
We release the out-breath.
There's a part of the mind that is knowing all of this.
The awareness, the knowing that can hold.
Subtle energy, body sensations, even the fluttery thoughts and emotions all are known by this capacity for awareness.
Letting go of the doing of meditation to rest in this fullness of body and mind and awareness.
The way a tree stands in its wholeness, its roots, its trunk, its twigs and leaves, softwood.
Softwood.
Softwood.
There is so much to this human life.
So many layers.
Keep going, letting go of our fixation with any given one to discover more.
Journey inward to the very heart of practice.

Thank you, Kim, for this sweet meditation.
So now by now this class I have offered several different modalities of learning, practicing with the sutta.
So you've had the chance to receive some Dharma teachings and you had the chance to share, reflect and ask questions.
You have a chance to practice together meditatively.
And so we'll open up again for any additional questions or reflections or something you'd like to share based on what's being offered today.
You're all very quiet after the meditation.
Okay, so what happened?
I was in a chat room. I've been practicing meditation for 12 years and practicing Buddhism at the path about 10 years ago.
And I attend a lot of sanghas. I read books, kind of everything that was being said earlier.
And I realized just in your opening talk and the presentation on the heartwood that I don't think I was being very intentional on this path.
I think I was, I've been committed to practicing and I've been committed to learning and I think I was doing a lot of conceptualizing and then apparently either on retreat or just maybe during practice or something.
One of those concepts or one of these teachings will like land in a place where it's integrated. And so like Diana was saying with reading, you know, once you have that, you don't unlearn it, you don't stop.
But I don't think that I've been intentional and now I see that like in a way that I interact, you know, I'm not mindful, I'm not present, you know, not really maybe living.
Especially like the foundational teachings and whatnot. I just had it going forward and taking in and taking in and every once in a while something integrates because that part of my path.
But, you know, I, my expectations here, to be honest with you, were that high. I thought, well, let's see what this is.
My practice has been a little shaky this year after a retreat that I went to and almost a year ago, super powerful and transformative.
But right after the retreats, like my practice, my meditation practice seemed to fall apart or go somewhere, you know, I was, I've been struggling with getting back to.
And I think there's no going back to because I think I went forward and I kept trying to get back to that basic place that I was on the path and it seemed like something wrong.
And I was making something wrong, adding a lot of struggle to it.
But so I thought we'll be coming to this course or series of teachings might help me, you know, get back on better track with my practice.
But my expectations, you know, this morning is like, oh, I kind of want to sleep in.
I don't know if I'm going to go, but I will just say I know I'm talking a long time.
I will just say I am so glad that I came and I'm getting so much from this just in this sort of amount of time.
So I'm really happy that you're offering this and I just want to thank everybody else who's here together with us.
Yeah, thank you, Robin, for your share.
Yeah, we can be in this place sometimes, you know, even after a very transformative experience, it may open a new layer where we kind of kind of like what Diana said, we get overwhelmed, you know, to quite know what to do.
But then as you're beautifully saying, you know, we find our way back and there's, you know, the woodpecker kind of digging different holes and so beautiful.
Thank you.
Thank you for sharing that.
We'll do one more.
We need to be the last one for today.
Well, I was going to say something similar, but I was really struck by the comment that I was made about that's not good enough.
And, and so, and that we have to continue to work hard and do the difficult work.
And so I was reflecting on, well, how much more work do I have to do, I've been doing this like for 15 plus years.
And I feel like I haven't made a whole lot of progress because I'm still, you know, feeling us, you know, there's a lot of things that I'm not doing right.
And then the comment about, you know, after you do retreat, what happens after the retreat, you know, I've taken celery cheese with, you know, the IRC, but I still really can't figure out.
And the other thing is I like being with people.
I don't like doing it alone.
That's what I was going to say. And I wonder if you have any thoughts or comments about, you know, trying to sustain what the practice of yourself.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, part of this is building the muscles.
And sometimes it takes us doing it together.
And I like, you know, when I remember early on going to gym, I always needed to go to the aerobics class with other people, otherwise I'd just not do it.
So it's wise to find Sangha to practice together.
There is this collective uplifting field that supports us.
When we feel this is, in a way, we're building our muscles, building a habit, new habit, and that supports us.
Over time, we can learn to begin to see if we're able to practice by ourselves.
But it doesn't have to be like overnight to shift, you know, and maybe that would do a little bit and kind of push the edges a little.
And little by little, we do this, but always know that there is a way that sustains our practice.
If it's the community, Dharma friendship, that's great too. That's great too.
So I'm going to pass this along to Kim to wrap up the day.
Okay, great. So thank you, everyone. And it's been such an amazing journey through all of this one seemingly simple, highly repetitive Suta.
There's quite a lot to unpack there and I encourage you to keep reflecting on it in your own practice.
So the suggestion will meet again on Thursday in two more days.
But it might be interesting to reread, or for some of you, it might be reading the first time, MN 29, this one on the simile of the heart would kind of in light of what we talked about today and what we learned from each other.
That can enliven our next reading of the Suta and see if you might see some different things.
And then we do encourage you if you have time to look at MN 107, which will be our focus on Thursday.
And then you might say what's going to be left for Saturday and you'll just have to come and see.
So thank you very much. I see it's our time and I look forward to seeing many of you in a couple days. Be well.
Thank you all. Do you want to unmute and say goodbye? We can all say goodbye at the same time.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
