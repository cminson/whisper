 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Welcome to the Insight Meditation Center. So, hello everyone, welcome. And I hope that those of you who are local and not local are safe in the weather. Here in Redwood City, we didn't have much rain or storm or wind in the last 24 hours as expected. But we did lose electricity in big parts of the town. And at home, there's no electricity and just a couple blocks away from IMC, it's still no none. But here we're good for now. So, it probably can never be over said, over spoken that the emphasis on this meditation of mindfulness, Vipassana, the meditation of the Buddha, puts great value on what we can see, know, experience here and now, in this own field of direct perception. I was going to say here in our own body, but it's the whole way in which through the senses of the body, we experience directly whatever it is might be. And so, learning to come into the fullness of our direct perception, direct experience, unmediated by theories and doctrines and speculations and views about the nature of life or even the nature of self. It's a radical, phenomenal pointing the Buddha does to the simplicity of here. And the metaphor I'd like to use for this and for this meditation is that of opening a present. There's a gift. Someone who cares a lot about you, loves you and wants the best of you has given you a gift. And that gift is wrapped. It's wrapped in maybe beautiful wrapping. And maybe in wrapping paper, the person has made themselves, they want to do all the trouble of paper making. So it's beautiful. And then within that, there's a box. And so you take off the paper and because it's your friend's beautiful paper, you don't want to just tear it up. You unwrap it very carefully. And as you open it, you smooth it out so it's flat and as little creased as possible. So the beauty of this handmade piece of paper kind of stands out. And it's a beautiful box. Maybe the box is made from some, also maybe your friend has made. And it's made from local wood that the person has been able to, maybe a tree that fell and person milled the wood and cut the wood, put it together into a beautiful box. And so again, you want to be careful and loving and appreciative of the box as much as what's going to be inside the box. The paper and the box itself is part of the gift. And then now you do open the box to see what's inside. And there's something again that this person has made. Maybe it's a beautiful exquisite clay bowl that clearly is very thin, very fine, clearly very fragile, could easily shatter if it dropped just a little bit. But it's exquisitely made and you can see the care and the love that went into it. And so you don't just pick it up with one hand and kind of like, you know, flip it around. You want to, because it's so special, delicate and a gift, you pick it up carefully, lovingly and hold it, maybe in both hands and kind of hold it gently. So the same way we enter into our own direct experience, maybe thinking of it as a present. And there are these three layers and the way that we can unwrap it is to relax deeply. And first we relax the body and that's the handcrafted wrapping paper for it all. And so we were and relaxing is how we unwind, how we unfold it, how we open it up and take it off, relax deeply in the body. And then we relax the mind, the thinking mind and the mind, the pressure, the tightness, the contraction, the hardness, the resistance, the fear that's kind of embedded in the thinking mind itself. And that's, you know, opening up carefully this beautiful handmade box our friend has made. Beautiful. It's not quite handmade, but this beautiful mind that we have, care and love. And then, and then finally we get to open it up and pick up what's there. And in the middle of this box, there's our heart. And now we hold the heart carefully coming around with mindfulness, soft, soft palms of our hand, holding our heart, our emotional heart, the depth of our kind of inner life where it's the deepest place of. And we hold it gently, lovingly so it also can relax. And the present is not the present. The present is what's left when we're fully relaxed. So in this way, coming into our direct experience for this purpose, instead taking a meditation posture and gently closing your eyes and begin to feel into your body. Feel where it feels tight, maybe where it aches, where it feels loose, comfortable. And if there's easy ways of relaxing your body, soften, relax. And then to take a few long, slow, deep breaths and long exhale in which to relax further. Relaxing, and then letting your breathing return to normal. And again, taking some time to feel your body as you inhale, feel where there's still some holding. And on the exhale, to soften the body, release the body. And then on the inhale, sensing, feeling, the thinking mind, the thinking muscle, wherever in your body there's the energy, the impulse to be thinking. Whether in images or words or another way. And then feel if there might be any pressure or tension, contraction, hardness, agitation, a feeling of activation. As you exhale, let the mind relax, soften, release. As you relax the mind, letting the mind open up, spread out, as if you're opening a beautiful box to see all the spaciousness and openness in the mind. That's just beyond the edges of your thoughts, your concerns. Letting your thoughts quiet, almost as if they're melting into the space, spaciousness around them. And then to now, on the inhale, feel your heart. Or the center of gravity for your deepest emotional life. And maybe as you inhale, it's like a hand, two cupped hands that come gently from underneath to hold, to support the inner emotional life that we have, whatever it might be. The heart center, the emotional center, or maybe even the very center of our lived life. And see if you can relax the emotional center, relax the emotions. Let them relax so that they are settled more deeply into the palms of awareness. As if the palms of awareness offer safety, support, so that it's safe to relax the heart center, soften. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. And when you relax as deep as you can, letting go as deeply as you can. With no concerns and preoccupations take you away from here and now. Just here. What is left for you in the simplicity of breathing in and breathing out? Below all the wrapping paper, all the tension, what is the gift of freedom? Unbounded freedom, experienced with every inhale and every exhale. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. And then as we come to the end of the sitting, you relax now, let go. Now that we're coming to the end, there's something about the effort or the bracing yourself around doing the practice and you can let go of. And let go more deeply into yourself, taking off all the wrapping paper and getting it all to the deepest place of rest. From a whatever degree of rest within that you can have from that rest to gaze outward into the world, thinking about the people in your life, the people in your communities, neighborhoods, on the streets, in the news. And wherever there are people that you're aware of in your life, the gaze upon them from their settled place and perhaps let there be kindness, a friendliness, goodwill, a simple goodwill that is not demanding or a high standard that you have to live up to just resting in goodwill and letting that good be a well wishing for others. What a wonderful thing it would be if more people could be happy and safe. Peaceful and free. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
