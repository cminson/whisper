 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org................................................................................................................................................. It's really quite a beautiful capacity that we have to be with ourselves in this way. We may not appreciate it so much. Just how beautiful it is. But maybe we can reflect a little bit on what it might be like if we sat down with a friend who was willing to just be there with us, however we were feeling, whatever was going on, just willing to be with us. We would really, I think, feel that as a sense of being accepted, of belonging, of being cared for. And our own capacity to be with ourselves can also feel that way. We can belong with ourselves, allowing ourselves to be just as we are, care for ourselves, a deep act of caring, to be willing to land with ourselves just as we are. And so opening to how you are in this moment, aware of just whatever is here, whatever's clear or obvious, maybe how the body is, maybe particular sensations in the body or might be a general sense of, maybe just a general sense of the tiredness or the energy in the body, however you are. It might also be a kind of an emotional tone, just opening to how you are in this moment, physically and emotionally, maybe with just a very relaxed, receptive attention, as if this receptive attention were the best friend possible, just willing to be with you as you are, not asking for any change, not asking for an explanation, just caring enough to be with us. So this capacity that we have to be with ourselves, it is deeply connected to this movement of caring, of kindness, of love. And it's also deeply connected to our capacity to begin to understand ourselves. Come in love together in this simple action of being with, being with experience just as it is. Just a gentle soft remembering to connect, remembering to be with yourself. For some, it may be, it may feel useful to have that being with, be very broad, just open to whatever wants to show up, whatever is showing up, whether various body sensations or moods or sounds, thoughts, just almost like a wide open lens, receiving. Whatever the attention is connecting. And for some, it may feel more useful to allow the attention to be with this particular aspect of experience, something that's already here, already obvious, like the breath or hearing. What feels most easeful for you in this moment? What feels most kind in the way of being with yourself? What feels most kind in the way of being with yourself? And of course, the mind will wander, will get lost, will forget to be with ourselves. In that moment that mindfulness returns when you remember about being with yourself again. Remember the kindness there, that this attention, this kind of being with, is a kind, friendly, allowing attention, remembering the kindness of that moment of being with ourselves and setting aside, letting go of the loss of the mindfulness for those moments. As we reconnect with the present moment experience, can it be with that sense of remembering, remembering ourselves, belonging to ourselves, caring for ourselves? Just being aware with however you are in this moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
