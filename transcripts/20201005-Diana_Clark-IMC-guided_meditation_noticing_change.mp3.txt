Good evening. Good evening, everyone.
A really warm welcome.
It's me and my...all these little gizmos
I have to...buttons I need to push here, so...
It's nice to be here with you all.
So we'll begin with a guided meditation.
Just settling in to the posture.
Feeling what it feels like to
just be here right now.
There might be some obvious sensations.
Feeling the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body.
Feeling what your hands are touching.
Feeling your feet on the ground or whatever they are touching.
And is there a way to feel connected, grounded?
To this moment, this experience.
As we pay attention or rest our awareness on being here,
we might notice a number of sensations that maybe weren't so obvious a moment ago.
Maybe some tension, some tightness.
Maybe it helps to wiggle a little bit as part of our settling in process.
Can explore if it's helpful to bring the awareness to those areas of the body
that might feel some tightness, might feel some tension,
or maybe are calling for attention.
And explore if there's a way that you can pay attention to this
with some warm-heartedness, with some openness.
Maybe some curiosity.
Not with the demand, of course, that the tension go away,
but just inviting it into the awareness.
There are so many things, so many experiences,
that could be had at this moment, so many things happening.
What would it be like to incline the mind toward the experience of stability or steadiness?
The mind might still be a little bit busy,
but is the body a little bit more steady, more settled?
The mind might still be a little bit busy,
but is the body a little bit more steady, more settled?
The mind might still be a little bit busy,
but is the body a little bit more steady, more settled?
And maybe with the noticing of the steadiness of the body,
there can be just a little bit more quieting of the mind.
The mind might still be a little bit busy,
more settled?
The mind might still be a little bit busy, more settled?
And one thing that might happen,
when we start inclining the mind towards stability or steadiness,
it really throws into highlight all that isn't steady, all that isn't stable.
That's okay. We can just notice.
We can notice others, thoughts are coming and going, we're getting lost in thought, we're coming back.
Maybe we're noticing that those areas of tension in the body weren't so straightforward to discover or examine.
Maybe they were a little bit slippery.
And if you have mindfulness of the sensations of breathing as your practice,
you'll notice that of course the breath is changing too from the beginning, middle and end of an in-breath to a transition
to the beginning, middle and end of an out-breath and another transition.
That's okay.
In fact, all experiences are arising and passing away.
That's okay.
