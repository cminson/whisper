 And that's what my notes say on that topic. Do you have any questions? Yes. Thank you. I noticed in your presentation of the philosophers that there weren't any women. Is that because there weren't any? There were women, but there were no women philosophers. No women. As far as we know. The last reference, you don't have many references to nuns in later Indian Buddhism. And this is one of the interesting things, is the Mahayana comes along and they advertise themselves as being really open and more supportive of women. But you find that there are fewer and fewer and fewer nuns during that time. The last inscription for any kind of donation to a nunnery I think is about the 10th century. And Buddhism lived on for another two centuries in India. And if you look in the secular literature when they talk about Buddhist nuns, around about the 8th century, you find talk of Buddhist nuns participating in tantra. Basically what you would have is they would have lay women who were their disciples, who would go out to the various places where the tantric rituals were being done. And then after they had developed all their tantric power, then they would come and they would ordain as nuns. But what's interesting is that the stereotypical role of a Buddhist nun, in a Sanskrit play, is as a matchmaker. There's the prince who has fallen in love with this beautiful princess of another kingdom, but he can't meet her, while the nun is the one who is going to do all the arranging. Or if there's this one princess who doesn't have her prince falling in love with her, she says, Well, let me take care of that. And then she takes care of that. And it's the interesting point of the view of the Vinaya, nuns are not supposed to do this. This is one of the things that you're actually forbidden to do. But in the plays, it's considered as a positive thing. The nuns are portrayed as very compassionate people, very wise. But wise, compassionate matchmakers, that's not really what the Buddha had in mind for his nuns. But this is pretty much all you know about nuns in later Indian Buddhism. As opposed to in the earlier centuries, right around the time of King Ashokan, right after, you not only have donations being given to nunneries, but you also have nuns sponsoring large donations. Which means either that they were born in wealthy families and carried some of their family wealth with them, or they had a huge number of followers that they could draw on to get the money to say, build a stupor or something. So there's kind of a decline over the period of time, just as there is a decline in the status of women as a whole in India during those centuries. Yes, question between you. Questioner 2. I was wondering if you could sum up the difference between Hinayana, the practice when you're a Buddhist monk, like I want to become an Arhat or I just want to get out of here, versus Mahayana, like I want to wait and help other people, or I want to wait and become a Buddha. I was wondering if you could just sum up between those two. In some ways there's not any difference at all. You've got to work on the perfections either way. In terms of the way the Vinaya is going to be observed in those different contexts, the Mahayana has long had a... It's very early in Mahayana teachings, the idea was that Vinaya really depends on the situation, just as virtue of the precepts depend on the situation. There's a much more situational approach to the precepts, that there are going to be times when the compassionate thing is to break the precept. Now you'll find specific Mahayana sects which will say, no, we're going to stick by the precepts anyhow. In, say, Japan, the Shingon sect was very close to Vinaya, and there are Mahayana. In Tibet, it's the Gelug's structure closer to the Vinaya. But one of the major differences you see between Mahayana texts and the earlier texts is this attitude towards the precepts. So that's one of the differences you'll find. Now if you actually look at somebody's practice, you may get an individual Mahayana monk who said, I'm going to stick with the precepts, I need to work on this. I've never really lived in a Mahayana monastery, so I can't describe it otherwise. But I certainly know that in the forest tradition, the emphasis is on, look, you've got this one lifetime, you don't know what you're going to be next time around unless you work hard. And you can't depend on a bodhisattva vow to see you through. So there's a much more sense of urgency. Yes. You see, look, when the path is open, take it. If you have a chance to be an Arahant, don't throw it away. You know, all the teachings you have in the Pali Canon point to taking the path of the Arahant. Now someone will say the Pali Canon doesn't contain all the teachings of the Buddha, but... My concern is that a lot of people take the bodhisattva vow without really thinking about what they're doing. One. And then two, it becomes an excuse not for going, you know, giving all your energy to the path. That's the danger. The danger of the Arahant path is to say, to hell with everybody, I'm just going to do my own thing. I think the second one is a lesser danger. Because your own thing as a person striving for Arahantship is you have to practice generosity, you have to practice the precepts. These things that other people are going to benefit from any of them. There's no such thing in Buddhism, any form of Buddhism, that you're going to get out of here without helping other people. One way or another. One way or another. Okay. I'll just make a few concluding remarks. I'm kind of burned out, okay? There was some plan to actually go over the readings. Remember those? Let me give you a few... After I do my concluding remarks, I'll give you a few recommendations on how to go over the readings on your own at home, and then we'll split. Okay, to conclude, I'd like to reflect a little bit on that image of the magic show we talked about earlier. Remember the Pali Canon? There are two kinds of emptiness. Emptiness as a meditative dwelling and emptiness as an attribute of objects. As an attribute of objects, the magic show is brought in as an analogy. You see that the objects of clinging are insubstantial, but clinging causes real suffering. It's not that the suffering is imaginary too. You let go of the idea of there being something behind the show, and instead you focus on the real problem, which is how suffering comes about. What are you doing to cause the suffering around these insubstantial objects? You look at the process of the rising and passing of suffering on its own terms, learn how to stop the clinging and craving through your knowledge, and you gain release. That puts an end to the show. Period. In the moments of awakening, there is an experience of the deathless. At the point of the experience of the deathless, there is no experience of any of the six senses, but it's not a blacking out. There is an awareness. But it's not based on any kind of fabrication at all. So when we say that there's an ending of a show, that doesn't mean everything shuts down and there's a total blacking out. There's still a kind of awareness, but it's an awareness with no suffering. Nagarachana takes a similar use of the magic show. In other words, for him it's seeing that things are dependently co-arising, that you cannot build a view around them. When you see that the views are built around these things are based on faulty assumptions, you begin to see the views themselves as a magic show. So you drop the assumptions about existence or non-existence, and you look just at the emptiness of things in and of themselves. By doing that, you drop all your attachment to views, as he would say, you come to it the state of total non-reliance on views, which is the ultimate emptiness. And then again, the magic show ends. In the Mahayana, they have a more positive view of the magic show. Remember the three stages of discernment? The first one is that you try not to be deluded by the magic show. The second one is finally you see through the magic tricks, and then you come back so you continue performing good magic for other people. Magic that actually helps them. The problem with this particular one is that they say that suffering itself is illusory, and when you see through the illusion, then you can still participate in the processes of conditionality, but without suffering, because you don't really dwell either in nirvana or in samsara according to them. And as far as they're concerned, continuing with the magic show is worth it, worth the effort. That substantial good lies in performing the magic. So what this symbolizes is the different uses of emptiness. In the early teachings, emptiness is used as a way of focusing your attention on the question of suffering and stress. The same with nirgajana, although nirgajana focuses on the issue of the suffering caused by holding an illogical view. It really makes no sense. In the mahayana, they don't want you to let go totally. There want to be something left during the letting go, and so they come up with the state of non-dual consciousness as something you're trying to get to through the process of deconstructing your views or looking at experience simply as mental constructs. And they leave you with that non-dual awareness as the ultimate, and discouraging any attempt to analyze that as having any suffering or stress in it at all. And then from that sense, state of non-dual awareness, then you can continue on in samsara, but not totally, totally endless, put it that way, in it but not of it. So that's the kind of change that developed in India over time with the teachings on emptiness. To look at the material that was in the readings, just give a little advice. That first passage is there to show what the Buddha's basic approach to discernment was. This is the question that is the basis for any search for discernment. The next passage shows how this whole question of looking at your actions in terms of their intention, the results while you're acting, and the results after you're acting, and then learning from your mistakes. How this starts out on a very day-to-day level, just what you're going to do. Are you going to yell at your little sister? Is it going to cause problems? Maybe you better not. And then working out from that, you'll find if you compare the pattern in the teaching in rahula with the pattern that's used in the teaching on meditation as meditative, excuse me, emptiness as meditative dwelling, it's the same pattern. So in other words, look to compare that second passage which starts at just an inch or two down on page one, and compare that with the passage that starts at the bottom of page three. And you'll see that there are lots of parallels. As for the passage that starts on page two, the point I wanted to make here was that the Buddha talks about when people develop their meditation. Some people develop tranquility first without any discernment, other people develop the discernment without much tranquility, and then other people develop the two of them together. And basically the pattern of how you develop the two of them together is the pattern that's used in the passage that begins in page three, emptiness as meditative dwelling. In other words, first you start out with the question of how am I going to settle my mind, and then once I've got it settled, then the question is how do I look at the process of fabrication? In this case, the Buddha advised, look at the process of fabrication in terms of the presence or absence of disturbance. The passage on the bottom of page five is there to point out that yes, in the Pali Canon, they do recognize the existence of a non-dual state of consciousness. But they don't think it's a big deal. In fact, they encourage you to see it as not a big deal. So keep that in mind. The passage is beginning on page six, deal with emptiness as an attribute of objects. There's a question from Moga Rancia, how do you view the world so as not to be seen by death's king? And the viewer says, view the world as empty. The next passage describes what does he mean by empty, looking at the world as empty. In other words, form, excuse me, that the six senses are empty of self or anything pertaining to a self. The next passage applies a similar insight into the five condas with a lot of analogies and compares form to a glob of foam. Feeling is like bubbles rising on the river when it's falling in heavy rain. Perception is like a mirage. Fabrication is like a banana tree. In the sense, have you ever taken a banana tree apart? It's basically just peel. There's nothing inside. You follow the peel and just kind of unfold it and it's just a big peel round around itself. There's no essence or hardwood in there. And then finally, number six is the magic shell. Consciousness is like a magic shell. In all these cases, you see that it's empty, void and without any substance. In other words, to reduce your clinging to the object. The passage that begins on the bottom of page seven describes how you take the experience of jhana and you take that apart and you look at it as empty as well. In other words, you go to all that trouble of putting it together and you say, this is still not as satisfactory as I thought it was. There's still stress in here. There's still not selfness in here. And then you gain a sense of dispassion towards that and that can lead you to the dappas. The passage that begins on page eight shows the alternative. If you're not going to look at things in terms of self or not self or in terms of existence or non-existence, what terms do you use? First he points out that if you start thinking in terms of, do I have a self? Do I not have a self? What will I be? And you end up and you get all tangled in a tangle of use. Even if you get entangled in the view, there is no self, it's a tangle. And again, it talks about not only the self but also the existence of the self. Did I exist in the past? Will I exist in the future? Questions of being and not being again. And so instead, what questions does he have you attend to? He has you attend to on the top of page nine, the Four Noble Truths. Stress, the origination, its cessation and the path to its cessation. This is then seconded in the next passage, which is on page nine, the beginning of page nine. When the Buddha says, when you look at the arising of things, the whole idea of the non-existence of things would not occur to you. If you look at their passing away, the idea of their existence doesn't occur to you. And all that's left is seeing that when anything arises, it's just as he says, that mere stress when arising is arising. Stress when passing away is passing away. It's just the coming and going of stress. That's all that's left for you to look at. This is followed by the passage to Bahia, where he similarly says, in the scene there's only the seen, in the heard, only the heard. The sensed and the cognized, only the sensed and the cognized. When you see, when there's just that, when you haven't added anything on more to that experience, then there's no you there. When you're not located there, because the whole point of, one of the implications of holding onto something, that's how you locate your something, is how you locate yourself and you define yourself by your clinging. Where there's no clinging, you're not located there. You're not defined. You're out of the equation. And the final one, page 10, we're going to point out, again, that the early teachings did know of a teaching that everything is a oneness, and they said, nope, sorry, that's one extreme. Is everything a plurality? That's another extreme. And then the Buddha goes into dependent core arising. Do you have questions or questions about the mind about that, or is that a discussion that I don't think you can talk about? I think it's very talk about the one just about that, the one that's about the sectionist. Okay, and that one is, when you don't construe anything around your perception, then the mind is such. Okay, you are such. Basically, the meaning there is that the mind doesn't change from anything, is not changed by anything, whatever it was it continues to be. No, it's a state of non- what's the word? No impact. And as for a Nargarjuna, ha ha ha. First thing I want to point out, if you look through the Nargarjuna, the top of page 12, verse 8, The victorious ones have announced emptiness to be non-reliance on all views. Those who have an emptiness view are said to be incorrigible. That's the key to unlocking the whole thing. Emptiness is non-reliance on all views, but he doesn't want you to hold on to an emptiness view. He wants you to use the teaching on emptiness. Yes, mic's out, sorry. The other place where emptiness is defined is on page 15. Under the examination of the Noble Truth, verse 18, we state that dependent-corrising is emptiness. And dependent on that convention is the middle way. In fact, if you're going to read Nargarjuna, that whole section 24 is probably the best to start with. People say, hey, if everything is empty, then you can't have any Four Noble Truths. If there are no Four Noble Truths, then there's no Buddha, there's no Buddha, there's no Dharma, there's no Sangham. You're refuting everything that the Buddha taught. And Nargarjuna is finally pinned down, so he has to explain himself. Because in the earlier chapters, Nargarjuna is kind of, he's having a lot of fun, attacking things from the hit and run from all sides. Finally, he has to explain what he's doing, exactly why this has any relationship to Buddha's teachings at all. And it's in this particular chapter that things make most sense. First, he talks about the two levels of truth, conventional and ultimate. And then he gives you the conventional truth of emptiness. We state that dependent-corrising is emptiness. Depending on that, convention is the middle way. And from there, then he goes to show how the Four Noble Truths make sense, only if you accept the teaching on emptiness on a conventional level. One other passage you should focus on before you start wading through Nargarjuna is on page 16. Under the examination of the twelve causal factors, there being clinging, becoming on the part of the clingier proceeds. If there were no clinging, or if that person were to be without clinging, he or she would be released and there would be no becoming. He's basically giving the explanation of why he's doing what he's doing. We're working on overcoming clinging, and by example he shows all his examples of clinging or clinging to views. The whole purpose of this being, once you overcome that clinging, then you're released and there's no further becoming. That's a Hanyana teaching. Trying to put an end to becoming is specifically a Hanyana goal. Finally, one other thing you want to look at. Go back to page 12. Look on verse 7, the exhortation to Gajayana. That is the same as the passage. Page 9. The first full passage on page 9. Sometimes you hear the claim that Nargarjuna in the Garakas here is trying to explain the Bhrajna-Bhramita Sutras. He doesn't mention them ever. Not a word. The only sutra that he cites by name is this one that was found in the Pali Kannam. There on page 9. It's interesting though, if you compare what he says about that sutra though, in the exhortation to Gajayana, both exists and doesn't exist have been refuted by the Blessed One adept in existence and non-existence. Notice that word refute. The Buddha's not refuting anything in that sutra. He's saying something about a state of mind he wants you to get into. Once you get into the state of mind where you're simply watching the arising and passing away of things, in terms of stress arising and passing away, the ideas of existence and non-existence don't occur to you. He's trying to put you into that state. Nargarjuna here is saying it more like the Buddha has refuted this on the logical level. Two different things. Close, but different. I think seeing the difference there is important for seeing what Nargarjuna does as he takes the early teachings and focuses on the issue of logical consistency. One other thing I want to tackle before we go. This is not quite on emptiness, but it is on Nargarjuna. Look at that last page, 16. Start over the examination of nirvana here. Verse 17. It is not assumed that the Blessed One exists after death. It is not assumed that he doesn't exist, both are neither. This is straight from the early canons. It is not assumed that the Blessed One currently exists. It is not assumed that he doesn't exist, both are neither. This also comes from the canon. These two verses are supported by this passage in Sanjuta, 22, 85, 86. Now look at how he jumps to that next one. There exists nothing to distinguish nirvana from samsara. And that's a jump. What he was talking about earlier is that when the Buddha goes into total nirvana, we can't say that he doesn't exist, both are neither. While he is still experiencing, we experience him as part of samsara, we can't say that he doesn't exist, both are neither. But the words nirvana and samsara don't appear here. They are talking about the status of the Buddha while he is functioning and then after his total nirvana. You are lost. Those first two verses are talking about the awakened one. You can't describe him after he passes away into total nirvana as existing or non-existing. You can't describe him in the present life as existing or non-existing. The reason for that is that you can't define him. You can describe all the things you can define. But then, from the person currently existing or in nirvana, then they go to talk about nirvana and samsara themselves as if they were two different states of nirvana and the state of samsara. Because, in the sense that you can't describe them as existing, not both are neither. There are no bases in the Pali Kanda for that next statement. For nineteen. Because there is a passage where the Buddha actually says nirvana exists. There is such a thing. From nineteen, then nirgajana goes on to twenty. The ontological status of nirvana is the ontological status of samsara. Between them not even anything extremely subtle can be found. Now, most quotes of nirgajana will take that phrase, the ontological status, and they will remove it. So that nirvana is samsara. I just wanted to point that out. Okay. Is this your translation? Yeah. Okay, so that's some guide posts on how to get your way through the readings. Any last questions? Yes. Microphone. Microphone. Microphone. You mentioned situational ethics a little earlier, and a little later, a story from, which I believe is from the Pali Canon, came to me, where the Buddha actually decides, for some reflection in this situation, to kill a pirate that is attacking a boat. And I've just heard that story along the line somewhere, and it came up when you mentioned that, or shortly thereafter. So I'm wondering if that is from the Pali Canon, and if you can give me the reference to that, if it is, or where it's from. Okay, it's not in the Pali Canon. It's in something called the Mobiya-gausalya Sutra. It's a very early Mahayana Sutra. And there are two interesting things here. There are instances, this is supposed to be a Jataka tale. It's not the Buddha itself. Jataka tale, yeah, that's the context I heard it in. In the Pali Canon, you do have cases where the Buddha, to be, in the Pali Jataka, breaks some of the precepts. In fact, if you go down to five precepts, there's only one precept he never breaks at all, and that's the precept against lying. There are places where he's guilty of killing, stealing, illicit sex, drinking alcohol, and other things. Now the traditional explanation of that was that he's just a bodhisattva, he's learning the ropes. There's more that he still has to learn. In fact, there's one where he's a hermit, and he's invited into the king's palace to teach the king's hymn. He falls in love with the queen, and basically sort of arranges it so they might do whatever. And the queen says, wait a minute, you're an ascetic, you can't do this. What kind of ascetic are you? And he gets so chastised and so embarrassed that he goes out in the forest and never comes into the palace ever again. And so that was his wife-to-be. And in that one, she teaches him the lesson. So in the Jataka tales, the Buddha is not perfect, but the explanation is, okay, he's not a Buddha yet. He's learning this stuff all on his own, he's going to make mistakes. So with that particular story you say it was from an early Mahayana text. It's an early Mahayana text, yes. And they're trying to make the point, they make the different point. It's not that he's imperfect or he's just learning the ropes, he's really, really wise and compassionate. So in fact it was that particular story that created a whole line of stories about wise ways of breaking the precepts, compassionate ways of breaking the precepts. But you don't find this in the early canon. Thank you. Thank you. Why is it that the admonition against lying is so sacrosanct? There's one passage where the Buddha said, someone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie, there's no evil that that person will not do. They take that more serious than anything else. Because if you can lie to other people, you can misrepresent the truth to them. And that can do more damage than killing them. You can get them onto wrong views for who knows how long to come. And it's of the four bhajakah rules, these are the ones that drive someone out of the monkhood, if you break any of these rules. And they're in kind of ascending level of seriousness. The first one is having sex. Second one is stealing. Third one is killing. The fourth one is lying about your spiritual attainments. Because again, if you kill somebody, that's just it for this lifetime. If you lie about your spiritual attainments and then they say you do something really dumb or unwise, they say, gee, that's an enlightened person, gee, who needs that? Aeons can go by before that person can come back. The Buddha's first requisite, the only prerequisite he had for a student, he says, bring me someone who is no deceiver and I will teach that person the Dharma. You can do an awful lot of damage with a lie. Yes? The question is, if you find the breath stressful, how to let it go? Remember the Buddha has the Four Noble Truths. Each truth has its own task or duty. Stress is to be comprehended. The cause is to be let go. The cessation is something to be experienced or realized and then the path is something to be developed. When you see that there's stress in the breath, you don't let go of the breath. You try to let go, you try to comprehend, okay, why is this stressful? Until you see exactly what's causing it. When you see what's causing it, then you let go of the cause. And he says ignorance about what's going on in the body, what's going on in the mind, that's going to be what's going to make the breath stressful. So that's what you let go of is the ignorance. How do you go after it? How do we actually let it go? Do we turn our attention or consciously? Exactly, exactly, you turn your attention to it. That's the only way you can let go of emptiness, is to replace it with knowledge and awareness. I don't get everything what Arjun said, but thank you very much. Question back there. You've been over this, but let me just ask, on page 16, number 19, let's forget whether or not it follows from the two preceding. Let's just take it as a claim. Is it true or not? And please comment. There's just nothing to distinguish nirvana from satsara, is that the one? Okay, we've got several issues here. One, is nirvana a place? Is samsara a place? In the Pali Canon, no. In later teachings, that's what it turns into. But they're two separate places. And then the mayana comes along and says, well, they're not two separate places at all, they're found in the same place. That's what they're trying to do, is they bring the two together. In the early Canon, nirvana samsara is a process, it's something that you do. And the ending of that doing, then, is nirvana. Radically different. But where they're found, they're found here. It's not that you have to go off. My teacher once told me, as a child, he was convinced that nirvana lay in the Himalayan mountains. That partly had to do with the Thai words for nipan, or nirvana, and himapan, which was the Himalayan mountains. And it was a radical discovery. No, it's right here. But then when you get there, then there's no there there. Only it's not Oakland, okay? It's a serious issue. We define ourselves by our clinging. And defining it, and wherever there's a clinging, there's a sense of location. That you're right here. When there's no clinging, there's no location anymore. But the deathless is something radically, radically different. From what we're experiencing right now. Question over here. Just one thing about views. To have a view, you have to have a point to view from. You have to have an existence. So are they related? I exist, therefore I have a view. Or I have a view, therefore I exist. It definitely is. Just as far as all those things go. Nirvana has no views. Views form a part of the path. That's part of constructive, fabricated experience. And I think one of the things all Buddhist teachers would agree on is, you've got to get to the point where there are, we're not holding on to any views. They differ as to exactly how you get to that point. And what's going to happen as a result afterwards. But you've got to use views in order to get to that point. That I understand. I was just kind of commenting on, if you have a sense of self, of existence, then you automatically have a sense, you automatically have views. That's all. Anything else? That it? Okay, well thank you for your attention. It was a long haul, but we made it. For years Gil has been asking me to do something abstract like this. I prefer to do more practical day to day, and discussions. But every now and then it's fun.
