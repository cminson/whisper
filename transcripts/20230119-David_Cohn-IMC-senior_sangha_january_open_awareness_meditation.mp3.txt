 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Grounding in the body, by being aware of the body, this calms the mind. Being aware of the feet, the calves, the sensations in the thighs. Your butt on your chair, being pulled down by gravity. The small of the back, the middle back. The rising and falling of the breath. You might notice at the end of the exhale, just relaxing there, you might notice some silence there. Some release at the end of the exhale, some gap. Or the clarity of simple bear awareness is revealed. And you can rest in that gap for a few moments. And relaxing and opening your heart. Now just for a little imagination, exercise, imagine in front of you are some loved ones, your closest ones, your spouse or partner. In front of you are your children, if you have them, or grandchildren. Your mom and dad, even if they've passed away. Your dear friends, in front of you, sitting there, you're looking into their eyes at these loved ones, grandchildren, pets, your puppy, your dog, your cat. And this meditation that you're doing today, and this gathering that you've come to today for your benefit, this is all beneficial to you. May this also benefit you. May my meditation be of benefit to my loved ones, to all of you. May whatever calm, happiness, contentment, ease, understanding, insight, wisdom, may it benefit you. Giving it away, giving away all the merit to them, blessing them. And then expanding that and giving it to all beings everywhere. May this meditation, this gathering today, you've benefit to all beings, suffering beings, suffering from climate disruption, floods, fires, hunger, thirst, suffering from trauma, habitual patterns, racial prejudice. May all beings everywhere, may their suffering be relieved by my practice today. And now just rest. With your heart a little more open, just be. Just be aware, simple. Not trying to be aware. Just sitting here in a natural, uncontrived way. If there's some silence, let there be silence. If there are movements of the mind, let there be movements. We just don't need to follow those movements. Get entangled with them. We also don't need to be in conflict with them. Just allow them to free themselves. So in this way we're already complete. We don't have to do anything. We're in a state of liberation, allowing whatever is happening freely to take place. Sensations in the body, sound of my voice or any other sounds that are coming into your hearing. Sights behind the eyes if your eyes are closed. Whatever you're feeling, let there be. And whatever you're thinking, just recognize that you're aware of thinking. There's this knowing quality that we always have. We're always knowing something. Not just knowing quality. Relax. And widen. Open. Unhindered. Maybe relaxing into space, opening into space. Space in front of you, behind you, to your right, boundless space, just letting your awareness open and include. To the left of you. Awareness is like space. It includes self-doubt, the thoughts of being, the feelings of being, anger, jealousy, fear, joy, inspiration. Nothing can get in the way of this. You can't do this wrong. So just relax now into easeful being and allow whatever is happening to happen. You're perfect just as you are. There's an expression, messy as it is, just letting it be. There's an expression, a center for healthy minds that describe this as well-being. Encouraging us to practice this as a pillar of well-being. It's a little late for a new year's resolution, but it's a very nice thing to do for yourself this year. Just be aware. Not just in this meditation or in your meditation. My meditation is over. Why not just continue with this? It's so easy, so simple, so good, so kind, and so profound. We don't have to do lots of different things to become Buddha. Just be a Buddha. This is radiant. This is open. It doesn't come from anywhere. It doesn't begin. It doesn't end. Once we get lost, it's just here. There's some peace here. When you open your eyes, you don't need to stop meditating in this simple, easy way. Thank you. I remember a time when I would get up in the morning and try to blow my stuff, make my bed, take care of the bird, and try to just get it all done so I could go meditate. But now I wake up and I'm aware. And I get out of bed, put on my clothes, and I'm aware. Every step of the way, it's just as good, just as good as meditation. There's no difference. The same ease, and you're touching the bedspread, the sheets, the blankets, and you're throwing them up and making the bed. Not to get it done so I can do something else, but uncovering the bird. It's got the blankets over him, feeding the bird. All well-being, all joy in a way, a certain kind of way, joy in this awareness. You know, brushing teeth is not a chore. It's another manifestation of this awareness, brushing the teeth. So we never have to stop doing this. So let's maybe discuss this for a while in small groups. I had several reflections that I put out for discussion focusing in different areas. One area is the simple well-being in this awareness. Do you experience something like that? That was kind of the reason we got into this in the first place, this prompt from the Center for Healthy Minds. If we sense the well-being in it, we're going to want to do it more. Maybe discuss something like that, your experience. I'm just going to throw out a couple of things and maybe you'll grab a hold of one or two to discuss. Can it be with you all the time? Can it be with you when you're thinking? Can it be with you when you're feeling? And how does it relieve your grasping? How does it help you with your reactivity? That's the point of the Four Noble Truths. The point of all the Buddhist teachings is I don't think any Buddhist teacher or any spiritual teacher has told you to grasp. I've never heard that as a teaching grasp on the sonta. How does this help you in that way? As grasping causes suffering, it hurts. And then in daily life, when you're cleaning out the house, you're getting rid of old stuff. Talking to people. How can it help? How can you do it? Yeah, those are some ideas. I'll try to figure this out.
