So thank you for having me. 
This Sunday morning I MC group feels a lot like church and I feel like a guest preacher. 
So thank you for welcoming me. 
Happy to be with you. 
So these are some meditators, researchers who devised a way of assessing personality based on an ancient kind of Buddhist system of classifying ourselves. 
So they write, even at the level of a single-celled organism, behavior must necessarily fall into one of three possible categories. 
Move towards or approach, move away, withdraw, or neither. 
No response. 
These three basic options cannot be reduced further and therefore would seem to represent the most parsimonious description of behavioral tendencies. 
So in that maybe you hear the approach, withdraw, or avoid, or ignore. 
And these are aligned with the kind of Buddhist personality schema of greed, aversion, delusion. 
The mind that grasps what's good, what we want. 
The mind that withdraws from what is unappealing or the mind that ignores. 
And in some ways I just want to say like personality is not, it's not neat. 
And the study of personality is like complex and there's a lot of nuance. 
And so I don't want to be too reductionistic, but you may feel a certain affinity for greed, aversion, or delusion. 
And actually being able to understand ourselves, diagnose ourselves maybe along these lines can be quite helpful. 
Now sometimes it's said like if you haven't already registered yourself as one of them, you might be the deluded type. 
Now I'm a little reticent to ask, but would anybody want a hazard, I guess, on my type? Aversion, yeah. 
It was actually a trick question. 
You're supposed to say, you're free from defilements, Matthew. 
No aversion, very clear, so clear. 
Even from childhood it was like very clear predilection to this sort of withdrawal avoidance. 
The negative was much more salient than the positive. 
The warrior's losing, much more potent than the warrior's winning. 
So we actually can learn a lot about our minds and the ways we suffer and the ways our suffering spills out onto others by just reflecting in these clear ways. 
And at some level we might consider all of these strategies as a kind of like maladaptive ways of wrestling with samsara, ways that we try to actually manage the insecurity, the vulnerability, the uncontrollability of the flows of pleasure and pain, and these kind of movements of the heart towards like to have and to hold, to grasp goodness, to grasp pleasure, or to try to find one's way through life by avoiding risk and harm and pain, or to sort of retreat into a kind of diluted sense of removal from the world. 
These are all very like understandable and in a deep way innocent strategies for meeting the challenges of being human, which we don't fully actually acknowledge, you know? In some ways that's the starting point of Buddhism is fully acknowledging the intensity of being human, of understanding this. 
So we could speak about all three of these, but this morning I did want to speak about delusion. 
So that article I started with goes on to say, and let me just say they also acknowledge that with each of these types they're sort of said to be like a positive flip side to it. 
So there's a certain kind of optimism and faithfulness that's associated with the greed and a certain kind of discernment and clarity associated with aversion and a certain kind of like equanimity associated with delusion. 
So the authors go on to say, while the greedy, faithful, and aversive discerning types are characterized by their strong motivational tendency of either grasping or pushing away, the diluted speculative type is distinguished by the absence of a strong motivational tendency. 
It's characterized by a lack of awareness of present conditions, whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. 
As a result, diluted types tend not to have strong immediate reactions and not to hold fixed opinions. 
On the positive side, this allows for creativity for being open to many possible options and thinking outside the box. 
On the negative side, the diluted type can seem lost, constantly scattered, and prone to following the opinions of others because of uncertainty. 
Now aversion burns and greed feels like that bottomless longing. 
But delusion, that just feels like the truth. 
The kind of cues like the alarm bells to recognize what's happening are much clearer with the greed and the aversion. 
In some ways, I feel like over the course of my Dharma life, I've trained myself to pay attention to those alarm bells. 
I know that my aversive personality is a risk to my own well-being. 
It could be a risk to the well-being of others. 
I really feel like I've trained myself to. 
. 
. 
The alarm bell goes off and it's like that really. 
. 
. 
I saw a bumper sticker at IRC, like I break for suffering. 
The aversion is so obvious. 
If you have any sense of the reference point of peace or love or non-hatred, aversion is so abundantly clear. 
It's the same thing for greed and longing, but delusion is much more camouflaged. 
David Foster Wallace's now famous commencement speech at I think his alma mater, he depicts a cartoon with his words. 
In the first frame, two little fish are swimming and one big fish is swimming the opposite direction. 
Hey boys, how's the water? And then in the second frame, the big fish has swam past and the two little fish are talking to each other and one little fish says to the other, what the hell is water? In some ways, we're deluded until we're not. 
The best available model of the world, like what we know is a blend of our own wisdom and clarity and confusion. 
Part of our path is there's this aspect of humility that runs so deeply through our Dharma life. 
I was just sitting retreat and the teacher said something like, if you're not becoming more humbled by this path, you're not growing. 
It's a little like stark, but it really resonated for me. 
It's not merely being humbled, it's also finding a kind of exquisite dignity in the human condition of the open heart. 
But it is also being humbled again and again. 
And for me in that and in the kind of exploration of delusion, the willingness to be wrong, that is like a core Dharma skill. 
It's not one we're so good at. 
But the willingness to be wrong, the willingness to actually let go of the deep emotional attachment we have to the world, to ourselves being one way rather than another. 
That is a skill that we actually have to develop and nurture over the years and decades of practice. 
And it necessitates a lot of courage and humility. 
Delusion, to me, it feels like it's this kind of like slow, thawing process. 
It can't be rushed. 
There's something about the months and years of just sitting in closer and closer, more and more intimate contact with sensory experience so that when we build our grand theories of ourselves and the world, there's somehow more closely tethered to the moment by moment ground of experience. 
You know, Gil sometimes talks about like the concentric circles of our being and sort of like mental proliferation, Papancha being the furthest circle. 
And we keep getting closer in, closer in, closer in. 
And it's said that the antidote to delusion is actually paying very close attention moment by moment. 
Mindfulness, yeah. 
So we keep getting closer in and over time there is this kind of thawing process. 
And when I talk to meditators, it's some people I've known over a course of years, it's this very gradual process where you couldn't name it exactly week to week or day to day or even month to month. 
But over the years, there's just this kind of brightness and clarity of the mind, more and more kind of subtle and sensitive to one's inner and outer life. 
Jonathan Franzen said, said, the blanket of self deception, a lovely warm blanket as far as it covered the soul in torment, but it never quite covered everything. 
And so, in a way, we become dissatisfied with the parts of ourselves that the blanket of self deception does not cover. 
And there's this kind of growing willingness to put ourselves at risk to see more. 
And to do this, to establish this sense of willingness, we first have to get over a certain kind of shame in not knowing there's a kind of disorientation when the rug is pulled out from under our self understanding. 
And this is so poignant when we're being challenged in one way or another, like, you know, if we're getting some kind of feedback or something, or something's not working as we anticipate. 
And it's like the egoic mechanisms of reestablishing the old understanding of self are so active. 
They're really, like, mobilized by any threat to who we think we are or what makes us of value. 
And so there has to be a certain kind of equanimity and non-shame with the parts of ourselves we don't yet understand. 
Like, how does the mind constolate around not knowing? I am in a long lineage, genetically, of people with extremely low tolerance for not knowing, you know. 
Like, my dad doesn't even trust Siri, you know. 
Even when he really needs to surrender to the wisdom of Google Maps, but he won't, you know, because it's like, you know, I'm being playful, but this is real, actually. 
Like, the sense of literally and figuratively not knowing where he's going is haunting, yeah? And I felt that that's a kind of theme for me, too, to work with. 
How does the mind constolate around not knowing, yeah? So we established some willingness, as one of my friends said, like, if you want to know your conditioning, you will. 
And if you don't, you won't, yeah? But at the same time, so it was a kind of theme on the retreat I was just on, like, we can't fake curiosity, yeah? Do you know that experience of, like, you're with yourself and you know you're supposed to be mindful? I'm a meditator, I'm supposed to be aware, I'm supposed to be interested in phenomena, but you're so not, you know. 
Like, there's really, like, the sense of, like, oh yeah, I know, oh yeah, the teacher said, explore a version, like, alright, you know. 
And we're like pretending to ourselves, yeah? We're feigning interest, but we're really actually just kind of making a bargain, you know, with the aversion that, you know, it's like, I'll give you 30 seconds of mindfulness if you go away, you know? And so that movement is one from, like, the movement of, like, getting, getting to a movement of learning and opening, yeah? And if there isn't that kind of curiosity and willingness, like, genuine willingness, then it may be better actually not to follow that particular object, not to investigate that strand of delusion or aversion or greed, because, yeah, as Michelle McDonald says, like, sometimes if we're working in that way, we can actually be reinforcing the defilement rather than actually opening to it, yeah? So we look for a kind of the openings when the interest feels sincere, when there's just a sense of, you know, it's like we get a little, I don't know, maybe just fatigued by our conditioning, you know? And sometimes it does feel like maybe there's a, for me, there's a little aversion in there, a little like, like, but it's just kind of like, ah, I'm just enough, you know, enough. 
And it doesn't have, like, a self-punitive thing, or it doesn't have, like, a sense of, yeah, self-hatred or something like that, but there's a certain kind of, like, just motivation and clarity, urgency, like, I really want to understand this, even if it doesn't go away. 
In some ways, it doesn't matter whether this conditioning dissolves, like, I want to understand what is happening here. 
Why does this keep happening? Why do I keep doing this? Yeah. 
So we approach delusion in some ways by, we kind of try on wise view, even if it doesn't feel totally native to us, you know? Like, we, right, it's that notion of, like, sutama apanya, like, the sense of, like, we actually bring some of our book learning, some of what we may have heard in a talk or something like that, something we've read, and we actually try to bring that to experience as a way of breaking the hermetically sealed container of delusion, you know? So we bring in wise view. 
We bring in, for me, it's like, to honor the most fundamental distinction, which is not between right and wrong or good and evil, but between suffering and its absence. 
Yeah. 
And just that framework, just, like, letting that be the guiding distinction for how we understand our lives and the lives of others is helpful. 
We prepare the mind. 
We actually, there's a lot of value just in getting quiet in the kind of frenzy of the mind when it feels like we're so bombarded by phenomena, it's hard to actually know what we're even believing. 
Yeah. 
Like, with the kind of chaotic noise of the mind, it's like, we actually have trouble tracing out what our commitments are. 
Yeah. 
And a lot of Dharma practice is actually noticing with more and more subtlety what we actually believe, or what our behavior conveys about our beliefs, our commitments, what it conveys about how we think we will be happy, what we think will end the seeking in the heart. 
And so we start to actually get really interested in this. 
Now, greed, aversion and delusion are deeply connected. 
And what I've found is that often it is delusion that rationalizes greed and aversion. 
Yeah. 
It's my delusion that allows me to kind of like pull a fast one and like explain away patterns of greed and aversion of clinging. 
Yeah. 
And, yeah, Wes Nisker said something like, he said something like, we're less, we're less rational animals and more rationalizing animals, you know. 
Like, that's deep, actually, you know, to look how we have rationalized our lives, rationalized our commitments, ourself. 
Yeah. 
Real courage in looking at that. 
But we can do this. 
Yeah. 
So I'm thinking about a friend who was like, who was deeply hurt by another friend, you know. 
And I watch and this person is a very, very kind of thoughtful, persuasive meditation teacher, actually. 
And so he like, at some level, our job up here is being persuasive. 
Yeah. 
By the way, just as an editorial side note, it's basically just to get you not to leave. 
That's like the main job description, you know. 
So this friend was like really deeply hurt. 
It cut like, it was just a real grief and also like a kind of egoic wounding in this. 
Yeah. 
And I just watched as his mind like, essentially, like began creating this whole elaborate narrative to justify a sense of betrayal and vindictiveness, to insulate him from the pain of the loss and to essentially explain away the aversion that came in the wake of it. 
Yeah. 
And it was like so the way that he did it was so elegant, you know, like, like so artfully self deceptive, you know, and he even like sprinkled in some Dharma themes, you know, to make it seem like you could buy it, you know, like, you know what I mean? Like, like there's like a little hat tip to certain Dharma principles, but at its base, it was a purely defensive mental proliferation, you know, and an unwillingness actually to feel the brunt of the initial impact of the pain. 
Yeah. 
And that birth, this whole elaborate mental schema that he may well live in for years, you know, and maybe we too have been living in something like that for years. 
Or maybe as our practice unfolds, we realize in retrospect that we've been rationalizing a certain kind of relationship to our own pain. 
And it's been keeping us in the swirl of delusion. 
So in in delusion, there's a kind of confusion reigns as a clear lack of clarity, a kind of ambivalence, uncertainty. 
And generally when we're faced with with certain kinds of ambivalence or ambiguity, we just try to think something to death, you know. 
And but sometimes we're just recapitulating the same mind state of ruminative delusion. 
And so we're trying to, you know, that famous quote, I think from Einstein, like, like, we're trying to solve the problem with the same tools that created it. 
Yeah. 
This is Philip Moffat. 
From a Buddhist psychological perspective, when you're caught in a debilitating ambivalence or ambiguity, your mind is either deluded and clinging to a desire for your life to be perfect, or it's afraid and wanting a guarantee that what you're doing is the right thing to do. 
Or it's refusing to participate in the dance of life due to some unconscious or conscious aversion to uncertainty. 
These mind states begin to limit your capacity to live fully and you're less effective in meeting your goals in the areas where they manifest. 
When ambivalence is debilitating your minds in a flu-like state and reality is obscured, you feel stuck, dissatisfied, restless, or uncertain. 
In the language of Buddhist psychology, you lack clear comprehension, samphijanya, of what is being called for and how you might respond to that call. 
So we want to look for cues around delusion. 
And one place to look sometimes as useful is the cue is like around alterations in our arousal level. 
Like the kind of numbed-out, dead-end state or the hyperaroused, reactive, kind of very brittle mind. 
And sometimes that is actually a cue like, okay, what is going on here? What is going on? We track our sila, our ethical conduct. 
We actually look like to examine the spheres of our life where we feel deeply aligned with our own kind of North Star, with our own deepest ethical commitments. 
And then we also look in the spheres of our life where we fall short of that standard. 
And sometimes it's the ethical lapses that actually are the kind of smoke signal of some kind of delusion hanging out. 
We look for the moments when the narrative of our life is chugging along in a coherent, predictable way, and then something happens and it gets interrupted. 
Do you know those moments where something happens and it's like this break with what we've known before? Sometimes this comes in the form of deep loss, but not always. 
Sometimes it's something very positive or something quite minor, but there's this rupture in the narrative of our life, the voiceover that's been narrating our life. 
And something breaks. 
And usually we kind of close down around moments like that, but there is an opportunity actually to look like what delusion was I resting upon. 
And for me, the kind of default assumption of the mind into permanence, the assumption of permanence, of reliability, that is like a delusion to which we must awaken many, many times. 
Like how long have I been hearing teachings on a Nietzsche? And how shocked am I by change? It's like so humbling. 
There's a real value, I think, here in cross-cultural exchange and travel and being in communities of which you're not familiar. 
One of the effects of that for me is like the sense, like it feels like the way I do everything is like the natural way to do it, like the preordained way. 
This is just how you live. 
This is how you cook and clean and move and do everything. 
It's like how could you do it any other way, right? If we thought there was a different, better way, we would be doing it. 
So of course this is where you put the toothbrush, right? So the bizarreness of our choices and lives and commitments and values is highlighted by seeing other people or cultures where people just do things differently. 
And you realize like, whoa, I'm totally situated in my own culture that maybe was invisible to me but is highly idiosyncratic. 
And just like actually cutting through some of that can shake the mind out of its own deluded assumptions. 
My teacher kind of main influence with Shenzhen Yang and at some point he said, kind of offhandedly, he said there are two maxims for spiritual practice. 
And the implication was like, all right, these two things are sort of like take you all the way. 
They're sufficient principles. 
He said the first thing was don't fight with yourself at any level. 
And the second was take feedback. 
And I so value the kind of place in the pantheon of spiritual principles, like a feedback being so highly placed, yeah? Whatever we do, however awake we try to be to delusion, there is forever the possibility that we are missing something critical. 
And so we come to rely on others, the feedback of others who are seeing from a different perspective. 
And this is something we can actually come to cherish, you know? Like I really have tried to train myself to be open to feedback, you know, as a facet of becoming more awake and more safe for others. 
Yeah, because it's really from our places of unconsciousness of delusion that we perpetrate harm, you know? It's not merely aversion, it's usually the kind of wedding of aversion and delusion together. 
And so it becomes something of a moral responsibility, certainly for if you're teaching meditation or something. 
It's like a moral imperative to be open to feedback, to critical feedback, yeah? And so we do what we can to wake up and enlightenment is usually characterized according to how high the heights are, but I'm very interested in how low our depths are, yeah? And raising that the waterline, yeah? Not merely knowing the heights, but actually attending like to the depths of our confusion and to spreading the Dharma more and more broadly into the corners of our lives. 
So that we may be safe in our own experience and that we may be safe for others. 
May you be well.
