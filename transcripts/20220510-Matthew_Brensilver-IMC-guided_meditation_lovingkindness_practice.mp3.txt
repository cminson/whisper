 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So good morning, good afternoon, welcome to all of you. I see there's a watermark on the video where I'm running the YouTube and so using my Zoom account and David Geffen gave, I think, a quarter billion dollars to UCLA and so you get your name on IMC's Zoom feed for that kind of sum. Anyway, happy to be with you, to be sitting together and yeah, maybe I'll just say a word before we sit. A mentor of mine will do some, will settle in, do some metta practice, love and kindness practice. Mentor of mine said, Matthew, there's a difference between kindness and niceness, and you're being nice. So, yeah, metta is not niceness, you know, it's a deeper kindness. And it's not pretending. It's not pretending. We have to be very careful about pretending to feel one thing when we're feeling another in our practice. Because when we pretend, it erodes some confidence in our path, in ourselves. Our heart is very sensitive to the misalignment of of pretending. And so we're never asked to pretend. Yeah, we're never asked to pretend. This is about an authentic encounter with our own heart. And there's some way to connect with what's actually here in an authentic way. There was some, one of the Brahma Vaharas is here for you. Yeah, one of them's always here for you. And so there's never a need to pretend to turn kindness into niceness or something like this. Yeah. So, let's sit together. This is the spirit of kindness towards your own body. The astounding number of things it's doing right in this moment, even if our attention goes to what feels like it's doing wrong. Thank you. One of my teachers said that your body, your body is done. Generosity. Some kind of gift. Your body is done. Maybe this begins to open your heart. As we settle, breathe as we do his first couple minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mmm, that is love in the face of goodness. So we can attune to our own, our own goodness. It's not grandiose or something. The goodness is, we might detect, is nothing we would want to brag about. It's a goodness that softens our heart. Maybe it's a goodness that you overlook always in yourself. It's a goodness that you overlook always in yourself. It's a goodness that you overlook always in yourself. I promise this is not a self-indulgent kind of affirmation. The more deeply we sense in and appreciate and abide in our own goodness, the more obvious that becomes in the eyes of others. We consider our goodness, maybe rest in the kind of heart center, your chest, pulsating, feeling life of maybe a little bit of warmth, a little softening, a little bit of love, and just stay with the signs of love and care and softening. You are and so when we silently whisper to ourselves, may I be happy. It's really not a prayer about some future that may come. It is a way of touching into the heart right now, of ringing a bell and then listening to the reverberations in your body, softening your body, making your body more porous. You with we are moved by our own goodness, moved by the innocence of our own longing to be happy. You you you you you maybe it's useful to use words, images, may I be happy, may I be safe, protected, may I live what he is, may I be happy, we start to drop some of the vigilance, the vigilance of patrolling ourself, the vigilance of arrogance, the vigilance of self-hatred. We drop all of that. Maybe right now it's safe enough to be moved by your own goodness, to abide in this kind of quiet love, may I be safe, may I be safe, may I be safe, may I be safe, may I be safe, may I be safe, may I be safe, may I be safe, may I be safe, may I be safe, may I be safe, may I be safe, may I be safe, may I be safe, you don't offer yourself this meta because of something, you just offer that. you you you you
