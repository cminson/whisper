You
So a poem from the Tarigata
about a new translation, kind of
elaboration from Maddie Weinglas and
Aya Nandubodi, the first
first free women.
And these are known as kind of
enlightenment poems of early
early Buddhist nuns and they're
just titled for the name of the
nun.
This is a Rohini.
You don't become the cloth just
because you put on robes.
You don't turn into empty space
just because you carry a bowl.
The sun doesn't bow down.
The trees don't throw flowers at
your feet.
Birds don't start answering when
you call.
The path will hold even the
biggest mistakes.
The path will make room for even
your deepest regrets.
But you don't become the cloth of
the robe overnight.
You begin very quietly something
you barely even notice.
Like the touch of water on your
skin.
Like a knife in a drawer.
Like the next five minutes.
Unless they're your last.
The path isn't a line on a map.
It isn't.
It's a great shine.
World.
Enter.
You like.
You might get thrown back once or
twice.
But if you push through the outer
layers.
Oh my sisters.
Then you will know the true
welcome.
That is the very essence of the
path.
The path is in a line.
So the.
The whole thing couldn't be
unpacked in the course of Dharma
talk.
But.
What struck me the line.
Yeah.
The path isn't a line on a map.
It's a great shining world.
Enter wherever you like.
You know,
sometimes we have the sense that we need to
to kind of fit, fit into the Dharma, to fit into the path.
But we don't so much assimilate to the path
as find our own belonging within it.
We don't, we don't have to kind of mold our heart
in to fit some notion of what Dharma culture is.
Because instead we find our own belonging within the Dharma.
Yeah, she says, you know, enter, enter wherever,
it's a great shining world, wherever you like.
And that sense of, of belonging,
that's very, very powerful motivation in our species.
And yeah, over time the Dharma, we find, we find our belonging
within the Dharma that feels more and more like home,
including all of the pieces of our heart.
Yeah, we're not forced to leave anything behind ultimately.
Yeah.
So we continue building our roads together and
yeah, entering, we can enter from anywhere, from anywhere,
even so remote, even when it feels like we have to contort
into some, something we can enter from anywhere.
Yeah.
So yeah, as you go to bed, if whenever that is,
it's not, it's not, not narcissism to actually affirm
the value of your efforts.
To actually, like, just, yeah, affirm the value of your efforts.
And yeah, find our own belonging within Dharma.
So yeah, may you, may you practice well and rest well and wake well.
And we keep going seeing what Dharma doors open,
even though we could swear that they're, they're walls.
Okay. Thank you.
