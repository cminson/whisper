The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Welcome, welcome again. Nice to see you all here. So tonight I'd like to start with
a little story. It's just a brief little story that's in the Vasude Manga. This is a little
bit later than the Polly Cannon. And I'm embellishing this story, so this isn't it verbatim.
But it goes like this. So imagine that you're in the desert and you don't have any water.
And you have some distance to travel and it's pretty precarious. And then as you're traveling you
come over a little rise into the distance you see like, oh, it looks like that might be palm trees.
But you're not sure. It might be a mirage. So you head that direction and you notice, yeah,
okay, it seems pretty steady. Those palm trees are still there. As you start walking you start
encountering people and they have wet hair. And they're carrying bundles of wet clothes. So this
gives you some encouragement like, okay, this is an oasis. It's just right over there. And you
get really excited having been in the desert and then saying, okay, here's an oasis. So you keep
on walking, you arrive and it's beautiful. There's this big lake of this cool water. You feel so
happy. Like, oh, it's here. Plenty of water. Nice and cool here. There's shade under the trees.
Then you drink the water. You jump in the lake. You get cleaned up. You get refreshed. You get out
feeling really contented, happy. And then you lie down in the shade of a tree and have a rest.
You're not asleep. Maybe you're just resting against the tree. Maybe you're not lying down.
But there's a certain amount of contentment that arises. This certain feeling of okay. Not a lot
of troubles, but just happy to be there. So this desert crossing the desert without water might
sometimes feel like our practice, our life, that there's this burdensome and difficult and not
feeling nourished, not feeling like we have enough. And this sense that we have to go somewhere,
we have to go across this sandy desert that's not so easy to walk on sand sometimes. There's
this relentless heat and maybe you're even feeling a little bit lost, not sure where you're going.
And then this idea of glimpsing an oasis, glimpsing, oh, there might be something here that can be
a support that can be something that's nourishing and find some respite from the heat and from this
thirst. Maybe in our practice, maybe this was early in our practice recognizing that maybe
mindfulness is a place that can provide some benefit or provide some nourishment in some kind
of way. But in the beginning, we often just have this glimpse of it and we don't necessarily trust
it. But we have a glimpse enough that we're willing to keep on going. And then when we have seen others
who are coming with the wet hair or with bundles of wet clothes or something, it's kind of like
being inspired by maybe coming to a meditation center, maybe meditating with others and seeing,
oh, there's others who practice this way. They seem happy or relaxed or satisfied or
they have wet hair. And at that moment, that's what you're looking for is wet hair when you're
in the desert, hot, feeling like you're thirsty. So we see clues that aren't just that are just
a little bit more than these little glimpses that we might have with mindfulness. And there's a
certain delight, there's a can be a certain uprising of maybe this is for me too. And then
when we arrive at the oasis, I realize there's plenty of water, plenty of water. There's this
feeling of happiness like, okay, okay, here's I can stay here for a while and drink some of this
water and feel like I like supported and nourished by it. And then we also dive in the water, we
feel refreshed and there's something inside of us that starts to settle like, oh, okay,
there's something here that's going to be helpful for me. Then we have this certain amount of
contentment. Often we think about this contentment arises because we got what we wanted, we wanted
some water. But I'd like to encourage us to think about another way to interpret this as the
contentment arises is because we are no longer have this strong desire for water. It's the ending
of the desire that wish for something different than what we're having that allows us some
contentment, rather than just getting what we want. So often in our lives, we do actually get
what we want. But having noticed how it doesn't really the satisfaction for that doesn't last very
long. We do get to sleep in sometimes we do have good meals sometimes the weather is beautiful
sometimes we do get these things that we want. But it never seems quite enough. So the contentment
is not just because we got what we want, but because there's the desire has been abated,
the desire has been rested, and there's more than one way to let the desire quiet so that it's
often I'm going to talk a little bit more about this. But still I want to kind of say something
about this, this story. After drinking the water or diving in the water, then this idea of like
maybe leaning against one of these palm trees and taking a rest. Maybe we're not sleeping,
but now just viewing and seeing what else is happening at this oasis. This recognition that
nothing else needs to be done right now. We got here, we have some water, presumably there's
some food to you or maybe we already had food with us. And so there's no sense of urgency if
things have to be different, no pushing or pulling kind of you like pushing trying to
shove our experiences away or pulling trying to keep our experiences with us, but just relaxed
under the tree. And so from this place of relaxing underneath the tree, we can see things
differently than if when we were feeling lost in the desert. So literally we see things differently.
In the case of this story, we see the water, we see the palm trees. But we all have this experience
too that when we're hungry and tired or didn't sleep well or got bad news or whatever it might be,
then we see things a particular way compared to when we feel content, relaxed, happy, we see things
a different way. In the case when we're a little bit grumpy, and because we haven't eaten or we're
tired or whatever it might be. And maybe we tend to kind of like look at the negative side or
have a little bit more contracted view, but when we're relaxed and feel content or certain
amount of contentment, then there's going to be a little bit more open our view what we see,
what we're noticing. And not only that, there can be a little bit more steadiness. This feeling
like things are okay. Yeah, okay, the kids are really loud when they're playing in the water over
there, but it's okay. Whereas, you know, if we were in a little bit of a bad mood, we might get really
irritated about the kids playing in the water, for example. So we could say that Buddhist practice
is about just this being able to see things differently, to create the conditions in which
there can be this being able to see the bigger picture, and to have a certain amount of steadiness,
to not feel like we're being buffeted or pushed around by our experiences, but to have a little
bit more relaxed and open perspective and to see what's arising and what's really happening,
as opposed to just being caught and consumed with the difficulties. And to no longer have this
enchantment of or lost in stories about how things are or how we wish they were, but to actually see
how they are. So in this story, there's a certain amount of joy and happiness that supports the
arising of this contentment that supports the arising of being able to see clearly. So joy and
happiness are an integral part of practice, but they're not the point of practice. We need them,
we need them for our life, but they're also a support for practice, partly because they help
create the conditions in which there can be a certain amount of relaxation, a certain amount of
openness that we can see a little bit bigger. So our spiritual path isn't only about having great
experiences. Our meditation practice isn't only about having wonderful meditative experiences.
We all know that these experiences cannot be sources of lasting happiness. They can bring
pleasure and there can be happiness, but they're not sources of lasting happiness. In contrast,
being able to see things clearly can be a source of lasting happiness when we start to see how
things really are and to put down the stories we have or the busyness in the mind that we have
that prevents us from seeing. So this seeing the bigger picture with a certain amount of steadiness,
we could call this equanimity. And the poly word is upeka and etymologically we could say that
upeka means to look upon. And one way, one reason why I kind of like this way of understanding
upeka is look upon is to highlight that it's different than look away. It's look upon. Because
sometimes equanimity, people think like well it's a certain amount of indifference or detachment or
coolness or indifference or something like that. And I would say no, that's more about looking away.
But equanimity is born out of this joy and happiness and contentment. It's not the only way to get
equanimity, it's one way. And it's about to look upon, to see the big picture, not just what we're
concerned with at that moment, but to be able to see what other people are doing, what's happening
with them, to see that not only is maybe the children are really allowed that are playing,
but also it's comfortable underneath this tree. And maybe I feel a little bit hot, but I'm not
thirsty. So we don't get stuck on the things that are unpleasant or stuck on the things that are
pleasant, but be able to see the whole range. There's perfectly neutral things happening,
unpleasant things happening, and pleasant things happening. So in some ways, we might imagine,
I talked about it, this contentment is kind of like leaning against the tree, but maybe it's more
about being at the top of a hill, and then you can see further, you can see a little bit wider,
maybe that's a better way to imagine kind of this idea of Upaka. And so Upaka has this awareness of
whatever is happening. It's connected to what's happening, seeing what's happening. But it also
has this inner balance, this steadiness, this being connected to the foundation. In some ways,
we can think of it like how sailboats have a keel. I'm not a sailor, I know that Jim is a sailor
here, but a keel, my understanding is, you know, this blade, I'll call it a blade, it's underneath
the boat that helps it to not tip over when the winds are pushing on it. So equanimity in some
ways is like having this keel that allows us to experience the winds. The winds are still there,
but we're not going to tip over with them. It helps keep the boat upright. So it's this
steadiness of mind and steadiness of heart in the face of still being connected with whatever's
happening. All of our inner and our outer experiences. So not only what we see out
there is the way I was describing it, but also what we see in here, our experiences. Maybe we
notice that some impatience. With equanimity, like, okay, it's just impatience, we don't have to add
a story on, I'm a bad person, I've been practicing all these years, I shouldn't be impatient or
something like that. And so with equanimity, it makes our lives easier, of course it does,
not being pushed around so much by our experiences. Whether our experiences include the news cycle or
difficulties with finances or partners or our inner life feelings of confusion or despair or
racing thoughts, troubling thoughts, whatever it might be. But equanimity allows us to not stumble
around or be pushed around by these. Recently, I had to take some medication that for a little while
that I knew was going to make me feel a little bit off. I'll just use this vague word off because
that's what it felt like. And somehow just like having this knowledge like, okay, I don't feel so
great. But it's just because I'm taking this medication, just that kind of a knowledge allowed
me to like, okay, that's just how it is right now. So sometimes just being able to see
the bigger picture, seeing that, oh, things, there's conditions for what's arising. There are
reasons for what's arising. And sometimes having that understanding can help us to have the
steadiness of equanimity. So in this way, equanimity helps us to see bigger. But seeing bigger also
helps us to understand the conditionality, maybe, right? No guarantees. But we can see,
like, oh, okay, of course, I feel this way. I didn't sleep well last night, I'm taking this
medication, whatever it might be. So equanimity also helps us to see more deeply into our
experience with this steadiness of heart, the steadiness of mind. And some way, equanimity can
be like a tripod that allows a telescope, or it could be like a microscope that allows us to see
more deeply, something that we wouldn't be able to see just with our regular busyness or regular
ways of interacting with our environment. And so what do we see when we see things more deeply?
We see that they're changing. There's so many different ways we can talk about changing. There's
can be the, all these different timescales, right? Things that have the nature to arise have the
nature to pass away. Things that have the nature to be born have the nature to die.
But also, there can be when the mind is really quiet and really settled, we can start to see
that there's a little bit of an afflickering of our experiences. The things aren't as steady and solid
as we might imagine them to be. So equanimity helps us to see this quality of our experiences.
Unlike this sense of like something being stuck and impenetrable or
unable to really have a way in which there's any flexibility.
Instead of that, we can see, oh yeah, okay, this isn't as solid as I thought it was, this
uncomfortable experience in my knee when I'm sitting. Maybe that's not just this pain, but with
equanimity we could see that we have the patience, we have the capacity to just be with the experience
a little bit longer and to see the flickering quality of it. We also can see that our experiences
are not inherently satisfying. To be sure there are pleasant experiences and there are unpleasant
experiences, but we still haven't quite found that experience that's going to be a source of
lasting happiness. And with seeing more deeply, we start to see even those things that we were
pretty sure we're going to make our life better, make things happy or satisfying in some way.
We start to see, oh yeah, even those aren't as satisfying. And we find that even though we
might be chasing after things, thinking that this is going to be the thing that's going to make me happy.
With some steadiness we can see, oh yeah, actually it doesn't make sense to hold on to this thing,
this that promise of this experience, the promise of this object. Because it's not as steady as I
thought. The naturally our relationship to those objects or those experiences shift. It's just
natural we don't have to make it happen and we just are not holding on so tightly.
And then when we're not holding on so tightly, there can be more ease or freedom or spaciousness.
And as we do this and as we explore our experiences with that mind and a heart that has some equanimity,
we start to understand our experiences more fully. And we start to see that every time there's a liking
of something, that means there's a disliking of something else. It's just impossible to not have
one without the other. And so we start to see like, oh yeah, chasing after our preferences.
Just really highlights everything that isn't our preference instead of just having a little bit
more open and relaxed view about things and not having to be so much spending our energy
and our time trying to just surround ourselves exclusively with our preferences.
So this not chasing after our preferences, seeing things aren't quite as satisfying,
seeing that there are changes, as I said, creates this conditions in which there can be this letting
go of this kind of little bit more spaciousness. That that alone allows the mind to be even more
unagitated. Unliberation, freedom is an unagitated state. So in this way, spending some time with
equanimity, cultivating equanimity, recognizing equanimity, is a way in which we are kind of
like the goals and the means that get similar. If freedom is unagitated and equanimity isn't
type of unagitation, we can see where equanimity is a help support, the type of letting go
that supports liberation, as well as itself being an experience that's similar to liberation.
In the same family. So sometimes we might think as a concept equanimity just might seem unappealing.
Some people say that they don't really want equanimity. It sounds boring. It sounds flat.
Instead, they might want this juiciness, this gusto, this of the joy, and we want the excitement,
of experience, or we might this passionate involvement with life. And it might sound like
sometimes when we hear this word equanimity, it might feel like there's a sort of
disconnection or not caring. And to be sure, indifference sometimes masquerades as equanimity.
And there will be times in our practice when we slide into indifference, when we kind of disconnect
from our experience, and we're feeling a little bit shut down, and maybe we're feeling a little bit
cold and removed. That's natural this happens, but that's not equanimity. That's more indifference.
And in some ways, I might say that it's important for us to have that experience,
to have this indifference arise, to recognize, oh, this is what it feels like to be disconnected.
This is what it feels like when there's might be some less agitation.
But there's also a sense of disconnection or not caring, or this arises when there's a little bit
of aversion as a reason. Sometimes we might even call this aversion, but it can feel,
we might have this idea that that's what equanimity is. But instead, equanimity has this sense of
aliveness, this sense of vitality, this sense of connection that's with some openness and spaciousness
and warmth. But another reason why equanimity might not sound like it's something more so
interested in is because we might come to believe that there might be this underlying belief that
we're not so sure why would our life be like if we didn't have lots of drama in some way or other.
The drama of getting rid of some difficulty or the drama of defending one's sense of self or
the drama of bolstering one's sense of self, make sure we look good to everybody. I'm using this
word drama. Sometimes it is dramatic. Sometimes it's really subtle, also, these types of things.
But maybe we're a little bit unsure what would be there if we didn't have this. Maybe I could
use the word busyness, this busyness of trying to get rid of the difficulty, solve some problem,
trying to bolster this self, make ourselves look good. So that might be another reason
why there might be some hesitation or maybe this idea that, I don't know, equanimity just
doesn't sound so interesting. But I would like to say that what we all really want
is some stable sense of well-being that can't be shaken by circumstances.
And this arises when we have some equanimity.
And some ways like the mind with equanimity is like a mountain that it remains there even
when there's tornadoes or hurricanes or these types of things. We might have this idea we want
to be happy and certainly we do. But there's this way in which always like searching for
happiness because things that we think are going to be happy make us happy, turn out not to make
us happy. So then there's this relentless search which might be subtle. But can you imagine what
it might be like to have like this really radical contentment? It's okay. Everything's okay.
I don't have to go fix that. It's not perfect. I don't have to fix it. I don't have to hold
on to this. It's enjoyable, but I'll be okay if it goes. I think this is so much what human
beings are really looking for. Maybe a place to rest, a place to feel safe,
and a place that in order to have that it can't be susceptible to whatever's happening in our
the world or whatever's happening in our inner life. And I like this. There's these few lines from
the awakening poem from Sabuti. Sabuti was a monk at the time of the Buddha.
And it was the tradition sometimes to capture these poems about when people had awakening
experiences. And the way that he describes this reminds me of this idea of equanimity.
So that's part of his awakening verses goes like this.
My little hut is roofed and pleasant, sheltered from the wind. So rain, sky, as you please.
I don't know if there's something very sweet about this. I kind of like this that
his roofed that he has this refuge, he has this shelter and sheltered from the wind.
I think many of us have heard about these eight worldly winds, these things that push us around.
Praise and blame, fame and disrepute, gain and loss, and pleasure and pain. And of course,
we only want one half of all of those dyads. But every life gets both, both halves of those.
We get all eight. There's nobody that's immune to this.
But Sabuti talks about in his hut that's roofed and pleasant, sheltered from the wind.
So rain, sky, or sky, rain, as you please. So he's not trying to make things be a particular way.
He's maybe it'll be sunny, maybe it'll be rainy, it's okay. But having the confidence
that we can meet whatever might arise. So equanimity, I talked about the way that
I, in this whole story that I started with is, you know, feeling like you're in the desert and then
having the happiness or the joy of seeing the oasis, the happiness of having actually drunk from the
oasis. So that's one way in which we can have some equanimity is to keep practicing when we
encounter joy and happiness. There are moments that may not be large, giant moments, but there are
some moments of joy and happiness that do arise in our life. Yay. The weather is going to be great.
Yay. The newspaper arrived on time in the morning. So what if you, for those of us who still read
newspapers, have them delivered. I was just visiting my mom recently and she does. I have to say I just
love this to God in the morning and get the paper. I myself don't, but I just love this my mom's house.
So to keep practicing when we encounter joy and happiness, often we kind of like stop practicing.
There's a way we might like stop being mindful or we might feel like we don't need to practice
anymore because maybe in some ways we feel like we arrived, we got what we wanted. We have this joy,
we have this happiness and that's the purpose of practice. So I'm going to stop.
But there's an encouragement. Can we stay mindful? Can we still be with the experience,
not abandon ourselves with it, experience it fully, but not forget practice in a relaxed,
easy, gentle way. And this is a natural progression to go from joy, which tends to have a little more
energetic feeling, happiness, which has a little more subtle contented feeling, and then to equanimity.
Doesn't always happen, but that's one way in. So just an encouragement to continue practicing
when you're experiencing joy and happiness. Another way is to actually really cultivate this,
I might say this inner reservoir of well-being, this well, this reservoir that can be a resource
no matter what their circumstances are. So to spend time really noticing when there is any sense of
well-being, that feeling that we get when we are generous to others, that feeling when we are letting
those people close to us know how much we care about them. When we're doing loving kindness
practice, maybe there's a way in which the heart opens. So really tuning into these experiences
when they do arise, maybe they're not that often, maybe they're very often whatever it is for you.
Tuning in, it's just so that the heart and the mind remember that there is this capacity for
this feeling of well-being. And so there's less fear about loss, for example, if there's a part
of us that understands where deep happiness arises. Deep happiness arises from this letting go,
from this opening, from this relaxing. Sometimes it arises from an external experience that
brings pleasure, but pleasure is not the same as happiness. And it's really would behoove us to
kind of like explore that how are they related but distinct. That all happiness comes out of pleasure.
But the more we are able to dip into this sense of well-being, the less likely we are to be thrown
off by balance, thrown off balance by these eight worldly wins, play. Praise and blame, gain and
loss, pleasure and pain, fame and dispute. And so one more way that there's a number of ways we can
work with equanimity. Another way is to just practice with some of the wisdom practices
and to remind ourselves, yeah, things do change. It's the nature of things to not be inherently
satisfying, partly because they change. And so to borrow some of this wisdom that we know from
other experiences that allows us to maybe relax and soften a little bit into open. So that then
we can sit on the hill and to see a little bit bigger, have a bigger vista, bigger view.
Maybe you can imagine that you don't know how to swim and you fall in the water
and then you thrash around, right? If you don't know how to swim, of course you do.
You feel like, okay, I gotta get out here. But if you have a life jacket on, then you can paddle
around and find your way. You don't have this fear of drowning. So cultivating well-being or
borrowing some wisdom can be a way which can be some life jackets that can help us to
have some equanimity in no matter whether the water is cold or hot or just right.
So joy, happiness, well-being, help create the conditions for equanimity to arise.
Equanimity is sometimes said to be a higher happiness because it allows for this steadiness
in the face of whatever is happening. And then equanimity creates the conditions for letting go
which is said to be the highest happiness.
So without this idea that this oppressive idea that we have to be happy all the time and that
we have to have joy in all these things, just in this talk I wanted to connect this idea of
happiness and equanimity. And then equanimity to liberation. So this idea that happiness is an
integral part of our path. We can cultivate, we can roll around in it. There's no reason not to
allow ourselves to be nourished by it and then stick with it with the practice and allow it to
turn into a certain contentment which can be a support for equanimity. That equanimity can be
a support for letting go which is a support for greater and greater freedom which of course is
happiness. So here we go kind of like this circle. So with that I'd like to wish you all a wonderful
memorial day. I didn't connect this necessarily to memorial day but it occurred to me that oh,
today is memorial day. So wishing you all a wonderful evening. Thank you.
