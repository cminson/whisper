The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good morning. Nice to be here with you.
Redwood City.
There's a couple things I want to share with you
before I get into my talk
this morning, which will be about identity.
But let me read you my favorite poem,
my current favorite poem.
It changes, but Mary Oliver is often involved.
This is called A Settlement.
Look at summer, and last year's loose dust has turned into this soft willingness.
The wind flowers are up, trembling.
Slowly the bracken are up, lifting their crevaceous and pale bodies.
The thrushes have come home, filled with mystery, sorrow, happiness, music, ambition.
And I am walking out into all of this with nowhere to go and no task undertaken,
to turn the pages of this beautiful world over and over
in the world of my mind.
Therefore, dark past, I'm about to do it.
I'm about to forgive you for everything.
Therefore, dark past, I'm about to do it.
I'm about to forgive you for everything.
I think that's so beautiful.
What if you could forgive everything?
You never made a mistake.
You were always exactly doing exactly what you needed to do at the time.
That there was no fault involved.
The slate is clean.
Wouldn't that feel wonderful?
It reminds me of an Ikkyu poem, a famous Japanese poet.
How many times do I have to tell you there is no way not to be who you are and where?
No choice.
So the Dalai Lama turned 80 and he had a few wonderful things to say
at a conversation when he was celebrated in New York.
He said, if you think you are too small to make a difference,
try sleeping in a room with a mosquito.
He also said, know the rules well so you can break them effectively.
And this line, compassion is the radicalism of our time.
The Dalai Lama and Pope Francis both on the planet.
There is hope.
So this morning I want to talk about identity.
And it's really a talk about Dharma and deep ecology and how they kind of meet.
Dharma and science and how they meet.
The Buddha and Darwin, how they might have gotten along quite well.
I've joked before and I'll do it again right now
that all of the Buddha's teaching can be summed up in a knock-knock joke.
So the disciples come to the master and they say,
the master answers with the number one question, spiritual question,
who's there?
Now if you don't get the joke, you have to be reborn over and over again
until you do get it.
But that is the question.
The Buddha said that true happiness can only be found
by eliminating the false conceit of I or self.
And ever since we humans grew these big brains,
we've been asking ourselves, who are we?
Where did we come from? Where are we going?
What's this life in this universe all about?
And to answer those questions, we've come up with some fantastic stories
about gods and devils and heavens and hells.
And humans have become so arrogant,
we believe the entire universe was made just for us.
That we were separately and specially created.
Some of us even believe that we were created in God's image.
That God looks like this.
Go figure.
And our major religions have come to regard the Earth
as a kind of training planet.
A place where you come and you learn some lessons
or burn off some karma and then you get to go off to some other place
where you truly belong.
But those stories are not only old and a little ludicrous,
but they're dysfunctional.
They take our reverence away from this world
and they remove the human from the web of life.
It may be one reason why these old stories
may be one reason why we are creating such havoc on the planet.
Luckily, we're starting to tell ourselves a new story.
And the new story says we are intertwined with all and everything.
In physics they talk about entanglement.
Or the chaos theory which says that every time I move my hand
the whole universe is involved.
The new story tells us that we are related to all the life that's ever lived.
All of us descended from the same single-celled beings.
All of us cell brothers and cell sisters.
Can you dig it?
And this new story we're telling ourselves is based on science,
so it must be true, right?
I call it the latest greatest story ever told.
It's really interesting. The Buddha was really a great scientist.
He used the scientific method.
He said develop this quality of mindfulness
and go into the wilderness of yourself
and examine the body, the feelings, the thoughts.
And question as you're examining,
what is the origin?
What is the ancestry of this construct called self?
In other words, bring your attention down into this living being
and examine it with that question, who am I?
What we will find, said the Buddha and Charlie Darwin,
what we will find is that none of it is I, me, or mine.
That we co-arise with all things,
sun, atmosphere, earth, elements,
that there are so many factors in our experience
that create our experience to impute a self in there is a stretch,
a real stretch.
And I think probably everyone in this room believes
that the story of evolution is true,
but we probably don't really get it yet.
We haven't really discovered the spiritual message of that story.
I think that we need meditations about evolution
and rituals and songs and dance.
The fact that we are part of this ongoing story, this unfolding story
of life on this planet.
I thought, well, we could start by chanting the table of basic elements.
Hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, car.
It's kind of mantra quality with all those ums and ons.
When we meditate, we bring our attention down from the story of our life
to the fact of our life, and we actually begin to feel ourselves as living beings.
That can happen. That happens.
And with a little reflection, it happens more.
Just feeling life with this unique condition inside of you.
With your breath, with every breath, with a little reflection,
you realize that you are exchanging nutrients with the plant kingdom.
That with every breath, you become a cell,
a part of the great breathing of this planet, which is continually breathing.
It's one of its characteristics.
The story of evolution tells us that we are part of all of this.
We're actually created by all the life that came before us.
Richard Dawkins has a wonderful reflection.
He said, you go back 400 great grandfathers, you know, all of us can do that.
You'll see someone who looks pretty human, but maybe your grandmother wouldn't mate with this being that you saw.
Maybe a little slope head model skull, you know, the little flat thing.
Go back a million, 500,000, one and a half million great grandfathers.
We all can do that too.
And you'll have a picture of a fish.
Some of your relatives were scaly and could breathe underwater.
Phenomenal, huh?
Last century, mid-century, Dr. Paul McClain at the National Institute of Mental Health
was investigating the evolution of the brain and realized that we don't have a brain.
We have three brains.
Right now inside your skull is the fully functioning reptilian brain, the brainstem,
the fully functioning mammalian brain, the limbic system,
and the neocortex of a new human brain.
And there is growing evidence, research, serious scientific research,
that indicates that we use our new human brain mostly to make excuses for the behavior generated by the other two brains.
Not kidding, that we aren't so much rational animals as we are rationalizing animals.
Consciousness comes in late in the game.
It's really interesting to begin to look at this story as if we're part of it and see what the message is.
If we see ourselves in this story, we are forgiven for all our supposed sins and mistakes
because we see that humans are really a baby species.
There were millions of generations of dinosaurs and millions of generations of mammals
before humans came along.
We've had maybe 20,000, 30,000 generations of modern homo sapiens.
We just got these big brains.
We don't know how to use them very well yet.
They didn't come with an instruction manual.
We're just a baby species.
Humans should not be tried as adults.
You are forgiven.
You're completely forgiven.
I think that's my favorite line.
The line that I love the most that has popped into my head over the last number of years.
You are not your fault.
Doesn't that feel good?
If we see ourselves in this story of evolution, our family increases a million, million fold.
We see we are related to all living beings through this miracle molecule, DNA,
this elegant spiraling double helix, deoxyribonucleic acid,
much too cold and clinical, a term for this magic substance.
It seems to be what separates life from non-life.
All life is guided by DNA.
So I'm trying to create a new acronym.
I'm trying to get people to, when you see or hear the letters DNA,
think divine natural abundance.
DNA, divine natural abundance is kind of giving it a spiritual spin.
You probably know this.
You may not.
99.999% of your DNA is identical to the DNA of the person sitting next to you.
The instructions for building and maintaining you are almost exactly the same as the instructions for building and maintaining me
and the Dalai Lama and House Speaker John Boehner and Oprah, Brittany Spears.
We share, our individual difference is just a thin coat of paint over the basic human design.
We share over 98% of our DNA with chimpanzees, nearly 90% with mice.
That's because most of the information for building and maintaining you
is information for building and maintaining a basic mammal.
We share nearly 50% of our DNA with worms and hold on, 30% almost with yeast.
Now, if we declare ourselves divine, is the slime not also divine?
And if not, where do you draw the line?
Who gets a soul, you know?
Snails, mushrooms?
See, the story of evolution doesn't deny our divinity in any way.
It may deny our exclusive divinity, however.
It's a great t-shirt put out by the biology department at UC Santa Cruz.
You share 25% of your DNA with bananas, get over yourself.
That's the message.
Also, a good case could be made that the universe was created for bacteria.
You'll sell bacteria and microbes.
They were here first, right?
They appeared on Earth 3.8 billion years ago today.
Happy birthday to you too.
And they have thrived and they are everywhere.
There's all these news stories coming out about your biome.
Turns out that there are more individual living beings inside your mouth right now
than all the humans that have ever lived on planet Earth.
They have churches and houses and roads, whole civilization between your cheeks.
There's some speculation that bacteria invented humans as a moving feedlot.
You get room and bored in a tour of the neighborhood, you know?
Of course, the main reason for the success of those little beings is that they reproduce by just dividing.
You don't have to take each other out to dinner first.
Now we know that we are related to those beings.
They invented mobility and oxygen breathing and sexuality.
All those things come from those little microscopic beings who found each other in the depths of the sea
and started creating multi-celled beings.
Just to keep these stories, get the story going a little more intricately.
But we are a new kind of animal now, human beings.
I hope you're not offended.
That is how our eminent scientists classify us.
I know some of you are in denial.
You go to a supermarket or a cafe, they're signing the window, no animals allowed.
People walk right through.
No animals here.
I think we should be proud to be part of that kingdom of beautifully arrayed creatures.
But we are a new kind of animal.
Our ancestors came down from the trees about four million years ago, four or five million years ago.
Among them was an ape woman who the scientists have named Lucy, the mother of us all.
So we can assume that the father of us all was Ricky.
And we started hanging out on the savannah, learned how to use crude stone tools,
became what is now known as homo habilis or handyman.
And handyman started standing upright more often, fix a leaky roof maybe.
Pretty soon we were standing up all the time, or a lot of the time,
and became what is now known as homo erectus or upright human.
And we're not talking morality here.
Obviously, for obvious reasons, soon after we stood upright, the loincloth was invented.
You know, the four-legged, all their private parts are kind of hidden.
But once we stood up, you know, it wasn't good.
So, now, standing up was apparently a very important moment in our evolution,
because it's associated with a rapid increase in brain size.
Now, you'd think that standing up would cause our feet to swell instead, but this is the theory.
Standing up left our hands free to work with tools, spears and axes, chopsticks.
And we needed more brain connections to deal with the more precise movement of our hands and fingers.
So this feedback loop was created, better hands, bigger brains, bigger brains, better hands.
Also standing up left our arms free to carry our stuff around.
So we started migrating out of Africa.
Nobody knows exactly why we left.
I suspect it was to look for Chinese food.
At the time, our brains were only half the size they are today.
Or we might have been able to figure out how to send out for Chinese food.
But anyway, we started wandering around the planet.
Our brains kept growing.
A lot of speculation about why probably getting caught in an ice age or two was one of the reasons.
You know, we had to think hard and fast how to stay warm.
It would have been simpler to just grow a heavier coat of fur,
but we didn't think of it at the time because our brains were too small.
Anyway, we grew bigger brains, learned how to make fire,
and began sitting around that fire and telling stories about ourselves like this one.
I'm telling you right now, the story of evolution.
This is my brain on evolution. All of us.
And at some point, our brains got so big that they outgrew our skulls.
We had to get the rounded dome-shaped skull.
The old slope head model just wouldn't hold all the brain.
So about 40,000 years ago, a blink of an eye in biological time.
Just yesterday.
Our immediate ancestors appear, the Cro-Magnon people,
and they began having elaborate burial rituals, making masks and jewelry.
Obviously, having reached a new level of self-awareness
and begun asking the big questions, you know, who am I, where do we come from, where are we going?
Is there an afterlife? Can we invent one?
And it's my theory that the Cro-Magnon people were the first to display a sense of humor,
which they got by watching Neanderthals work with tools.
You know, they were always dropping. You could never figure out the pliers, you know.
So 10,000 years ago, 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, the last ice age is beginning to melt,
and our great, great, great grandparents are beginning to work with agriculture, live in cities.
And the last 10,000 years has been a complete revolution of the life of this planet
due to the behavior of our species.
Complete revolution. Now we can fly off the planet.
We can see to the edges of the universe.
We can see deep inside of matter. We know how things work pretty generally in chemistry and physics, biology.
In just the last couple hundred years, we've nearly doubled the expected lifetime of a human being.
So you get pretty much twice as long to be yourself.
Just a few generations ago, most of our grandparents were peasants, not very long ago.
And now most of us are asked to absorb many volumes of information in a lifetime,
operate fairly sophisticated machinery.
It's a whole new world, and considering that and how quickly it's happened,
I think we're doing a pretty good job of being humans, actually.
You know, there are some major problems, major flaws.
Definitely, there's too many of us.
Some of you will have to go.
It's really important, and nobody ever talks about it, and I just talked about it.
But it's really a whole new world out there, and I do think we're doing pretty good.
We're still working with brains designed for members of small tribes of hunter-gatherers.
That's according to the evolutionary biologists and biologists,
which would explain our addiction to shopping.
You know, if it's out there, you go get it.
It's kind of obvious.
It also may help explain our confusion in our territorial ways.
But if we look at ourselves in the story of evolution, there's a lot of reason for hope.
We see, first of all, that life has survived all sorts of catastrophes,
continents bumping into each other, comets crashing into the earth, ice ages, plagues,
Henry Kissinger, life is tough and may very well survive humans.
Also, we see that just 2,500 years ago, the Axial Age, we had Lao Tzu in China,
Socrates in Greece, the Buddha in India.
Obviously, a revolution in consciousness and self-awareness.
2,500 years ago, a blink of a blink of an eye in biological time.
We're just sort of waking up.
I really like to have that image as we meditate, that we're not really...
We're doing it for ourselves, but we're also doing it as members of a species
at a particular moment in evolution, trying to awaken, trying to find our commonality
and trying to learn ways that we can be free of the instincts that we've inherited
from our evolutionary past.
Can we gain any freedom over these?
Do we have to be aggressive and acquisitive?
We want to stay inquisitive, but...
So we see that revolution.
And realize, just less than 100 years ago, we knew of one galaxy in the universe.
We called it a nebula.
The latest estimate is that there's 100 to 200 billion galaxies
containing 30 to 50 billion trillion suns.
And it was all made just for us.
A little harder to believe that.
And now, of course, they're finding thousands and thousands of planets
in our galaxy alone that could support life.
Galaxies, they're full of suns that could support life.
Planets that could support life.
I think that's really good news.
It's starting to look obvious that there's life everywhere in the cosmos.
I think it's a great piece of news because it takes the pressure off of us.
Right?
What a relief.
It's not all about us.
We don't have to carry the entire burden of meaning in the cosmos.
You're off the hook.
If we do find life in another galaxy, then we'll have to become, talking about identity,
we'll have to become galaxy identified.
We'll be Milky Wayans.
And in the intergalactic sporting events, we will be chanting, you know,
hip hooray for Milky Way.
These are the jokes, obviously.
But hope in that we are just waking up to such things as the size of the universe.
We now know that life has gone from a single cell being to a being with a hundred trillion cells.
That's you and me.
And inside each of your cells is a little strand,
actually two yards when stretched out of DNA,
containing the equivalent of thousands of volumes of information
in every single one of your hundred trillion cells.
The whole history of life is stitched inside of you.
Everything that life knows stitched inside of you.
Your brain processes an estimated 11 million bits of information a second.
And you hardly have to lift a finger.
Considering the complexity, the creativity, amazing construction of this being that we are,
it's hard not to believe that there's something behind it, some purpose, some meaning, some design.
God, I said the word.
The famous scientist, E. O. Wilson, a beautiful writer, great scientist,
says to imagine a human being being created through random chance in the universe
is like trying to imagine a hurricane blowing through a junkyard and creating a 747.
Something going on. We don't know what it is.
But it's so wonderful to be in awe of it and to have it as part of our tools to find liberation,
to understand our place in this big story.
I find it very liberating.
And also creating a new sense of belonging.
We're all part of this grand drama, this great experiment.
I call it God's little biosphere project.
And when I get depressed or discouraged, I often try to remember,
it's taken the universe 13.7 billion years to make me.
There's cause for some self-esteem.
You know, what a project. 13.7 billion years working on me.
So, seeing ourselves in this story, there's hope, there's liberation,
and there's love for the world,
which is where we want to start with our environmental work, doing it out of love.
We're not going to save the planet, you know.
It ain't going to happen.
Sun will burn out.
We're just doing the best we can in trying to create as little suffering as we can
and alleviate as much suffering as we can while we're here.
So, I think we have some little time for discussion if you would like to add
or amend anything I've said.
I like scientists who tell me, no, you got it wrong.
It was billion, not million.
Remember, are you old enough to remember when million was a big, big number?
I've been playing a game with friends.
We start a sentence by, I'm so old, I remember, and then you fill in.
So, some of our, I'm so old, I remember when the only people who had tattoos were in the Navy.
Or, I'm so old, I remember when women were embarrassed if their bra strap was showing.
Remember?
I'm so old, I remember going out and getting in my car and driving around for entertainment purposes.
It's called going for a ride.
I'm so old, I remember the 1900s.
Yes?
What do you think Facebook's function is?
In the grand scheme.
In the grand scheme of things.
Yeah, no, you know, there was all this talk, especially around the whole earth catalog people,
Stewart Brand, and when the computers started to come alive and everybody had them.
They thought, well, we're going to, all these communities, virtual communities,
but communities will be created and it'll be a really wonderful thing.
And now you see people walking around, you know, like this.
And that's, by the way, why we have an opposable thumb is to text.
We finally discovered the reason for it.
But I think overall, it's yet to be known what all of this, I mean, I'm here in the heart of Silicon Valley,
but I suspect that it's, I don't know, it's not good for us.
But that we're too lost in our individual story anyway.
I mean, that's why we're all here in some way.
And when you can go into your own entertainment world through the screen,
it sort of cuts you off from, to some degree, I think, from connecting with people on an energetic level.
I'm just old, you know, I'm old and in the way.
I'll be gone soon. Do what you want.
Yeah.
That was a wonderful talk.
Thank you.
And I'd like to, it occurs to me as you're talking that as exciting as the story is,
I think that when I was in college, we did not know about DNA.
When I was in college, we did not know about tectonic plates.
So think about what's going to happen in the lives of some young people in this room that we can't even imagine.
Really? Thank you for saying that.
Yeah, it's a revolution, yeah.
When did they discover the DNA?
Was it the 50s?
The mid 50s.
Yeah, and tectonic plates at the same time, period.
I don't think we really have absorbed the new information.
We at least haven't turned it, just like, you know, you know that everything is changing all the time.
But it's not until you can kind of integrate that into your, the marrow of your being, your behavior doesn't change.
You don't, you still hold on, you know, as if it wasn't true.
Anyway, thank you.
Thank you for your talk.
I really appreciate it.
I studied evolution in grad school.
And so I've been kind of processing some of this too alongside Buddhist practice.
It's a little bit mind blowing and you kind of can't get your mind around it.
But I guess it seems like there are some basic things.
Because if, I feel like when I get too much into the numbers, it's like my brain can't really intuitively understand even a thousand miles away.
And I start thinking about billions of years and it just doesn't really go anywhere.
But like when I, when I'm hanging out with my, you know, with my nieces and nephews and I can, and we're like at the beach or everything.
And they're like, where did all this come from?
And we're like, well, you know, you basically started with this giant ball of hydrogen helium gas.
You left it alone and you ended up with rose bushes, giraffes and human beings.
Like, that's not a miracle.
I don't know what it is.
It's related to all of life.
It's really.
You have feelings.
Your dog has feelings too.
Because, you know, you guys, those parts of the brain have descended from the same ancestor.
And it seems like one of the most fundamental things is, you know, like the idea of cell.
And you take a single human cell and you, so I'm working on mitochondria right now.
So it has applications to aging and stuff like that.
But it's interesting because they have their own genome that has a separate origin than
the rest of the cell.
It was actually like a little bacterium that came and started living as a symbiont.
And then eventually that actually became one single organism.
So it's like, even if you look at one single cell, you can't really, that idea of being
separate doesn't even work at that level.
And the mitochondria figured out how to take the sun's energy and turn it into our living
energy, right?
Yeah, so the chloroplasts in plants, they have a similar story where they were something
free-living and then they started, had the same relationship.
But I guess after all of that, what I get down to is like, I've recognized that I have a
fundamental, like the way I see reality is objectively different from how it actually is.
So I guess I should meditate more.
Never hurts, never hurts.
Just let me tell you, and also everybody, if you, I wrote a book called Buddha's Nature,
which is about evolution and dharma and how they kind of, the message is kind of similar
and they meet each other.
The Buddha said, for instance, the body, he said, this body is not mine or anyone else's.
It has arisen due to causes and conditions.
For now, it should be felt.
But, I mean, he really is saying, you know, that we co-arise it, that the self is an illusion
that we've created.
It's got obvious survival importance, you know, to think of yourself as important in
moving through the world.
In fact, a guy named Damasio, expert on emotions, says that the whole concept of self,
the whole feeling of being a separate self, comes from the fact that your brain is continually
mapping your inner world and the outer world so that you can safely move through it.
And that's what gives you a sense of self.
It's basically the survival programming.
Anyway, yeah, get those mind mitochondria.
You got any? You can show us.
You got to look real close.
So, yeah, one more.
I'm so old, I can remember when water fountains and bathrooms and department stores were segregated.
And the balconies of movie theatres were reserved for colours.
And so, you know, even as things get worse, this just tells me we're making progress, too.
So, the other thing I wanted to say is several parts of your talk reminded me of a quote that I liked by Oscar Wilde,
which goes, we're all lying in the gutter, but some of us look up at the stars.
So, I guess that's why we make progress, if we do.
Thank you.
Can I ask you where you lived? Where the segregation, where, what city? Where did you grow up in?
Dallas, Texas.
Explains everything. Thank you.
What do you want to say here?
Well, in the 30s, I know San Francisco had a lot of health.
Anyway.
Do you still have a redlining in every town in this country?
Yeah, that's true. Insurance, redlining, you know.
Anyway, let's, alright, one more and then we'll sit and close it out.
This gentleman.
I have some questions, like, you can help me to understand.
So, you said, if it's science, it's probably truth, right?
So, I disagree with that, like, from the statement that this gentleman said, like,
by that his time, like, people might believe there's nothing like DNA.
So, now we believe in something that scientists says, like, oh, there's DNA.
And then tomorrow, somebody else will tell some story.
Some new research comes up and then people like it.
They have some evidence, something like that.
What is truth?
I believe that truth never changes, right?
So, if it's a truth, it has to stay at the same state after a million years, 100 years, whatever.
What I think is, like, truth is Buddhist teachings is exactly true even today.
But if I 100 years ago, it was truth and tomorrow it's truth.
So, that's the truth.
Thank you.
And then I have one more question, like, so, when I hear the stories of Buddhists' time,
I usually, I'm from Sri Lanka, I listen to some talks from Tripitaka.
So, when I hear those stories, like, I feel like we are not, like, evolutionarily like our brains,
the people who live these days.
I feel like totally opposite, like, we are so behind what we had during the Buddhist time.
Like, how powerful they are, how mindful they were.
And then, when I think about the brain, I don't agree that we are evolutionarily, like, developed kind of thing.
So, you can help me to understand.
I can't help you at all.
Thank you for saying that, though.
I think there's, you know, truth changes, and some truth doesn't seem to change.
It itself seems to be a truth that doesn't change.
So, let's just sit for a minute together in silence and let all that information just wash through, empty out, feel your, feel your aliveness,
a unique condition, a piece of the universe that wonders about itself.
Thank you.
Thank you all.
It's been a pleasure to be here with you.
Our paths will probably cross again some day.
So, be well.
Evolve well.
