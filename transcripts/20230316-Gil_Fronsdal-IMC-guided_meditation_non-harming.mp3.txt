 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodorma.org. Hello everyone, welcome to our meditation session. One of the very important principles in Buddhist practice in Buddhism, one of the principles that when we live by it or when we observe it in the world, can be a source of tremendous inspiration and happiness. It's a profound principle for human life, it's a profound aspect of love itself, and that is the dedication to non-harming. And non-harming is maybe not often associated with love because sometimes love is expected to be much more active, actively having a positive regard, actively having feelings of goodwill and compassion and appreciation and all kinds of things that come with love. But in fact, a profound way of loving others and loving oneself is to really see the value of non-harming. Because in non-harming, and let's just keep it for meditation for now, if we are dedicated to not harming with our thoughts, not harming with our actions, with our attitudes and our speech, that the harm is not interfering with our natural capacity to mature, to grow, to evolve spiritually, dharmically, humanly. Human beings are built to change over time, and certainly if we get older we recognize those change, but part of the change that's built into us is that of maturation, a growth in wisdom, a growth in freedom, a growth in love. And this phenomenal growth that's possible is a natural thing that has one of the most important qualities is to get out of the way for it, to not interfere with it. And a life dedicated to non-harming is a life dedicated to not putting up the obstacles to this natural growth, natural evolution that's possible within us. So heightened sensitivity to how our thoughts undermine us, harm us, by negative thinking, critical thinking, and sometimes those thoughts come with authority, like this is true, but no thought that undermines us, no thought which doesn't look upon us with kindness, basic kindness, no thought that somehow hurts in some deep way. It's possible to recognize that we have behavior and thoughts and feelings which are not so healthy, but that doesn't have to give birth to hurtful, harmful thoughts. Seeing our shortcomings clearly without adding harm moves us towards health. So to not harm and then make space for the practice to evolve. So assuming a meditation posture that maybe allows you to have some nice balance between being alert and being calm. And the alertness is partly to be alert to the thoughts, the attitudes, the impulses which undermine us, deplete us, shut us down or tighten us up, that bring tension and reactivity. And the calm is partly to so we can better appreciate the alternative. The calmer the mind, the hearts are, the less it wants to harm. So to take a few long, slow, deep breaths and to relax the body, to take some long, slow, deep breaths and relax deep inside. So to take a few long, slow, deep breaths and relax the body. And then letting the breathing return to normal. And as you exhale, see if you can have a wave, a calming wave through your body. Exhale and settle in the body, calm in the body. On the exhale, allow there be a calming of the mind, a quieting of the thinking mind. And then to settle down into the breathing. And one way to approach a thorough going attitude, not harming, is to assume that in meditation you can do no wrong. Nothing is wrong with you. However, the practice is to keep waking up, to keep being mindful of what is, to clearly see and know what's happening. Where that clarity of being awake, being mindful, is leaving everything alone, not being involved, not picking up, not staying involved with thoughts, getting out of the way. It's enough just to be clearly aware of what's happening here and now. Focusing breathing is the stabilizing force in the present moment, the calming, focusing us and not being entangled or involved with anything that goes on, just to see, just to be dedicated to non-harming. Now we're allowed to........................... Is there any way that your thoughts or your attitudes right now are harmful? Undermining. Don't think that that's wrong or a mistake. Or criticize yourself for it. That's more harm. Rather, know it clearly. Recognize it for what it is. And let it be. Don't granted more attention. Don't feed it with more involvement............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. is a beautiful intention. It's the beginning of a new direction. May it be that on this day, as we come out of meditation, that we have a heightened interest, intention to not cause harm, and that that dedication is an expression of goodwill, of kindness, of love. May all beings be happy, may all beings be safe, may all beings be peaceful, and may all beings be free. Thank you.
