The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
But this meeting takes place every weekday at this time, whatever time it is for you in your time zone.
It's six o'clock on the west coast of the United States, of course.
And it's an opportunity every day of the week, which is really such a great thing
to engage with the practices of the heart, the Brahma Viharas, and their relatives.
I think of them as all the kind of associated practices of the heart
that go along with kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity, the four classic Brahma Viharas.
And the group is usually taught by Diana Clark or Niki Mirgafori. They trade off.
And I'm sitting in for Niki tonight.
And my name, as you can see on the screen, my name is Shelly Galden.
I live in Santa Barbara and help lead and teach in Asanga down here in this neck of the woods in California.
And I also teach at IMC and IRC occasionally, and I'm very kind of deeply embedded in Asanga there,
doing a lot of volunteer work.
So that's kind of out of the way.
I don't want to say that. It's not really just the introduction of myself that's out of the way,
but the rest of it is something I really want. It's such a valuable program.
So this time of year, here we are, it's the last half of December of this year.
And this time of year, right from the last week in November with Thanksgiving in the United States
through New Year's Day, it's seen really traditionally as a time for gratitude and generosity
and love and connection with others. It's the holiday season, we call it.
And it can feel sometimes like there's an expectation, like there's an obligation even
for all of us to feel the same way across this season, but we know that's not really the case.
It can be really joyful, it can be kind of mixed, and it can be a difficult time for some of us, for many people.
We might feel lonely, we might feel left out, kind of excluded, not valued.
And maybe imagine that others are having a really good time, especially if we're spending our time alone.
And if we've lost family members or friends recently, it can be a time when we feel those losses
more strongly, more kind of in a more pointed way.
And if we can't be with our loved ones because of the pandemic or because of other limitations, that can be painful too.
Or even if we are with family and friends, sometimes that can feel lonely.
And sometimes there are tensions, sometimes painful memories that arise when we are in family gatherings.
Disagreements and hurts that are kind of ignored or shunted aside most of the year will sometimes rise to the surface,
sometimes in a very difficult way when an annual holiday dinner or a visit home kind of triggers memories
and feelings associated with that place, whatever place it is, and those particular people.
And then sometimes kind of old patterns of reactivity in our relationships will rear their heads
and we'll get caught in resentment or hurt or blame.
You know, they say sometimes our parents, I like to think of it as our whole family of origin.
They know how to push our buttons because they're the ones who installed them, they say.
So it's kind of natural sometimes to find reactivity when we connect with our families.
And then for those of us who don't connect with the conventional kind of attitudes around Thanksgiving
or don't connect with Judaism or Christianity or with the less religious aspects of the season,
the secular holiday music that seems to be ubiquitous everywhere you go,
if you're not in your own home, and the shopping and the decorations, all the trappings,
there can be kind of, there can be some contraction, some judgment, a sort of impatience.
Can we just get through this? Why can't I just be January?
There can be feelings of obligation around buying presents for people, writing holiday greetings, participating in rituals.
There's all kinds of ways in which holidays can be stressful.
And of course, there are also a lot of people, a lot of us who really love these holidays,
who find great joy and great meaning in the religious aspects
or simply in the existence of a season that's kind of dedicated to gratitude, generosity, goodwill.
And then look forward to the gatherings, finding just the right gift for somebody who they love, cooking or baking,
if that's our thing, liking the sound of the bells ringing, the decorations, the lights,
the smell of the evergreens and candles, and the whole gestalt kind of, the whole atmosphere of the season.
And then there are some of us who don't connect with these widely celebrated holidays that I mentioned,
but who might participate in some different ones, like celebrating the solstice, which is next Tuesday.
You know, there's the sense of the light, the light comes back the next day, there's more light.
And that's a lovely thing to celebrate.
Or Kwanzaa, you know, the African American, it's a harvest celebration that's celebrated for about ten days
around this time of the year, the end of the year.
And then there are traditions around the New Year, there are European traditions,
there are Asian traditions, ways of marking that.
And some people make up their own kind of traditions and have their own special ways to mark this transition
that people do pay attention to.
I have friends who gather every late December and make intentions for the coming year.
And other friends who, I don't know if they still do this, friends who used to do this, choose angel cards.
You know, these little small little cards that have beneficial qualities of mind written on one side of them.
And then they'll all get dumped into a hat and each person will pick out one.
And they just trust that whatever quality shows up is the right one to cultivate for the next year.
So there are, you know, there are a million ways to create a ritual, to create ceremony,
to honor something that seems meaningful this time of year.
And I think we've probably all heard other New Year's resolutions and maybe we've made some of our own.
And maybe we even kept some of them.
So considering all this, all this stuff, I had the thought that whether you do feel connected to the traditional holidays at the end of the year,
or not, you know, whether it's a time of joy and togetherness or loneliness and maybe some pain,
however it is that we hold this season, that it just might be meaningful as we come to the end of another calendar year
to kind of clear the decks, so to speak, to start with a clean slate,
to make an effort to free the heart of things that might be pulling us back into the past,
to kind of free up space inside us to meet what comes next in our lives in a fresh way.
So my idea is to do a brief forgiveness practice, and then a little bit of meta,
and then to spend some time in our meditation just connecting with an aspiration,
not necessarily our deepest aspiration for our life, but something that might arise in us once we've let go of the parts of us
that create a little painful tug on our hearts, the parts that try to keep us tied to the past in painful ways.
So, you know, are we ready to start fresh? Start fresh.
I think Jack Cornfield, speaking about forgiveness, he has this statement that I've always thought was really great,
that forgiving is giving up all hope of a better past.
That's like giving up all hope of a better past.
So, traditionally in forgiveness practice, I'm sure there's been a lot of forgiveness practice done in the happy hour in the past.
We usually ask for forgiveness in one kind of direction, and then we offer forgiveness into other ways.
So we ask for forgiveness for ourselves, for any harm that we've done to others,
and then we offer forgiveness to others for any harm that they've done us,
and then we also offer forgiveness to ourselves for any harm that we've done ourselves.
So that's what I want to start with, and so with that introduction, I'd like to invite you to take your comfortable
Brahma Vihara, your meta-meditation posture, comfortable at ease, but also awake, ready to be attentive to what comes,
and just become present to your current experience, what's happening right now,
relaxing any areas of tension, coming to a place of balance, place of ease, and also alertness.
And maybe spend a little time with your breathing, just as a way of kind of settling, relaxing a little bit more, resting.
And if forgiveness practice is something you don't feel ready to do right now,
it's fine to continue with attending to your breath or to just do meta-practice, to switch to meta.
And if at any time during the practice that I lead, if you feel you need to step away from it,
that you just want to back off from it, then I invite you to do meta or mindfulness practice,
to do meta in the way that's easiest for you, where the care is easiest to flow.
And you might want to put your hand on your heart for this meditation,
just to offer that kind of tangible sign of care for self that can give us.
So we can begin with one of two ways of asking forgiveness from others.
If there is a particular situation you remember when you caused harm, something that comes to mind
and maybe gives you pain from time to time, you can focus on that situation if you'd like.
And so it's quite specific. And ask people in that situation or the person for forgiveness.
If there isn't anything like that that comes up, you just think back over your life
and recall places in your life where you acted in a way that caused harm to others.
Maybe just being sharp-tongued with a loved one and making fun of someone when you were a child,
telling a lie, taking something that belonged to somebody else.
I think we all have done things that we regret later in our lives, everybody has.
So just allow any of these little things to become present to you
and connect with what it feels like to acknowledge that they happened.
So you can take a moment to call to mind either area that you'd like to ask for forgiveness,
even a specific instance that causes you pain to think about,
or just a more general look at the ways that you've potentially harmed people during your life.
And once you've chosen, you can begin repeating these phrases.
Just repeat them a few times. You won't do this for a long time.
For any harm I have done you intentionally or unintentionally through thought, word, or action,
I ask your forgiveness.
I'll repeat that because it's a long phrase.
For any harm I have done you intentionally or unintentionally through thought, word, or action,
I ask your forgiveness.
For any harm I have done you intentionally or unintentionally through thought, word,
or action, I ask your forgiveness.
And now maybe just take a few kind of deep breaths, long breaths,
and reground in here and now, and gently let go of that contemplation.
And then we can move to the harm that others have done us.
And we also know that every one of us has suffered pain from the actions of others during our lives,
minor pains, and maybe major pains as well. It's unavoidable.
There might have been criticism that cut deeply deliberate insults or injuries,
maybe something subtle, just a twinge, or maybe something more profound,
some betrayal or cruelty or abuse, that is still difficult to bear the memory of.
Everyone has suffered injury from others. We all share that.
Sometimes if the harm has been great, it's not possible for us to offer forgiveness,
and that's fine. It's not an obligation. Perhaps in future we'll be able to do that.
Or, you know, it's possible we'll never really feel able to forgive,
but to have it as a possibility to not exclude it, I think that really helps to soften our hearts.
And it's important to remember that forgiving someone is not absolving them of responsibility for the harm they caused.
It is simply being willing, as Jack said, to give up all hope of a better past.
When we intend in the direction of forgiveness, it makes space in our hearts for more love,
more peace, and more joy too. It helps clear the deck so that we can start fresh.
So remembering harms that have been done to you, you can repeat.
For any harm you have done me, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word, or action,
I offer you forgiveness. You can add as best as I am able, if you like.
For any harm you have done me, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word, or action,
I offer you forgiveness as best as I am able.
And if you don't feel able to forgive now, you might try this.
For any harm you have done me, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word, or action,
my intention is to one day forgive you.
For any harm you have done me, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word, or action,
I offer you forgiveness as best as I am able.
Thank you.
So again, you can take a few breaths, just reconnect with the felt sense of just being here,
sitting, breathing, you know, in this good company.
And again, just you can gently let go of that contemplation.
And now we'll move on to the harms that we have done ourselves.
And just like the other kinds of harm, we have all at one time or another,
maybe often even, acted in ways that harmed ourselves.
We've probably judged or criticized ourselves, believed we were unworthy, not good enough in some way,
compared ourselves with others or with some ideal in a way that caused us pain.
Or maybe we've had addictions or other habits that we know have harmed our bodies and our minds, our hearts.
And there's the harm that comes our way when we know we've acted unethically.
Just think back over your life, noting times when you have in some way caused yourself pain.
For any harm I have done myself, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word or action,
I offer myself forgiveness.
For any harm I have done myself, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word or action,
I offer myself forgiveness.
Thank you.
For any harm I have done myself, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word or action,
I forgive myself.
Thank you.
You can let go of the forgiveness contemplation now.
Again, maybe a breath or two just to resettle with the present moment and just see what's been the effect in your heart.
I think people often find that there's a tenderness in the wake of doing this formal forgiveness practice.
And when I sort of tune into that, that tenderness feels to me a lot like meta, very much like meta.
Meta for ourselves, maybe meta for those who've harmed us, and maybe just meta for the tenderness that is in all human hearts.
And for a couple of minutes now, I really invite you to offer meta in whatever direction seems most needed,
most useful right now, towards yourself, towards people who've harmed you, towards all of us here in this Zoom room
doing this tender practice together, whatever feels most, what your heart feels most drawn to right now.
And I won't say anything, I'll just let you proceed for several minutes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And now what I'd like to ask you to do is to turn to what arises in the heart after we've offered this forgiveness and meta.
Perhaps your heart feels somewhat cleansed and open.
Probably it feels tender, and I think a tender heart can be a doorway to recognizing and connecting with what we want our lives to be about.
So just sit for a bit, you know, in the kind of tenderness of your heart and drop in the question,
what's next for me?
No need to think about it and to analyze, construct a plan or to consider practicalities, nothing like that.
Just see what comes up in spontaneously, in response to what's next for me.
And I'll just let you sit with that for a few minutes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So now is the time to have some breakout groups.
So I'm going to give you 15 minutes, plus there's always an extra minute at the end.
And there should be four, possibly three people in each group, depending on how many people leave the building in the meantime.
And I'd like you to give each person three minutes to share without being interrupted.
And whatever comes up for you in this exploration.
Let's see, let me set a time here.
Well, I think I'm going to actually, I think I'm going to change it because there are some fewer people, so I'm going to make five rooms.
Okay, here you go.
Thank you.
