So we come to the last and fifth talk on fear, and I hope that during this week I've been able to offer you some new perspectives on practicing with fear, living with fear, understanding fear, and I'll continue with that today. 
And I thought of maybe that the subject for today would be the wisdom of fear. 
And part of the wisdom of fear is that, or how to understand that the wisdom, that fear can be wise, is when we think that one of the functions of fear is protection. 
It's an attempt to protect something. 
And then what are we protecting? What is being threatened? And some things are worth protecting. 
Some things are not worth protecting. 
And so there is this notion in Buddhism that there is healthy fear and unhealthy fear, helpful fear and unhelpful fear. 
So to have a categorical attitude towards fear as being wrong or bad is not so useful. 
What's useful is to practice with fear, to normalize fear, to not identify with fear, to learn to hold fear with kindness, hold it gently so you can really see it and know it. 
And it's helpful to have it sit on your shoulder and accompany you rather than be you. 
All things that I've talked about this week. 
But then it's also important to be able to look deeply at fear. 
And is this healthy this fear? Is this helpful this fear? Is it this really protecting me in an important way? Is it really a protection? Or is it the opposite? Am I actually more in danger by having this fear? Because some fears and anxieties, especially anxieties that are quite strong, probably put us in greater danger than if we don't have it. 
We're more likely to make mistakes. 
We're more likely to act impulsively. 
We're more likely to. 
. 
. 
Some anxieties are self-fulfilling that if we're anxious someone is going to happen, that very anxiety makes it more likely to happen. 
Sometimes it's the analogy that sometimes is used around dogs. 
If you're afraid of a dog, the dog is more likely to attack you. 
And so the more anxiety there's around the dog, we want to protect ourselves, but the very movement of anxiety is the thing that keeps us from being protected. 
And so we have to kind of look at what we're afraid of here. 
And is it healthy or not healthy? And if it's a healthy fear, we're protecting something worthwhile, then the fear has a function of being motivating. 
There's energy in fear. 
And that energy can be motivated to do something, to actually do something that protects what needs to be protected. 
And sometimes that's to do things in the world. 
And maybe put a lock on your door, for example, if that's what's going to keep you safe. 
And sometimes it's to really practice careful self-monitoring so that you don't succumb to unhelpful states of mind. 
You don't succumb to anxiety or anger or hostility or greed. 
And you don't succumb to attachments that are maybe even the source of the fear itself. 
And so the fear, healthy fear protects what needs should, can be protected. 
It's helpful to protect. 
And so what are some of the things that are helpful and healthy to protect? Certainly our integrity, our ethical integrity, because one of the sources of fear is when we live unethically and afraid of being caught or afraid of our own conscience. 
It's also, you know, there's a fear of wrongdoing. 
So there's a healthy fear of, I don't want to do that. 
I don't want to lie. 
I don't want to get into that kind of situation. 
And that keeps us from doing it, keeps us even getting into those situations. 
And the deeper and more peaceful meditators tend to become, the more likely they're going to have a fear for somehow harming themselves with their ethics. 
Or harming anybody with their ethics. 
The fear of causing harm. 
That's a healthy fear. 
And it can be an anxious fear. 
It can be a neurotic fear, not to harm others. 
And that maybe won't be so helpful. 
But there is a healthy not wanting to cause harm. 
It's like the heart sings when it doesn't cause harm. 
The heart stops singing when you think about causing harm, or think we have caused harm. 
And so that's worth protecting, being close to. 
And then there's a sense of well-being we get. 
Whatever that is, if I use that word very vaguely, that as we practice, as we go through our lives, there are times when we feel a degree of peace, happiness, connectedness, that is nourishing, supportive for us, brings us joy and delight. 
And that's worth protecting. 
It's remarkable how easy it is to give it up. 
How easy it is to get distracted and cut up, and sometimes very petty concerns, that to really wipe away the sense of balance, the sense of inner strength or peace that we might have. 
And that's so it's worth protecting that. 
So how do we protect that? Maybe we protect it by being careful with what we watch on TV. 
Maybe we're careful who we spend time with, or how much time we spend with people. 
Maybe we're careful about where we go or the activities we do. 
Because some activities, like watching a shopping channel or looking at catalogs, maybe stimulates unhealthy desires and attachment that stirs up and causes us to lose the fact that we were pretty content before we looked at the catalog. 
And so to be. 
. 
. 
So the wisdom of fear is to understand that fear is trying to protect something, and is what it's protecting worthwhile? Is it appropriate? Is it helpful for us? So there used to be read quite a bit, this quote by Krishnamurti, there is fear as long as you want to be secure. 
Secure in your marriage, secure in your job, secure in your position, secure in your responsibility, secure in your ideas, in your beliefs, secure in your relationships to the world and in your relationship to God. 
At the moment the mind seeks security or gratification in any form, at any level, there is bound to be fear. 
So there can be attachment to a security, to a certainty, in a world that has much more uncertainty than we often will admit. 
And so all these things we try to hold onto for our security, and then is that really the right place to feel secure? For the Buddha, the ultimate security, ultimate safety, is found in letting go, is found in peace, is found in non-attachment, non-clinging. 
And that can make us feel very vulnerable, very challenged. 
But to find strength, courage, stability in that place of non-clinging, non-attachment, and realize that that is portable, and learn how to take that with us in all the insecure situations in life, all the uncertain places in life. 
Life is uncertain. 
There is dangers in life. 
But the biggest danger is that of what we do to ourselves through our attachments, through our karma, the actions we do, through the dispositions of the mind to hate, or to be greedy, or be caught up in something so that we lose ourselves, we lose ourselves in anxiety. 
There is a place of security within that it's worth protecting, it's worth finding, getting close to, and that place where it's a place within that cannot be threatened. 
No matter what happens in the world, that place is not touched. 
And to be centered there, to know that, is the ability to go through the world without fear. 
But until we get to that place, that point, any hints or sense of that possibility, of that inner well-being, that moves in that direction, that can be protected, that we want to be careful for. 
That is worthwhile protecting because we're moving towards freedom. 
We're moving to the place where we're really bringing the greatest health to ourselves, the greatest spiritual health, the greatest freedom to our hearts. 
So fear is an all-too-human experience. 
It wants to protect us. 
It's kind of in and of itself a healthy movement of protecting something. 
So we don't want to dismiss fear. 
We want to be able to be friends with fear, connect to fear, see it deeply, because as we see it deeply and are present for it, all fear, all movements of protection, probably at the very root of what they're about, is this place of ultimate safety, or this desire for ultimate safety. 
And many fears are misunderstandings. 
Many fears is misunderstanding what's really important. 
Meditation, like meditation, hopefully will connect us to what is most important so that we remember that as we go into the world. 
And we don't fear things which are not that important. 
That doesn't matter so much. 
There's plenty of things that we might fear that we don't have to worry about. 
So I'd like to end with a quote from Martin Luther King that brings this topic of fear into our social domain. 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
wrote, People fail to get along because they fear each other. 
They fear each other because they don't know each other. 
They don't know each other because they have not communicated with each other. 
So to the degree to which we are afraid of others, maybe we haven't really gotten to know them. 
And maybe we really haven't let them know us. 
Maybe to develop real communication between people is one of the benefits of becoming wise with fear. 
Because then fear does not interfere with our ability to communicate, to connect, and have real friendship with other people. 
So thank you for all this. 
And may you now take a time to really become wise about your fear, maybe even courageous around it. 
So I'm going away again next week for another week of vacation this summer. 
And I'm happy that Nikki, Nikki Murga Fori, will come back. 
She's come often to be my substitute and wonderful teacher. 
She teaches a happy hour at IMC, which is an hour's time for loving kindness practice in the afternoon. 
So she'll be here next week, and I'll be back the following. 
Thank you.
