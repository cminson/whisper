 Greetings, Sangha. Greetings. Lovely to be with you in this moment in time and to practice together. So we will continue our explorations of tools that are supportive and helpful in developing Samadhi. Concentration often translated, Samadhi asks, settling, unifying, collecting the mind. Calm abiding is another translation that I favor over concentration. One supportive tool, one supportive consideration for collecting and settling the mind is collecting and settling and relaxing the body. Often one invitation that I like people to drop in if they're practicing, if they're trying to cultivate the settling mind is relax and receive, relax and receive. So in terms of wise engagement, wise engagement, in which we'll talk about today and also partially tomorrow with respect to Samadhi. And I don't like to use the word effort, wise effort. I like to translate it and use engagement another E word because effort naturally brings up the sense of effort tightening, tightening of the brow and trying to get concentrated. That's not really the idea. That's not how it works. It's more a relaxed the body to be relaxed and to receive to receive the breath to be with the breath. Yesterday we talked about the joy of the present moment, tuning into the simplicity of the joy of the present moment while relinquishing what is not helpful. We talked about that the first day on Monday. So the relinquishing and tuning into the joy especially of the present moment becomes possible when the body is relaxed, when the body is in a receptive mode. Hence the mind becomes more relaxed. The mind becomes in a more receptive mode. So let's begin. Let's practice together. Let us arrive. Let us arrive. Let us arrive in this moment, in this posture, whether sitting, lying down or standing. And inviting, inviting the body to let go, to soften, to relax. Our body not separate from the mind. The embodied mind. Inviting, inviting our hands. Bringing awareness to the hands. Inviting them. To relax. And give their weight to the earth. As we caress our hands with our attention, our awareness internally. Sensing, feeling the sensations and putting down the weight. Moving up to the arms, to the shoulders. Softening. Relaxing. As if the hands, the arms, the shoulders and the neck are being breathed. They're receiving the breath. They're being breathed and with each out breath. These areas of the body settle on their own. Relax on their own. They know how to do this. Effort is not needed. With each exhale. Softening, letting go. Feeling, sensing the face, the forehead, muscles of the forehead, the jaw, the eyes, muscles behind the eyes, the muscles in the face. As if they too are receiving the in breath. Exhaling with the out breath. Relaxing. On their own, muscles of the face know how to do this. Trust. Trust. Just one more time. One moment. From the neck to the chest. The chest receives the breath. This body receives the breath. And exhales with the exhale, it knows how to relax. To let go. To relinquish what is not helpful. To let go of the heart, the heart center. Softening, relaxing emotions and feelings. Exhaling. Moving down to the abdomen. Enlivened receiving the breath, the abdomen, the lower abdomen. It knows how to receive the in breath. And how to exhale. Letting go. Relaxing. Offering its weight to the ears with each exhale. And so too the sit bones. Making contact with the cushion, with the chair, with the earth. Receiving the breath. Releasing their weight with the out breath. And the upper legs, lower legs and feet. Feeling the contact points with the earth, enlivened with the in breath. And exhaling with the out breath, this body exhaling with the out breath. Every cell, every nook and cranny of this body. Entire body. Receiving the in breath on its own, relaxed, relaxedly receiving the in breath. Soft, natural in breath, not forced. Relaxing, softening, exhaling, the body receiving the exhale. Relax and receive. Relaxed and receiving. Relaxed and receiving. But as tightness, contraction has arisen anywhere in the body. It's often a sign that often corresponds to contraction in the mind. Relinquishing what's not helpful in the mind and in the body, relaxing. Letting go, contraction in the body, the tightness. Being aware of the joy, the simplicity, the joy, the simplicity of this moment. The gift of just sitting and being breathed. Amazing, amazing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Relaxing and receiving. The breath, the sensations of the breath. The breath, the sensations of the breath. The breath, the sensations of the breath. The sensations of the breath. The sensations of the breath. The sensations of the breath. The sensations of the breath. The sensations of the breath. Relax and receive. Relaxing the mind, the heart, the body. Receiving the breath. Relaxing the mind, the sensations of the breath. Relaxing the mind, the sensations of the breath. Relaxing the mind, the sensations of the breath. Relaxing the mind, the sensations of the breath. Relaxing the mind, the sensations of the breath. Relaxing the mind, the sensations of the breath. And for the last moment of this practice period, whatever arose or did not arise during this set, whether the mind was unsettled, sleepy, etc., etc. Relaxing, releasing any thoughts, any judgments, self-criticism, letting go, not needed. Relaxing, letting go of what's not helpful. And receiving, receiving your own goodness, your own goodness that you showed up. As best as you possibly could, given all the causes and conditions. And gave yourself as best as you could. As an offering, an offering, made an offering to cultivation. As if you put yourself, your heart on the altar of humanity, here I am. Cultivating peace, settledness, goodness for my own benefit. Benefit of others and the whole world. Receiving the goodness of that, trusting there is goodness there, generated. And putting it on the altar, sharing it with all beings everywhere, with generosity. Sharing our goodness, may it be a cause and condition, for peace, for ease, for freedom of all beings everywhere. Thank you for your practice.
