Okay, well perhaps we'll just let the others drift back, those who are not here. 
I just want to again just say if there's any questions before I move on, and I'll take it into a slightly different mode. 
But I want to just see what. 
. 
. 
Hi, I guess this is working. 
I was wondering if there's anything else you'd like to talk about? I don't think so. 
Okay, all right. 
Okay, this better? In your discussion about metaphysics and what Buddha was teaching practical ideas and the unknowable reincarnation is something very unknowable for me. 
I was wondering what is the context of Buddha's time of reincarnation? Okay, well, it's interesting that reincarnation, it's not particularly found in the Vedas. 
It's not particularly found in the oldest strata in the literature of ancient India. 
It starts to occur in that set of literature which I spoke about very, very briefly called the Upanishads. 
That's where it really starts to occur. 
And if you just literally ponder on that English word for a moment, reincarnation, it's literally the same thing taking up another body. 
That's what it is. 
And what is the same thing is basically the question that takes up another body in the early Upanishads? Well, the same thing that takes up another body is the atman. 
Now, the atman is the self. 
It literally, in Sanskrit, the atman is a Sanskrit word, and it literally means breath. 
The atman was the breath. 
It's linked to the German word for breathing and breath, the atem. 
So it's actually that which is the breath or the life or the self of the individual which takes up residence in another body. 
Now, I always say there's a big difference between rebirth and reincarnation. 
So the context that the Buddha is speaking about is reincarnation. 
The belief in this very self-same thing fixed, unchanging, moving from life to life to life until something can be liberated. 
Until that can be liberated. 
Until it, in fact, can merge back with Brahman. 
Speak up if this doesn't make sense because I want to make sure everybody follows. 
So that's the context in which the Buddha is speaking. 
The context of the absolute, well, becoming the fundamental metaphysical idea of Indian society. 
It's the one that really permeates Indian society to this day is the idea, you know, sometimes if I'm in a, I don't know, sort of awful situation, then I can only wait for a future rebirth for it to be better or to be reincarnated in a better form in that life. 
Okay, that's the context in which the Buddha speaks about rebirth. 
Well, rebirth is obviously different, very, very different. 
And I'm trying to decide if it would give you the traditional interpretation or the way I actually see it within the text. 
I'm going to give you the way I see it. 
Come on, I might as well go for that one. 
What actually seems to me to be going on with the idea of rebirth in the text is much, much more metaphorical than literal. 
Again, I think he's playing with that background understanding because if you think about it, for a start off, if there is not this fixed self, even if there was rebirth, it's not going to be me that's reborn, is it? So it's no consolation and being reborn. 
So being reborn isn't a great big deal anyway. 
I've always contented myself with the thought, if something is reborn as a cockroach in a South American jungle, it's not going to be me. 
It's going to be something else. 
Now, I could even play with that idea a little bit, but I think the Buddha is using this idea as the notion of actually rebirth is a moment-to-moment thing. 
Now, I'm going to talk about dependent origination a little bit later on and I think you'll see the answer to this clearer within that, that this process of rebirth is a moment-to-moment rebirth. 
We literally carry our stuff over from moment-to-moment-to-moment and if you carry your stuff over, it'll help you engage. 
This is actually where I was going to go anyway, so it's a helpful question. 
It'll actually create this, Sangsara. 
Sangsara is very interesting, there's a word, because Sangsara is usually, and you've probably all heard it, Sangsara is the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. 
That's Sangsara, but Sangsara is actually much more than that. 
And that, I think, is a much later interpretation. 
Sangsara is literally, as the word etymologically means in Pali, going round in circles. 
That's what it means. 
So there's a qualitative, phenomenological sense to our finding ourselves in the same place repeatedly. 
Does that actually have any resonances with people? You know, that we find ourselves in same or similar places on an almost regular basis, and that's because we're carrying the same stuff over. 
That is a sense of how we're reborn, moment-to-moment-to-moment. 
The idea, obviously, is to get outside of that, liberating yourself from carrying stuff over. 
Now, what I often say about the concept of rebirth is, here in whichever way I think is helpful to you. 
Now, that way I've kind of given it to you here is a way I think it can help us to actually think about it as a much more positive thing directly within this life without being metaphysical. 
Know that we carry the same stuff over, know we repeatedly end up in similar places, and the cycle will continue for the rest of your life unless you do something about it. 
There's the fatalism, if you like, to a degree. 
If you don't do something about it, it continues over. 
It continues again and again and again and again. 
Doing that. 
So there, if you like, is the impetus to do something about it. 
The consolation, if you like, is within this life in that you could be free of that. 
Free of repetitive behavior. 
To my classes in Oxford, I often say this is particularly mostly therapists, I said, you know, the wheel of samsara is basically a big version of OCD. 
That's what it is. 
Obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
So we're obsessively and compulsively doing the same stuff again and again and again, because it's driven by the same material, again and again and again. 
Now, if we eliminate the material that drives it, literally the motivating force behind it, which is being identified as, for example, the first of them, loba, which is infatuation with stuff. 
That's a pretty well big compulsion, a lot of us. 
We're infatuated by the stuff of the world. 
Aversion towards the stuff that we're not infatuated with. 
That's a huge driving force. 
And then there is confusion. 
I tend to use the word confusion rather than delusion or ignorance, because both of those other terms in Western languages, delusion and ignorance have a kind of pejorative sense to them. 
It's your fault that you're confused and deluded. 
Actually, it's not really. 
It's because our societies are confused and our parents were confused and we end up being confused. 
That's what the situation that we're in and that's kind of the backdrop to all of our behavior that gives rise to the other two things. 
Now, unless you can deal with that, then repetitive behavior is going to go on. 
That's what's going to continue. 
However, if you hear it in the more traditional sense of something going on from life to life to life, well, all I can say is if that's helpful, well, okay, it's helpful. 
Use it. 
But it's metaphysical if you're hearing it in that sense. 
I can see repetitive behavior in my life and I'm sure you can all see it in your lives if you look at it. 
And if you want another version of empirical rebirth here, is that your stuff goes on even after you're dead. 
Doesn't it? All of those people you've been engaged with in your life and had close relationships, distant relationships, aversive relationships and everything else, all that goes on. 
If I bring up a child and traumatize that child, that goes on. 
That's a bit of me, in a sense, going on through that child who becomes an adult and then it goes on through their children. 
That's a very psychological way that our stuff goes on. 
Another way, and you can think about this more ecologically, is literally how garbage goes on. 
All the rubbish we leave behind us, both literally and metaphorically. 
It just goes on. 
So I think what the Buddha's way is about, really, a lot of it is actually beginning to eliminate the amount of debris that we leave behind us as we go through our lives. 
That, I would say, is literal rather than metaphysical. 
And I think we can see that. 
We can see the way others have influenced others and that way they've been psychologically harmed or helped by others. 
We can see literally our rubbish going on and so on and so forth. 
And it can be a very practical way of seeing this teaching. 
But, as you know, all of the major traditions within Buddhism have rebirth as a major concept within it. 
I've heard things like saying, well, you can't possibly be a Buddhist if you don't believe, unless it's the word belief, if you don't believe in rebirth. 
But on the other hand, these traditions, including, I'm not going to pinpoint any particular tradition because I think they're all doing it, all of these traditions will say examine everything. 
Analyze it, test it. 
Don't take it on authority. 
I think, particularly in Western Buddhism, so many times the Kalamazhita is cited as being really good and then people would say, well, go and believe in rebirth. 
Now, the Kalamazhita, by the way, for those who don't know, is the one where the Buddha is saying basically don't believe a word I say because I say it or somebody else says it, or it's tradition, or authority says it, or it's hearsay, or whatever ways that we get knowledge transmitted to us. 
He's saying examine it in your experience, but on the other hand, the traditions are saying something else. 
That's, I think, the difference between what I call the starter of the Nakhayas and religion. 
Now, I can only admit this for myself to you, which is what I'm interested in is actually not religion, but I'm interested in what is there as a teaching, which can help us directly. 
Sorry, it's a long answer to a short question again. 
Yes, just one more and then we'll continue to talk a little bit more further. 
If I understood you correctly, earlier you said that the Buddha was a social critic of the societal structures of the time, and I'm sort of reminded of the way I've come to view Jesus as also being a social critic for which he was crucified. 
So I'm just curious, did the Buddha, as far as we can tell, come in conflict with the power structures of the time? Oh, yes, very much so, very, very much so. 
He comes in conflict, not in quite the devastating way, of course, that Jesus does in the Gospels. 
He doesn't come into conflict in quite that way, but he's often put in extremely compromising political situations and positions, where, for example, one of the classic examples, there's something called the Samanya Palasota. 
Again, it's in the Degenakaya Long Discourses, where he's having a chat with a king called Ajata Satu. 
Some of you might know this text, and Ajata Satu is asking, basically, what are the fruits of living this reclusive life, the homeless life? Now, Ajata Satu, here's the background to it. 
Ajata Satu has just murdered his father. 
And if you go through the discourse, what you see the Buddha is, is gradually, very slowly beginning to bring the king around to an awareness of the deed that he's engaged in. 
That's the context with which it goes. 
Now, you often find him coming in conflict with the Brahmins. 
He often jokes with them. 
He puts himself in positions which are going to make him extremely unpopular in society, because he's questioning everything within it. 
He's actually really confronting that society. 
Now, Indian society, perhaps, I mean, it wasn't under the occupation, obviously, but Palestine was under that particular period with the Roman occupation, with Jesus, and so you probably haven't got the kind of same conflictual elements going on within it, but you're certainly finding a figure who is very unpopular, and there's a number of attempts made on the Buddha's life throughout the text, you know. 
For varying reasons, they're kind of slightly mythologized, but you see them going on. 
He's put himself in extremely unpopular positions at times. 
He speaks his mind most of the time, apart from the Samanya Palasota, where he's actually plays politics very carefully to try and bring Adyata Sati around to an understanding of what is being engaged in. 
But he's definitely coming in conflict with the powers that be of the time. 
When he comes into conflict with Brahmins, you often find them, for example, and I think these are probably very authentic texts, because there's no reason for them to be there, in many senses, in the canon. 
They often come to him and ask him a question. 
The Buddha will give his response and his reply, and on a number of occasions, they go away shaking their heads saying, this is rubbish, I don't understand what he's saying. 
Really not convinced by what he's saying. 
There's no reason for those to be there, but it shows him coming into conflict with what's going on. 
But other times, as you can imagine, he's making himself extremely unpopular. 
I mean, there's one particular instance, I'll give you one instance, where some Brahmins are throwing some water, and the Buddha says to them, he's throwing water up in the air towards the sun, and the Buddha says to them, what are you doing? He says, we're watering, sending water to the ancestors. 
So the Buddha picks up water and starts throwing it in the opposite direction. 
And they say to him, what are you doing? He said, I'm watering the fields. 
Imagine how popular that made him in Brahmins circles. 
So yes, I mean, the answer, yes, he does come in conflict, but we don't see the devastating results in quite the same way. 
Although, if you haven't read it, I would actually read Stephen Batchelor's last book, which kind of puts together an alternative biography of the Buddha, the confession of the Buddhist atheist. 
Because within that, I mean, I think Stephen even speculates that the Buddha might eventually have been poisoned, which is very, very possible, very, very possible. 
And this is the reason why he's saying to the others, I'll eat this, but don't let any of the others eat it at all. 
This particular food that's been prepared for him. 
He's obviously aware it's been adulterated in some way. 
That's right, Chunda, who's the blacksmith here, that's right. 
Madhava Sukara, which is probably pig's meat, which would again, would have been very antithetical to the Brahmins. 
Eating flesh. 
Okay, so we pause from some questions for a little bit and perhaps move this on just a tiny bit. 
So, let me kind of just hopefully sum up where we've got to a little bit. 
Buddha critiquing his society, exactly coming from your question, really, really engaged in critiquing his society, looking at what's going on within it. 
Using the tropes of the language of his society as well. 
I always have a picture, when I think about this and have an image of what was going on in Indian society with the Buddha walking around, I can imagine a lot of people scratching their heads, going, he appears to be using the same language, but he's now using it differently. 
And some people will engage with that and others won't in the different ways in which the language is being used. 
And he's often, if not always, metaphorizing aspects of Indian, and I do say this deliberately almost, Indian religious traditions. 
He's engaged in a tense, and I haven't mentioned this before, but he's engaged in a tense relationship with the two polarities of Indian society, which are, he's finding a middle way between the household life of the Brahmins. 
Now, everything in Brahman society was centered around house and hearth. 
All of your religious rituals, most of them took place in the household. 
It was your duty, I didn't mention this, it was your duty to get married and produce children if you're a male. 
Life was mapped out, I told you it was a thumbnail sketch, life was mapped out literally from cradle to grave as to what you should be doing at the stages of your life. 
And there's a term that they use even up to, in contemporary Hinduism, which is called navana ashrama dharma, the duties you have at the stages of your life to your social strata. 
And those are completely mapped out for you. 
And one do you have dropouts in the dissidents, as I put it, who moved outside of their society. 
So that's one side of the equation, which is the household life of everything being situated in it, literally with these duties. 
The other side of it was Jainism. 
Jainism actually presented a very different picture, which is a picture of complete asceticism. 
It's my accent, I have to apologize for it. 
I mean there was literally within, for example, the Jain orders and there were a number of them, a group which was known as digumbara, which was skyclad. 
These are the naked philosophers that Alexander the Great came across. 
These were the people who were very truly ascetic, ascetic within their society. 
They literally could not stay more than one night in any one place. 
They had to keep moving on. 
And some of you know even contemporary forms of Jainism have this sort of thing with wearing masks and always looking at your feet and never stepping on an insect. 
All this sort of really strong aspect of Ahimsa, Ahimsa non-violence, which is there. 
On the one hand, the household life is stultifying to any spiritual awakened experience or can be. 
The Buddha certainly puts it in the category of being quite difficult within that, but certainly within Brahman, within the stranglehold of Brahmanism, it becomes virtually impossible because it's all governed by ritual. 
And on the other hand, you have these extreme ascetic practices of the Jains. 
And so the Buddha is even creating an order that runs as a sort of social corrective between the two. 
So people become renounces. 
They come, you know, that Sramanera tradition, they become summoners. 
They become part of that renouncing order. 
But the Buddha cleverly says to them, you want to renounce society, I will make you completely dependent on society. 
Interesting move, very clever. 
So he's putting them completely back in touch and dependent on that society. 
So you can't escape society, even if you are entering into the bhikkhu sangra or the bhikkhuni sangra at that time as well. 
So that's part of the social critique as well. 
He's offering even an order which is, you know, by its very nature, critiquing the two extremes of society in its way. 
Then another major aspect, perhaps this is getting into slightly new material, he puts at the forefront of his movement ethics. 
Now I find this is something that actually in western dharma circles does not get talked about enough. 
The whole ethical side of this. 
And even that some of the figure within the history of Buddhism that I can be quite critical of, Buddha Gosar says that even your meditation practices if they're not rooted in ethics are groundless. 
So look at your behavior. 
Look at your thinking behind your behavior. 
Look at intention behind that. 
This is all coming out from an early study of the text. 
He's putting ethics at the forefront of this. 
Now within the bhikkhu bhikkhuni sangra, this is your 227 rules. 
Now at worst as a lay person you get 10, at minimum you get 5. 
But they form the actual bedrock of practice. 
These are not slightly sort of adjuncts to practice. 
And all too often, I don't know if this is true with yourselves, I'm sure it probably isn't, but all too often I see, certainly within the UK, I see people defining their form of Buddhism by what meditation practice they do. 
I'm a Dzogchen practitioner, I practice Mahumudra, I'm a Zen practitioner. 
These are all styles of meditation. 
I have nothing to do actually with the dharma. 
In a sense, the dharma is rooted in ethics. 
That is where it's rooted. 
It's rooted in that practice of everydayness. 
That's where you're acting every day. 
And even the precepts, I often find very mistranslated. 
Or curtailed, shortened. 
The sting, the radicality of what the Buddha is even proposing in the precepts, taken out of them. 
So the first precept says, don't kill. 
Okay, we're back into another ten commandments, except we've got five of them now. 
I'm not going to go through these with you because I think you're all familiar with them, but go back and look at the original wording of these things. 
They all start with, A, it's a rule of training. 
So this is a way of training yourself. 
Just as you sit down on the meditation cushion and train yourself in learning to not meditate actually, but cultivate another mistranslation. 
Another does not mean meditation, it means cultivation. 
We're cultivating particular dimensions of experience. 
Insight. 
We're cultivating calmness. 
We're cultivating meta. 
We're cultivating karuna, muddita, upeka, and so on and so forth. 
We're cultivating these. 
So a rule of training. 
A rule of training to refrain from harming living beings. 
Far more interesting than don't kill, isn't it? I mean, I can actually engage with that. 
The other one just tells me, don't do it. 
Whereas to refrain from harming living things means to actually engage in an inquiry into all my relationships of harm, including harm to yourself. 
It's implied you're not excluded in this. 
You're a living being. 
So how do you harm in your life? That's the interesting thing about it. 
And I'll only mention one more precept, but go through them all. 
But the third precept is an interesting one because it's usually just translated, don't engage in sexual misconduct. 
It actually, again, is mistranslated. 
Actually, one of the words within the whole phrase is kamesu, which is sensual indulgence. 
Don't, it's saying, I engage in a rule of training to refrain from sensual and sexual misconduct. 
So this is how you abuse your senses. 
We have multifarious ways from far more than ancient India, engage in sensual misconduct, misuse and overuse of the senses. 
So take a close look at those. 
That's, again, going back to the early texts rather than this. 
Often it can be, and I'm not pointing an accusatory finger at anybody, often these bland overlay of the way that we interpret it in contemporary practice, which is we come up with a nice list because that's what Westerners are used to, a nice list of things that says don't do this. 
Now, there's less of an engagement with a don't do than with a refraining from. 
Now, I'm not going to labour this point, but look at the precepts again. 
Reflect on the precepts on a regular basis in your daily life because they are the bedrock upon which the rest of the inquiry, which is the way I see this path that the Buddha is giving us in the early texts, it's that upon which it rests. 
If you look at, for example, the Sigalaka Sutta, which is, again, it's a Dighana Kaya Sutta, it's number 31, I think it is, in the Dighana Kaya, you'll find there, this is the Sutta that's directed towards Sigala, who's a layperson. 
And actually, as a layperson, there was always distinction in Indian society and the way it was portrayed in Indian society, they just had to look even more closely at their ethics than, say, the monastic, because the monastic has these 227 rules that they have to engage in, and they have the constant scrutiny of the other monks around them who often will critique them. 
They have to go through the Upasata, which is actually the recitation of their faults during the full moon and new moon periods. 
So there's a lot of kind of constraint on the monastics. 
But laypeople, we have to engage even more closely, I think, with the precepts. 
So that's kind of a little bit, I think, that comes out of the way this is taught. 
So that's the bedrock it relates, rests on. 
Okay, I'm going to go take us up to lunch on mistranslations out of this, because they're misleading, more often or not. 
I've given you quite a few, some of them I remind you of again, but in many ways the depiction we have of Buddhism places it firmly back with the translations we often have of a religious tradition. 
We've just heard me speak about them, because I've just used a couple of words, monks and nuns, Bikku, Bikuni, Vihara, monastery. 
These words don't actually mean this at all. 
Bikku means basically beggar or sharer. 
Now literally it means the most basic level, it can mean beggar, one who begs, but one who begs and also then shares what they have gained as food. 
You go round and you're pinned apart with your bowl and everything and people give you and then you go back and then you share the food between you from this. 
And there's another sense of sharer, and I'm sure you can come up with what that is. 
What do monks and nuns share? The dhamma, this is what they share. 
So in receipt, in kind of recompense for the food that they give and which they then share out among each other, they then share their understanding of the dhamma. 
That was the contract within society. 
Vihara is not a monastery. 
I don't know about you, but when I first came, when I was first involved in Buddhism 40 years ago, when I first heard the word monastery, I thought of kind of Catholic monasteries. 
Closed orders and all this sort of stuff and silence, and that came to this horrific thing of living in a Tibetan monastery. 
Which was far from that, had a main road running through it. 
About 600 monks in it who never stopped talking. 
And it was far from a quiet haven of a place. 
It's literally a dwelling place. 
That is all it is. 
So again, often notice the way that we're led into picturing things by the language that we use. 
The language of the dhamma, these are just peripheral words almost. 
Bikku, bhikkhuni, vihara. 
But the language of the dhamma is very precise, the way it's used. 
And often these translations mislead us in what they're doing. 
So dukkha, being the classic one, I won't go into that again. 
Vidya, ignorance, so pejorative. 
I'm sure, I don't know what it's here in the States, but as I said that to someone, you're ignorant. 
I'll probably get a punch on the nose in a UK situation. 
Whereas it doesn't actually mean that, it means more the sense of not, where it's not just not knowing, it's not wanting to know. 
It has that as its major connotation, not wanting to know. 
It's not Vidya, not knowing, not wanting to know, within it. 
Confusion, it also has that connotation of confusion within it. 
Sangsara, you've heard me talk about that. 
Well, birth, death, rebirth. 
Well, going round in circles, here it literally, going round in circles. 
This is a verb again, by the way, Sangsara, in its form. 
Nibbana, well, this is not Buddhist heaven. 
Nibbana is process, Nibbana is verb. 
It literally, if you want a technical version of it, it's what's classed as an intransitive verb in Pali. 
It means it doesn't move from a subject to an object. 
It's an intransitive. 
So it's actually literally means gone out. 
That's what it means. 
And it refers to the gone-outness of greed, infatuation, aversion, and confusion. 
Those have literally gone out. 
It has to be the flaming forces behind your behavior. 
Sangsara, which is also related to Sangsara. 
This is another word, which, you know, volitional formations, standard translation of it, volitional formations, doesn't really get into the main dimension of it, which is really its habit. 
It's that which is a habit. 
It could be bad habits, could be good habits, but they're still habits. 
In other words, they're unthinking, almost neural pathways upon which the mind rungs and constantly reproduces themselves in various activities and engagements that we engage in, that we have. 
Vinyana, which is usually translated simply as consciousness, which then neglects the more dynamic aspect of it, which is thinking. 
This is consciousness and thinking. 
It's cognizance, in other words. 
Vinyana. 
So these are just some of the words. 
It's just a small extract of the kind of lexicon of words that we use continuously, which actually I think the English word often blocks us from really, really engaging with what the Buddha is saying. 
Well, we've had the classic one, Buddha, awakened, awakening as opposed to enlightenment here. 
So we can get led into a religiosity simply by the language that we use, which isn't present in the early texts. 
Now, since I've got this title, which is, you know, Buddhism Before Taravada, well, Taravada is a religious position. 
Let's make that clear. 
Now, that's not to say it's a bad religious position. 
That's not to say it's a good religious position. 
It's a religious position. 
It's a position and a reading of the early texts in a very particular way. 
It's a very selective reading of the early texts, primarily by this figure called Buddha-Gosa in the fifth century, who then writes that massive doctrinal foundation for Taravada, the Visuddhimagra. 
So much so that any critique, anybody who's a critic of Buddha-Gosa and Sri Lanka, their books are banned because it's not Taravada in orthodoxy. 
It's not Taravada in position. 
And Sri Lankan, Taravada Buddhism, consider itself to be what they refer to themselves as pristine Taravada, completely uncontaminated by anything else. 
You'll walk through the middle of Sri Lanka and you'll find these Mahayana statues. 
And things like this. 
But what I'm trying to get you to hear is that it is an orthodoxy. 
There are certain things that you subscribe to as a Taravada, which are not necessarily there within those early starter of texts. 
So when we start to look at these early texts in this much more dynamic way, I would actually equate it to something that Heidegger says he does to the history of Western philosophy, which is you engage in a destructive retrieve. 
You have to destroy the tradition in order to retrieve what the tradition has cut out. 
Now, that sounds very dramatic. 
It's not as dramatic and as aggressive as that. 
But it is trying to retrieve those gold nuggets which are there in those early texts, which get so lost within this orthodoxy, which we can so easily sign up to and lose out in sense our investigative capacities here. 
And this is what you, in a sense, I say the practical side of what I'm talking about, is keep alive your investigative capacity. 
Your capacity to engage with these texts. 
They will reward you if you engage in them this way. 
So, there's a little bit about the background of Indian thought, and there's a little bit about the language that we use at present and how that language and the orthodoxies can mislead us. 
I think it's probably time, in a way, to move on into looking at some of the teachings that the Buddha gives. 
I think there could be absolutely authenticated through the early texts and see where, perhaps, and you are not going to explicitly everything here, but where in your minds you might see that they don't actually touch with what the tradition says, the traditions that you're used to. 
And I think we'll probably start with things like the noble truths after lunch and then have a look at also aspects of the teacher Samad Pada, you know, dependent origination. 
Because that actually is the explication of the noble truths or the ennobling truths as I'd like to get through to you. 
So, perhaps we adjourn for lunch, 12 o'clock. 
Does that sound okay? It will take, what, maybe an hour and 15 minutes? Does that sound good? Is that too long? Too short? Perfect.
