Good morning. Greetings.
And this is sitting here in the innermost meditation hall of IMC.
And this morning, the reference point for the meditation will be intimacy.
And intimacy comes from the Latin word, I think, intimacy, which means innermost or deepest.
And intimacy can be, it has two meanings in terms of meditation.
One is to be aware from the innermost deepest place within, an intimacy,
a place where awareness feels most intimate, where knowing feels most intimate.
The other meaning is to have awareness be most intimate with our experience.
That we don't stand far away, we don't step back to watch or see things being aware from a distance,
as we talked about yesterday, but rather we get really close.
And it's so close that it's a place where awareness and sensations meet,
and really kind of feels, really kind of connected, touching, in touch with our experience.
And it's held by the phenomena that sensations and sensing the sensations are inseparable.
To have a sensation is to sense the sensations, is to be aware of the sensation.
And so this intimacy is right there, to be right there where those two are the same.
But the intimacy and mindfulness meditation can be even deeper in that we go into,
we kind of put attention inside of the experience we're having.
So if we're experiencing the breathing, maybe in the chest or in the belly, the movements there,
almost like you imagine putting yourself in the middle of the breathing,
and the inside of the whole experience, and from the inside out being aware of breathing.
It's a little bit more clear sometimes for some people around pain,
that we can sometimes it's best to watch, see the pain from a distance.
That's the easiest way to have some equanimity.
Sometimes it can be easier to go to that innermost area of the pain, to go inside the pain.
Almost like you open the door and you step inside of it,
because pain is not a unitary singular thing.
A singular thing is made up of a variety of different sensations and things.
And to go put yourself right into the middle of it, the heart of it, and rest the tension there.
It's a very different relationship than even being up against it, touching it.
And sometimes when I've had extreme pain, the way that I've managed to stay somewhat balanced with it
is to do that very thing. I kind of let myself enter into the middle of the pain.
If I'm right at the edges of it and touching it, it's too easy to be in the reactive mode
or thinking about it or having an attitude about it.
But if I put myself right in the middle of it, then something gets quiet
and the reactivity kind of falls away or just there, and then the pain becomes something else.
Or if there's pleasure, not just to feel the pleasure,
but kind of almost like go into it to feel its component parts,
feel how the sensations of pleasure are dancing and moving and changing in and of themselves.
So these two meanings of intimacy.
Finding a place within where awareness feels intimate to be aware, that place.
There's a real intimacy from the inside out that maybe has not felt
if it's in the head watching or the experience.
And then to kind of come really close, so close to the experience with awareness
that you're kind of sinking into it or settling into it rather than
even being against the edges of it, touching it.
So to take a upright posture, either literally or metaphorically,
and to gently close your eyes.
And take some gently, gentle, long, slow, deep breaths on the exhale.
Relax into your body.
Settle down into your body like you're lowering yourself into a very nice pool of water, a bath.
Taking a deep breath in, settling in.
And letting your breathing come to normal.
And on the exhales, continue with the relaxing the body
and relaxing the face, the shoulders, the belly.
And each time you do, feel or allow or imagine that you're settling deeper inside.
The awareness is settling deep to maybe the most intimate place within.
And from a place of the innermost place
from where you can be aware or feel, sense your experience.
Become aware of your breathing.
And find kind of what you think is the center of breathing.
Kind of the center of the innermost part of the whole experience of breathing.
And let the awareness have that kind of intimacy with the breathing.
Not thinking about it.
Not being you who's aware of the breathing that's there.
But all of you seemingly settling into the center of your breathing
as if there's an easy chair there in which you can sit.
And from there be aware of the sensations of breathing, how those sensations arise.
As they're known, as they're known, they arise.
As they're known, they arise.
As they're known, they arise.
As they're known, they arise.
As they're known, they arise.
As they're known, they arise.
As they're known, they arise.
As they're known, they arise.
As they're known, they arise.
As they're known, they arise.
As they're known.
And if while you're aware, meditating, something else becomes more predominant than breathing.
Bring yourself really close to that, to the emotions, not to the thoughts, but to the thinking mind.
Not to what you're listening to, but inside the listening in the ears, sensations of listening.
Other sensations of your body that predominate. Feel them from the inside out.
As they're known, they arise.
As they're known, they arise.
As they're known.
As they're known, they arise.
As they're known.

And as we come to the end of the sitting.
To appreciate an intimacy here with oneself in whatever way that feels like you're away.
Is there some place where you can rest your attention within that feels like home or feels comforting?
Maybe it's a place that you don't easily share with other people.
But in the privacy of meditation you can open to it, you can settle in it, touch it.
Maybe it's in the heart.
Or maybe there's something deeper than the heart.
Some place deeper in the body.
It could be anywhere.
A place that's most intimate might be a place where we have the most acceptance of ourselves.
The most kindness to ourselves.
The most sense of belonging to yourself in a generous way, in a full way, here.
And without anyone needing to know in the privacy of your own meditation.
From the most intimate place within where you're capable of love, compassion, kindness, goodwill.
Rest in that place, let awareness settle and field.
Where you can have kindness.
Doesn't need to be expressed or spoken or no one needs to know about it.
Nothing you need to prove with it or accomplish.
Just the simplest place of tenderness, of warmth, and generosity of heart.
And from there to gaze upon the world kindly.
From there, invite the whole world into your heart as you allow your heart to become bigger and bigger.
Your heart becomes infinitely large to be able to hold the privacy of your own meditation.
All beings everywhere.
Maybe all beings everywhere as if they're your relations, your relatives, your friends, your fellow companions on the journey of life.
And to gaze upon them kindly, wishing them well, wishing them safety and belonging.
A deep acceptance, a deep possibility of being able to share their deepest place of intimacy with the world.
Wishing that they too could know and feel their own depths.
And with that, know the depths of others.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.
And may we stay close to where we can have these wishes.
And may we stay close to where we can gaze upon the world kindly and caringly.
May our care, kindness and generosity serve for the welfare and happiness of the world.
Thank you for watching.
You
