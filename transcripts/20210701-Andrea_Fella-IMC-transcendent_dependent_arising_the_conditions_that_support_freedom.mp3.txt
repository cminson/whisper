 So over the last weeks we've been exploring the conditions that unfold in our practice as we practice. So the direction towards happiness, towards freedom comes about through stepping onto the eightfold path and engaging with our experience, noticing how things are in the moment and being willing to meet it, engaging with wise view, wise intention, ethical conduct, and then engaging with effort, mindfulness, and concentration. So these practices are what step us onto the path and we begin to cultivate qualities of mind and heart that take us in the direction of freedom, take us in the direction of ease, of peace, of release from the habits of mind that tie us all up into knots, create suffering and struggling in the world, habits and patterns of greed, aversion, and delusion which are responsible for the vast majority of the suffering that happens. There are definitely things that happen, hurricanes and fires and natural disasters, things that happen that create stress, create difficulty for us. But the path that the Buddha is speaking about is one that leads to an ease or a peace of mind regardless of all of the conditions in the world. And so much of the suffering that we do experience comes because we are engaging with each other out of anger, hostility, frustration, confusion, desire, greed. So there's a lot of the suffering that is put into the world, a lot of what is difficult that's put into the world is a product of our human minds. There's so much of that that's going on and so the path that the Buddha pointed to is a way to uproot, diminish and eventually ultimately release those habits of mind that put so much stress and suffering into the world, the patterns and habits around greed, aversion and delusion. So this is the definition, actually the definition of freedom in the Buddhist teachings. I'll actually read some of this to you, descriptions of freedom. The ending of greed, the ending of hate, the ending of delusion. This indeed is called freedom, called nirvana. Enraptured with lust, enraged with anger, blinded by delusion, overwhelmed with mind and snared, one aims at one's own ruin, at the ruin of others, at the ruin of both, and experiences mental pain and grief. But if lust, anger and delusion are given up, one aims neither at one's own ruin nor at the ruin of others nor at the ruin of both and experiences no mental pain and grief. This is nirvana. This is freedom, immediate, visible in this life, inviting, attractive and comprehensible to the wise. And the description of that experience of freed from greed, aversion and delusion, well he said, experience is no mental pain and grief, but he goes on in another place to say this is peace, this is exquisite. The ending of craving, peaceful. Some other similes that are used, I won't read all of them, there's a set of about 42 similes that are used for freedom. I'll just read a few of them. The true, the beyond, peace, the exquisite bliss, solace, the wonderful, the exhaustion of craving, the subtle, the very hard to see, security, the unafflicted release. So there are some similes for this freedom. And the teachings that we've been exploring point to that there are conditions that lead us in this direction to the ending of greed, the ending of aversion, the ending of delusion. There are conditions that support the movement in that direction. And that's what we've been exploring, the teaching of transcendent dependent origination. And it begins, as we've explored, as we've talked about it, it begins when we meet suffering and basically ask the question, is there a way out of this suffering? And we have the great fortune to meet someone or read a book or hear a talk that points the way that says, yes, there is a possibility to live a different way. And with that, we begin to get curious, perhaps listen to those teachings, maybe begin to engage. And so the beginning, the very beginning of this path, it's an act of intelligence. It's a cognitive act. It's a thinking about suffering and asking the question and then listening to teaching. So this, it starts with a cognitive act. And then we step, perhaps we step onto the path, the cognitive act of hearing the teachings maybe points to us that engage, you know, step onto this path. That's that activity of taking that step onto the path requires some confidence or some faith or some trust. And that's a heart quality. And so right at the beginning of the path, we have this blending of cognitive qualities and heart qualities that propel us into action. And I see this actually all the way through. We'll just go go through the steps again, just briefly here from this perspective of how the path, the unfolding conditions blend or interweave or integrate. I think of it as an integration of heart and mind. We have the wisdom or the understanding to step onto the path, but then there's the kind of the trust that it's actually going to support us. So there's heart and mind together. And then as we begin to practice, and again, the practice actually requires us to remember the teachings and bring those into mind. So we use our intellect, we use our thoughts, our cognition to begin the practice. But then as we practice the unfolding of these conditions, the next steps or the next unfoldings in this teaching around transcendent dependent origination, the conditions that lead us towards freedom bring in that with the arising of faith and actually beginning to engage, that delight and joy follow. So more heart qualities. And we're kind of carried along by those heart qualities, that delight and joy that can arise as we begin to engage, nourishes the intellect, nourishes the cognitive part of the mind that says, yes, this is useful. This is helpful. This is a direction to continue. And so the heart and the mind support each other. And then the next tranquility, the mind kind of settles down, it begins to settle down. It is also just kind of a blending of, it's not exactly what we call an emotion tranquility. It's not exactly what we would call cognition either. It's kind of the settling of cognition that's experienced. It's the settling of the mind, the settling of the conscious mind. Instead of being so active and busy, it starts to get more tranquil. So it's a different way of experiencing our cognitive capacities. And from there, that tranquilizing of the mind, the result is happiness. What follows there is a happiness because that settling of the mind, we begin to touch into a completely different way of being that we may not have ever really known before. There's a settling of the mind, a letting go of a lot of, not an ultimate letting go, but a settling of some of the hindrances at this point. There's a settling of those hindrances. And we taste for a little while the experience of freedom from being battered around by greed and aversion all the time. And we taste that and happiness is the experience. So again, this kind of blending or interweaving of heart and mind qualities from that happiness concentration, a deepening of the settling of the mind happens. Again, not exactly a, again, it feels kind of like a blending, like tranquility concentration feels like a blending of heart and mind to me, a different kind of experience of heart and mind. And that's very settled and very receptive and can the concentrated mind can receive experience in a way that understands it in a new way. So that concentrated mind when motivated by understanding suffering, again, the cognitive momentum of the path starting with wise view, understand suffering. And so the concentrated mind connected to that wish to understand suffering, again, the blending of intelligence with kind of the settled heart, that allows us to start to see things in a new way. We see experience as impermanent, as unreliable, as not self. So that again, this is a more in this becomes an understanding that is reflected in the cognitive side of things. We understand it's not necessarily integrated fully in a way. I mean, we at times we have the understanding of, oh yeah, that's impermanent. And the mind will just let go of something as it sees its impermanence for a little while. But then a little while later, the habit of that craving or clinging comes back because that understanding of the impermanence hasn't been fully integrated in a way. It was available in that moment. The seeing of impermanent and unreliable in that moment was available. And so the mind could let go. But the movement or the underlying tendency towards those habits of greed and aversion and confusion, they're still there. And so there's a process of learning, a process of unwinding, a process of seeing over and over and over again these habits and getting the taste of a different way, then forgetting that taste of a different way, getting caught in our habits again, feeling the suffering of that, perhaps experiencing a letting go again. So there's a process here at this point in the past. So this is what we talked about the last couple of weeks, the understanding of things as they are, impermanent, unreliable, not self, leads to a sense of disenchantment with our habits and patterns, disenchantment with the way we have engaged in the world. And so I think of disenchantment, so the knowledge and vision of things as they are, seeing the impermanent, unreliable nature of experience, that's kind of the wisdom side of things. It's not just cognitive, it's an integrated, integrated cognitive experience that allows a release from the habitual clinging. But the patterns and habits are so deep that there's a lot of resistance to that truth. We don't like these truths. We don't like that it's impermanent. We don't like that things are unreliable. And so the process of disenchantment is the process of realizing over and over and over again that the patterns and habits of greed and aversion and delusion keep getting us caught, it's like we have to get disenchanted over and over and over again. And so the heart doesn't like these truths, doesn't like that things are impermanent, unreliable, and so it rebels. So the place of disenchantment is the place of seeing the deeper and deeper ways the heart just does not want to accept these truths. So there's a process. This is a gradual path. This process is gradual. And that's emphasized over and over in the teachings, but also here I think in this part of the unfolding of the conditions that lead us to freedom, both disenchantment and the next one, dispassion, that the word dispassion we talked about last time, dispassion literally means that the word wiraga in Pali literally means fading out. And so the process of the fading out of those habits and patterns, just even the word implies that it's a gradual letting go, a gradual releasing. And so the, again, this is kind of blending between heart, the cognitive and the heart qualities, the wisdom and the heart qualities. In disenchantment, the heart is responding to wisdom with some frustration, with some difficulty, with some challenge. And the way through that time is really to open to those heart responses, the not liking of that truth. That's our path. And then as we open to those relationships, open to the fear, open to the confusion, open to the frustration, open to the feeling of homesickness, of just really wanting to go back to those habits and patterns because they were so comfortable. As those begin to unwind, the mind begins to let go. And that's the dispassion. And that to me too is more in the, it's less emotional and more kind of the wisdom operating in our minds. It just goes, yeah, that is just not helpful. The mind begins to let go. And so this letting go is the releasing of greed, aversion and delusion. So this, the dispassion is really the beginning of freedom, the beginning of that description of what I read. The lust, anger and delusion are given up, one experiences no mental pain and grief. This is freedom, immediate, visible in this life. So the next few steps or conditions that follow from this letting go of greed, aversion and delusion, that's the kind of the mind, the mind lets go because it understands, again, the cognitive is there. It's not, it's not a conscious cognitive thing. It's not me saying, oh, I should let go of this. There's such a deep understanding that the mind will let go. The wisdom that's been cultivated will let go of the clinging, will let go of the greed and aversion. And so again, this is a, this is a cognitive act, but it's not cognitive in terms of me doing it. It's cognitive in terms of the wisdom that's been cultivated. Let's go. The next couple of links in the, the chain are called release. And then the last one, knowledge of release. And to me, again, we kind of, we end where we end with the release. What is said is that the, in the commentaries, at least in the descriptions of this teaching, is that the, I find within my notes on this piece. The moment of just when, when the mind finally fully lets go of greed, aversion and delusion, that's the release from craving. So that's, that's the, that's where the mind just realizes not to pick up, not to pick up the craving anymore. So that's the, the, the taste of the beginning taste of freedom from greed, aversion and delusion. The next moment or the next experience that's said to follow from that is kind of the enjoyment of the experience of freedom from the oppressiveness of greed, aversion and delusion. So the next moment is, is said to be a kind of a heart quality. So there's the, there's the release, there's the, there's the, the letting go, the dispassion, the mind that has let go of the, the greed, aversion and delusion. And the next moment is this feeling of enjoyment. This word is, is, is Vimuti in the Pali. And it is often translated as emancipation or freedom or release, something like that. It is the, it is the freedom from the, the chains that have been binding us basically. So emancipation is a common, a common translation for this word. And Bhikkhu Bodhi, a commentator, a translator of the suttas into English has described the difference between these two as between dispassion and this emancipation as being kind of breaking out of chains that have bound you into prison. So that, that stepping out of that prison is the dispassion and the emotion that you experience upon the experience of the freedom. That's Vimuti, that's that emancipation. So that's a heart quality again. It's kind of this, the, the, a different feeling in the heart, feeling of not tied up anymore. The last one is said to be a cognitive understanding of, it's like that, it's again, it feels like that there's an integration between our heart and our mind here. The heart understands the freedom in enjoyment and the mind understands greed, aversion and delusion are gone. They're not even, there's not even a trace of them left. That is said to be the final freedom. And so to me, this, this path, the main piece I wanted to say or to get across here is to point to how the eightfold path is our, that's our practices. That's what we do. We cultivate right view. We learn the teachings. We learn about how to engage that supports our intention to engage, which encourages us to engage skillfully with wise speech, wise action, wise understanding, and to carry that into observing our hearts and minds with, with wise effort and wise mindfulness and wise concentration. So those, that's what we do in our practice. And as we engage with that, there's more momentum that builds so that it's less work and more it's kind of like more natural over time. In a way it's, it starts out being pretty hard. And at times it gets hard. At least I've seen there are definitely times when, you know, it gets easy for a while. It's like, Oh, I figured it out. And then it gets hard again. You know, that disenchantment place, it gets hard again there, you know, when you really have to keep looking at things and really want to go back to those habits and patterns. But the, the work that we do is in that eightfold path, but the unfolding, what happens as we engage to me is a very deep integrated integration of our heart and mind and body, the integration of understanding and what that understanding leads to heart qualities of compassion and joy and loving kindness and the feeling of freedom as a release that the kind of the joy of that. So there's to me, this, the, what the, the practice, the freedom liberation to me inspires me as a form of really deep integration of wholeness that can be experienced when the mind and heart understand letting go of greed, aversion and delusion. What's let go of, what's let, what's released, what's eliminated are the forces that tie us up in knots, the forces that divide us from various parts of ourselves, the forces that create schisms in our hearts and the forces that divide us from each other. That's what's released in our path of practice. It's not the sometimes when we hear, you know, the ending of greed, aversion and delusion, we might wonder and certainly when we're caught in greed, aversion and delusion, there's a way in which those habits of mind tell us I'm what's motivating you. I'm why you do anything. And when we're caught in those qualities, the mind can't fathom or can't imagine that there are motivations that are possible when greed, aversion and delusion are absent. And so this is, this is that, that integration that, that happens through this path is the beginning of the understanding of the, the qualities of the wholesome qualities that can motivate us. Compassion motivating us, wisdom motivating us to engage in the world. It's such a different, such a different way of being. So the expression of freedom, the definition of freedom is the release of greed, aversion and delusion, but the expression of freedom, I mean, just the sound of release from greed, aversion and delusion, you know, well, if I wasn't angry about anything or I didn't want anything, why would I do anything? We might think that we would, you know, we would just kind of sit around and I don't know, space out or something without greed, aversion and delusion. But the expression of freedom is a movement of compassion, of engagement, of love, of connection, of care. There's the, the absence of greed, aversion and delusion leaves a lot of room for so many different expressions of freedom to arise. I've experienced some people in Burma. I've met some people, some monastics, some practitioners in Burma who are very free. I don't know if they're ultimately free or not. They're very free and they're also very different. Some of them are very, one, one person is so tranquil and so quiet and I just want to be really still and sit with him and listen to him quietly speak the Dharma. And another one is just always laughing and playing games and like joking and so different. The expression of the absence of greed, aversion and delusion doesn't look like any one thing. There's a lot of room for personal expression, I guess we could say in that. It's a, I think there can be a celebration in that, the variety of possibilities with freedom.
