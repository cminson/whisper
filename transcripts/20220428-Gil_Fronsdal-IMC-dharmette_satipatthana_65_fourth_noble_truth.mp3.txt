The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So today's topic is the fourth noble truth and how we understand that depends
a little bit about how we understand the second noble truth. If the second noble
truth is the cause of suffering, then we may or may not be able to let go of the
suffering, but we understand the cause. And knowing that maybe some
attachment is the cause, some clinging is the cause, some belief that's unhealthy
is a cause, then we look for a practice that helps us to become free of that, to
loosen the grip. And so the fourth noble truth is the practice to do that. And so
we start cultivating a way of being in the world that creates the conditions
for us to let go of the cause. And so we practice right view, we practice ethical
life, we practice meditation practice, so that we can experience or attain the
degree of subtleness, the degree of non-agitation, the degree of integrity
that allows us to, or the system or mind or hearts to begin to soften and release
the attachments we have. If we know the cause of suffering, in craving or
attachment, and we have a very clear release of that craving, a cessation of
it that's dramatic, then we know, oh this is the way forward. And so if the
Eightfold Path can be, this is the way to do this again. This is the way to
develop myself and grow myself so that these are the practices so that I put
myself in a better position to let go even more and not cling again. If the
second noble truth is the arising of suffering, and the fourth is the cessation
of suffering, we see it coming and going, all the different shapes and forms of
suffering that we have, of stress we have, and we see that in the arising and
passing there starts to be freedom. Then the Eightfold Path can be seen as a
path to do this more and more, support that deep seeing. But if the cessation,
the third noble truth, is a definitive clear dropping away, the bottom drops
away in some wonderful inspiring way, and then we realize, oh this is freedom. This
is peace. This is the profound sense of well-being that's possible. I have no
idea. Then the Eightfold Path is still the practice to do, it becomes the
practice to two things, to move into this experience of peace more and more. But it
also becomes a practice that manifests that peace. In the teachings of the
Buddha, we find plenty of times where the Eightfold Path are eight ways of
being in the world, which are not practices to attain peace. They're not
practices that, now we understand, this is the what we should practice if we want
to deepen and deepen our peace. But there are more expressions of the peace. So I
don't know if this is a good example, but an open hand might feel
easeful, and the expression of the open hand is ease. The expression of open hand
is being open. The expression of open hand is being its sensitivity available to
the world. The expression of the open hand is it doesn't, it's not creating a
fist to hit someone. It's just an open hand. So when the letting go is deep, full
enough, and we have a, it becomes, it can become a reference point and a source
from which we then live our life. And the Eightfold Path then is not a
prescription for how to practice further, so we can deepen our practice or
experience more liberation, but rather the Eightfold Path is an expression, is a
description of how we start living. So if, if, so expression, how are they, so at
some point we have a clear sense that it's really good to be at ease, to be a
peace, to be, have a sense of well-being. And then when we have forces within us
that want to go in a different direction, we would say why? Why give up
something good, something useful for something that's not so good? And it's
not a matter of practicing the Eightfold Path, but rather it's a matter of not
doing those things that take us away from the Eightfold Path. Someone who is
deeply practiced becomes the Eightfold Path. They don't practice the Eightfold
Path. And then becoming it, they don't do the things, they don't allow themselves to
do the things that, that take that away or they lose touch with themselves, this
home of who they are. And so at some point in this Four Noble Truths practice, the
Eightfold Path becomes more and more interesting. Either it becomes, we
understand that this is useful to do this, all eight of these practices, to create
the conditions, to involve, to move into a kind of transform who I am, transform my
feelings, my, my sense of being, my attitude, how I am in the world. So it
becomes easier to let go more and more. Or there has been a transformation from a
deep letting go. And now it's a matter of growing that transformation, letting it
become spread and become bigger and bigger. And the Eightfold Path is then
both the goal, the fulfillment of the goal, and the means to the goal. So the
Eightfold Path are eight sets of ways of being. Sometimes they're called Eight
Practices, which is true when they're understood to be a means to liberation.
But there are eight ways of being when they're understood as being an
expression of our awakening. So these are right view, right resolve, right speech,
right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
concentration. And the right concentration ends with right concentration. And right
concentration is, so the middle ones, right speech, right action, and right
livelihood, they're ethical, how we behave in the world and how we relate to
other people, how our actions affect others. And there's a kind of an
orientation to an ethical transformation. Not to follow rules so much, but to follow
these guidelines, these ways of being that are the ethical guidelines, so that
we begin to be transformed. It's not about following rules, only it's about
living this way so that we start being ethically transformed. We become someone
who has such a sense of integrity or peace that, of course, we wouldn't do
the unethical things that would obscure that or harm that. But with the right
concentration, we're talking also about a transformation. Concentration is not
just a matter of having a lazy, not just a laser focus of the mind. It's having a
unified sense of peace and calm from having let go a lot and practicing
concentration, practicing stability and steadiness. And this is one of the
primary ways that the tradition, Buddhist tradition, has for preparing
ourselves for the deepest kinds of letting go we can do. We're kind of
becoming softer, more malleable, more resilient, more less distractible. And in
that state, it's kind of like we're ready for just something to be put down
that we've been carrying for a long time. So there's some kind of inner
transformation that happens. And part of that inner transformation is an
experience of peace. And at some point that peace becomes a reference point,
becomes a seed that we can water and grow, becomes something that a plant that
kind of grows and blossoms within us. And the Eightfold Path represents
that blossoming, that fulfillment of it all. So if you're not familiar with the
Eightfold Path, they're really marvelous things to learn and study. Once
you kind of get the idea, study them enough so you understand the basic idea
of what it is, each of them, then once you understand, then you can start
feeling your way, sensing your way, understanding how these eight waves of
being are not only practices, they're also inner wellsprings of being at
home, inner expressions of being settled in a peace with oneself. And this
peace doesn't start off, doesn't have to be dramatic, but there might be a
little hints of what that is like. And then as we orient around that peace, it
can grow. It's possible to have very small degrees of peace in this life
that we overlook. The mind is so concerned with its preoccupations that
we just keep thinking them and we have one preoccupation finished and we just
plan to jump on to the next one and the next one. And there's no space. What we
learn in this practice is to create a little more space and attentiveness to
the subtler places of well-being, subtle places of peace that begin surfacing
through the practice and then touch into it periodically, regularly through the
day. Find the little seeds and recognize it, water it with attention. Let it be a
reference point, let it be a guide, let it be kind of there to support you as
you go through your life. So for this day, you might study, get a book or
something or go online and read about the noble Eightfold Path, but you also
might look for the seeds of peace, the little hints of it, or ease, that
might be more part of you, more available than you allow yourself to feel.
Pause, stop, take a break, check into yourself, see if you can find, is there
anywhere within you some modicum, some even a smallest degree of peace and
well-being. And if you stay close to that for a little while, breathe with it,
what happens to you? And what do you learn about peace, being, an expression, and not
a practice? So thank you for today and we'll have one more talk on the Four
Noble Truths tomorrow. And we're almost done with the Satyapetana Sutta. Thank
you.
