So, as Inez was saying this morning, the great thing about a meditation retreat is this
opportunity for continuity of practice, that we get a much larger period of time in which
to practice being present, being aware, being in contact with our experience.
And I like to think of, you know, the entire meditation retreat as having this sort of
ongoing posture of alert, attentiveness, wakefulness, investigative, studying, and it's just the
frame that changes.
So we go from the practicing that in sitting, practicing that in walking, practicing that
while we're preparing and eating a meal, whatever mode we're operating in, we bring that way
of being to it.
And now we're moving into the frame of Dharma talk meditation.
And I think it's really helpful to think of this period as any other period of meditation
and cultivation. So that might mean some sense of staying connected with your body and your
breath as you're listening.
Might mean something like listening with the body, listening with that sense of embodiment,
listening with the heart, moving out of a conceptual mode of listening into a more heartfelt
mode of listening.
And there's no need to take notes unless that really helps you.
You can just listen and trust that whatever is important and timely will stick.
And also know that the talks are being recorded.
So you can always go back and listen to them again.
So the Buddha counseled this path activity of wise effort, part of the Eightfold Path
of awakening of liberation, freedom.
I learned it a slightly different way.
I have a different acronym.
It's very similar, but I learned it as pace, P-A-C-E, pace your effort.
So the P stands for presenting unwholesome states that have not arisen.
The A is abandoning unwholesome states that have arisen.
C is cultivating wholesome states that have not yet arisen.
And E is extending those wholesome states.
Most of my meditation study and training has been in the Vipassana tradition.
Most of my practice done at Spirit Rock Meditation Center.
And it's always been oriented around a spirit of resting with what is being at
ease in this moment, however things are, really learning to investigate the experience without
trying to change it or manipulate it in any way.
So when hindrances arise, my training was to be with the hindrance, allow it to be there,
feel the unpleasantness of it as it manifests in the mind and the body, to be with it without
judgment, to notice where there's clinging.
And the development of this capacity is tremendous.
Sometimes I think that's kind of the, almost the superpower that comes with our practice
is that we can cultivate being at ease however things are, even when conditions are difficult,
to have some sense of being okay, even when things aren't okay.
I think if you look around the world it's very easy to reasonably conclude that there's
a lot that's not okay.
And yet it's still possible to experience joy, ease, well-being, and happiness that's
not so dependent on those outer circumstances because we've transformed our relationship
with our experience.
I had the good fortune to attend a short meditation retreat with Venerable Bhikku Analyo, he's
a pretty famous monk and scholar of the early Buddhist teachings, and he gives this meditation
instruction and I'll sort of mimic it.
This is pretty much the pace of the instruction.
He's German-born so he does it with a little accent but I won't do the accent.
Feel the body resting on the earth, feel the body from within the body, remove the hindrances,
feel the joy of an unhindered mind.
And this retreat was to a group of Spirit Rock teachers, I was a trainee at the time,
and one of the very senior teachers in our tradition asked this question, you talk about
removing the hindrances like you just snap a finger and the hindrances are gone, how
do you do that?
And he said, I thought this was an advanced group.
His approach to the practice of meditation was so different than mine, it was really
a kind of empowerment to develop a powerful meditative skill to help you along the path.
So much more clear seeing and insight that can happen when we're not hindered.
So I think I'm kind of going through a little bit of an evolution, so inspired by that,
that one could have a meditative cultivation that would be like a recipe for happiness.
And this is really what this teaching of the Four Wise Efforts is and I think there's probably
a middle way of how to approach this.
You can balance point, maybe you find your own balance point and maybe that balance point
changes from time to time.
If you're a fixer and your first tendency is to apply some strategy, then maybe you
relax the effort and spend more time in the being with, the investigating, the coming
up close to the experience.
Maybe if you spent a lot of time doing that, and I think that, like I said, I think that
practice is very important and very helpful, but if you spent time doing that, then maybe
moving more in the direction of how can I have agency over my mind state.
So I just want to unpack some of the language that we've already begun to use, skillful,
unwholesome, kusala in Pali, these are states of mind that lead to the alleviation of suffering
for ourselves and others, unwholesome, unskillful, kusala tends to lead to suffering in ourselves
and others.
And we tend to know these states when we manage to see them.
The unwholesome states can often lead to agitation, confusion, not seeing things clearly, often
predominantly unpleasant, or unpleasant in the end, they can sap our energy.
Wholesome states tend to be more calming, more uplifting, leading to more discernment
and wisdom, predominantly pleasant maybe, give us energy and enthusiasm, often lead
to the arising of kindness and compassion, which is also very pleasant.
So lots of examples of these, I'll just share some of them with you, the greed, hatred and
delusions that to be the root of suffering, unwholesome, unskillful, kusala, and for those
of you that are new to this, and most of you are experienced practitioners, but the first
time I heard these words, greed, hatred, and delusion, I thought, I don't have those things,
I'm not greedy, I don't have hate, and so you can take those as shorthand for a wide
range of experiences from being slightly irritated to enraged, to the desire for enormous amounts
of material wealth, to the desire for a cookie in this next moment, can be a whole range
of experiences.
And I think it's quite interesting that in the Pali language, oftentimes the opposite
is just a negation, so the opposite of hatred is not necessarily love, we might say the
opposite of hatred is love, but the terms that are often used in the sutras are non-hate,
so non-hate, non-greed, non-delusion, are skillful, wholesome, and I find this helpful
because there are certain political figures, public personas where it's very difficult
for me to get to love, but it might be attainable to get to non-hate.
So killing, stealing, false or harsh speech, gossiping speech, covetousness, misusing our
sexuality, taking intoxicants all unwholesome.
We brought this in at the beginning of the retreat, partly to create a container of
fear safely, but also because this practice is stepping into the wholesome.
Abstaining from all these things, unwholesome, so abstaining from killing, stealing, unwholesome,
abstaining from killing, stealing, unwholesome speech.
And you know, I'm going to talk predominantly today about preventing, although there's definitely
some overlap in all the elements of preventing, abandoning, cultivating, and extending, but
maybe this is our first item on the list of preventing, to follow the precepts, to practice
good moral conduct, to live in integrity.
And when we practice this, this harmlessness, it's so skillful.
We give others the gift of safety, the gift of fearlessness, you know, this feeling when
you're around a safe person, you actually can kind of relax.
And so when we practice harmlessness, we kind of automatically reduce the suffering of others
in this way.
We also reduce our own suffering when we do things that are not in alignment with our
core values.
The body will usually tell us the more and more we practice mindfulness of the body,
the more and more sensitivity we develop to listen deeply to the, they're always providing
it.
It becomes uncomfortable when we're not in integrity.
And when we're in alignment with our deepest values, it actually feels really good and
free.
When I was a young child, I went to India with my parents and, you know, I was born here
and grew up here.
So I had a lot of trouble with the food and all the activities that we were involved in
was mostly visiting relatives and friends involved food.
And everywhere you'd go, they'd want to feed you.
And I was a, you know, a skinny kid who was very picky and mostly I wouldn't like the
food, but he couldn't really refuse and you couldn't get away with just like moving your
food around the plate.
So I came up with a brilliant idea that I would just tell anything I didn't like.
I would just tell the hostess that I was allergic to that food.
So I developed this long list of foods that I was allergic to.
But I was fickle.
So the list kept changing.
And what I didn't count on is that all the friends and relatives and family talked to
each other.
So I got caught up in this terrible mess of web of deceit.
And what I remember most profoundly about that was that it was very stressful.
I was a five year old and I was really quite tormented by these lies, which really were,
you know, like not wanting to hurt people's feelings, but still very unpleasant.
You have this experience of you contemplate doing something unethical and your conscience
tucks you out of it.
And the both I call these forces, the guardians of the world that they guard us against unwholesome
intentions and acts when we have real remorse and a kind of conscience.
Someone wrote a letter to the IRS.
It said, dear IRS, I have been unable to sleep knowing that I have cheated on my income taxes.
I've understated my taxable income and I've been in close to tick for $5,000 sincerely
taxpayer.
And it says, PS, if I can't still can't sleep, I'll send the rest.
But when we act in alignment with our deepest values, we can live in what the both I described,
the bliss of blamelessness.
It's really, it's like a remarkable feeling to be able to go through the world unafraid,
held up high that you know that you're not to blame for anything.
Other wholesome states worth mentioning, any of the Brahma Viharas, so meta kindness, friendliness,
Karuna, compassion, Medita, when we have joy at the joy of others, Gropeka, equanimity,
generosity, renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience, resolve, so we might recognize those
from the list of the Ten Parames, all wholesome.
Faith?
I've been thinking a lot about faith lately.
I, sometimes when I get too involved in the state of the world, doubt arises and thinking
about faith as a kind of attitude to doubt, wholesome state.
And some vega, the Buddha called spiritual urgency, where we kind of feel like, okay,
it's all on the line now, we got that now or never can bring us energy and enthusiasm
to our practice.
Sometimes we see the unwholesome as the opposite, so we notice impatience or stinginess or
indulgence, lack of resolve.
And you know, we live in such a culture of self-improvement that I always feel like I
want to address that, that there's a way that it can sometimes feel a little bit violent
almost, that we discount who we are in favor of who we want to become.
And for me, this is kind of a red flag in my practice when the desire to prevent and
abandon and cultivate and keep turning into like a lot of negative self-dialogue, or have
ill-will in it, for me this negative self-talk often reveals itself with the word should.
I should blank, fill in the blank, the thousand things I should be or should do or should
not do.
And sometimes it feels like that voice is encouraging or helping you, but you know,
when there's ill-will in it, I think it falls in the category of unwholesome.
So I want to share a quote from Jim Sinclair, he's a prominent activist for the autism community.
And I don't really have, it's not anything to do with autism, it's just he's the one
that happens to say these inspiring words, and they're strong in their nuance, but they
really have helped me.
So I want to share them with you.
He says, when my parents say I wish my child did not have autism, what they're really
saying is I wish the child I have did not exist and then had a different non-autistic
child instead.
This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence, this is what we hear when you pray
for a cure, that your fondest wish, your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease
to be, and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces.
Every time I hear that, it's like a kick in the gut because I've seen some version of
that in my own mind, something that's trying to negate and replace.
It's worth keeping in mind to notice when that self-talk becomes filled with ill will
and that it's then one of the things that we can learn to prevent and abandon.
Another way to prevent the unwholesome from arising is by cultivating samadhi, sometimes
called concentration, not my favorite translation.
When the mind is gathered, calm, collected, unified, the mind is more responsive, more
malleable, and we've already begun to do this.
This is a natural byproduct of meditation practice, especially on retreat.
We aim the attention at the object of our meditation, the breath, the body, we sustain
that attention, and with the right balance of effort, the mind naturally gets gathered
and concentrated.
Built into that experience often is a pleasant feeling in the body, can be pleasant mental
factors that are energizing and give you enthusiasm.
Sometimes when those factors are strong, it can feel like there's a kind of effortlessness.
The way it's been described to me is it's not so much that I'm practicing dharma or
I'm practicing meditation, but that I'm being practiced in some way.
Another way we can prevent the unwholesome is through wise view.
One of the sutta in which the Buddha urges his disciples to frequently recollect these
five things.
This is done in monasteries around the world as a daily practice to reflect on these five
recollections.
I am of the nature to age, I have not gone beyond aging, I am of the nature to sicken,
I have not gone beyond sickness, I am of the nature to die, I have not gone beyond dying.
All that is mine, beloved in pleasing, will become otherwise, will become separated from
me.
And then it takes a slight turn.
I am the owner of my karma, heir of my karma, born of my karma, related to my karma, whatever
karma I shall do for good or for ill of that I will be the heir.
There's a modern version of this, there's an app.
When you leave the retreat, you can get this app for your phone, if you're inspired, it's
called We Croak, and it sends you reminders five times a day of, it basically says, don't
forget you're gonna die, or remember you're gonna die, and their tagline is death makes
you happy.
And I have actually found this to be true.
When I'm involved in some internal drama, I'm annoyed at my co-workers, I have some
resistance to something that I know is actually good for me, then this pops up on my watch
or my phone, you're going to die, and it really, it kind of puts things in perspective, is
this thing that I'm so worked up about, something I'm gonna remember on the night of my death.
With wise view comes the acknowledgement that being a human being comes with some measure
of suffering, the seminal teaching of the Buddha and the first noble truth, and as was
saying, we don't always get what we want, we often get what we don't want, sometimes
we get what we want, and it's not what we thought it would be, it's like you meet someone
and you're sure you were lovers in a distance past life, soul mates, and after two weeks
with them, you realize why you haven't kept in touch for the last 2,000 years.
I'll cleave in.
There is suffering, it's a declaration of insight, but it's also practice instruction
from the Buddha, the practice to know our suffering deeply and intimately, and in some
way, when you recognize suffering as suffering, the way in which you're practicing, you're
on the path to awakening, and I used to have this kind of belief that whenever I was in
some intense suffering, that somehow it was my fault, that I had made some mistake, that
there was some user error in executing the program, and this would lead to all kinds
of internal, you know, afflictive, self-blaming kind of states, but when I'm able to relax
into the truth of this teaching, you know, the truth of suffering, the truth of things
are always changing, a lot of this negative self-talk and self-loathing began to fall
away, and also my suffering has begun to seem less personal, and something like this happens
with age, and we lean on the elder side in this retreat, so eventually you realize, you
know, whatever you've gone through, whatever you're going through, millions, maybe billions
of people have had or will have this experience, of course the details are all different, but
it's the nature of this existence, so when we don't take it, so personally that's freeing.
So a poem I like, it's called The Dakini Speaks, and Dakini is defined as a, quote,
female being of generally volatile temperament who acts as a muse for spiritual practice.
I love that, I seem to have a lot of those people in my life, so I love that definition.
She says, my friends, let's grow up.
Let's stop pretending we don't know the deal here, or if we haven't noticed, let's wake
up and notice.
Look, everything that can be lost will be lost.
It's simple.
How could we have missed it for so long?
Let's grieve our losses fully, like ripe human beings, but please, let's not be so shocked
by them.
Let's not act so betrayed as the life had broken our secret promise to us.
Impermanence is life's only promise to us, and she keeps it with ruthless impeccability.
To a child she seems cruel, but she's only wild, and her compassion exquisitely precise,
brilliantly penetrating luminous with truth.
She strips away the unreal to show us the real.
This is the true ride.
Let's give ourselves to it.
Let's stop making deals for safe passage.
There isn't one anyway, and the cost is too high.
The true human adult gives everything for what cannot be lost, so let's dance the wild
dance of no hope.
So the first of these four recollections, I'm the nature, to age, to die, to sicken.
Be separated from all that is dear to me, are kind of like the harsh reality that is
to be known and understood.
And then the fifth recollection, the one about karma is where we have some agency.
The word karma was in use at the time of the Buddha, but he kind of redefined it to mean
intentional actions of body, speech, and mind, that all actions have an effect.
Words from the Dhamma Pada, this is Gil's translation.
All experience is preceded by mind, led by mind, made by mind.
Speak or act with a corrupted mind, and suffering follows as the wagon wheel follows the hoof
of the ox.
All experience is preceded by mind, led by mind, made by mind.
Speak or act with a peaceful mind, and happiness follows like a never departing shadow.
The Buddha also described karma, he said, whatever, in another way, whatever a person
keeps pursuing with their thinking and pondering, that becomes the inclination of their awareness.
Whatever a person keeps thinking and pondering, that becomes the inclination of the awareness.
And we see that we humans are capable of extraordinary feats, and music, sports, dance,
art, so many arenas, because whatever we practice, we get really good at it.
And how we use our mind defines how we experience the mind, how we go through life, how we feel,
how we act, how we treat others, how we meet challenges, whether we survive, just survive
or whether we thrive, how we use and train the mind, constructs our default modes, where
do we go when we're under stress, do we immediately go to fear or anger or worry, or do we go
to compassion, interest, faith, and this is why practice is so important, this time on
retreat is so precious, because if the mind is getting good at however we use it, there's
a way in which we're always practicing something.
And if we're not intentional about cultivating beautiful qualities of mind, or a peaceful
calm abiding, or any of the other innumerable wholesome states, then we just end up practicing
ways of being that come from our family, from our communities, from random thoughts that
emerge from the environment, from social media or whatever.
And because we're neurologically wired to be attracted, captivated and interested in
that, which is stressful and dangerous, which is a positive attribute, and it's probably
kept us alive as a species, knowing where the dangers are and remembering them.
But left to chance, without that intentional movement toward the wholesome, we tend to
just be practiced, being anxious and scattered and agitated.
So another way to prevent the unwholesome, especially the unwholesome that arise from
an action, like contemplating doing something and not sure what the results will that be,
is to reflect on that action.
This is what the Buddha taught his son, Rahula, who was probably seven or eight at the time.
He said, what do you think, Rahula?
What is the purpose of a mirror?
Rahula says, it's for checking your reflection, sir.
The Buddha said, in that same way, deeds of body, speech, and mind should be done only
after repeated checking.
When you want to do an act, you should check on that same act.
Does this act with the body that I want to do lead to hurting myself, hurting others,
or hurting both?
If not, then to the best of your ability, don't do that thing.
And if so, then you can do, I think I said that backwards, if so, then don't do that
thing, and if not, do that thing.
And then he invited him to make that reflection for three times in advance.
You can reflect, is this likely to lead to suffering or the ending of suffering while
you're doing the action?
This is where it gets tricky because this requires that we are present and aware and
checking in as we're acting, which can happen when mindfulness is strong.
And if in the midst of acting, you discern that this is unskillful, then you can stop,
change gears, try something else.
And then the third, reflecting a third time when the action is done, to go back and look
at the results of the action.
So we can learn and make connections, learn from our mistakes and learn from our successes.
A related way of presenting is to start to pay attention to what triggers the unwholesome
and avoid or minimize those triggers.
So as we cultivate more and more mindfulness, when we notice that a unwholesome state is
present, can we track back to where it began and avoid those triggers?
And sometimes it's quite obvious, like if you're an alcoholic, you know it's a good
place, a good practice to avoid bars or places where people are drinking a lot.
It's just sort of common sense.
If you're caught in the hindrance of desire, obsessed by some desire, you can take a look
at what stimulates that desire.
And some desires stimulate more desire, like a potato chip or a fancy catalog, browsing
the web, especially social media.
Desire sometimes has this quality of camouflaging, like there's this belief that if we get that
thing, that that somehow that will cure our suffering and that will be a lasting satisfaction.
Just on my example, I don't I don't keep potato chips in the house, I immediately throw away
the fancy catalogs that appear on my doorstep and I've uninstalled social media apps from
the phone, just eliminated those triggers, so I don't have to go down that road.
You do this with people, you know, some people that trick, you know, maybe maybe you can't,
I should say, certain people, you have to have relationships with it and then and then
you're back to, you know, how can I be with this difficult person?
With compassion and kindness, but, you know, you can we have some agency to choose our
relationships and we can avoid people who these these mind cities can be quite contagious.
So if you're around people, you know, who are anxious, it makes you more anxious when
you're around people who are worried all the time, you tend to worry more when you're around
people that are peaceful, you tend to be more peaceful.
I think our community of practitioners is such a resource.
Another way of thinking about avoiding is sometimes it's called guarding the sense doors.
This is much of the ethos of retreat, turning inward, simplifying, not engaging with all
the alluring things out in the world.
And the reduction of what, you know, stimulus that we're taking in is also conducive to
Samadhi, the gathering of the mind is another great tool for preventing.
You know, I really, I really enjoy movies, especially action, adventure, superhero kinds
of movies, but I really have to pay attention, you know, if I watch them too late, then I
get just slightly agitated, like enough that the characters will show up in my dreams and
I don't sleep that well.
And it took me actually a while to track back and make that connection.
I mean, I'm trying to sleep and I'm noticing this unwholesome state of agitation and irritation
and I could actually track it back to just a stimulating experience and then choose better.
So now my rule is not after eight.
Only one of the through lines of Dharma practice is that when we pay attention to our experience,
we can learn from that experience in the ways that support us.
So this is called a autobiography in five short chapters.
This might be familiar to some of you.
Chapter one, I walk down the street, there's a deep hole in the sidewalk, I fall in, I'm
lost, I'm helpless, it isn't my fault, it takes me forever to find a way out.
Chapter two, I walk down the same street, there's a deep hole in the sidewalk, I pretend
I don't see it, I fall in again, I can't believe I'm in the same place, but it isn't my fault,
it takes a long time to get out.
Chapter three, I walk down the same street, there's a deep hole in the sidewalk, I see
it there, I still fall in, it's a habit, my eyes are open, I know where I am, it is my
fault and I get out immediately.
Chapter four, I walk down the same street, there's a deep hole in the sidewalk, I walk
around it.
And then chapter five, I walk down another street.
I think I'll just end there.
I had another thing, but it's probably too long, so why don't we just sit together for
a few minutes and then I'll ring a bell and send us on our way.
And so my encouragement to you is to continue the practice of preventing the arising of
unwholesome states with the guarding of the senses that you've been doing, noble silence,
guarding off devices, keeping the attention close and inward, and cultivating samadhi,
relaxing into the schedule, more continuity of practice, walking, sitting, places in between.
Okay, so much for your attention, I have one announcement, and that is that at 6.30
there's an optional practice discussion meeting.
So if you'd like some support, you have some questions about the practice, you're welcome
to come, you're also welcome to come if you'd just like to listen.
That's at 6.30 and the link for that is at the bottom of your schedule on the IRO page.
And then we'll go about a half hour, maybe less, depending on what's up for folks, and
when that's over you can then go to the sit that will be in progress in the main hall.
Alright, thanks everybody, wonderful practice, so let's see you soon.
