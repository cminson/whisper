The relationship to the word for memory.
To remember.
Sometimes Sayodo Teja Nia just says or begins a meditation by remember yourself.
That's a simple way to begin connecting.
In a way, just remembering the existence of this being sitting here in the space and this time.
It sounds like a simple thing, but often we don't really remember ourselves.
We don't remember to be with ourselves.
So being with your experience.
Being with the experience of the body.
Perhaps at the beginning remembering that relaxation is supportive.
And inclining towards or seeing if it's possible to relax the body.
Sometimes I just kind of attend to or attune to the body as a whole.
Remembering relaxation and I feel sometimes a little bit of tension falling away in that way.
Gentle kind of inclining towards.
May there be relaxation in the body.
And being available to see what happens with that inclination.
May the body relax.
And I also find it useful to more consciously check in inside the body more deeply inside the body.
Maybe the inside of the throat can relax.
Maybe the area around the heart can relax.
Maybe the stomach, the intestines can relax.
As the body relaxes, it creates conditions.
It's supportive for the mind to be able to more easily connect with experience.
For the mind to relax into the present moment to be available to receive experience.
So supporting relaxation of body can help the mind to relax.
And maybe we can let go of mental tension, pushing, pulling around past and future.
Just with this invitation to land, to be present, to be with ourselves, to remember ourselves, remember experience.
With some measure of relaxation of body and mind.
What is available?
What is already being remembered?
What is already here?
What is already being experienced?
Maybe sensations of the body, heat or coolness, tension or relaxation, dryness, moisture.
Pressure, vibration or pulsing, tingling.
Exploring, opening to just the sensation level of experience.
And maybe too, sound is apparent at times, the sound of my voice or sounds in your environment.
Sometimes the attention may be in the physical body, noticing pressure or coolness or heat and then the attention is drawn to sound.
And then back to the body.
We don't need to hold our attention still in order to be mindful.
Mindfulness is about connecting with what is happening in the present moment.
And that may be the attention shifting from one thing to another.
So that's fine.
If you begin with noticing body and then the attention shifts, that too can be remembered,
can be experienced with mindfulness.
So body, hearing.
Also perhaps emotions or moods may become clear or obvious.
At times the attention pulled to a feeling or an emotion.
Sometimes we can know the quality of the mind of pulling back or leaning in or being balanced, being okay.
This is what's happening and the mind is fine, the mind is calm.
Receiving whatever is obvious in this moment, wherever it's easy to be connected to the present moment.
And we don't have to hold tightly to that.
Sometimes what's easy shifts from one thing to another or where the attention naturally is now in the body, now with hearing, now with emotion.
We don't need to be in charge of where the attention is.
We do need to remember to be with experience.
That's pretty light, not a lot of effort we need.
Just enough to be with whatever is here in this moment, whatever is obvious in this moment.
Mindfulness will wander, you'll lose mindfulness and the mind will wander.
You'll forget about being aware, forget about remembering yourself.
And at some point you will remember again, that moment of remembering again.
The first thing to connect to there is that you have remembered, that mindfulness has returned.
Aware again, awareness is back.
And that awareness will be with something.
Often if the mind has been thinking, we wake up being aware that we're thinking.
Let's take that in.
Thinking is happening.
Being curious about the happening of thinking rather than the content of thinking.
And if there's a pull to the content, see if you can let that go in favor of being present with however you are in this moment.
It may have a different flavor than before the mind wandered.
That's okay.
Just exploring being with how you are in this moment.
What is obvious?
It's easy to be aware of in this moment.
It's easy to be aware of in this moment.
That's okay.
That's okay.
