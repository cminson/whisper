 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. I was introduced to meditation and breathing probably almost 50 years ago. And someone had told me 50 years ago when I was still a teenager that I'd still be practicing mindfulness of breathing 50 years later. Those 50 years would have spent a lot of time tuning into my breathing. I probably would have, I don't know, it probably would not have been a welcomed idea. But in fact it's been a wonderful thing that these years in meditation it just feels like it just keeps deepening and opening and a great and great appreciation for meditation, for being present, for attention, and to do it through the vehicle of breathing. And I spend a lot of time paying attention to my breathing. In fact, my attention to breathing is kind of with me most of the time. If I'm doing things, talking, reading, being on the computer, it's kind of almost like I have become a second nature to also be with my breathing at the same time. It's like my breathing accompanies me with everything. And it doesn't interfere with my ability to do whatever I'm going to do. But it supports me, it guides me. I recognize right away, quickly enough sometimes, sometimes right away. When I get tense, when I get tight, holding, concerned, when I'm pushing and trying too hard, it all gets translated into how my breathing operates and I lose the easeful relaxed breath. And sometimes that's completely appropriate to have the breathing change. If I go for a run or hike up the hill or have some real fun with some friends playing or something, that the breathing does change in ways. But it qualitatively feels wonderful if it's for a good purpose. But sometimes I'm trying too hard or I'm tense or trying to figure out my computer and I feel my whole chest kind of tighten up and the effects of the breathing, it's held. And so to constantly be aware of it, it kind of guides me in having a much more peaceful kind of life as I go through my days. And I love my breathing. It's intimacy with it. It's almost like an intimacy with life. And it keeps me intimate and connected in a wonderful way. So the theme for today is recognizing. Yesterday was relaxing and we can relax too much and become kind of a just a, you know, collapse in some way. But most people, they relax deeply, deeply to have meditation be a place of releasing, releasing the holding and tension is one of the great purposes of meditation. But it's not the only purpose. And if we can overemphasize in such a way that we kind of slump a lot or collapse or just get kind of dull. And some of the sharpness of meditation comes from the factor of recognition. And this is kind of the heart of what mindfulness is usually taught, that there's a recognizing quality to it. And different teachers will emphasize different aspects of this mindfulness of recognition. Because many people in the West tend to be thinkers, think a lot, get lost in their thought and up in the control tower. Some teachers like to really emphasize language of feeling, sensing, feeling your breathing, sensing your breathing, placing your attention in the middle of your, the physicality of breathing is, and just kind of really sense and feel it. But there are kind of three major forms of recognition that come into play with mindfulness practice. And they, different times, different ones of them are relevant. And knowing these three can be very helpful because sometimes we're trying one when the other one is actually more appropriate. It's more useful for the whole system. And sometimes one of them is more helpful to work through some kind of difficulty than others. So knowing these three can be very helpful. So one is this emphasis on feeling, sensing, the direct physical sensation experience of breathing. And that's one of the means of getting concentrated because you find some place where the breathing occurs in the body, where there's a sensation, and you kind of ride the sensation closely. Maybe you kind of imagine yourself sitting in the middle of the sensation and being carried by it or focused on it, or just really kind of attuned, very closely attuned, so the mind doesn't wander off very easily. Just the sensing becomes the grounding, the stabilizing force, the steadying force for the mind to quiet down and get focused and stable and concentrated. And people who do the nostrils will have the sensations on the nostrils, the breath, kind of very, they get very precise and acute and very sensitive. And it's amazing how cute the sensations can get. Very compelling, very pleasant. Sometimes the feeling in the chest, a little movement. It might be the whole chest. It might be as we get concentrated in just a little round spot, maybe around the solar plexus or higher up somewhere in the midline. And just a feeling, just right there feeling it. And if it's in the belly, it might be there's classic places of the Hara. This place is about two inches below the navel, maybe kind of like one inch into the body. And like the attention is right there feeling the sensations. And there you're feeling the movements often, the sensation movements, the flow back and forth. And so it can be very effective to get us out of our head sometimes that way. Other times, and for some people, what's more helpful is what's really the heart of the recognition factor, which is to know what the sensations are, to know what the experience is while it's happening. So to recognize it's an inhale when we're breathing in, to recognize an exhale with the exhale. And the recognition is a little bit cognitive. It could be with a single word. We use mental notes sometimes, or almost as if there's a mental note. Like we imagine we're saying the note. Like inhaling or in, out. Or it might be that there's a movement, expansion. And we recognize that we recognize that's expansion, like the expansion is happening. That's known, expansion is known. There's release as we exhale, those knowing the release. Or there might be a whole slew of sensations that come into play. Maybe too fast to kind of name them all, but there's kind of a silent recognition or an acknowledgement of what these sensations are. So in a sense, after an inhale, you might remember in a sense that there were, because you recognized it well if you were there, that there was a subtle release as the inhale began. And then there was a gentle push in the part of the chest, perhaps. And then an expansion is spreading. And then at the top of the inhale there was a tautness, like some resistance to breathing in anymore. And then maybe a pause and then a release as the exhale began. And the recognition, if it's done too effortfully, like you're doing a checklist approach, it just makes the mind busy. It kind of uses a coarser, active part of the mind. The idea is to be very simple and natural and easy. Almost like a wonderful expression is the cognitive functioning of emptiness. The mind is very relaxed and very present. It will know. It's knowing just happens on its own. It's not so much a willful effort. But initially there might be a little bit of effort to know, but it's kind of like not so willful. It's just a way of helping to stay present. It's a tether. It's an anchor to the present. It's a way of having a little more clarity about what's going on. And as meditation deepens, the clarity becomes stronger. And there's less of the filter or the cloudiness that happens when we're distracted a lot, caught up in our thoughts and our feelings. And so there's more and more ease and just recognizing. And some people will go through this pattern of starting with feeling the breathing. And then as the things settle down, get quiet and concentrated, it just feels natural then to brighten things up, to sharpen the clarity of the mind by having a gentle, soft recognition, knowing, cognitive knowing of what is actually happening here. And it turns out that in deeper meditation there's something very deepening about this cognitive knowing, just very simple, natural cognitive functioning of emptiness. At some point that cognitive functioning might seem like it's too much. And at some point it shifts just to observing. Very simple. Observing of the experience. It doesn't have the same kind of direct contact and intimacy of feeling. It doesn't necessarily have the same kind of clarity as recognition of cognitive knowing. But observing can be very spacious, it's meant to be one of the deeper places we come to. We settle back and we're not entangled, not identified, not involved, trying to fix anything that's going on. We're just there peacefully, just watching it. It's almost like we get out of our own way when there's observation. There's observing but no observer kind of thing. These are kind of three of the main kind of forms of mindfulness and different times different ones are relative, useful. I kind of talked about them as being deepening but sometimes when the mind is very active some people find it's better to just settle back and observe rather than feel. Sometimes the intimacy of feeling hooks us in to being kind of caught and more engaged. And sometimes the cognitive knowing is going to be so beautiful. It's like in the knowing, the cognitive knowing is where there's freedom is. It's almost like you say to yourself, oh it's just an inhale, it's just a tight breath, it's just a controlled breath. And that recognition is like, oh, that's all it is and let it be. So the recognition factor and so we begin with some relaxation so we're not tense in doing all this and then we practice recognition in three forms and you can experiment. There's feeling, sensing, then there's cognitive knowing and then there is just observing, simple observation. And this is for people who are real beginners I recommend just the feeling and sensing and stay with the sensations the best you can. And then as it shifts you know these other ones as well. And so thank you and I look forward to continuing this topic of breathing tomorrow.
