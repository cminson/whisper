 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good morning. Good day, everyone. Welcome to the meditation. And this is the week we're going to be looking at greed. And one of the aspects of greed is the way in which it takes us away from ourselves. Now, some people are so identified with intense desires and wants and cravings that they feel that this is who they are and they don't recognize how there's a kind of alienation or pulling away from a deeper connection to our hearts, our body, our inner life, a deeper place where there's a settling, an at-homeness. And the Buddha calls this, doesn't talk about at-homeness, but he talks about one's ancestral home, that the practice of mindfulness is to stay based on or grounded in one's ancestral home. And so it's not just one's immediate home, which can be cozy and nice for some people, but a place where one has been, I don't know, rooted for centuries. And so that metaphor here is that we're here to meditate, to really stay closely connected from the inside out kind of. And one of the interesting things to notice is how when we get involved in thoughts, especially if we get lost in thoughts, there is a pulling away, a getting lost from this groundedness and connectedness to something that's more solid, more connected, more at-home here. And of course, sometimes there's good reason to go spinning out in thoughts. Sometimes it's uncomfortable to be here in our ancestral home. There's conflict going on here and difficulties and feelings. But it turns out that for mindfulness practice, that there is a healing quality that comes from settling in and being present in the body here. So in this meditation, you might want to just notice the difference between when you kind of get pulled into the world of thoughts, and if thoughts are about the external world and past, future and people, how we're kind of leaving the present moment in a certain way. And that as we begin again with breathing, with mindfulness, see if that can be a quality of coming home, coming centered, grounding here, where there's a connectedness, where we don't lose something deeper, fuller connection to ourselves. And then we notice that we lose that, we get involved in thoughts. Or if we get involved in strong wants or strong aversions, there's a way in which that pulls us away from this deeper place of groundedness. And if we get involved in strong ideas of self and what's in it for me, there's a loss of something there. And see, experiment with and explore, get to know this movement of a way and coming back, being disconnected and being connected, wandering off into distant lands and being at home in your ancestral homeland here. So, assuming a meditation posture, and there is a way in which a long tradition of assuming a posture that's dignified, that is, we're kind of expressing our worthiness, our value. We are not diminishing ourselves, cowering, or somehow discounting ourselves. And we're not puffed up, but not asserting ourselves, but a simple dignity, simple nobility. So a posture that expresses that. And people who are sitting upright, it might mean sitting a little bit straighter. Maybe there's a way of pulling in the spine a little bit between the shoulder blades. So the chest is a little bit more open. Feeling the weight on the sitting bones. So the weight of your body seems balanced on top of it. Not leaning forward too much or backward. Gently closing your eyes. And with a feeling that you have all the time in the world, in a loving way, take some slow, deep breaths. Maybe three quarters full, the inhale. And as you inhale more fully, to feel all the sensations that get activated with the deeper breaths in the rib cage, in the chest, in the shoulders, belly. And as you exhale long, relaxed exhale, just long enough to remain comfortable with it. Relax, settle in on the exhale. And letting your breaths return to normal. And with a kind of intimacy with your breathing, the physical sensations that come into play as you breathe. As you exhale, soften in the face. And if the face doesn't soften, be content as to feel and sense the physicality of the muscles of the face. The sensations from the inside out. Meaning not your thoughts and images of your face. But how the skin, the muscles of your face feel for themselves. And then to soften and relax the shoulders. And to soften the belly. And then to tenderly, lovingly, experience how the body experiences breathing. A certain receptivity to feel how the body experiences the rhythm of breathing. And then to soften and relax the shoulders. And then notice if and when you get pulled into the world of thoughts or pulled into the world of wanting or not wanting. How there might be a loss of this deeper connection to the body. To the inner life here and now. Maybe even a kind of alienation from oneself. And that mindfulness is to return to this ancestral home, to this place here in ourselves. Grounded, connected. Noticing the move, the rhythm, the contrast between being pulled away and returning, connecting here to the body breathing. See what you can notice and learn about yourself in the contrast between being connected and disconnected with our embodied existence from the inside out. See what you can notice and learn about yourself in the contrast between being connected and returning. ah ah ah ah ah........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ peaceful and free of all the forces within them that afflict them, all the forces around them in our societies that oppress them. It may it be that this practice that we do and how we live our lives from this practice, may it be for the welfare and happiness of others. May all beings be happy, may all beings be safe, may all beings find peace, and may all beings share mutually in a life that's free.
