 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So a warm welcome to all of you this evening. One of you on Tuesday evening mentioned the META talk that Gil Fronstall had given in the morning, and I want to thank you for that. I listened to it this afternoon while I was hiking through a gentle snowstorm, and I was really inspired by it. In his talk, Gil introduced the words protective and reactive as different ways to hold what are often called unwholesome states of mind in Buddhism. Unwholesome states of mind are those conditioned ruts we can fall into when we want to hold on to the way things are, or we want to make things be different, you know, get certain things to go away, or we are simply blind or confused about how things actually are. And those are the unwholesome roots of suffering, greed, aversion, and delusion. These practices that we do in happy hour are actually wonderful antidotes or ways to cultivate a wholesome mind. Mindfulness helps us begin to recognize those times when our minds react against anything that appears to threaten the way we want things to be. The mind may have a habit of trying to protect us or itself against what is feared or disliked or found to be unpleasant. And this new framework that Gil introduced is, in itself, I think loving kindness and this insight that recognizes that sometimes these afflictive states of mind that come out as so-called unwholesome states of mind or behavior actually had their origins in trying to protect some part of one's heart or mind that felt vulnerable. Gil also introduced the word nurturing as a different way to hold what are often called wholesome states of mind. Wholesome states of mind are those qualities of non-harming which include not being greedy, not coming from ill will, and not being cruel. Just the absence of harming is a contribution to making a more benevolent world if we don't do harming things. And often we can go from there to develop generosity, kindness, and compassion. These are the qualities that we're cultivating through these practices we do during happy hour. So it's a wonderful insight to consider that the most beneficial states of mind are, in fact, nurturing. It's inspiring to connect with an inclination in ourselves towards goodwill and towards an openness that wants to see other people well cared for, able to thrive, able to be safe that recognizes that we're interconnected. So the safety and well-being of other people is our own safety and well-being ultimately. So with these inspirations for this evening, let's meditate together. Taking yourself some time to settle in. Understanding how you are as we begin the meditation. Where you are has been conditioned all day long and in the days, months, years prior to this. But taking notice to begin with of whatever the body might be feeling. Sensations have come to be in physical sensations in this moment. And if it feels available to soften, softening or bringing some ease or relaxation to any areas that are holding some tightness or something, perhaps through softening, something can release. Often we experience emotions in physical sensation as well. Just turning towards the heart with awareness. What is present in this moment? Emotion in itself can nurture us, letting us be aware of any difficult states and also of states of contentment or peace, curiosity. Whichever are present, challenging states or nurturing states, allowing them their space, allowing them to be seen with kind awareness. Allowing any state of mind that arises. Really recognizing it, receiving it with awareness. States of mind too have been conditioned by the events of the day, the week, the year. Receiving thoughts that may be arising. And if there is a wish or even a slight reaction that it would be better if things were different in the body, the heart or the mind, receiving that, allowing it with kindness. Perhaps recognizing any protectiveness that might be there or might be manifest in some way in this moment. It's natural for all creatures to try to protect their bodies. And it's natural for human beings to try to protect their hearts and minds. Recognizing any vulnerability with care. Recognizing it, knowing it, recognizing it. Sending it some kind wishes. And for some of you that could be just in the form of feeling the heart opening, the tenderness of the heart towards what's arising, what's being known. For others it may be helpful to send the wishes in the form of some phrases whispered quietly in the mind or simply received as I say them. Wishing any vulnerability. May you be well. May you be safe and free from harm. May you be happy. May you be peaceful. May the vulnerable parts of this being be nurtured. And with care and compassion. May any suffering in this being come to an end. And perhaps as this heart, mind and body receive the nurturance of awareness, of mindfulness allowing things to make themselves known to be received. There may be some feelings of nurturance that are arising. May this nurturance increase and continue. May it flow inward to this body, heart and mind and outward to others who are coming to mind. Sending them these same radiant feelings from the heart or phrases inclining the mind towards good wishes. May you be well. May you be safe and free from harm. May you be happy. May you be peaceful. Wishing any sense of connectedness that's available between yourself and another to be nurtured and to grow through these wishes. Just as you wish the best for the other person, wishing the best for yourself. Just as you wish to be free from harm, safe, well and peaceful. Wishing these same wonderful nurturances to the other. Having receiving whatever arises in experience to be known and felt as we continue in silence with this meditation. Thank you. ï¿½ you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you as we come to the final couple of minutes of this meditation perhaps allowing yourself to appreciate or even honor the way the mind heart and body may have tried to protect itself in the past done its best to care for any vulnerabilities and also appreciation for the ways in which your heart, mind and body have come to nurture themselves and others. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you and during these next two parts of our evening you have an opportunity to continue to notice ways in which the heart and mind may try to protect themselves or ways that they've learned to nurture themselves or others. So as we go into breakout rooms the idea is watching your own heart and mind as you listen deeply to others and then that each person have a chance to share one thing at a time and just putting one thing into the circle of three people and then giving the next person a turn and refraining from any commentary about each other sharing or any need to offer opinions. That's not needed. The best thing you can do here is to offer each other your presence and offer your own heart the care of watching what arises. So with that we'll go for 10 minutes into the breakout rooms and if you for any reason get isolated in a room by yourself don't worry I will find you and move you into another room. Enjoy.
