So it's good to sit with you.
This is the essential, avaricious nature of loss. It encompasses without
distinction the trivial and the consequential, the abstract and the
concrete, the merely misplaced and the permanently gone. We often ignore the
true, it's true scope if we can, but for a while after my father died I could not
see, stop seeing the world as it really is marked everywhere by the evidence of
past losses and the imminence of future ones. This was not because his death was
a tragedy. My father died peacefully at 74, tended throughout his final weeks by
those he loved most. It was because his death was not a tragedy. What shocked me
was that something so sad could be the normal necessary way of things. In its
aftermath, each individual life seemed to contain too much heartbreak for its
fleeting duration. History, which I had always loved even in its silences and
mysteries, suddenly seemed like little more than a record of loss on an
epic scale, especially where it could offer no record at all. The world
itself seemed ephemeral, glaciers and species and ecosystems vanishing. The
pace of change as swift as in a time lapse, as if those of us alive today had
been permitted to see it from the harrowing perspective of eternity.
Everything felt fragile, everything felt vulnerable, the idea of loss pressed in
around me like a hidden order to existence that emerged only in the presence of
grief. It's Catherine Schultz from Lost and Found. I wasn't planning to talk
about this but here it goes. So when we love in a world that changes, a world
that trembles in all directions, grief becomes a part of life and we have to
love something. It's just what mammals do and so grief is woven into the
fabric of our biology and really when we care about other beings, when we care
about sentience itself, grief becomes a feature of life. And so Monday was
helplessness, how helplessness can illuminate our power yesterday,
renunciation freeing us up to enjoy pleasure more fully, less compulsively.
And today grief, grief freeing us up to love more deeply. Now when I use the word
grief, I'm not just talking about the loss of someone, it's broader than that
and I'm not talking about the species of grief that debilitates us, freezes us,
although that's a part of life too. But the way that the Dharma interacts with
the grieving heart such that we are changed by it, positively changed by it,
our love is deepened by it. Spiritual practice is, it's a form of growing up
in a way, it's a form of growing up. And growing up entails growing pains. You
know, sometimes the kids will get them like these diffuse pains in their legs
or something like, okay, no problem, growing pains. And they're growing pains
of spiritual maturation too for each of us. They're growing pains of evolving
our Sela, evolving our ethical commitments of actually growing up
ethically. Maya Angelou said, do the best you can until you know better than when
you know better, do better. We have to be willing to know when you know better, do
better, have to be willing to know, we have to be willing to come into a deeper
alignment with our existing values to actually trace out those values, what they
mean for ourselves in the world to come into a kind of alignment with the depth
of our own heart. We're willing to be stretched to widen the circle of moral
concern. And the movement of the heart in that, that can feel a little like grief.
Yeah, that circle widening, you know, more and more of the world feels like a worthy
moral concern. And they're growing pains in associated with deepening compassion,
like when love meets suffering, they're kind of two byproducts, grief and
compassion. Love meeting suffering, grief and compassion. And the movement, the
movement of the kind of the clenched fist of grasping that Gil often speaks of,
the movement of the clenched fist of grasping to the open hand of letting go,
that feels like something, that movement feels like something, and it often feels
like grief. Not so long ago in teaching, I sort of had this this insight arose and
it was kind of like, wow, how did I not put this together before, but much of the
fruit of practice unfolds through a process of grieving, it feels like
something is being lost, and for sure something gained. Now we don't have to
make this some enormous project, my grieving project, we're just willing to
feel, willing to feel. And I hold grief in a kind of reverential way, you know, it
does not belong in the family of afflictive emotion in my mind. And I can
imagine a life that is free of agitation and anger and anxiety, I could, I don't
live it, but I could imagine it, I can imagine it. I cannot imagine a life free
of grieving, I don't even know exactly what that would be, but it feels like it
would be an abdication of our love and care in some way. People are, they're
often grateful when they're given permission to grieve, to know that this
is part of the path, this is the part of the path amidst loss, this is part of
just the growing pains of the evolution of our compassion, of our love, the
expansion of the scope of our moral concern, that the movements of letting go
entails some sense of grieving. Now the traditional phrase about the fruit of
this practice is, beyond, you know, beyond grief, sorrow, lamentation, and
despair, we get beyond grief, sorrow, lamentation, and despair, but I want my
Buddha to grieve. That may be, that may be, that is controversial, but just for me I
want my Buddha to grieve. Grief is, it's redeemed by different things, we're
certainly redeemed by art, but also by growing our love, and a love that is
uninformed by grief is a naive love. What we, what we find in, in, in grief is
that the ego is just all out of moves. Do you know that feeling? There's moments
where it's just like the ego is all out of moves, there's no energy for it to
move in this way or that way, and there's some beauty and opportunity in that
itself. And so we do this work for ourselves, it's important for ourselves,
it's important for our society, because the failure to grieve, the failure to let
go, that spills out, it spills out, and it, the failure to grieve can distort our
love, you know? Our love becomes too reticent or too controlling, and so yeah,
the courage to love is the willingness to grieve, and when we're willing, the love
deepens, less reticent, less controlling. Sometimes our hearts fully enlightened
beings are described as being consummate in shame, consummate in shame, and what's
being alluded to is hiri and uttapa, the shame around moral transgression, around
causing harm, consummate in shame, I've always struck by that translation. I wonder,
maybe it's possible to be consummate in grief too. Zerilka, it's possible I am
pushing through solid rock in flint-like layers as the ore lies alone. I am such a
long way in, I see no way through, and no space. Everything is close to my face, and
everything close to my face is stone. I don't have much knowledge yet in grief,
so this massive darkness makes me small. You be the master, make yourself fierce,
break in. Then your great transforming will happen to me, and my great grief cry
will happen to you for this fair consideration. It's good to be able to
talk about these things together.
