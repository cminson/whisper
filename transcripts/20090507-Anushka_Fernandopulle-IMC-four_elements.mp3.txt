So I'm happy to be here. 
It's been actually quite a while since I've been here speaking with your group. 
And I thought I'd talked to you a little bit about one aspect of the practice of the Satipatana Sutta, which some of you are probably familiar with. 
So Satipatana Sutta is often translated as the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. 
So it's one of the main suttas that a lot of the meditation practices that have come down to us at this day and age of practice has come from. 
And one particular aspect of that sutta that has interested me over the last year or so that I've been working with. 
So I'd like to start with the introduction to that sutta, which I find very inspiring. 
So pikkhus or all of us here, practitioners. 
This is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the attainment of the true way, for the realization of nibbana or liberation, namely the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. 
So this is how Buddha starts out this discourse. 
And it's very inspiring. 
It's like a good ad for doing the practice. 
So here's what you get from this. 
Surmounting sorrow and lamentation, that sounds good. 
Disappearance of pain and grief, who doesn't want that. 
Attainment of the true way, that may be a bit more cryptic depending on your relationship to spiritual life. 
And then realization of nibbana or liberation. 
So then it goes on in this teaching to talk about different aspects. 
So practicing with the body, physical body, practicing with mental states, practicing with unpleasant, unpleasant neutral vedana, and then with different aspects of the teachings themselves and reflecting on them. 
So some of you may be familiar with this. 
And in the part that's talking about the body, it starts with the body, physical body, which is a really great object for our meditation practice. 
So probably because it's always here with you, right? The physical body. 
So it's not so esoteric, right? It's like with you carrying you around if you perceive it that way, right? Has its ups and downs and so on, right? So the aspect that interested me was one angle that's about the Four Elements. 
So the Four Elements is a kind of ancient scientific categorization of both elements in nature, but also elements as it relates to our own physical bodies, right? So probably you won't relate so much to the scientific angle on it. 
So the elements are earth, air, fire, and water, right? So that was kind of their ancient categorization. 
But you might relate to the practice, which is actually to be able to feel your body in these different ways. 
So to have a direct experience of the body through paying attention to some experience of these different elements, right? And in paying attention to the body with this particular angle of attention, then you can see that actually our body is always changing. 
Our body is not under our control. 
Our body is not one solid thing, right? And because of all those things that if we try to grasp for that, then it will lead to suffering, right? So that's what I thought I'd talk to you about today. 
So maybe I'll start out a little bit with my understanding about the Dhamma, which I often like to do with groups. 
So, you know, the Buddha was a guy who lived 2,600 years ago, and he had sort of existential crisis and wanted to find out, well, what's the point of all this? What's the cause of suffering? What's the end of suffering? What's it all about? He went and did various spiritual practices, looked here, looked there. 
Finally, he basically figured out his own way, and then Sese was enlightened. 
So he sought through into the true nature of how things are, right? And then he was free. 
Then he had actually surmounted sorrow and lamentation, pain and grief, right? So what was it that he found out? So this is what's called the Dhamma, so the teachings of the truth, the teachings of the way things are. 
So good news about this Dhamma is that it's not something that he made up or kind of concocted or created this like complex philosophical system around. 
It actually was something that he discovered through paying attention with his own awareness, right? And which thus is actually the truth of the way things are and available to all of us to pay attention to in the same way, right? So we have as much access to that as he might have at that time of his own spiritual quest, right? And thus the more that we live in alignment with the way things are, with the Dhamma, then basically the happier and more harmonious our life will be. 
And the more we live out of harmony with that, then the more suffering we'll have, the more friction. 
Stress there will be in our life, right? So it's kind of akin to the law of gravity, say, right? Which is kind of an aspect of just how things are, right? So the law of gravity, as far as I know, is not really run by any person or bureau or anything like that, right? And it acts equally on all of us, right? So regardless of your height, age, race, education, good-lookingness, any of that stuff, right, you are subject to the law of gravity. 
When you're born, you don't seem to know about that so much. 
So you often see little babies sort of practicing or experimenting with the law of gravity, right? So they will find things and drop them, throw them off the high chair, watch them fall to the ground, right? And then it usually becomes a game where the grown-up picks it up and puts it back and, you know, so on, right? So by doing this, by experimenting, you actually see the baby sees, like, oh, this is part of the way things are, right? If you drop stuff, it will land on the ground like that. 
Sometimes it bounces, right? And that's just part of how things are. 
So then as a grown-up, you know what? There's this thing going on. 
So if I wanted to place this glass in thin air like this, it will probably fall, glass might break, water will spill. 
Or no longer have a glass of water, there will be a mess, right? So it's not because there's some problem that I need to take personally. 
It's not because there is something that I did wrong, per se. 
You know, it's just that this is part of the way things are. 
This is how things are. 
So then if I would like to place this down, it's better to place it on something, understanding that that's how things work, right? So similarly with the dhamma, you know, it's just the way things are, and a lot of it is actually observable, right, to us. 
And the tools of the practice of mindfulness and of the meditation practices and reflection practices help us to know this, right? So as we learn this, then we naturally act in a way that's in accordance with the way things are, right? And so then similarly, we're not trying to do things that are going to cause grief, per se, right? So we're not trying to, you know, metaphorically place things in thin air. 
And thus our life goes more harmoniously, right? So this includes actually paying attention to our actions in the world and understanding that our actions actually have results, like don't disappear. 
So this is actually the law of karma, right? So when you do things with wholesome intention in the mind, then we'll have some positive effect. 
If we do things with unwholesome intention in the mind, it will have negative effect immediately end in the future, right? So back to the four elements. 
So one of the ways that we can pay attention and learn, so just like the dropping things off the high chair, is by paying attention to actually our physical body. 
So what is this actually thing that we call our body, right? Like what is it really? So certainly there's the visual form that we have, right? And that we see in the mirror and that, you know, changes a little bit here and there. 
And then there's actually a direct experience through our sense of the sensations of the body, right? So with the four elements of the body, it's helpful to pay attention to that aspect of things, right? So I'll just direct you a little bit to reflections about this. 
And it's the kind of thing that you can reflect on sort of internally and externally, which is part of what's suggested in the sattipattanasuta. 
And also have a direct experience of, right? So we'll take the first one, which we could say is the air element, right? Or, you know, if you look at a modern taxonomy, it might be gas or something like that. 
So air element. 
So the air is all around us, right? In some way, as human beings, we're all swimming around in air, right? And then as you do the practice, so many of you are probably doing the paying attention to your breath practice, right? You tend to your breath as it goes in and out. 
So what we're actually paying attention to is, in fact, the air element as it enters our body, right? And it leaves our body, right? So the air element is this essential part of our being, right? So the breaths that we take have been this continuous chain of our life from the time you're born, right? And you get whacked and then start crying and breathing, right? And then all the way through to death, right? You take your last breath. 
That's this continuous chain. 
So we're constantly in this interaction with the air element, right? And in fact, it's actually one thing that we all share in this room. 
So we're all, you know, intaking and exhaling from the same kind of source. 
So we're in the same, like, little fishbowl here and, you know, IMC, right? There's our exit. 
It's like the little castle in the fishbowl, right? You can swim out there and go in there, bathroom, right? But we're all in there, right? Taking it in, exhaling, right? And then it goes into the lungs and so on, right? But you can feel that air element, feeling the expansion contraction, right? Feeling the expansion contraction in your chest, feeling that near lungs, right? So next one we'll take a look at is the water element, right? So see if you can feel right now some liquid, liquidity in your body. 
So common places to look are your saliva in your mouth, okay? Sometimes you can feel some, like, mushiness in your stomach, right? Sometimes you can feel some sweat somewhere, moistness, right? So this is, like, the water element, right? So the water element is also a big part of who we are. 
So technically speaking, we're about three-quarter made of water as human beings, right? Which is actually about the same proportion as the earth, right? And I understand that about every seven days you replenish your supply of water, right? So, you know, get rid of it and come back and drink more. 
And so if you go to someplace new, you know, in about a week's time, you become, like, largely made up of that water from that place, right? I went to New York a couple weeks ago, and then, you know, after being there for a week, then I was made up of New York water, right? Three-quarter of my body, right? And in some ways we're kind of like these Brita filters, you know? You're basically constantly pouring water in. 
It's like sifting through you, taking out impurities, you know? Constantly going through, going through, right? So our body is kind of this bag. 
Even when you feel like your skin, your arms, like it's kind of mushy, right? You know? So there's like some softness there. 
And a lot of that softness is made of the liquidity, right, of our bodies, right? So the water element is a big part of who we are, as it is a big part of the earth, right? So you can feel that since that sense of the liquidity of our body, right? Which also has to do with cohesion, right? Some sense of cohesion of water elements together. 
So that's the air element, the water element. 
Next one we'll look at is the fire element. 
So fire element is actually about heat, right? Temperature. 
So our body is in some places hot, in some places cold, right? Sometimes you can feel more heat, like in your belly area, you know, under your arms, different places. 
If you had to rush to get in here and you sit down, then you feel like the heat element a lot, right? I think it was pretty warm today, right? And San Francisco was pretty warm, probably warmer down here, right? So that's different than it was last week when it was like cold and rainy, right? So then you feel that heat element externally. 
But then also there is a heat element internally for ourselves. 
So that sense of temperature, of heat, cold, right? And then sometimes kind of like you feel in externally, there's sort of an area in which there's sun and there's shade and different areas of temperature. 
You can feel that in your body too, right? Like certain parts are hot, certain parts are cold, even as you sit here, right? So I can feel like the coolness in my arms, but then I can feel like heat in my socks. 
I'm wearing socks that are possibly too warm for today, you know? It's just all these different currents of temperature changing going through, right? And then we have the earth element. 
So the earth element is the element of solidity, right? So solidness of the ground, the ground that's always supporting us. 
And you can feel this element in your body through the solidity of the bones in your body, through the solidity of your teeth, right? There are certain parts of the body that we can feel as being more solid, right? So you can even get a sense of that sitting here, like feel the solidity of where you're touching your chair or your cushion, right? So you can feel some pressure when we're touching the ground, right? You can feel some pressure there, right? The solidity. 
So we're made of this solidity as well, right? Although the solidity is also actually an illusion, right? So the solidity feels like it's made of minerals and things like that. 
But it's actually similar to what it is outside. 
So coming up here, there's sidewalk, right? A sidewalk is made of cement. 
So cement is like ground up stones and stuff, right? And actually our bones are made of minerals too, right? So similarly, there's externally this earth element. 
So the ground, obviously the dirt considered the earth element, the stones, all the solidity in the world. 
And then similarly, there's a part of us that's solidity too, right? So then it's interesting to take into account, you know, how does that get to be there? So we have this definition of me and everything else, so me and nature, right? So there's my body and then there's the world around me, right? So how we come to be alive and how we continue our life is also largely through eating and drinking, right? And actually maintaining the conditions in which the body can thrive, right? So for most of us, you know, living here in the Bay Area, fortunately, you know, it's not an area in which there's war or it's not an area in which there's such extremes of temperature, things like that. 
So sometimes you can get kind of lulled into thinking that, like, the body's not that delicate, right? But just to be told, like, it is actually pretty delicate, right? So if you don't take in water for like three days, I believe it is, you're likely to die, right? Food, you can go a little bit longer, but water, you really need to replenish your body, right? And the temperature also, right? So, you know, it gets too hot, you become very uncomfortable, it becomes too cold, you become very uncomfortable, right? I used to live on the East Coast and I feel like I had a much broader range of temperature that I could stand there. 
And now that I moved to San Francisco, it's like maybe between 55 and 75 is like okay for me. 
75 is a little cold, right? Maybe 60 to 75 is like okay, and anything outside that's too cold, too hot, right? The body starts to be unpleasant, it complain a little, right? So we need these conditions as well, right, of temperature, right? Then we actually need this earth element too. 
So I don't know how many of you here take minerals, take vitamins that have minerals in them. 
But we take in minerals, right, through the food that we eat, through vitamins, things like that, which help to replenish our bones, calcium, right, hard pieces, right? So we're in constant interaction in this way with our environment, right? So another way that we take in things is this aspect of food, right, nutrition. 
And I think it's helpful to reflect on this too, in terms of our connection, our interconnection with the earth and actually with everything, right? So, you know, I said if we don't drink water for a couple days, we'll die, right? But supposing you've got water, but you didn't get food, so also after some period of time, your body would start to suffer a lot, right? So where does the food come from? The food actually comes from the ground, right? So the food grows from the ground, in the earth element, through water, through sun, right? So through the heat element, through the liquid element, right? Then this plant is allowed to grow, right? Even if you're a carnivore, right, usually the animals that you eat would eat the plants, so somewhere along the line it gets back to those plants, right? And then those plants are harvested by someone. 
They're brought to a store or they're brought to a restaurant. 
They're prepared in a certain way. 
You get them at the grocery store, you go to the restaurant, you get your food, and then you start to eat it, right? So hopefully you got a chance to eat today, so you can reflect as I talk about this on what you ate as your last meal, right? So what was in that last meal, right? So think about the ingredients that were in the meal that you had, maybe prior to this or lunch, or, you know. 
. 
. 
Hopefully this would not cause too much suffering from people who had wished they had eaten before, but didn't get to, right? So you think about what's in there, right? So think about where those elements came from. 
So plant life was growing somewhere, if it was bread, it was like wheat, right? Also grown somewhere, then ground in a mill, right? If it was something dairy products, then it came from cows or goats, right, who also had spent a lot of time munching on the grass, right? And then that food comes to us and then we eat it, and then an interesting thing happens, because the border between what we think is me and not me starts to become permeated, right? So usually you identify this is me and this is the sandwich, right? And the sandwich is not me, right? This is me, right? But then as you start to eat the sandwich, the sandwich becomes me, right? So at what point does the sandwich become me? Like, where's that boundary of that? You know, it's in your mouth, you're chewing it, it still is not usually considered me, per se. 
After you swallow it, then it's become me, right? It goes down, it goes in your stomach, then all of those elements, which include the interconnection between the sun, the earth, the wind, actually, also the rain, right, comes to be part of your own body, right? So it's only through eating every day in that way and connecting with the external elements that actually our own internal elements are also nurtured, right? So why is it helpful to reflect like this? So both you get a sense of this interconnection, right? This interconnection between what we consider our separate self and the external world, which is actually somewhat illusory, right? Like it's much more permeable than we think, right? Also because as we actually pay attention to the body, in its bare physical sensations of cold, hot, right? The sense of liquidity, the sense of solidity, the sense of air, right? We can feel that actually they're just these impersonal elements, really, right? And actually it's the same thing that we're feeling that someone else is feeling in some ways, right? So different combinations, different permutations, but basically when you get down to the bare attention level, it's very similar for all of us, right? And all of these elements are not being directed by yourself, right? And you can certainly do things to try to machinate a little bit, right? So put on a jacket and this and that to change a little bit. 
But the body is doing its own thing also, right? You try and do your best to take care of the body, try to exercise, you try to eat, try to not get too cold. 
But at the end of the day, it's kind of doing its own thing at the same time, right? Everything's not in our control of our body, right? So the body grows in different ways, some of which we like, some of which we don't like, gets older, you know? Hair starts to lose here, appear here, you know, different things. 
You know, our face changes shape, we like it, we don't like it, you know? All this stuff, right? So we kind of do our best with our intentions of compassion to kind of work with that. 
But at the end of the day also, the body is not fully in our control, right? So that's just a little reflection on the elements for you. 
And you can actually do this practice in several different ways. 
So one is, of course, before you eat, you know, actually to consider what you're eating. 
And, you know, just take a few moments to sort of think about its journey there, so to speak. 
And then its connection to your own body, right? And that actually is, you know, appreciation because in that chain of events have been so many people, birds, worms, humans, cooks, you know, that actually brought that to you, right? So it's taking a moment to reflect on and connect with that chain of connection, right? So also it means that even on your worst day, the fact that you have food in front of you and all these different people and animals have sort of conspired that you might live again, right? So it's good to remember that too, right? And appreciate that, right? And in all of that process, there also has been a lot of death too, right? So death of bugs, death of animals. 
There's been a lot of life and death that's gone on in that, right? As much as we try to minimize that too. 
So appreciating what it's taken for that to come to us, right? Sweat, blood, sweat, tears, yeah. 
So at the point of eating. 
And then also actually in your meditation. 
So you can actually sit in your meditation and pay attention particularly to these different elements. 
So you can say like, okay, I want to pay attention to this fire element. 
So just noticing like where there's heat, right? Where there's coolness, right? You can pay attention to the air element. 
So feeling that coming in and out, your breath, right? Wherever else you're feeling the air element, you can pay attention to the element of water, liquidity. 
So just noticing where that is in your body, right? And you can pay attention to the solidity, to the earth element, right? So you can either do that sort of sequentially in an intentional way. 
Or as you're just doing your regular meditation, when you notice something like something in your knee or something in your arm, instead of immediately going to arm or knee, you know, feel like what is actually that bare sensation? Like what is that like? Is it solidity? Is it cohesion? Is it heat? You know, what does that actually feel like? And then connect that with sort of the elements too. 
So maybe I'll leave it at that with the elements and see if there's any questions people have or reflections you'd like to share too. 
On this or anything else too. 
Thanks for that. 
I had a question about, you were talking about the four foundations of mindfulness and then also the four elements. 
And if you could talk about, are the four elements under one of the four foundations of mindfulness? Are they a separate category or just kind of link those for us? They're under the body category. 
So there's a category of the body that actually has a lot of different like maybe 14, 15 different sub things under it. 
Yeah, so that's where it lies. 
I was wondering because I mean sometimes when I'm sitting I notice like a sort of like adult ache or something in my shoulder just, you know, from working with the computer all the time. 
Like how could, would I be able to kind of like describe or notice that in terms of four elements? Like oh it feels kind of like adult heat. 
Like how would you go about doing that? Yeah, you could do it exactly like that. 
So I mean basically it's a way to help us to somewhat disidentify with that experience that we're having and disidentify not meaning to separate, right? But it's like to not identify but also completely connect with it. 
So just like you're saying like is there feeling what it is actually? And then if you're feeling like heat, if you're feeling like solidity, if you're feeling like whatever it is, it's a way to kind of help get close to that. 
And you don't need to get super hung up on like oh which element is this or something like that, you know? So it's basically just like sort of a tool to help us connect with that. 
And then also if that's an interesting sort of lens for you then to see that in that lens. 
So for me like it's been interesting to do that both the reflection about externally like I was saying and then also internally. 
And then connect that more and more. 
I mean even ways like say, you know, the part of the liquid thing is that we have the circulatory system, right? So like blood and stuff, so going around in our body all the time, pump, pump, pump, right? And there actually is also this whole circulatory system in the cities too, right? Sometimes people feel like oh in the city it's hard to connect with nature and the elements, but all this stuff is there too. 
So in the city there's this whole plumbing system, right? It's like this entire circulatory system here in Redwood City, right? Since all of you are plumbing here. 
And it's just like also constantly pumping water out and then also a sewage system, right? So there's all these different systems of pipes in which all this stuff is going around. 
And then when I connect to that in my own body it's like oh yeah, externally, internally, you know, there's like this reflection that's there. 
And connection. 
So some of it can be like sort of reflection, you know, contemplation reflection. 
And then some of it is actually directly connecting to it, to that experience of it, you know, with mindfulness. 
So just like you're saying, like feeling that in the shoulder. 
Thank you. 
I had a question along some of the lines. 
I also work at the computer all day and noticing that I'm suffering from really bad posture and I'm trying to fix it and trying to think of how I can correct it. 
I mean, is it sort of like meditation when you're trying to do mental noting? I mean, what's the best way? Should I not judge myself and just first notice it for a few weeks before trying to actually correct it? Or, you know, sometimes I find myself judging myself and getting angry. 
Like, am I doing that to my, you know, shoulders? Yeah, yeah, so this is a good, like, it's a good avenue for a lot of practice. 
So you're trying to fix it. 
So you notice that you feel like, oh, my posture is not good. 
And what makes you notice that? Like people tell you or you feel bad or, you know. 
Both. 
Yeah. 
So you get reflection outside, but then also you feel something, right? Yeah, I feel discomfort, but somehow I've gotten used to making myself be in pain, like by slouching. 
Right, right. 
Oh, sorry. 
So you're used to certain kind of discomfort that happens, yeah. 
And, you know, actually I think that, like, all of practice to some extent, like all of this whole path, which is about suffering and the end of suffering, is becoming increasingly tuned into different levels of discomfort that are there that otherwise we're kind of gloss over or ignore. 
Because we're not paying attention or because we're paying attention to something else or because we're in our own world. 
And then as you pay attention to it more, allowing that to release more, right? So, dukkha in the end of dukkha. 
So here we have a great example, posture. 
So the first thing is, like, to actually look at it as this interesting thing, you know, like anything that seems like a problem. 
Because you have, like, spiritual practice. 
It's great because it's like, oh, this is an interesting thing to practice with, right? So when does, like, have compassion for yourself, right? So everything comes about because of causes and conditions. 
So the, you know, bad posture comes about because, I don't know, I'm going to make up things now. 
So, you know, spend a lot of time in sitting in chairs like this. 
Maybe don't, you know, the body doesn't get enough breaks, you know, to move around and stuff. 
Maybe the furniture is made for people who are, like, bigger than you. 
You know, like, all these different reasons why they contribute to this posture. 
Maybe, like, it's stressful at the job. 
So then it's, like, starting to get more and more crunched up, you know, like this. 
So just having compassion for oneself, understanding, like, oh, yeah, okay, all these different causes and conditions have led to what this current situation is. 
So now I'm bringing attention to this. 
I see this. 
I see this as an aspect of suffering, right? So can I bring compassion for the body, right? And also to the mind as I'm dealing with this, right? And then I think with something like that, it's not that you have to, like, observe the pain over and over, but it's like, okay, so what is it that brings relief? So sometimes it's just like, okay, so you're going to work with this with the elements. 
So sometimes I find, like, if I get like that, like, like, bringing in the air element, you know, like, bringing in the air element actually just brings more uprightness or something like that, right? So you can pay attention to, like, well, what are the conditions then that actually lead to the body being happy, well-off, like, healthy, right? So that's actually a good thing is to try and take care of your body and try and create conditions for it to be okay, right? So it's not like, it's a wussy meditator thing to do to, you know, like, not suffer with that. 
So I think it's, you know, that's a good compassionate thing to do, just like you would want to do for someone else who is in pain, right? So then, you know, there's all these different ways that you could work with that. 
It's like, oh, maybe I need to do yoga more or stretch or get up every 15 minutes or, you know. 
But then you're working with it in the context of both understanding, like, okay, so this came about for these different conditions. 
So that takes away the, like, self-flagellating aspect of it. 
Or the aspect, if there's any judgment, like, oh, I'm such a bad posture person, or, you know, I can't believe I let this go on so long, or I should have better posture, or I caught myself with bad posture an hour ago and now it's back. 
How is that, you know, like, right? So, you know, trying to let go of that stuff if that's happening. 
But if it is happening a lot, then also have compassion for that, the judging mind, right? Judging mind. 
Judging mind is just adding on to what's already a bad situation for the poor body that's been made to, like, be crunched up like this all the time, right? So then bringing compassion like that. 
And then, yeah, doing what you can, I think, with the physical body. 
So it's like actually paying attention to what is it that brings comfort both in that moment and outside, right? Something like that. 
So I was just wondering, so you do the whole meditation and you focus on posture, for example? To do a whole meditation, focusing on posture. 
Yeah, I mean, is that. 
. 
. 
Like, regarding the question that was just asked to you? No, no, regarding what Sutta explains. 
Oh, okay. 
The Sutta explains actually just paying attention to the elements themselves. 
And there's actually many different ways that you can do that. 
In the Sutta itself, in fact, I have it here. 
Let me read it to you. 
The Sutta itself actually draws this metaphor that's a little bit gory, perhaps, about being able to see the different elements as if a cow was chopped up at a crossroads. 
Since you asked, let's see. 
Okay, so there's all these different ways that you're paying attention to the body. 
So it's actually like you start out in this body section. 
There's about the breathing, paying attention to the breath. 
Then there's a sort of paying attention to the different organs of the body, actually. 
It's actually visualizing and feeling them. 
So then we come to this broader sense of paying attention to the body, like when walking, stretching. 
And then we get to the elements here. 
Abhika reviews the same body, however it is placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements thus. 
In this body, there are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element. 
Just as though a skilled butcher or his apprentice had killed a cow and was seated at the crossroads with a cut-up in pieces, so too a bhikkhu practitioner reviews the same body as consisting of elements thus. 
In this body, there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element. 
In this way, the practitioner abides contemplating the body as a body, internally, externally, both internally and externally, and abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. 
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body. 
So just a little bit of specifics. 
I mean, it's just saying to notice the different elements, and then there's all these different ways in which you can kind of work with that. 
So some people actually get very interested in one particular element, like water element, and then that is actually the focus of their meditation is becoming aware of that as that arises. 
You can kind of like not push these things too much, because if it doesn't really interest you, then it's just a drag to have to, you know, do that all the time. 
But if it does interest you, then I encourage you to explore that. 
So either looking for the different four elements, or one of them that's particularly interesting to you too. 
And then this internally, externally, one is interesting too. 
So it's like paying attention to that in your own body, and also like externally I interpret that to be like in the world, as well as in the bodies of other people, right? So not in like a creepy way, but like noticing that everyone else is breathing too. 
Like all animals are breathing, you know, taking in the air element. 
The plants even, right, are all breathing, but opposite to us, right, which is good. 
So we're like in harmony with them in some way, right? The birds, the squirrels, the fish, you know, breathing the water, you know, all that. 
So it's like seeing that that's part of life. 
Like the whole planet is like breathing all the time in this way, right? Everything's in motion, you know, and we're a part of that. 
So you can kind of play around with it. 
I think you can be like a little creative with it if it's interesting to you in that way. 
This is the Majma Nikaya, the middle length discourses, and Satipantana is number ten of it, four foundations of mindfulness, and you can also find it online too, so you don't actually have to carry around this giant book. 
Like that. 
So I understand also that you're about to start a series about daily practice too. 
At home practice. 
So I also had a few thoughts that I thought I would share about that. 
So I'll do now. 
You can also ask more elements things too. 
So how many people here have a daily practice that they feel happy about? Okay, so first thing is to say that you're not alone, right? So many people have some struggle with this at some times in their life, and sometimes other people don't, right? I found that oftentimes people take to or not take to, kind of similarly to their persona, so to speak, to meditation. 
So some people are like predisciplined people about every which thing, and then oftentimes those people don't have as hard a time of starting a daily practice. 
Other people are kind of like team sports kind of people, so they'll do things in groups, so many of you may be this kind of person, so I'll come to the center because then I will meditate, but I know if I was left to my own devices, it would be less likely that I would be sitting here at quarter to nine doing this, right? So it's good to know your own sort of tendencies and patterns and work with them, right? So in some ways, doing meditation practice, starting a meditation practice, is just like any other element of behavior change, so any other habit that you want to pick up, right? It's like a little mysterious and esoteric, but there's a way in which it's just kind of a habit, right? So I think it helps to think about a habit which you may have developed successfully in your life at some point. 
So let's take, for example, brushing your teeth, right? So if you haven't developed brushing your teeth as habit, don't feel bad, but I'm just going to use this as an example, right? So what are the elements in brushing your teeth, right? So one is that you do it at a similar time every day, right? So most people brush their teeth either when they get up or before they go to bed, right? Or both, or after lunch, right? So you know when you're going to do it, okay? Point one, knowing when you're going to do it, setting aside the time, right? Number two, most people have their toothbrushing equipment, right? Toothbrush toothpaste, right? Always at hand. 
They run out, they get more, and they keep it in the same place all the time, right? So you keep it usually in the bathroom, maybe in the kitchen, but you know where it is, right? So number two, you have your equipment and you keep it in the same place, right? So if you didn't do this, you could imagine if you were like keeping your toothpaste sometimes in the car and sometimes in the kitchen and sometimes, you know, look for it every time you're going to brush your teeth, right? You'd be less likely to actually brush your teeth, right? Also, if you didn't decide when you're going to brush your teeth already and now have it as a given, if you just kind of vaguely took an aspiration that toothbrushing seemed like a good thing to do and you'd like to add that to your life, you've heard about toothbrushing as a positive thing, you've met people who brush their teeth and seem to be good clean people, right? So you think, I'll do that sometime, but then you haven't decided when, you don't have the equipment and you haven't decided, you know, so you can see where I'm going with this, right? So for meditation, it's helpful to decide when you're going to do it and basically make some internal commitment to doing that, right? So when is a good time to do it? So of course any time, but for some people, the morning, right, when they get up is good. 
Get up, sometimes you can tie it to something you already have a good habit with, like brushing your teeth. 
So it's like, okay, I'm going to get up, I'm going to brush my teeth, I'm going to sit. 
That's like tacked on to the toothbrushing regimen, right? For some people, when you come home from work, it's good. 
For some people, right before they go to bed, it's good. 
So it's good to kind of like figure out what time may be the best for you, right, to do that, right? Then the sort of equipment. 
So of course you don't need that much equipment to sit and breathe, right? But it can help to have something that sort of reminds you of that, right? So you have some equipment, like if you like to sit on the ground, you have your cushion or something like that, right? Some people have like a small altar or something like that, which sort of helps remind them of that part of yourself. 
So that intention to be awake or that intention to develop yourself or whatever your relationship is to practice, right? And it doesn't have to be like a huge thing, the altar, you know, it could be just like some things that inspire you or some pictures of teachers or even of nature or people that you love or, you know, something small, a flower, whatever. 
So some people are into that, some people are not. 
But that's just a suggestion too, as part of the like making a place thing, right? So if you can have a little setup in your apartment home, then that's helpful because it kind of reminds you, kind of the same way like your toothbrush toothpaste are there, right? It's like, oh yeah, this meditation thing, right? This is my meditation spot, right? So then you walk by and you remember it and, you know, okay, so I brush my teeth and I roll into this thing, right? So I mean, we're kind of like dogs, we have to train ourselves, right, as best you can to do these things, right? So the other thing that's helpful sometimes is social pressure and tooth brushing. 
So if you live with other people and if they're also brushing their teeth and you're not, right, it becomes noticeable, right? So it also is always helpful if there's other people who do that, like who meditate. 
So coming here is helpful, social pressure to do that, right? But if you have people in your home who do, then also you could try and meditate together. 
Also it's helpful, right? So think about it like those of you who are having a hard time with practice. 
So we sat here for half an hour, right, and we didn't get up and stuff, right? So at home, you may or may not be able to do that. 
You may feel like that's hard to do, right? So what is that about, right? So one thing that it's about is, well, actually I should ask you what it's about. 
I shouldn't tell you what it's about. 
What do you think it's about when it's hard to sit for like half an hour? Supposing at this point you've gotten to the cushion and you're like, okay, I'm going to sit, and then you bounce. 
So what happens if you're willing to? All of us have this problem, so go ahead, yeah. 
Yes. 
Oh, she's asking for the mic actually, yeah. 
Yeah, just the hindrances, restlessness, doubt. 
Dance like that. 
Yeah, yeah, great, yes. 
I mean, it's a good answer. 
In my experience. 
Yes, yes. 
So, you know, I don't want to steal Andrea's subjects in talking about this, but yeah, the hindrances are also key, 2600 years of tradition of this being things that dog people who try to meditate. 
So you probably have discussed them here, so their doubt is one of them. 
So that could come in your daily sitting practice in the form of like, should I really be doing this or should I be doing something else? Don't I have all those bills to pay? Should I make that phone call? Shouldn't I do this? Shouldn't I do that? I wonder if this is really doing anything. 
It doesn't feel like it did when I sat on retreat. 
I'm not having any special experiences. 
I'm just, you know, on and on, right? So that is actually doubt. 
So you can actually bring attention to that experience and know that as the state of sort of confusion, doubt, and feel what that feels like. 
So actually bring attention to it and know it, right? So these five hindrances are actually just like these weather patterns that go through your mind, body, and which actually you can bring mindfulness to. 
You can bring awareness to, and it's very good to practice this kind of relationship with, to doubt. 
Then the two other pairs. 
One is of sleepiness and restlessness. 
So two opposites, right? So sleepiness, as I see someone taking over the room here too, is like the body, tired, the mind, tired, sinking, right? So you can actually bring some energy to that experience, get interested in it, and actually feel like, so what does it feel like to be sleepy? Like where's the edges of sleepiness? What does sleepiness feel like in my toes? Where does it come from? Does it start here and erupt? Does it drift in like the fog over Twin Peaks, you know, like that? Like what is sleepiness like? How does it come in? What does it feel like? So actually feeling that in the body, right? You can also help yourself because sometimes you have the best intention, but you're just so tired. 
So you can open your eyes, right? Light up some light. 
You can stand up actually to standing meditation. 
But knowing this state sleepiness in the body and the mind is helpful. 
Then the opposite is restlessness, right? So you're like, sit down, but you're just like so wanting to jump out of your skin, right? So sometimes it's in the mind, like you're worried about something a lot. 
Worry, regret, kind of restlessness of mind. 
And sometimes it's like restlessness of the body, right? You just feel like, you know, like the body is like revving, right? Like how can I sit still? Then sometimes you have a multiple attack where you're like, then you have doubt, like, oh, maybe I should have gone to the gym instead of this. 
And clearly my body doesn't want to sit, right? So it's good to check that because then this is also just another energetic pattern that's going through the body-mind, right? Which also you can bring awareness to. 
So with all of these, you bring awareness to them. 
You can see them as not me, mine, whether a pattern is going through, changing also. 
It's not like this will be here permanently, which anytime there's this feeling like, oh, this is going to kill me or something like that, right? It's good to be like, okay, it's impermanent, changing. 
It's not how this, wherever, right? Notice that. 
With restlessness, it's good to give a big container, right? So actually not to kind of bear down on it in some way. 
But actually to sort of expand with some spaciousness so that that can actually hold the energy, right? That's like so active. 
So they say it's like if there's a calf or a horse that's like bucking, it's like very energetic. 
Like you don't want to put it in a little stall. 
If you put it in a little stall, it's going to like freak out more, right? Kick more. 
So actually put in a big pastor and then let it like run around, jump around, do its thing. 
And then after a while, it kind of settles down. 
So similarly with your awareness, with your attention, instead of like trying to bear down on it, it kind of like make my attention as spacious as this entire room, right? And within that spaciousness, then whatever the body is doing can be held. 
And then the other two pair are desire, right? So wanting something, sort of craving. 
And then aversion, not wanting something. 
So desire can be like, you know, I really want to watch this show. 
I want to eat something now. 
Usually like wanting a certain experience of some sort. 
And then aversion is like pushing away. 
So that could be like, if it's really boring, it seems like your meditation is boring, right? Or if there's body pain, you don't want to sit with that. 
If there's memories that come up that are disturbing to you, right? Or something like that. 
So that ends what happens, frankly, when you're sitting in your daily practice, is not like some beatific experience, right? Sometimes it is and that's great. 
But some of the time it just feels like taking out the garbage in some way, right? So you're just like rehashing conversations you had during the day in some conglomerate form. 
You know, running through this and that. 
Did I forget to turn off the lights? You know, just like a humdrum-y stuff it seems like, right? But in some way there's a way in which like the system gets so tight during the day that actually even doing that I think is like helping the system to relax and sort of unwind itself, right? And then you actually have a moment to even notice what it was that you didn't have time to notice during the day, right? Something like as our body gets, you know, tighter, right? There are different things that sort of accumulate on us that we sort of contract, contract, contract, right? And during the day we're like too busy trying to get things done or do this or something. 
So we're not noticing necessarily like each of those little contract, contract, contract, right? It's hard to do that, right? So when you're sitting is actually a chance, even if it feels like, oh, all I'm feeling is all this contraction is like actually giving that some attention. 
So loving attention, kind attention in which that can kind of like unravel itself. 
So like if you have a rope that's like tight, tight, tight, and then you let go of the end and it starts to be like, you know. 
So it's okay, like let the body, let the mind do what it needs to do. 
It's good for it, you know, in some way, I found. 
It's like good, you know, whatever it is. 
And then also letting go of our judgment. 
So this was a good sitting, this was a bad sitting. 
I achieved this much more in my spiritual growth, you know. 
If I have a little marker on the door frame, like you do with the growth of those little kids, you know. 
So it's like some, there's some amount of just like putting in the time, you know, like sitting. 
Yeah, then each time that you do that, you're developing these habits of being present, developing the habits of mindfulness, right? And we're always cultivating something or another. 
So this is good to keep in mind. 
It's like all of our life we're cultivating this or that in every moment, cultivating this or that. 
So what are we cultivating now? We're cultivating kindness, we're cultivating fear, cultivating revenge, we're cultivating spaciness, right? So all these different possible, you know, grooves that are being dug in our mind, right? Cultivating mindfulness, it's a good one to dig. 
So as we practice something, then that kind of groove gets dug more. 
It becomes more the habit of the mind, right? So regardless of what the content is of your experience when you sit, the fact that you've like tried to bring attention there, done the best you could, even if it's for only like two seconds of being there, then, you know, that's great. 
You've dug that groove more than if you were just doing something else, right? So that's the pitch for daily practice. 
So, you know, think about your own temperament and what works. 
Think about how to make a place that you feel like would be sort of appealing to you and have the stuff that you need there. 
Also, if you live with other people, of course, you have to like negotiate at that time. 
So like the kids are, you know, roommates don't bug you, right? Turn off mobile devices, right? Yeah, just make that, that's your little retreat for that period of time, right? So ideally you set the amount of time and then if you have a little timer thing you can set, then that helps you not to have to worry about it and keep like looking at the clock like that, right? A few different things to play with though, too. 
So one is with this hindrance thing. 
So some people say like, I'm really interested in these hindrances or not interested in them, but they come. 
So I'm going to actually sit until I see three different hindrances. 
So I'll be sitting here and there will be this piece of me that like wants to get up. 
So what's that about? So what's going on? So like, okay, oh, that's doubt, right? Okay, what does that feel like? Okay, got that. 
Then you settle down again and this other thing, like, it's really boring. 
I don't want to sit here. 
Oh, that's aversion. 
Okay, so just notice before you get up. 
And then the third one will come like, I really should make it. 
I really want to eat dinner. 
I'm hungry, right? Okay, desire, you know, like that. 
So you can decide like, okay, I'm going to sit here until three of them go. 
Fourth one, I'll let it go because I'm only human and, you know, I'll sit through three hindrances. 
So you can decide something like that. 
Anyway, just some words on daily practice for you. 
So questions, comments about that? Yeah. 
I have a question about the elements. 
Oh yeah, great. 
Sort of. 
I really connect with nature, but I do have a hard time living in the city and like kind of keeping a positive attitude about connecting because it's ugly. 
Yeah. 
A lot of times it's like, this isn't where I want to be, you know? I appreciate your talking about like the underground pipes and that kind of system and comparing that. 
But I'm trying to kind of grapple with how do I keep not, you know, make that negative groove about, oh, I get off the highway and it's just ugly and I'm in my car and I'm disconnected and. 
Yeah. 
There's many different ways to work with that. 
So one is actually, so if that's your experience is like you get off the highway and you're like, ah, pavement hell, I'm back and, you know, then that's your experience. 
So then it's like, oh, okay, this is a version. 
Like this is what it's like. 
This is what it's like to hate where I am, right? How does that feel, right? And just feeling that, like really feeling what that feels like in terms of the body, the mind, right? So sometimes it's only when you actually feel that pain of that that you start to realize like, oh, there's actually not a great thing to cultivate this sense of hatred, right? You know, because otherwise there's a part of you that's like, oh, this is actually true. 
And so I should continue thinking this because everyone knows it's better to be in nature and, you know, like, so there can be this whole story about it that sort of cultivates along this aversion, really, right? So actually feeling that and dropping into the emotional feeling below that story about it, right? So that's one thing you can do. 
And then having compassion for oneself in that experience. 
Because basically anytime that we want things to be different than they are, that is like fighting the law of gravity, right? So here I am on the road and I want to be in Muir Woods and I'm not. 
It's like some version of like, I want to be somewhere I'm not. 
Recipe for suffering, right? And we all do it all the time, right? Many times. 
But, you know, so it's good to see that it's like, oh, okay, this is what the dynamic is here, right? I've been clinging to something. 
I have this idea in my mind come up, clinging to it, right? Clinging to what it could be, what it should be, right? So just seeing that, right? The other is you can do a little reflection because actually all the roads too is made of minerals, right? I mean, it's different form, right? But it's all like rocks and tar and all this stuff, right? So you can play a little game of like the elements that I see around, you know? It's like the air and the tar and the, you know, the water and see that's part of me and part of this too, you know? Kind of reflection like that, right? And the other thing is also just to understand if you're like a person who likes nature to try to get yourself into nature sometimes. 
So it's not just to actually, you know, suffer with it. 
It's like, oh yeah, this is something that actually feeds me is to be around nature and a lot of time I'm not able to. 
So like, let me go to nature in the weekends or something like that. 
Like, let me actually prioritize that. 
Because I think there is something nice about being able to be in the natural world and I think sort of remember ourselves as part of that. 
That it's true it's harder to do in the city. 
Like in the city sometimes it feels like everything's on this certain like pace and stuff like that. 
And, you know, I mean, I think in the Bay Area it's nice because you can see nature sometimes even around. 
Sometimes you can see the mountains and this and that which helps to put things in perspective a little, you know? But still it's different than being in the middle of the deep forest too, right? So it's also recognized if that's part of who you are that you need that. 
Like, okay, compassionate thing for me to do would be actually to like prioritize taking myself on walks. 
Like, take your dog on a walk or something like that, you know? Take myself to the park, something, yeah. 
And then also even in your home, like, you can decide like, oh, I want to have some plants or something. 
Like, nature's important to me. 
So like, this is part of my altar. 
It's like a little plant area, like natural thing or, you know, in your car even, a little test tube plant. 
Well, VW said that, right? A test tube plastic flower. 
Plastic flower may not be convincing, but you know, something like that, yeah. 
So yeah, I mean, I think it's good both to bring the awareness to it, bring compassion to it, but then also to see like, okay, so what can I do to help myself be happy in this too? So speaking of being happy and releasing, I think it's right at our time. 
So let me just sit for a moment and we'll share the merit from our practicing here together. 
So this is a sharing blessings. 
So you can just connect again to your body, the solidity of ourselves touching the ground. 
Take a breath, feeling the air coming in and out. 
You can feel the water in our mouth, connecting to the water element, feeling the temperature, how it is in our body right now. 
So here we've had this opportunity to practice together and to share the dhamma, hear the dhamma. 
It's actually a very beneficial thing for us to do for ourselves and for everyone that we encounter. 
So we appreciate ourselves for having come here tonight and we share the blessings from our practice with everyone here and with all the other beings made of the same elements, seen, unseen, near, far, in the air, on the earth, in the water. 
Just as we wish to be happy, all beings wish to be happy. 
Just as we wish to be safe, all beings wish to be safe. 
Just as we wish to be free from suffering, so do all beings wish to be free from suffering. 
We wish this for them as well. 
So the train has come that tells us to leave the meditation hall. 
So thank you for being here today. 
It's a pleasure to be here with you and hope to see you again sometime. 
I have a dharma web page on MySpace, MySpace. 
com slash Anishka F. 
So you can check it out. 
I have some recommendations of books and dharma cartoons and this and that. 
I teach around the Bay Area, sometimes further afield, so hope to see you again.
