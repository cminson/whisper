Before we move on to the topic of clinging, any more questions about craving? Ajaan, I'm kind of wondering what's the difference between sensuality craving and sensual becoming because there are the examples you gave. 
The craving for sensual is becoming is basically taking on the identity of someone in a world where you can join sensual pleasures. 
So the sensuality craving is the nucleus for that becoming. 
So first is the image of the pizza, and then there's the image of me as the person who can eat the pizza and can get the pizza. 
So the first one is sort of this image of I want to go over that pizza, that's the craving for sensuality, and then there's I want to be the person who can get pizza anytime he wants and whatever. 
That's the becoming. 
Question over here. 
Ajaan, thank you for the talk, the Dharma fire hose that I'm drinking from here. 
You mentioned something at the end of the last session which really piqued my interest, and you said that Buddha spoke about not harming others, but that was separate from not hurting people's feelings. 
And given the issue of speech, particularly say on college campuses now, I'm just interested in if you have a sense of what the Buddha might say about folks who would say that some speech is hurting my feelings, and therefore it's harmful to me. 
I wonder if you have something to say about that, if that's okay to ask. 
Sure, I must admit that the reason I was smiling just now was I was thinking of a phrase I learned in Thailand. 
There's one woman who was a professor at a university in Thailand and she says, what's wrong with this current generation of students is that even if they stepped on chicken shit, it wouldn't crush it. 
In other words, you've got to learn how there's going to be unpleasant speech in the world, and it's not necessarily harming you. 
The Buddha gives us an example, you probably know that Suta Majama 58 where the prince has been put up by the Jains to ask the Buddha, would the Buddha ever say anything unpleasant? And they think he's going to double bind. 
If he says yes, he would say unpleasant things, they would say what's the difference between you and the ordinary people out in the market? And if he says he wouldn't say unpleasant things, they have him on record for saying unpleasant things about Devadatta. 
And so the prince goes and he asks the question to the Buddha, and the Buddha says, that's a question that does not deserve a categorical answer. 
And the prince realized, okay, the Buddha was able to get out of the double bind. 
And he gives the example of having a child who's got something sharp in his mouth. 
And what do you do? You hold the child very carefully, and you get your finger in the child's mouth and get that sharp object out, even if it means drawing blood. 
Why? Because if the child swallowed it, it would be even worse. 
So there are times you have to say unpleasant things to people to warn them, to warn them or else warn the other people around them, that this person is on the wrong course. 
And so he says basically before he would say anything, he'd ask himself first, is it true? And if it was true, then the second question is, is it beneficial? And the third question, is this the right time to say something pleasant or something unpleasant? So truth, beneficial, time and place. 
And they say if something would pass all three tests, then he would say it. 
So the fact that there is unpleasant speech in the world, he has lots of instructions on how, given the fact that we live in a world where human speech can either be pleasant or unpleasant, well meant or not well meant, helpful or not helpful. 
We have to learn how to train our minds not to be affected when unpleasant speech comes. 
So this is part of a training that you have to learn. 
Okay, no matter what unpleasant things people can say to you, you don't have to let yourself be harmed. 
I think part of the problem is they're trying to take the laws of a psychotherapist's office and impose them on the rest of society as a whole. 
And it doesn't work that way. 
Because otherwise nobody will be able to say anything because somebody is going to be offended. 
So we have to learn how to learn that people's speech can be what they, people have the right to say what they want to say, but we don't have to let ourselves get harmed by it. 
And the image of the Buddha gives is, think of your mind, well think of your good will as being as large as the earth. 
And the person is saying something unpleasant is like someone who is trying to spit on the earth and dig in the earth and say be without earth, be without earth. 
And you say, nope, the earth is just too big. 
So instead of having this image of yourself as this poor weak person who is victimized by every unpleasant thing that is being said to you, your mind is solid and it's large and invulnerable, invincible. 
And if you can learn that, then we can live with one another. 
So I think that's probably what you would have to say. 
Thank you. 
Hi. 
So I feel like I'm accustomed to hearing the second noble truth talked about in terms of the three poisons, greed, hate and delusion. 
Can you help me distinguish the three poisons from these three forms of craving? Are you talking about the same thing with different terms? A lot of the craving, three times the craving are what either be greed or aversion. 
And then because craving is based on ignorance, that's where the delusion would be. 
So you've got the delusion underneath the two. 
And then the cravings either tend to go towards something or trying to run away from something. 
Mike for Monk. 
I've heard you just this morning speaking about the path in the mountain and how the path doesn't necessarily correspond to the nature of the destination. 
And I've heard in a previous talk sort of speaking about the quality of the enlightened mind, like the luminous quality, but that just implying sort of the knowing or not what people usually take it as. 
But I'm curious about that because in terms of an arahan not ever breaking the five precepts or something like that, and the path also having that quality of harmlessness around say the five precepts, there seems to be a correspondence and some quality to the enlightened mind that would keep it from those things. 
The color of the dirt on the road to the Grand Canyon is the same color as the Grand Canyon. 
Thank you. 
Let's move on to clinging. 
Okay, clinging is defined in passages of 10, 11, 12, either as desire, passion, or as delight. 
In other words, you don't just want something, but you've found something that you really feel passionate about or you really are delighting in. 
The word for craving, dunha, means to thirst for something, whereas the word upadana, which is the poly word for clinging, is to feed on something. 
So the connection is, okay, with craving you are thirsting for something out there, and with the clinging you've found something to feed on. 
And you grab onto that and you hold onto it to get some sustenance out of it. 
So it's both the act of taking sustenance and the sustenance that's provided by whatever the object is. 
They use this primarily in two contexts. 
One is the sustenance for a tree. 
The tree takes sustenance out of the earth. 
And the other is a fire taking sustenance out of its fuel. 
It clings to the fuel at the same time that it's feeding on the fuel. 
And I think this image of feeding is the best way to sort of think about clinging. 
Sometimes the question comes up, you know, if I can't cling, how can I have attachments to my family? And the difference is you can, you know, feel affection for your family, you feel committed to the family, responsible for your family. 
But the question is, does your happiness depend on feeding on your family? And for a lot of people it is, you know. 
Yeah, I really get my sustenance in life by feeding off of my children or feeding off of the situation in the family. 
And that's the unnecessary part of the relationship and that's the part that turns it into suffering. 
So if you want to learn how to be in a relationship, the Buddha actually recommends that when a monk gets ordained that he regards his teacher as his father and the teacher is supposed to regard the monk as his son and treat one another with the same kind of affection. 
But this means, it also means in the context that you don't have to make your happiness depend on this person being the way you want him or her to be so you can feed on them. 
That's the distinction that's being made here. 
Now, what do we cling to? We cling to these activities that are called the aggregates. 
In fact, the five cleaning aggregates, this is the Buddha's definition of suffering. 
You know, when he talks about suffering, first he gives you a list of the different kinds of suffering. 
There's a suffering of birth, aging, illness, death, being together with what you don't like, being separated from what you do like, not getting what you want. 
All of which are things we're familiar with. 
And then he says, okay, in short, it's the five clinging aggregates. 
And this is where it goes from being familiar to being unfamiliar. 
So we have to develop, we have to talk both about clinging and the aggregates. 
Just as a note to keep in mind beforehand, because this is the first noble truth, you want to comprehend clinging, you want to also comprehend the aggregates. 
And comprehending means that you understand them to the point where you develop dispassion for them. 
Remember, we're talking about passion is what drives the fabrication. 
Passion is also what drives our felt need to feed off of these things. 
So you have to learn how to understand, what are these things that I'm feeding on? One of the things, and is it really providing the nourishment that I thought it would? And you ultimately want to see that it's not. 
It's like that famous far-sight cartoon where a group of cows are out in the pasture and one of them is jerking her head up and saying, wait a minute, this is grass. 
We've been eating grass. 
Well, the Buddha actually has a very similar image. 
He says it's like a blind person who's been given a dirty old rag and he's told this is a beautiful white piece of cloth, keep, take good care of it. 
And so he takes very good care of what he thinks of what is a beautiful white piece of cloth. 
And then his friends and relatives take him to a doctor who gives him his eyesight back and then he looks at it and he realizes he's been cherishing a dirty rag. 
In other words, we've been feeding off these things without really noticing what we're feeding off of and realizing that without realizing that we're causing ourselves more stress than we need to. 
Okay, what are aggregates? What's clinging? Let's go into a little bit more detail. 
Okay, there are five aggregates. 
Form, which is the form of your body, can also mean any physical form. 
A bottle of water. 
The watch. 
Other people. 
These are all forms. 
Okay, then the second one is feeling. 
These are feeling tones. 
These are not emotions. 
A feeling tone of either pleasure, pain, neither pleasure nor pain. 
The third one is perception. 
These are the labels that we apply to things. 
The names we give to things or the image we have in mind when we're thinking about something. 
That's a perception. 
Fabrication is the mind's ability to put things together. 
To think about things and to put perceptions together so you can begin to plan and evaluate the results of what you've done, the way you sort of think and judge about things. 
The way you reason to yourself is also fabrication. 
We'll be getting more into this later on. 
And then finally, consciousness is the bare imprint of a sensation on your senses. 
The reception of those imprints. 
They've got form, feeling, perception, fabrication, and consciousness. 
Those are the five aggregates. 
The question is why does the Buddha divide the objects of clinging into these five types? The best answer I can come up with, it doesn't say why in the canon, but the best answer I can come up with is that all of these five things are involved in the process of feeding, both physically and emotionally. 
In terms of physical feeding, for example, you have this body which you have to sustain, and there are things outside that you could possibly eat. 
That's all form. 
Then you have feelings. 
You've got the feeling of the pain, of the hunger, when the body feels a need or something, and then you've got the sense of pleasure that comes when that need has been met. 
Perception is two-fold. 
One is perceiving, what kind of hunger do I have? Am I hungry for something salty? Am I hungry for something sweet? Am I hungry for vegetables? Am I hungry for a relationship? What lack do I feel? Can you identify the nature of the lack? Then they ask the other question, of course, why is it out there that I can feed on? This is how we relate to the world to begin with. 
Our first perception is, can I eat it or can I not eat it? Little kids crawl across the floor, they find something, where is the first place they put it? In the mouth. 
Is this edible? Then the next question is, suppose I need a certain kind of food, how do I find it? That's fabrication, how you plan for it. 
Once you've found it, can you eat it as it is, or do you have to prepare it? You get a raw potato, you can't eat the raw potato, you've got to cook it, you've got to do something with it. 
All of that is fabrication. 
Finally, consciousness is kind of the bare awareness of these things. 
All these processes as they're happening. 
So these are the things, given the fact that we define ourselves as beings in a particular state, and the nature of a being is that they have to feed. 
This is your most basic activity as a being. 
I've got to sustain my being by feeding it. 
And so it's through these five activities that we sustain ourselves, which is why they are so basic and fundamental in terms of activities of the mind as we're going through the world. 
Now we hear so much about how the aggregates are painful, but the Buddha says they're not exclusively painful. 
He said, if they're exclusively painful, we wouldn't cling to them. 
We'd have no passion for them, we'd have no delight in them, we'd have no desire for them. 
It's the fact that they do have offer some pleasure that we actually cling. 
Now this is important because sometimes you hear, we cling to things because we think they have inheriting existence, or we cling to things because we think they're permanent, but we don't really care whether they have inheriting existence or permanence. 
We think, is it going to be worth the effort to get them? And we think from it, what are the two big things that people cling to? Food and sex, right? Does anyone think that food and sex is permanent? No. 
Do we think that they have inherent existence? No, it doesn't matter. 
We think it's worth the effort to get it that we go for it and that we cling to it. 
So what this means is we're making a value of judgment, and the Buddha is saying we're making a very bad value of judgment in clinging to the aggregates. 
And we have to learn how to train ourselves to make better value of judgments about whether these things are worth holding on to or not. 
Once a year I go to Zion National Park and I have to drive through Las Vegas. 
And we don't stop. 
We don't stop. 
We made this mistake of stopping one time at a gas station to get gas, and so we have three or four monks out and you're cleaning the windows on the van. 
And somebody comes up to you, are you guys a rap group? I figured this is the last place on earth I ever want to teach the Dharma. 
I'm sorry. 
And one of our sports in going through Las Vegas is looking at the billboards. 
And one of the billboards was saying, because you know, promising, we give a 93% payback rate. 
And you know what they're saying? You give us a dollar, we'll give you a 93% back. 
And every Friday night people go by droves from Los Angeles. 
And every Sunday afternoon they're coming back by droves because they want to trade a dollar for 93 cents. 
And this is our problem as human beings. 
We're bad judges of what actually is worth doing. 
Because we learned what's worth doing when we're little kids. 
And the ideas from our childhood, when we didn't have good judgment, are still hanging around, lurking around in the mind. 
So the Buddhist teaching is trying to say, we have to learn how to have better value junctions about these things. 
This is what the three perceptions are all about. 
You look at something, is it lasting? No, it's not lasting. 
Is it stressful or easeful? It's stressful. 
Is it worth holding on to as yourself? The teaching on that self is not a metaphysical doctrine. 
He's not saying there is no self. 
The question is, is it worth developing an identity around this? And the answer is no. 
Then let go of that. 
It's a value judgment. 
Is it worth it? No. 
So that's what we're working on. 
Trying to prove our value judgments. 
Now given what I was saying earlier about how we have the raw materials from which we fashion things. 
In other words, it's like we have the food from which we are going to fashion something that we want to eat. 
We tend to cling first to the raw materials as they're coming. 
We cling to the present moment process of fashioning something out of them. 
We cling to the anticipation of what we're going to get. 
And we cling to the results when they're attained. 
So there's four stages in the process that we're cling. 
Just the raw material coming in. 
Say you have a garden where you've got your vegetables growing. 
You cling to the garden. 
You cling to your skill as a cook in fixing food out of the garden. 
You cling to your anticipation about what you're going to get when you finish fixing it. 
And then you cling to the food as you're eating it. 
So there's all these things that we tend to cling to. 
An image I like to give is you're raising chickens. 
You've got the chickens because you want to get the eggs out of the chickens. 
Even if you're vegetarian, you've got the chickens for the eggs. 
You cling to the chickens. 
They provide the raw material. 
You cling to the eggs as they're coming out. 
And you cling to your ability to do something with the eggs in anticipation of what good food you're going to get out of the eggs. 
Now the problem is our judgment is pretty bad. 
Whatever comes out of the chicken we assume is an egg. 
And we eat it. 
And then we wonder why our stomachs are not, you know, we get sick. 
And then on top of that the Buddha says, Not only do we feed off the aggregates, but the aggregates chew on us. 
Form, feeling, perceptions, fabrications, consciousness, these chew on us. 
In other words, these are the chickens from hell. 
They wait until you're asleep at night, and then they come and package your ears and eyes and nose. 
And we don't see the connection. 
They say, Where are these chickens coming from? We're feeding them. 
So these are the things we've got to watch out for. 
The raw materials that are coming in from past karma, our skill as a cook, basically, our anticipation of what all the good things we're going to get from our skills, and then we cling also to the product when it's attained. 
As I said earlier, the aggregates are not exclusively painful. 
They're also not what we are. 
There's a belief, in fact, it's actually developed quite early in the commentaries, that we don't have a self, but the aggregates are what we are as human beings. 
That's not the case. 
The Buddha keeps saying, One, self does not have to be permanent. 
Whatever is, you see this several times in the canon, that he equates, the Buddha says, Your sense of self is not necessarily the belief that you have a permanent self. 
It's whatever you identify yourself as. 
It could be permanent, not permanent, whatever. 
It's still you, your sense of you, that is yourself. 
And the Buddha says very specifically, You've got to learn then to see that none of these aggregates are yourself. 
The question is, What are you? The Buddha says, Don't ask. 
Because as soon as you try to define yourself, you limit yourself. 
A very standard case of this, and I've been hearing it again and again, If I'm a psychophysical being, how could I possibly be reborn? How could I possibly know anything that is deathless and unconditioned? I mean, this is the basic premise of secular Buddhism. 
In fact, I was talking with a Buddhist scholar a while back, and I made that particular comment, and I pointed out, On the one hand, the Buddha never defines what a human being is, and said his approach was, Let's see what I can know, what I can do, and then based on what he was able to know and do, then he came back and looked at what capabilities does a human being have. 
But he never comes back to define what a human being is. 
And this particular scholar said he could understand how the Buddha gained a sense of equanimity on the night of his awakening, but the idea of putting it on to rebirth, that just made any sense to him. 
And he said, You're like a person who can read only three letters at a time, and you see the word antelope, and you see him. 
Okay, the Buddha teaches ants. 
That's what you see. 
As for antelopes, it just doesn't make any sense to you. 
And especially if someone comes to you and says antelope, it's not ant, it's antelope, and you say, Well, ants don't elope. 
That doesn't make any sense to me. 
I'm going to stick with ants. 
The Buddha said, If you define yourself, you limit yourself. 
So he said, Stay away from this process of defining yourself. 
This is why there's nothing in the fornable truths about what you are. 
Simply define your experience in terms of what you're doing that's causing stress, what you can do that can lead to the end of stress. 
Those are the only categories you need to think about, or think in. 
Okay, this clinging is something we have to learn how to overcome. 
Not because it causes stress and suffering right now, but clinging is what leads to rebirth, and even more suffering after we die. 
As long as the mind is clinging, as long as consciousness and craving are there, they will feed each other. 
Consciousness does not need a body in order to survive. 
It survives on clinging and craving. 
And the clinging and craving, of course, depend on the consciousness. 
It kind of goes back and forth. 
But the process could be indefinite. 
It could go on and continue unless you put a stop to it. 
There are four types of clinging. 
Okay, there's clinging to sensuality, which we've already defined. 
You cling to your ability to fantasize about sensual pleasures. 
There's clinging to views, clinging to habits and practices, and clinging to doctrines of the self. 
Sensuality, views, habits and practices. 
Sometimes that's translated as rites and rituals, or precepts and practices, which makes it sound like the Buddha is saying, if you don't have any precepts, you're okay. 
Which is not what he's saying. 
The word sila can mean habit, virtue, precept. 
In this case, I think it means habits. 
I'll give you an example. 
If you've heard the story of Conrad Lawrence and his goose, you can tune out for the next five minutes. 
I'll repeat it to you if you haven't heard it. 
Conrad Lawrence was a famous biologist in Austria. 
And one summer he was raising a goose. 
The goose gave birth to a little Gosling, and then she died. 
And so immediately the Gosling fixated on Conrad Lawrence. 
Wherever Conrad Lawrence went in the garden, the little Gosling would follow him around. 
And this summer went by, of course, the little Gosling turned into a goose. 
It was still following around the garden. 
And as fall came, Conrad Lawrence realized, I've got to bring the goose into the house so it doesn't freeze during the winter. 
So one evening when it came time to feed the goose, instead of feeding the goose, he just walked into the house and left the door open. 
So the goose followed him in. 
Now this is the first time the goose had ever been in an enclosed space and it freaked out. 
And so a window down at the end of the hall, immediately went running to the window, hoping to get out, but then realized he couldn't get out. 
In the meantime, Conrad Lawrence walked up the stairway. 
It went up to the right, which went up to his apartment in the next floor. 
Called the goose, the goose turned around, went back, followed him up the stairs. 
That's where it got to eat. 
So from that point on, every time the goose went into the house, it would go first to the window, then back and up the stairs. 
And then as time wore on, the trip to the window got shorter and shorter. 
And so finally the goose would go to that side of the stairway, shake its foot at the window, go up the stairs. 
Then one night Conrad Lawrence came home late from work and the goose was really hungry. 
And so as soon as he opened the door into the house, the goose went running into the house and up the stairs. 
It stopped halfway up the stairs, shook all over, and then very methodically walked down the stairs over the window, back up. 
That's clingy to habits and practices. 
Listening to your inner goose. 
So we have sensuality, views, habits and practices, and doctrines of the self. 
Of these four, three of them actually have a role in the path. 
Just giving you a little forewarning. 
There will be views, there will be habits and practices, and there will be doctrines of the self that you will cling to provisionally as part of the path. 
Sensuality does not have a role in the path. 
But let's go look at the unskillful versions of these things. 
Basically the views here are the wrong views that would lead you to act in unskillful ways. 
The Buddha wants you to ban on those. 
These include views of determinism. 
In other words, whatever you experience has already been determined, either by something you did in the past or something a creator God did to create the world, or just simply impersonal fate. 
That's a wrong view because it means that you're not going to pay attention to your actions. 
You're not going to take responsibility for them. 
That's one wrong view. 
Another wrong view is randomness. 
In other words, there is no cause and effect in the world. 
Things just happen randomly, spontaneously, which would lead you to believe, well, whatever pleasure comes, I'm going to grab it right then because I don't know when it's coming back. 
That leads also to unskillful actions. 
It's interesting that the Buddha also includes the belief that I have a self and I have no self. 
These are wrong views. 
Important point to remember. 
And all the variations that come with that, it sounds kind of complex. 
Excuse me, but it sounds very Indian. 
It's through self that I know self, or it's through not self that I know self, or it's through not self that I know not self. 
But it's also, it's just the story of Western philosophy. 
Kant, I know self through not self. 
Leibniz, I know self through self. 
The question is, what am I? Do I exist? Do I not exist? This animates Western philosophy, Indian philosophy. 
And the Buddha is basically saying, don't go there. 
It's a writhing of use. 
Then there are any of ten positions that the Buddha said, he would not even answer the question. 
Is the world eternal? Is the world not eternal? Is the world finite? Is it infinite? Is the body the same thing as your soul? Is your soul something separate from the body? After an arhat dies, does the arhat exist? Not exist, both, neither. 
What's that? Just stay away from those. 
Because it just gets you entangled in a writhing of use. 
Agnosticism is also a wrong view. 
In other words, saying, and it's specifically an agnosticism about what's skillful and what's not skillful. 
The Buddha calls this ill-rigaling, that you refuse to take one answer or another. 
Now there are some issues, of course, that the Buddha would not address, as I just said. 
But in his case, he would also explain why you don't address them. 
Whereas he says, basically, agnosticism that comes either out of fear, because I don't really know and I don't want to take a position, or fear that there might be somebody who's smarter at arguing than you are, so I'm not going to take a position, or the idea of, well, if I have no views at all, I will be okay, so I'll just not have views. 
That doesn't count as the proper approach. 
So all of these things would come in that you hold onto these things, either to argue the point, or just for your own personal belief, or the belief that by holding onto this, I will become a better person, or that will make me better than other people. 
My first grade teacher was a Catholic, and my mother was head of the PTA that year when I was in first grade, and so the first grade teacher was also the principal of the school. 
It was a little tiny school. 
We had 63 kids and eight grades, a farm school. 
She would come home, she would come by our house every now and then on the way back from school, and talk to my mother about issues of the school. 
And one day after the meeting, my mother came to the dinner table and said, I just heard the strangest thing from your teacher, which is she thought that if being a Catholic didn't make you better than other people, what was it worth? And I must admit, even at grade six, I realized this is stupid. 
But there are people who hold onto things, their views, because they feel it makes them a better person, or if you hold onto this view, if you take Jesus Christ, you personally learn to stay with no doubts, you go to heaven, you know. 
All of this is holding on, this is clinging to views, and we suffer because of it. 
Okay, that's views. 
Habits and practices. 
As I said, this is not just rituals and it's not just precepts. 
Any habit that you hold onto would the belief either that if I do things a certain way, I'm guaranteed a road to heaven, or I'll just do things because I feel right doing it, you don't really look at the results carefully. 
The practices that the Buddha criticized and accounted included the belief that following brahmanical rituals would take you to heaven, that self-torture would take you to heaven. 
You've probably heard about the dog-duty ascetic, you know that one? Where the sky says, okay, if I really take on the mind of a dog and the behavior of a dog and everything, I will get to go to heaven. 
And he comes and he curls up on the ground right next to the Buddha, like a dog. 
And he has a friend who's a cow-duty ascetic who's been also practicing to have the mind of a cow and the habits of a cow. 
And so the cow-duty ascetic asked the Buddha about the dog-duty ascetic. 
Will this actually take him to heaven? He said, Buddha said, don't ask. 
You don't want to know. 
But the cow-duty ascetic keeps asking him again and again. 
So he says, look, if you develop the mind of a dog and the habit of a dog and the behavior of a dog, when you die, you will be reborn in the company of dogs. 
But the cow-duty, okay, the same thing, you develop the mind of a cow, the attitude of a cow, the behavior of a cow, you will likely be born in the company of cows. 
So these are wrong habits and practices. 
The two other examples, there was a professional soldier who had been told by his teachers, okay, if you die in battle, it will take you to heaven. 
You have to go to the heaven of heroes. 
And he says, what does the Buddha have to say about this? He says, don't ask. 
The Buddha had this habit of, okay, if he was about to deliver something unpleasant to someone like that, he needed to know that they really wanted to know, which in India meant that you had to ask it three times. 
That was a sign you were sincere. 
You really want to know something. 
Then he would answer. 
In this case, he said, no, you die while you're in battle and you're thinking, may these beings, maybe the enemy be destroyed, may they die, may the, you know, may alarm come to them. 
When you die, you're born in the hell of heroes rather than the heaven. 
The professional soldier breaks down and cries. 
The Buddha said, this is why I didn't want to answer. 
And the guy says, I'm not crying because what you said I'm crying because my teachers lied to me all this time. 
Another one was a professional actor who came and asked the same question. 
The Buddha said, don't ask. 
And finally, the answer was, you know, if you're up on the stage, you are giving rise to passion, aversion and delusion to yourself and you're trying to give rise to passion, delusion, aversion to your students, in your audience, excuse me. 
Instead of going to the heaven of laughter, you're going to go to the hell of laughter. 
In other words, they don't laugh with you. 
They laugh at you. 
This is one of the reasons why you don't see actors and actresses in Hollywood hanging around Theravada monks. 
So, these are the habits and practices that the Buddha criticized as you don't cling to these things. 
I thought you were laughing. 
Finally, doctrines of the self. 
Basically, identifying yourself anything as I am this. 
Say, this is myself, this is what I am. 
Which is not the same as having a sense of, just a simple sense of I am. 
We'll get to that distinction in a minute. 
Now, the self does not have to be permanent to count as a self. 
There are lots of examples in the Dikha Nagaya. 
Sometimes you see that the not-self teaching was formulated specifically in response to the Upanishadic view of the self. 
But that's assuming that there was only one view of the self in the Upanishads. 
Actually, I've been able to count nine in just 16 Upanishads. 
The Dikha Nagaya 15 has a particular way of dividing them up. 
There's the belief that there's a self that has form and is finite, a self that has form and is infinite, a self that has no form and is finite, and a self that has no form and is infinite. 
All of these count as definitions of self that you could have. 
Similarly, the self tends to be defined around the five aggregates. 
You either identify yourself, I am this aggregate. 
One thing I forgot to mention earlier is these aggregates are actually not things. 
They are activities. 
Your form is something that you keep creating your perception of form all the time. 
Feeling is something that you are doing, something you're doing. 
Perception is something you're doing. 
Fabrication you do. 
Consciousness you do. 
All of these things involve activities and you're clinging to these activities. 
You're going to either identify yourself as identical with the activity or as the owner of the activity. 
However, that owner might be defined. 
That you are in that activity or that activity is in you. 
For instance, you are in that activity. 
You might have the idea that this body belongs to me and I'm the little person inside that looks out the eyes that listens out the ears. 
That's you in the form. 
So you're not identifying yourself as the form, but you are in there someplace, running around, taking care of what's coming into the senses. 
Another vision you might have is, okay, I have this infinite sense of self and this body belongs to that, which would be the case, okay, the body of form is in consciousness or is in my infinite self. 
That too would also count as a form of self view. 
So we're not just limiting ourselves to saying the idea of a separate, unconnected self is the only type of self that Buddha is talking about. 
It could also be infinite self, a connected self. 
I am identical with the world. 
I am identical with everybody else here in the room. 
That also is a self view that can cause suffering. 
I mean, just think of all the people in the world that you don't want to be part of. 
Being interconnected is no solution to suffering. 
And as for the distinction between I am this or I am, there's a sutra where Venerable Chemica, who is a non-returner, is asked about the question, do you identify around any of the aggregates? And he says, no. 
And I say, well, in that case, you must be an Arahant. 
He says, no, I'm not an Arahant. 
I still have a lingering sense of I am, but I don't identify it with anything. 
And he compares it to the scent of basically what was used as detergent in those days. 
You wash a cloth with the detergent and then call. 
The dirt is now out of the cloth, but then the smell of the detergent is still in the cloth. 
So there was the me who was doing this cleaning up. 
And for a non-returner, there's still a sense of I am, but it's not identified with any of the aggregates. 
That's the distinction between conceit, which is I am, and doctrine of the self, which is I am this. 
So we're clinging to the doctrine of the self, I am this. 
So those are the five aggregates, those are the four forms of clinging. 
As I said earlier, our duty here is to comprehend it to the point where we gain dispassion for these things. 
Dispassion for the aggregates themselves, dispassion for the different ways that we cling. 
This is one of the big paradoxes of the Buddhist teachings. 
The things that we hold on to tightest are the ones that are causing us the most suffering. 
So this is what the path is going to have to do, is to give us something alternative to hold on to it while we're letting go of these things that we really like, that we really feel have a strong sense of identification around. 
So that is unskillful clinging. 
Any questions? Yes? Where's the mic? Yes, back that way. 
To beat them. 
Two questions maybe. 
Well, let me mix them together. 
So there's a lot of teachings out there nowadays about some of them related to Indian saints, Ramana Maharshi, that represent a lot of views about the true nature of self. 
I'm not this, I'm all of this, et cetera, et cetera. 
So from what you're saying, I see those all as views, self views. 
So maybe first question, so what's the remedy for that? How do I perceive those, in some cases, experiences? You mentioned Janas before. 
So I've had a Janic experience, no time, no space, no self, no person. 
I could look to that and say, well, that represents some kind of ultimate reality, and then cling to that as a view of ultimate reality, or of no self. 
How do we deal with those kinds of experiences? You ask yourself, when I was in that experience, what was I doing? If I really was unconditioned, you wouldn't be doing anything at all. 
But there's usually, especially if it's a Janic experience, there's something that the mind is doing. 
There's a perception you have to hold on to, there's a little bit of fabrication you have to hold on to, there's an intention you have to hold on to, you have to look for that. 
So when the mind gets into concentration, that's the Buddha's way of asking things. 
What level of reality have I tuned into as much as, what am I doing to maintain this experience? And what if there was nothing done and the experience happened? There was no intention. 
The question, even sometimes there's no intention, you slip into these things. 
But then to maintain them, there has to be an intention. 
What am I doing to maintain this? And you say, I don't see anything, then you just look again and again and again and again. 
So in terms of, you know, my being exposed to a lot of other teachings as well, it seems like, you know, repeated in a way, not this, not this, you know, resisting the idea of adopting a view of self or ultimate reality. 
Again, this gets back to looking at things in terms of the fornable truths. 
What am I doing? Is there any stress? So you mentioned as part of the view of determinism, one of the, which is an unskillful view, one of the aspects I think you said was a belief that things that you do now can have an effect on what happens to you later. 
No, it's that everything that you experience now is the result of a past action. 
That's the determinism. 
And so my question is, how is that different from karma? Karma is that you're also contributing to your experience right now through present karma, which does not necessarily have to be determined by past karma. 
Could I ask you to just repeat that? Okay, in other words, your present experience is composed of three things. 
Input coming in, the raw material coming in from your past karma. 
What your intentions are right now, the fabrications you're doing around that to create it into a coherent experience. 
And then the results of that present moment fabrication. 
And that present moment fabrication does not necessarily have to be influenced by your past karma. 
So just to be clear for myself, so the determinism idea is basically just like, if I touch this, I'll have good luck. 
The fact that I'm touching this right now is because of some past karma I did. 
I am not responsible for it right now. 
Okay, all right, I got you. 
Thanks. 
Question over here. 
Okay, just a quick question. 
We're waiting right here, right in front of you. 
I have a practical question. 
Maybe I don't know much about Buddhism, but you say, I still have trouble thinking of the term, you know, non-self or equal-less or whatever you call. 
So if so, I know that our physical body is made up of four elements. 
And when we leave the body, then we'll go back to where it was. 
But then what leaves the body when we die? And if you say that it's non-self, then who bears the karma of the past karma? Okay, the Buddha never says there is no self. 
He never says there is a self. 
Non-self? No, non-self means, is this me? You point to something, is this me, is that me? And the answer is no. 
But the question is, is there a self behind all this? Is there a self asking the question? Don't ask that question. 
Because that question gets you carried away from the practice. 
No, to nowhere. 
Okay, but what leaves the body when we die? Why is that the energy? Or something goes from one life to another? The Buddha has to look at the rebirth not so much as what leaves the body as, okay, what is it that causes you to have a new experience of a new becoming even when you leave the body? And think of it like going from one dream to another. 
What goes from the first dream to the second dream? It's not a question. 
Because you have the dream in the same place, the second dream comes in the same place. 
So the question is, what leaves here to go there? The question is, how do I, here, right here, right now, in this body, when the experience of this body goes away, what causes me to take on a new experience of a new body in a new place? And it would be your clinging, your craving. 
So that's what you look at, the activity of clinging and craving. 
So the Buddha never answers the question, what gets reborn? The question is, how does rebirth happen? And it happens through clinging and craving. 
So you had to adjust your mind to think in a different way. 
Question back here? Yes, thank you. 
I find your analogies, your metaphors, quite useful. 
Can you pass this mic back there? The chicken, the egg and the chef, or the goose, shaking its left leg at the window. 
When we find ourselves in those moments of clinging, and we're aware that we're clinging, shaking my left leg, what is your practice? Do you flow to gratitude for the fact that your left leg can shake? Do you look at the pan full of eggs and bless the chicken? Can you elaborate on. 
. 
. 
I look at myself shaking my leg and I say, am I really getting anything out of this? Yes, that's a good first step. 
And the question is, can I go up the stairs without shaking my leg? And if you're making the eggs, you say, yes I am. 
I'm making the eggs and the question is, am I getting any real nourishment out of these eggs? But look a little more carefully at the eggs that I'm putting in the pan. 
Did I get the right things out of the chicken? Depends on what I fed the chicken. 
Well, not only that, but I mean chickens, no matter what you feed them, create chicken shit. 
Are you getting chicken shit out of the chicken and trying to cook that? And how are you cooking it? Are you cooking it well or not well? Okay, thank you. 
What did you think of that? There's a question back here. 
Ajahn, thanks for being here. 
Very nice talk. 
Question, more general question. 
How can we bridge this fundamental divide between the knowledge of the modern science, cosmology, physics, geology, etc. 
, etc. 
and all the knowledge that comes from the Buddha, they seem to be incompatible. 
The story that science tells us about the origin of the universe, the structure of the systems like solar system, the structure of the future of the earth and solar system. 
Why this knowledge? We cannot find it in the Buddha's teaching. 
It seems that modern science doesn't speak at all about all these extra realms, planes of reality, all these beings like devas and asuras, etc. 
But at the same time, Buddha doesn't talk about what modern science talks about. 
So how real is what Buddha says? Okay, well, they're talking about different things, looking at things from different perspectives. 
What science is looking at is when they're talking about you, they're talking about what they can measure about you from the outside. 
What your heart rate is, what your breathing rate is, what your past history is, what your genetic history is, that kind of stuff. 
They can talk about that. 
But the experience of what is it like for you to be sitting right there right now, they can't describe. 
And also, I don't know of any scientific equipment that can measure devas. 
The presence or absence. 
A lot of things they just can't talk about. 
What the Buddha is talking about is when you go inside and you look at how you experience your body from the inside, how you experience your mind from the inside, and he explores that. 
And this is one of the reasons why he takes suffering as his big issue, because that's the big issue inside. 
Now take for example, you know that old question, how do we know that when you see blue and I see blue, our blue is the same? We don't know, right? There's this divide. 
That is not really that serious an issue. 
But your issue is about your suffering. 
How do we stop that? How do you stop that? And science can't tell you. 
Because they can't even measure your suffering to begin with. 
They can't detect it. 
They can detect the brain waves and other things that they interpret as corresponding to your suffering. 
But the actual suffering itself, they can't get it out and look at it. 
So the Buddha is talking, they're talking, looking at experience from different perspectives entirely. 
So these planes of reality, are they objective? At the same time, like Milky Way is objective? What makes something objective is that two different people with the same instruments can see the same things. 
And so our problem here in the West is we don't have many people who have developed psychic powers out of meditation so they can confirm one another's experiences. 
When I was trained in time, there was a lot of that. 
Different people separately would detect the same thing going on on one of these other levels of reality. 
But then my question is if by doing meditation and going deep inside and developing this extra sensory knowledge we can know about other planes of reality but we still cannot explain how this universe comes about the way science explains. 
Do we need to? If you can solve the cause of suffering, then you're free to solve any other problem you want. 
It's a question of priorities, right? Thank you. 
Question over here? Again, not to belabor the point but about the doctrines of self, I think there was a monk that asked the Buddha who's suffering, who's death, and the Buddha said not a valid question and they went back through the whole chain of dependent origination. 
But yet it's said that the Buddha felt compassion and taught out of compassion. 
So for whom does the Buddha feel compassion? The Buddha taught three levels of right view. 
There's mundane right view, there's transcendent right view, and then there's the ultimate right view where everything is just arising and passing away as suffering and you let go of it all. 
And different questions get answered in different levels. 
And the question you just asked is a mundane right view question. 
The Buddha is not saying there is nobody there. 
It's just that if you're trying to put it into suffering then you switch your mode of thinking. 
And once you've solved that problem then you start thinking about, okay, who out there can I help? Then you realize, okay, there are people out there to be helped. 
That was the realization he had. 
So the question is not, we create our senses of selves and we create this process of going on and we are suffering, so there's the suffering there. 
Just speaking of that. 
Just a quick question following up on the suffering. 
So what's your advice with a skillful approach for people who have chronicle pains, either physical or mental pains, because easily the world around people with pains will be around how to deal with pains. 
Is this real, pain killer or not, and all these things. 
So what's your advice on that? Okay, we could talk for a whole day on that one. 
Basically dealing with physical pain first is one learning the extent to which you are making yourself suffer around the pain. 
And it's less the actual physical sensation of the pain that's making you suffer and it's more the way the mind is talking to itself. 
The perceptions you have, i. 
e. 
fabrications, perceptions around the pain, that's what's causing you to suffer. 
So we focus on that. 
Now if a person has got so much pain they can't even learn how to get the mind into concentration, you say, okay, take some pain killer, take the edge off the pain, give yourself a space where you can get the mind into concentration. 
And then as your concentration develops and you can start using it to analyze what does the mind do around the pain, taking that raw material from its past karma and creating present suffering around it. 
So take care of the fabrication first and then deal with the raw materials. 
Well, sometimes, again, sometimes you have to say, let's lessen the pain a bit so you can get some time to get some space to concentrate. 
But my teacher had a couple of students who had cancer and in each case they learned how to deal with the pain of the cancer without having to have the pain killer by looking at the way they were fabricating extra stress around the pain. 
Because you have to see there's a difference between the pain of fabrication, the pain of just physical events and suffering in the Four Noble Truths, the suffering in the Four Noble Truths comes from clinging. 
That's the suffering that weighs on the mind. 
When that suffering is not there, physical pain does not weigh on the mind. 
You have to learn how to make that distinction. 
Thank you. 
So along the lines of what the woman was saying back there about the goose and shaking the leg, so many of our responses are conditioned not only from our early childhood experiences as you said and even from previous generations of experience. 
So what is it that actually helps us to uncondition that so that we're not either shaking the leg? What is it? Is it the meditation? Is it the contemplating of these things? What helps to liberate us from these things? It's a combination of one, giving yourself new activities to hold on to. 
That's what virtue is. 
Give yourself a meditation, you know, concentration practice so you can have an alternative sense of well-being that doesn't have to depend on shaking your leg. 
And then finally saying, hey, they're shaking my leg. 
This is going to be nowhere. 
It's a waste of time. 
Why should I continue? And as long as you have, you need, well, it's like any addiction. 
I mean, clinging is addiction, basically. 
And so one, you have to see that this is stressful. 
Secondly, that you have an alternative. 
And part of the alternative means learning new skills so that you get a different idea of yourself that you are capable of doing the alternative. 
And give yourself an alternative source of pleasure. 
So you can say, oh, I don't really need that old form of pleasure. 
I've got something better. 
Yeah. 
Thank you. 
I think part of my question was what she has already asked. 
But yeah, what I originally intended to ask was once you have identified your clinging, you have recognized it, you have comprehended it through meditation. 
And you have tried the cold turkey approach and it's not working. 
You tried the witch approach? I mean, stop the addiction. 
Stop the craving. 
And that doesn't work. 
So basically a progressive process to acquire new activities. 
You have to acquire new activities. 
It is an hour to hour. 
It's a minute to minute basis. 
Once you have identified it and you can clearly see that's happening. 
Try to say that, okay, I'm the one who was doing it. 
I'm not going to go ahead and do it and you do cold turkey. 
I mean, you stop everything. 
But that doesn't work because your past keeps on, you know. 
Well, there's the part of the mind that wants instant gratification. 
Yeah. 
And for that, this is one of the reasons why we try to develop our powers of concentration so that just by breathing, you can feel better. 
You see, look, I've got this alternative activity. 
I can do this instead of doing the other activity. 
I was going to get on to later in the day, but I might as well do it now. 
As the Buddha says, there are five steps to overcoming a clinging. 
The first one is seeing it arise. 
And when it arises, seeing what's causing it to arise, what comes along with it? The second step is seeing it pass away. 
Realizing that some of these urges we have, they just say, I'm going to stay here until you give in to me. 
But then you realize, no, they come and they go, they come and they go. 
Does that put you a little bit above them? And then you can look at, well, what's the allure? Why do I like this? And sometimes it's the hardest thing to see because many of the things we like, we hide from ourselves. 
Or we misunderstand, as I said earlier in the morning, we don't understand the location of the craving. 
Where exactly is the craving focused? But you have to look at, what do I think I'm getting out of this? But if it's not tangible, if it is just an impulse, if it is at intellectual level. 
Yeah, exactly. 
That's where you want to see it. 
There's something in my mind that thinks that by giving into this activity, I will get this pleasure or I'll gain something from it. 
That's the allure. 
Because sensual you can clearly see and you can stop it, you can reduce it. 
But intellectual is you're clinging to a view, an idea, a concept of yourself. 
And then it comes back to tell you that, oh, you are not, it's like your whole value system may fall in front of your eyes. 
So, you know, going ahead and identifying, stopping, breathing, and moving ahead from there. 
Yeah, you said, well, I'm holding onto this identity of myself. 
Is this actually making me suffer or not? And if this identity is making me suffer, why do I hold on? You have to find where's the allure? What do I find attractive about that identity? Like some people find the identity of a victim as being really, really attractive. 
They get to blame all their problems and everybody else. 
But they're miserable. 
But if you say, I'm not the victim, I'm actually an agent in causing myself suffering. 
They don't like that because, gosh, I'm irresponsible now. 
But there has to be a shift in the perspective. 
If I can take responsibility for this, I can get past it. 
So you want to see the drawbacks and you want to see the allure. 
And you want to see that, okay, the drawbacks way outlay the allure. 
But you have to see precisely where the allure is before you can pull it out. 
So you find courage and, you know, involvement in other activities to give you more strength, more, you know, that you can do this. 
So you can pacify that part of you that you are bigger, bigger than that part. 
And you have the courage to become what you want to become through the new process. 
Thank you. 
Ajahn, this clinging we talked about. 
We first of all, you described it in terms of the five clinging aggregates. 
There's also the four types of clinging. 
So are the four types of clinging present in all of the five aggregates? You could do that as an intellectual exercise sometime. 
To what extent am I clinging to my form through sensuality? To what extent am I clinging to my form through habits and practices? I've got the body that can do all these neat calculations for Apple and, you know. 
. 
. 
I see. 
And then, okay, your views about the world, how do they revolve around your form? How does your sense of self revolve around the form? Then you do the same thing for feelings, perceptions, fabrications, consciousness. 
I see. 
Now you find that maybe there may be some missing elements in that table. 
That gives you an idea, okay, where do I actually identify myself? What am I really clinging to? Okay. 
One more question. 
This five-agricate model also seems to be. 
. 
. 
Because we talked about feeding. 
It seems to be similar to another thing that the Buddha talked about, where consciousness has got food. 
He talks about four different types of food for consciousness. 
Form, feeling. 
Form. 
But then he talks about contact. 
Oh, there's physical food, contact. 
Yes, contact. 
Consciousness itself, and then what was the other one? Oh, intellectual intention. 
Intellectual intention. 
So there seems to be some overlap, but slightly different terms. 
So can you. 
. 
. 
Well, I think the Buddha created these different ways of analyzing it to see, okay, whatever you find works for your understanding of how your own consciousness works. 
That's what you apply. 
But it's ultimately the same thing he's saying. 
This is the consciousness that is feeding on all these things. 
Right. 
And that's the reason why we are reborn. 
I want to know you personally. 
When you are going to do something, so you decide you're going to translate a book. 
And so then, are you becoming this book? You're in the realm of becoming. 
So I want to. 
. 
. 
As an example, I want to hear how you. 
. 
. 
Become. 
Yeah, and how you go through these experiences. 
Are you an example of right clinging and craving? Well, I hope I'm a right example. 
And then how do you do that? Okay, let's see. 
I have the desire to translate something from Thai, okay, from one of the Ajahn's. 
And I think about the consequences of doing this. 
I'll give you a very precise example. 
I was in Thailand last December, and I went to see the Supreme Patriarch. 
Now, I've known him since for 20 years now. 
He's a really nice guy. 
And so I went to see him, and he gave me a book. 
He had been a student of Ajahn Phan, who was a student of Ajahn Man, back when he was a young monk. 
And so someone had printed for him some of Ajahn Phan's Dharma talks, plus English translations. 
Now, there's a phrase I have in Thailand that you do. 
. 
. 
Something looks like it was done by somebody's foot. 
In other words, they really didn't do a good job at all. 
It was some of those God-awful translations you could imagine. 
Now, I thought to myself, I could very easily redo those translations. 
Now, the danger is, if you'd redo those translations, maybe the Supreme Patriarch decides he wants you to do more translations. 
Do you really want to get involved in that? And if you would like to do the translations but not get involved, is there some way that you can figure out that you can basically say no afterwards? I mean, one of the best things I learned in Thailand was how you say no to power. 
You have to do it very subtly. 
I'll give you some examples in a minute. 
In this particular case, I find a figure out how I could actually beg off any later translations. 
One question is, when do I have the time? When do I have the energy? Is it going to be worth it? So, I went through and I read the talks and I was just like, this would be worth it. 
It would really be worth the effort to go into it. 
That's that value judgment. 
Is this worth the effort? Maybe you decide, okay, I'll take that on. 
All of a sudden, that means I have to take my identity as a translator. 
And my reputation as a translator, I want to do a good job. 
That's the becoming that comes around that. 
And of course, there's the anticipation, the result, will that be a good result? Is it worth the effort that goes into it? And I decide, yes, it would be worth the effort. 
That's why I went ahead and did it. 
So, that's the becoming that comes around that. 
Now, there's a great story from Berlioz, do you know Berlioz, the composer? Yes. 
Apparently, he had a dream one night where he'd composed a symphony in A minor. 
And he even had the key, the rhythm, it was a 2-4 first movement. 
And the themes and everything, it was all came out in the dream. 
He woke up and he said, you know, I could write this down. 
But then, good Lord, it would be another five months of my life to make it into the actual symphony. 
Is it worth it? He said, no, it's not worth it. 
And so, the next night, the dream came back again. 
Same symphony over again. 
And he woke up and he said, I really got to say no this time. 
I just can't do this. 
So, we don't have that symphony by A minor from Berlioz, you know. 
And it depends on whether you like or don't like Berlioz, whether it was worth it or not. 
But that's the kind of thing you do. 
Is it worth the effort? Thank you. 
In terms of saying no to power, I have a couple of good stories. 
You know, you don't just say no to the king, say, when the king makes a request. 
You have to figure out some good reason to say no. 
And there was a case where the king came to Ajahn Mahabhu and said, I'd like to build an ordination hall for your monastery. 
Building an ordination hall? That's a meritorious act. 
How can you say no to a king who wants to do a meritorious act? Ajahn Mahabhu said, I run a meditation monastery. 
And if I get monks coming from other places and they don't follow my teachings, I can always send them back to the preceptor where they were ordained. 
If I ordained people here, I would have no place to send them. 
And the king backed off. 
Ajahn Sawat went back to Thailand one time. 
And he was invited to the palace for the king's birthday. 
And this is after Ajahn Sawat had been in Thailand, in America many years. 
And the king said, why do you keep going back to America if Westerners want to come and if Westerners want to study the Dharma with you, they can fly to Thailand. 
They don't have to be there for them. 
And Ajahn Sawat said, I'm not there for the Westerners. 
I'm there for the Thai people who don't have anyone to depend on. 
Beautiful answer. 
The king just backed off. 
If we had more people learning how to say no that way, the world would be a much better place. 
I had to go in to see the Supreme Beater, the old one, because my visa required that I had to get his signature every year. 
And there was one time I actually got to meet him. 
Usually I just kind of passed it in and came past out. 
But one time I actually met him. 
So he called me into his dwelling and we started talking. 
And he could see that my Thai was pretty good. 
And he said, would you translate some of my books for me? And I told him, you know, I still haven't finished with Ajahn Lee. 
Okay, no, no. 
So, question back here. 
Ajahn, you talked about the clinging to views, sorry, self-views. 
And you specifically talked about this idea that, you know, there is a self within the body or self-inform as an example. 
But it seems like when we are meditating, we are kind of doing that as a training. 
We kind of maybe, or at least partly, we kind of center ourselves in a particular location in the body and we think of the breath energy coming there and spreading it out. 
So it seems like we kind of maybe training ourselves to do that. 
This would be a great segue for the next section of the discussion. 
The selves that you take on as a practitioner. 
But we have other questions. 
You said there were five steps in overcoming craving. 
Could you quickly review them again? Okay, seeing it arise. 
And not just arising, seeing the origination, what causes it to arise. 
And then noticing it when it passes away. 
The third one is seeing the allure. 
Why do you like this? The fourth one is seeing the drawbacks. 
If I go for this, what trouble does it entail? And the fifth one is after you've compared the allure with the drawbacks, you realize, I don't really want this anymore and that's called dispassion. 
That's the fifth step. 
For example, suppose you have anger. 
Now part of your anger says, okay, if you don't go away, I'm going to make your, as I say in Thailand, I'm going to squeeze your nerves until you can't stand it anymore and then you're going to have to give in. 
But then you ask yourself, is the anger really as consistent as it claims to be? And then you begin to notice, if you watch your mind carefully, well, the anger comes and then you lose interest after a while. 
But then the hormones in your body have been churned up. 
You say, well, you must still be angry, so pick it up again. 
Rather than saying, well, this is just the left over hormone discharge that came with the original burst of anger. 
But as part of you that likes the anger, oh, here's another excuse to pick it up again. 
So that's the allure. 
What is it you like about the anger? And then, but then you see, wait a minute, okay, what I like about the anger is the perception I have of myself as being more powerful when I'm angry or whatever. 
I get things done when I'm angry. 
But the way you get things done is like the kind of person who, was it Facebook that said, move fast and break things? Which of the internet companies had that as their? It's Facebook. 
What? Facebook. 
Facebook, okay. 
Move fast and break things. 
Do you want to be the kind of person who moves fast and breaks things or do you want something a little bit more skillful about how you get things done? Which gives you the kind of the motivation to say, I want to get past this anger. 
Until you finally develop full dispassion for it. 
I said, I don't really need this. 
And dispassion is the feeling that comes, I don't need to feed on this anymore. 
I just don't need even to, since I'm not going to feed on this food anymore, I don't even need to fix it. 
That's dispassion. 
So I want to ask you a little bit more about how do you make the value judgments if it's worth it or not. 
So my sense is that of course there is an obvious answer of things that is good for yourself and good for others. 
But I wonder if there's more to that. 
Well, the question is sometimes you just have to look at how much energy that this is taking. 
And how many other things do I have on my plate? Can I add one more thing to my plate and still get all the other things done? What's going to get delayed if I take on this particular task? Do I have the energy? Do I have the time? When it's done, will I feel that it was worth it? Yeah, but about that particular part of like, how do you think is, how do you value whether it's worth it or not? In terms of what kind of value you're like. 
. 
. 
Depends on your priorities. 
Yeah, and what is important for you in particular? My? Yeah. 
I want to train good monks. 
That's the top priority right now. 
Okay. 
Thank you. 
Okay, one more question before we stop for the break. 
Okay, we can stop for a break. 
Okay, we'll come back at three o'clock.
