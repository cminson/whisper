Practice Note : Enjoyment and Presence

This idea of being  present, of being mindful for what is  
actually happening in the present moment , without 
judging it, without react ing to it, without being for or  
against – to just be present – is something I’ve found to 
be very useful. In doing this , with time , there came  an 
inner stability or steadi ness wher e I could be non -
reactively present in a steady, stable way , even with a 
wide range of things churning t hrough me or happening 
around me .  
 
After doing  this for a while , I learned that there’s a lot 
going  on in the present moment. And there’s a sense 
that out of al l the different things happening in the 
present moment, the mind will select out what  it thinks is 
important to focus on . We don’t tend to think that we 
have intention or choice s in that selection process . But 
there are time s when I’ve sat with a lot of sounds 
around me , and haven’t noticed them at all  – they just 
weren’t  part of my selection process. At other times , the 
same so unds will be what the selection process picks  
out, pulls up, and makes a big deal out of. I learned  to 
see the sele ction process in what I’m  present for.  
 Sometimes physic al discomfort can be prominent, but 
sometimes the same physical discomfort has no pull in 
the selection process  operating  in the background. 
There are  a lot of dif ferent things going on: sounds , 
sensa tions in the body , feelings , thoughts , and moods  – 
a whole wide  range of things . It’s okay to be  a little bit  
involved in that selection process . But you don’t have to 
necessarily go along with whatever selection your mind 
happens to make . In fact, that’s  what you  do when you  
focus on the breath. O ut of the whole range of things 
you could pay attention to in the moment , you focus on 
the breath , because  the breath is stabilizing, centering, 
and helps you  stay in the present moment. I t’s a nice 
anchor to the  present moment so that you don’t wander 
off. 
 
There are some other simple c hoices you can make in 
the selection process that can help you to be  more 
concentr ated, more in the present. One way  is to give 
some choi ce to noticing that  part of your unfolding 
practice  that is pleasant and enjoyable . Look  for the 
pleasure in the practice.  
 
When I was a new Buddhist practitioner , I thought that 
you were n’t supposed to enjoy yourself. In Zen, you 
were sup posed to just be there. T he idea of feeling 
pleasure seemed a little bit besides the point of just 
being present in a non -reactive, free,  and non-attached 
way. But pleasure is a normal part of life , and is also something  that s upports concentration and  a sense of 
well-being.  
 
So as you st ay present fo r the breathing, for the present 
moment,  notice that part of you r experience which is 
enjoyable.  This is not at the expense of pushing away or 
resisting what is uncomfortable , pretending it’s no t 
there , or trying to override , or deny it . We’re supposed 
to be realistic and present to see what’s going on ; but if 
there is some enjoyment, even a small percentage of 
the whole experience, it’s fine to take tha t in, and 
choose to include it . Then the mind wants  to be present . 
It has an easier time being present  if the experience is 
enjoyable  – and the mind i s going to want to be there.  
 
You don’t want to  be too active ly attached to success in 
this, but when you are sitting down and getting  into the 
meditation , look ar ound and see where  in your 
meditative experience  there  is something enj oyable, 
pleasant or comfortable.  Is there pleasure in the 
experience? Is there pleasure in the breathing? Is there 
pleasure in just sitting still? Is there pleasure in not 
being  caught up in all the different activities of daily life , 
running around taking care of things ? There’s a whole 
range of things that can be enjoyable in the present 
moment if we scan around . When we feel that 
enjoyment, feel that  pleasure, then there is a simple, 
relaxed way  to include that pleasure and that 
enjoyment, as part of the gestalt ( part of the whole ) of what’s happening in the present moment . Then being 
present becomes  welcoming and desirable .  
  
If your fantasies are more pleasant than your imme diate 
experience , then the mind will go off in the fantasies 
more easily. Hopefully you can  find some simple 
pleasure, some innocent enjoym ent. It doesn’t have to 
be bells and whistles  – just something  simple  and 
relaxing that helps you.  
 
As you go about your sitting and  walking  practice today, 
you might consider  whether there is some enjoyment or 
pleasure or sense of well -being that’s here . Then, is 
there some way you can use t hat to help you be more 
present? Not to use it so that your mind drifts o ff more in 
thought  and starts fantasizing . For example, if you stand 
in the sun, feel the warmth and  start th inking of going to 
Hawaii, that doesn’t help you be present; but if you can 
go out in the sun, feel the warmth , and this connects 
with your body so  that you feel more grounded , then it 
supports the practice.
