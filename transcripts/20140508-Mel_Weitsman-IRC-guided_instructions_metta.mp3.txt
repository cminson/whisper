Well, today, this morning, now, I'm going to lead you, us, in a meta-meditation.
I'm sure that many of you have done meditation before. I think so. So, I'm going to tell you how we do this, and I'll talk as we go along.
There are various ways that this is done, but I'm just going to do it the way that I know and have done in the past.
This is a meditation where we extend love, some people say loving kindness, but love, to various people, classifications of people, myself, someone that is a stranger,
and then to someone who I know very well, and then to someone that I dislike. I don't want to say hate, but that's good.
Someone that you really have aversion to, and then that can be extended to your community, it can be extended to your country, it can be extended to the world,
it can be extended to the universe, and you can keep doing this and add infinity to them. But I'll stop short. I won't go too long.
The first person that we extend this to is ourselves, because if we can't extend love to ourselves, then it's pretty hard to extend it to others.
So what we're extending is actually our own sincerity, but it's difficult for some people. The hardest one is for yourself.
Do I love myself? Well, we have to understand what we mean by love. Love is the one word that's used in so many different ways that it almost loses its meaning.
The love that we're talking about is disinterested love. Disinterested means no strings attached. You don't do it for any particular reason.
You don't expect anything. It's just simply how you connect with the universe. Love is what connects everything to the universe. Love is what connects everything to everything.
So you can say, I am filled with love. I think that's a good way to say it. You can say it any way you like, but as a suggestion, you can say I am filled with love.
And then just do that for a while, and then you extend that to somebody that you don't know. It could be somebody in this room, because you don't know everybody in this room.
And you can extend love to that person. But I'll guide you through it.
I thought of an alternative. You could say, I am filled with light. You can say I am filled with radiant light. I like that one.
And I wish you to be filled with radiant light and extend that to everyone. So that's the one I'm going to try. But you can do whichever you like.
So you can close your eyes or keep them open.
I haven't thought of whether you should say this or not, but I'll just say it. So just think or not think.
Just extend love or light. I am filled with.
You don't even have to say I am or anything like that. You can just say love or light.
And just let it fill you.
Just allow the light to radiate out.
From your center.
Just allow the love to radiate out from your center.
What we give is what we receive.
Now think of someone who you don't know.
Maybe in this room. And extend that love or that light to that person.
May you be filled with love. May you be filled with light.
Now extend this love or this light to someone you do know.
May you be filled with love. May you be filled with light.
Now extend this love or this light to someone you do not want to extend it to.
May you be filled with love. May you be filled with light.
At the same time be aware of your breathing.
Now extend this to.
Your whole community. May you be filled with love. May you be filled with light.
With each breath, let it permeate the whole community in all directions.
Like a ring or a drop or a pebble dropped in calm water and let the ripples flow out with your breath.
And now extend to the whole world.
May you be filled with love. May you be filled with light.
And let the ripples flow out in all directions from your center.
And then may all beings be happy.
And then may all beings be happy and live in safety.
That's it.
Now we can sit.
Now we can sit.
Now we can sit.
Now we can sit.
Now we can sit.
Now we can sit.
Now we can sit.
Now we can sit.
Now we can sit.
Can you say a word about when or how you use this practice?
Kindness goes along with it, but I think that's a given.
Now I think that Thich Nhat Hanh says kindness attached to love is a kind of qualification so that you don't mistake it for sex or some other reason meaning, but it's okay to say love.
And I agree with them. I've always agreed with that.
But it's okay to say loving kindness. It's just that it feels better to me to just say love because it's okay if you understand what it's a higher meaning.
I just realized this is the only practice I do, although I don't call it anything.
I don't send out love so much, but I always feel like light is, when I sit, I don't think about light, but I feel that light is being transmitted.
Koban Chino gave a nice little talk one time about we are all vehicles of light, vehicles for light.
Light is, we allow the light to pass through us and into the world, whatever that means to you.
Light is one of the most important aspects of Mahayana Buddhism.
When you look at how Mahayana is being expressed, it's always being expressed as light.
Mahayana Sutras have a distinct quality of being grandiose and imaginative, but they're always talking about light.
So light is another term for emptiness, Buddha nature, existence, nonexistence. Everything is light.
I just have a natural affinity for that.
I sometimes think with my breath that waves of light are being emanated from Mahara.
That's just my mode. I don't have to think about whether I'm meditating or not. That's just a mode of being, but it's natural. It's not something stuck on.
It's just a natural way to be.
Allow yourself to be a vehicle for light. We're all a vehicle for something. We're a vehicle for anger. We're a vehicle for hate. We're a vehicle for self-interest.
We're like a transmitter. We receive and we digest and then we transmit. What are we transmitting? What are we putting into the world?
What are we broadcasting? Everybody's broadcasting something. I think the purpose of Dharma and Sangha is harmony. How do we allow harmony to manifest?
I don't say create harmony, although we can do that, but how do we allow it to manifest? Nature is always working harmoniously even when it's destructive.
But destruction is part of rejuvenation. Without destruction, there's no rejuvenation. Death gives birth to life. To follow that harmony and go along with it is important.
But we also have something to add, not add, but help. How do we allow harmony to arise in the world?
When we practice with Sangha, that's what we're doing, allowing how do we get along together? How do we work together so that it's like a dance, a wonderful dance that we do?
We're always dancing around each other. There are confusing dances and harmonious dances. Dancing is important. Music is important. Creating harmony and just being with each other.
Anyway, I'll talk about that tomorrow when I'm supposed to give a talk about wisdom. Do you have any other questions? Yes, yes.
So the formal, loving-kindness practice that you gave to us is the same practice that you always do? Is that what you're saying?
I just do it all the time, without thinking about this. It's just my mode.
But I've done that. I've led the formula. And I sometimes give that to people. It's always been one of my favorite things.
I give it to people sometimes when they're angry and they can't get along with other people. So I say, well, try this. Sometimes it works, but mostly it doesn't.
Can you tell me about this question? I'm curious how you see the loving-kindness practice fitting into Zazen practice.
Zazen is loving-kindness.
I really appreciate the way that you presented the first portion of loving ourselves, because that's something that I really struggle with. I find the rest of it does just come naturally.
That's the hardest part.
The way that you presented it as not something to do, but as you were saying before, it's just something to acknowledge and let it be instead of you trying to make something happen.
It's just recognizing what was already there.
Yes. You can't add anything. Let what's already there come up and don't interfere with it. You don't even say me.
This is what meditation, for me, that's what meditation practice is. Zazen is just allowing yourself to be a vehicle, or just called emptiness.
You're just empty, and you allow light or love to permeate the world without trying, and without thinking too well of yourself, just well enough.
The word humility, to me, means just being yourself. You don't think too much of yourself, and you don't think too little of yourself.
People think humility means to retreat into yourself, and I'm not so good. No. It means just know yourself.
You don't think too little of yourself. You acknowledge what you can do and who you are, and you don't think too much of yourself.
You don't extend, expand your ego. So this is who I am. I'm okay. Even though I'm not okay, I'm okay.
Everything has its opposite. Whatever you say, the opposite is also there. So how do you put this together?
This is my out of Buddhism. How do you clue the opposite? We have the koan mu. Does the dog have the Buddha nature?
Someone asked from Joshu, does the dog have the Buddha? Everybody knows. If everything has Buddha nature, does the dog have Buddha nature too?
Meaning mu, meaning no. No. But I thought everybody had Buddha nature. How come the dog doesn't?
Then someone else asked him, does the dog have Buddha nature? He said, yes, of course. Which is it? Yes or no?
That's the koan. I'm going to give you the answer. The answer is that you have to include the opposite.
Yes has to include no. No has to include yes. And that boggles our mind.
I think I'm done. Just a short announcement. So at the beginning of the retreat, we requested for people not to take a shower every day.
But what we really meant was take a short shower every day. If that's your practice usually to take a daily shower, please go ahead and do that.
Don't luxuriate. Don't luxuriate, but no. Thank you.
Thank you.
