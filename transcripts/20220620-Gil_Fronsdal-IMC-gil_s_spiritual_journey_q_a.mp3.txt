The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So good evening everyone. Is this volume okay for everyone? Is this good? So I
didn't know I was supposed to be here today. Somehow the scheduling happened
in such a way that I didn't know. And then I see someone texted me 20
minutes ago and said that I looked at the schedule and sure enough, there I
am. So I'm happy to be here. But I think that we're going to have to do this
together. I don't have a talk to give. Not anything that maybe you want to hear.
So at the moment, so there's a few things we could do. One is you could just
say the classic thing is you could ask questions. I was home with my wife just
now and I said, oh, there's no one to be there and I'm scheduled to be there. And
what do I do? And she said, well, you can just go do questions. And then I said,
okay, I'll go. And so we could do that. Or I can ask you questions. But that might
be scary. So what would you like to do? Or you have other options. But that's
those are two I can think of. Sorry. Questions. Okay, let's see if you have any
questions and I'll do my best to respond or ask a question in return. Maybe we
can maybe pass out the mic. Be ready with it for someone. Test test. Always have
lots of questions. Very new to all of this. Sorry. I'm new to all of this. But one
question lately has been, what is the role of fun? The role of fun, having fun.
Oh, fun. Just fun, pleasure. How do we work that into improving? Yeah, that's a
good question. I think the fun. Some people find this practice to be quite
fun. Believe it or not, I don't think I associated with fun. But the greatest
happiness, the greatest joy that I've ever had in life in a long sustained way
is through this practice. I've been on retreat for months. And it was
kind of like nonstop joy, just kind of ecstasy. So it was not fun. You know, I
don't know if that's exactly fun. But it was kind of unsurpassable kind of joy.
It was wonderful. So that can happen that way. This morning I had a
conversation with someone about grief in this practice, you know, in
Buddhism. Is there a place for grief? Because in the ancient texts, it seems
like there's no real place for grief. Grief is something to overcome. And
there's no mention of fun. There's a little bit of mention of play. But there's
not much enough fun either. So does that mean that this is like a really
flat tradition? And the only thing you're allowed to do is sit and close your eyes
and be quiet, you know, and just deal with it. Or is there fun? Is there grief?
What are the range of things a human person can do? And so now speaking
for myself, rather than for Buddhism, is that I'm not that interested. I'm not
looking to Buddhism to tell me how I'm supposed to be. I'm looking at Buddhism
to inspire me to look deeply at what is happening to me. So if I have, having fun,
I don't have any idea that I, Buddhist, should have fun or should not have fun.
I'm just having fun. And then the practice of mindfulness is for me to look
at that as I'm doing it. And there's a ways in which I'm attached to some
things, a ways in which something unwholesome or unhealthy is coming out
in that fun. And if it is, then I'd like to stop that. But if it's not, then I'd
like to keep doing it. I don't see any reason not to. Fun is fun. So the same
thing with grief. If I feel grief, I don't really care whether the
ancient tradition has no room for grief. It's just supposed to really matter,
just overcome it and not have it. And it's a complicated question what the
ancient tradition really says and what it means. And scholars are looking
into this, try to tease apart. Because we're talking about a language that
no one speaks anymore from 2,500 years ago. And to understand exactly what these
kind of crucial questions are played out is a topic. But I'm not so
interested, even with grief or anger or anything, to judge it automatically as
should or shouldn't be that way. If I'm having it, then it's real. And if it's
real, I want to see it. I want to know it more deeply. I want to see what's going
on. And I want to see if there's something unwholesome unhealthy in the way
that I'm engaged in it. Am I attached? Am I clinging to something? And if I'm
clinging to something, then for me it is, I'd rather not. But if I'm not clinging,
whether it's fun or grief or whatever it might be, if I'm not causing any harm to
myself or others, then I'm fine with it. So that's not answering your question
directly. But it's offering you a Buddhist principle which is be mindful
when you're having fun and see what it's like, see what's going on. So it's
probably not a satisfying answer. But if you want to ask again, maybe you
want to say why you're asking it. I think at the center of it is that question of
I should or shouldn't. And behavior based off of let me have this clear cut, I
should do this or I should do that. But I think your answer to me kind of says
that there isn't a this or that, that it's an investigation of each thing. And
just again, that mindfulness approach of when I recognize what I'm calling fun,
what's there? Is there attachment? Is it something, is it behavior that is moving
towards what I want to be? Or is it behavior that's moving towards something
else? Right, yes. I think you understood what I had to say. So should and
shouldn'ts are not as interesting as looking deeply. And if you look deeply,
then you maybe have an answer to whether you should or shouldn't. You know, if you
see that it's causing harm to you, maybe then you shouldn't do it. Or it's
causing harm to others, maybe you shouldn't do it. But you don't start with
that premise. You start with investigation. Great. Thank you. Yes, if you could.
Hi. And if you could say your name, I'd love to know. I'm Teresa. Teresa.
Triva. Teresa. Teresa, Teresa. Yeah, it's hard with the masks and everything. My hearing is
not so good. So we could turn it up a little bit because my hearing is, is a
little hard. Also when swimming, it's an FD thing. And so I think there's a little
bit of water in there. So, so I've been on a journey. So I have been meditating for
maybe like three years now. But still like, and I noticed there's been like, like
phases in my psychology. And like, kind of like, observing myself and seeing how I
react to things. And anyway, I'm still, I'm still kind of going through phases. And
I was kind of curious since you're taking questions. In your journey, in this
practice of mindfulness, have you kind of been through a similar journey of like
the evolution of your psyche? Like going from like, like right now I'm observing
my tendencies. And then now I'm like watching myself in action and trying to
observe those actions. And then I noticed I've been kind of just like
shifting in my perception. And then it influences my actions. But anyway, I'm
still like kind of in the mix of it all. Wonderful. And I was actually really
curious for somebody who's been practicing for longer and deeper and kind
of way more, you know, progressed. I was curious if there was like, like a
progression or like some sort of like phases or like trends of like observation.
Yeah. And then like, and then, and then where did you end up? I mean, I'm sure
that's still a journey. But like, like now when you practice, do you, are you just
kind of going back to center and like, do you, like, do you feel like you're going
to different states of consciousness where, I mean, Samadhi is like kind of like,
you know, like a bit huge thing. But I'm just kind of curious, like how that, like
how has evolved and gone towards that. Wonderful. Yeah. So the, I love, I love
very much the metaphor of journeys, of journeying, the unfolding, the evolution
of practice. And, and I find that the stories that people tell or the
teachings that kind of lay out a arc of practice inspiring to me. And yes, I've
had all kinds of journeys, arcs, phases in my practice. I probably wouldn't have
worded the way you worded yours, but that's, it's always going to be personal. So
I was delighted to hear the things that you were mentioning. And so what I can
affirm for you is yes, there are phases. And what you describe is are good phases
to go through. And there's a lot more. There's some more that are more classic
for Buddhism. And some which are very personal, not, you know, that aren't
really part of it. I wouldn't say they're not part of Buddhism, but they're not
really classically discussed or something. But one of the, one of the
interesting things to the shifts over time that makes an interesting study is
how does your interest shift over time? How do your, your perception shift over
time? How does what you tend to notice in yourself in the environment shift over
time? How does your motivation shift over time? And these all will unfold and
change. And sometimes intentionally so it's like this is what we want to see
the change and we move towards it. Sometimes, you know, it's a surprise how
we change. But if you do this practice, you will change. So is that, you can
welcome to ask more, more specifically, because I'm not sure I touched exactly
what you wanted to say. Yeah, I guess I was curious if there were like, like, what
are the arcs? And I guess we don't have to sit here listening to like the whole
scripture. But like, was there like very striking, like, clear, like, like where did
it take you on your journey? And how did that help you evolve?
The like, you know, I've been doing this for almost 50 years. So there's been a
lot, I could cover a lot over this time, it's still unfolding. The, the, when I was
a beginner, I started it was introduced to meditation at first. And it was kind of
nice for me. And it wasn't Buddhist meditation, but it was, it was nice to
do. And then it was in college. And then I had summer vacation. And then I'd stop
meditating. And then later, about nine months later, I was introduced to
Buddhist meditation, to Zen meditation. And I wasn't really caught by the
meditation, but I was interested in the and some of the teachings that I read
about. And, and then it took a little, I got serious about doing it. But I felt
like, so I was ready to really give myself over to Zen practice. But I didn't
feel like it was the right phase in my life for it, to give myself over to it
in a big way. And so I felt like I had to take care of loose ends in my life. I
was 21, 20 or 21. And, and so one of the loose ends was, I'm from Norway. And I
had, I didn't grow up a lot in Norway, but I had this uncertain relationship.
And so I thought before I, you know, I need to go back and resolve my
relationship to the country and what, you know, where I should live and things
like that. So I went back to Norway for a year. And, and then eventually I came
back to the United States to continue college. And, and I was suffering. And I
had this idea that if I meditated, started Zen meditation, it would help me
deal with the suffering I had. So I started meditating every day, twice a
day. And, and something shifted for me after a few months of meditating. And
then as I discovered, I was meditating for no reason. And I'm kind of a
rational guy. And so it was kind of strange for me to not have a reason to
do what I did, but I was going to do it anyway. There was no question about it.
There was, you know, there was something in me that was motivated, but it didn't
know why. Why am I doing this? You're doing it. And, and so I thought about it
for a while. And I came up with the two things I kind of began to realize was
happening to me. One was that, that I wasn't doing meditation for a reason
any more than a, than a musician plays music for a reason or a dancer dances
or an artist paints. It's a kind of an expression in the moment. And not, you
know, and it's not so much to get through the music as fast as you can. It's to
express something in the music or the dance or something. So I thought, yeah,
I'm not doing it for a reason, but it's a form of, it was the fullest kind of
self-expression I discovered and I knew. And that was so meaningful for me. And as
that became clear, then I, I felt what I was experiencing was integrity. And
later I realized, I don't think I meant moral integrity, ethical integrity. I
think what I meant back when I was 21 or something, I sense a wholeness I was
developing that hadn't had before. And, and that sense of wholeness then
changed my trajectory of my life. And so first I had it in meditation and that
was really nice. And then I discovered that then I had this question, well,
Gil, the line between meditation and daily life is an arbitrary line. Why do
you only be this way in meditation? So I, I said, I wanted, I want to be able to
do this whole, this integrity thing in the rest of my life as well. And, and so
that's when I, that's the reason I moved to live at a Buddhist center. And so I
lived there, I lived at the San Francisco Zen Center for many number of years. And,
and in this quest to kind of be more integrated with this wholeness, be able
to live it in my, my everyday life. Paradoxically, I kept going, I went deeper
and deeper into the monastic life, more and more meditation. But it wasn't
exactly, I wanted to meditate more yet. I just wanted to somehow expand into my
life. And then, but in the process of all that, there was, there's all these phases,
right? So in the process of all that, I began seeing my psychology, my neurosis,
the, the social games I played. And it became more and more obvious, you know,
this kind of the oddities, the foibles of my mind. And I really was motivated to
then work with them. And like in the monastery, one of them that I saw
painfully was how much I wanted people to like me. And I was doing the social
gymnastics to get everyone to like me. And I was the manager of the kitchen,
managing a kitchen crew. And that's like the last place you want to be if you
need to have people like you. And so it was really hard. And so it was exhausting.
And, and after I, you know, and one of the ways wisdom works is get wise. If you do
something long enough to see the suffering of it. So I saw the suffering of
wanting people to like me. And how it was just, it was overrated. And so, and then
because I was meditating a lot, it was a very interesting juxtaposition between
seeing the suffering of this psychological complex of wanting people
to like me. And feeling I was, I was ready to let go of it. But I go and
meditate. And meditation, I have this feeling of wholeness and goodness and
deep, deep, deep satisfying feeling of just being alive, kind of. And so that
going back and forth between that, between this radical alternative to
wanting people to like me. And there was kind of like a reconditioning me.
Whatever conditioning I had growing up that, that was difficult, that led me to
want to, everyone to like me. In meditation, that was being reconditioned by
this. Something was changing and shifting from me. And anyway, so I know that I
could, I could go on all night for 50 years and tell you, but that's what
comes to mind, that kind of beginning years of the thing. So is that relatable
for you? Yes, very much. Thank you so much. But it's definitely a good journey.
It's definitely a wonderful thing to go through their phases. And yeah, that's
what I said. It's one of the greatest things in my life is to have done, doing
this practice and, you know, where it's taken me and brought me and things I've
discovered and got to see. And it's, you know, it's been the greatest thing. Thank
you. So this is kind of actually a segue. I think that will move on from
Teresa's question. I actually happened to be listening to a Dharma talk that
Norman Fisher gave at Green Gold today while I was walking my dog. And he started
talking about you. And he was saying that he was talking about how you received
Dharma transmission in Zen, but now you're a Vipassana teacher. And as someone
who kind of has like a foot in both camps myself, I'm kind of curious about what
made you ultimately kind of make this commitment to be a Vipassana teacher
rather than a Zen teacher. Oh, because of all you students. Clearly, all the people
who came to practice and were coming, wanting to get Vipassana teachings from
me. And they were so sincere practitioners. And it was so clear that how good it
was to be, that has big to be a lot to do with it. And my idea of as, you know, we
can, I came to go to Sanford in 1990. And I was also being trained to be Vipassana
teacher then. And I was still doing Zen training. And there was a small sitting
group in Palo Alto. And I was asked to take it over and be kind of a teacher for
it. And that group grew and grew. And my plan was at some point it was growing.
And I said, okay, I think the plan is to, I want to grow it big enough so that I
can invite another teacher. And I can leave. I wanted to live in the country,
someplace. And, but then, you know, I've been here 32 years, so I haven't left yet.
And so it was, but at some point it became clear through about seven years that I
wasn't going anywhere because I felt a commitment to the people who were here
and practicing. And, and so we had a meeting where I wanted, I wanted them to
know that I was making a commitment to be, to be a teacher for the group. But I
didn't have any expectations or, you know, requests. I just wanted them to know
that's what I was making this big life change, life decision. So at that meeting,
I said that, and then somehow the meeting kind of quickly unfolded to it. We
should get a center. And so then we started this process to buy this place.
It took about five years to do it. So that's not your question. The question is,
oh, the Zen Vipassana thing. Well, Norman Fisher, he has a dual allegiance to, you
know, did he, did he confess in that talk? Oh, he did not. Oh, I hope he's listening on
YouTube. He's deeply immersed in Judaism. And I don't know exactly what
its connection to Judaism, but I think he's very deeply connected in his heart.
And his best friend for, until he died, was a rabbi. And so, so this idea of, you
know, having, being in two traditions is, there's lots of room for that in, in
Buddhism. So to be more specific to your question, I never made a, in the early
years of doing this, I didn't make a definitive decision to, I loved Zen. I
had no, I really had no trouble with it. I felt very at home in it. I was ordained
as a Zen priest. And, and it worked really well for me. But then we had a, back in the
1980s, there was a whole slew of Buddhist teachers who had ethical challenges to
say it politely. And, and there was the Abbot of San Francisco Zen Center. It was
one of those. And so when he kind of was, that happened, that kind of freed me up
from Zen Center to go, and I went to Japan to practice in Japan. And, but while
I was in Japan, I, oh, and when I've got my airplane ticket to go to Japan, I knew
I had to leave Japan after some months to get a new visa. And I discovered that
that for $25 more, I can get a, then it would cost a round-trip ticket from
San Francisco to Japan. I could get a round-trip ticket to Bangkok with free
stopovers in Japan, in both ways. And so I knew I had to leave Japan to get the
visa, new visa. I thought that's really cheap, $25 to go get an outcome. And so,
and so I got a round-trip ticket to Bangkok. So after being in Japan for about
three months, I, you know, working in monasteries there, and I flew to Bangkok,
and, and, and I, and I knew that I was, I was, I was a Zen priest then, and I was
beginning to have conversations with people who had meditation experiences I
hadn't had. And if, I don't, I didn't feel like I needed to have them, but as
people coming to talk to me, I felt I needed to know the map of practice. And I
knew that in Thailand, the map of practice was in some ways much more
clearly laid out than they ever do in Zen. So I said, I'll go to, I'll just, while
I'm waiting for my visa, I'll go visit different monasteries and talk to the
teachers and find out that map. But then I decided when I got there, no, I'm just
going to go to one monastery and just say I'm here, tell me what to do. And so I
had a little address for a dog patch, little meditation monastery on the
edges of Bangkok. Dog patch means kind of archaic and pigs running around and all
kinds of interesting things going on. And I set up and the guy said, the teacher
said, okay, here's a little hut, hut for you to live in. And all day long, you just
do sitting meditation and walk meditation and come and talk to me in the
morning. And it's okay. So I was happy to do that. And so I was waiting for the
visa to come. And it took me 10 weeks to realize, you know, the visa is not
coming. And then I realized I could go back to Japan now and I'll get another
six months under, you know, without a visa or something so I can, you know, to
finish my year there. But those 10 weeks, it was like a 10 week retreat. And I'd
never sat in silence that long. The most I'd sat in Zen is seven days. So to do it
for 10 weeks was a, and I got more concentrated than I ever been before. And
I touched something inside that I'd never touched before. And it became
essential to touch that again. And it was kind of a, when I left, there was kind of
a dark night of the soul time. I went back to the United States. But all I can
think about was go back because I didn't know anywhere else to touch that place
again, except through that practice. And so as quickly as I could, I worked in a
restaurant, a fast food restaurant for a while there in the money. And when I had
the money, I went back. And this time I knew that the meditation practice I had
studied in Thailand came from Burma. So I decided to go up to the headquarters,
the source. But I hadn't, I wasn't leaving Zen. It was just like, it was just accidentally
discovered, accidentally set a 10 week retreat. It made an impression on me that
changed me. I had no choice but to continue with it. So I did. And that
was next retreat was eight months long. And that made a huge impact on me. It was
a life changing event for me. And then I came back to Zen Center. And actually, I
didn't come back. What happened was in those eight months, I hope I'm not
boring you. It's okay. The story is like this. So at San Francisco Zen Center is
where I practiced. But when I was on the eighth month retreat, I got really, really
quiet and deep and still, it was really, you know, and then I would still have
these little thoughts. And I had thoughts about Zen Center and positions in Zen
Center and advancement in Zen Center, this teacher at Zen Center. And you know,
it was all these Zen Center intrigue kind of thoughts. And I said, Gil, what in the
world out of the world did Zen Center get into the depth of your psyche? And I
made a vow, I'm not going to go back to Zen Center until I have Zen Center out of
my mind. So I went back, came back to us from Burma. And I wasn't planning to be
back at Zen Center, but I had a girlfriend. And she really wanted to live
at, she was, she had psychological challenges of, and so she really wanted
to live at Zen Center. And so I went back to Zen Center to live with her. And then
I stayed for another year, year and a half. And then I went, and then I was
ready to go back and continue with the Vipassana practice. And so I went to the
three month retreat at IMS. But by that time, they wanted me to be a shusso, the
head monk at Tasahara. It's kind of like a rite of passage for just in the
cusp of being a Zen teacher. And I mean, I didn't have anything going, you know. I
wasn't like I was at a career. It wasn't like I was had ambitions, you know, I
just wanted to practice. And so I was delighted to go back and be this head
monk. And then it felt enough. I'd done 10 years of intensive practice, monastic
practice. So then I thought I need to figure out, I'm not, it doesn't make
sense to go back to Zen Center. It makes sense now to find, but what am I going to
do? I'm a Zen priest. I'm dedicated to the Dharma. That's what I want my life to
be about. And how do I make a living? What am I going to do? And so I decided I
would get a master's in religious studies, specializing in Buddhism, so that I
could teach in a community college, like an intro class to Buddhism. So I went to
get a master's. And while I was there, Jack Cornfield called me up. And I hardly
knew him. I'd met him once, talked to him on the phone once. And he invited me
into his teacher training. And then I had this very strange, very, can you
can't hear? This, that did sound change somehow? Is it in the better now? So I
was a remarkable experience that Jack Cornfield invited me to be in
teacher training. I was standing, kind of looking out a window. And it was like, I
felt this click, click, click, like the pieces of the puzzle of my life came
together. It's like, wow. So of course I said yes. I mean, who wouldn't say yes to
that, to study with Jack to be a teacher like that? I wasn't really thinking so
much that I would be a teacher maybe. I don't know what I was thinking, but I
just like, just, oh, this is right. And then I came back to the Bay Area and was
it living at Zen Center and studying with Jack? And so I was always in and
out. It wasn't like I chose one or the other. And then I started studying to
get Dharma transmission from Mel Weitzman, my Zen teacher. And he knew I
was being trained to be a Vipassana teacher. And then at some point I got this
this, it's called Dharma transmission authorization to be a Zen teacher. But
usually the understanding is when you get this Dharma transmission in Zen, you're
kind of responsible to pass the lineage on to the next person, like pass it down.
But Mel gave me Dharma transmission and he said to me, because I'm giving this
to you with no expectation. You have this other path that I trust you, I trust
what you're doing, and you do what you see is fit. And then so I wasn't
living at Zen Center anymore. And being outside of Zen Center, they didn't
really invite me back to teach much. I had something to do with them, but the
Vipassana world invited me to do a lot of teaching. And so I entered into it. And I
studied it a lot and studied the teachings, the early teachings of the Buddha.
And I felt a strong affinity to it. And right now I feel a strong affinity to
these early teachings more than I do to the Zen teachings. And so what I say
to what I said to myself or say to people is that in a kind of way, Zen is my
religion and Theravada or Vipassana is my practice. Is that kind of different?
However, I'm not very interested in religion. I'm interested in the practice.
And this is the practice tradition. I'm really practicing it now. But I love
Zen and I'm very grateful for it. And I stay connected to Zen Center. And my
gratitude for Zen Center is really great. So I have this commitment. If they ask me
for something, I say yes. I try to say yes. So does that tell you kind of the
convoluted story of my connection between the two? Yeah, I've been so curious. So
that was really interesting. Super nosy. Very satisfying. Thank you. Someone else
said something over here? I kind of answered it. Okay.
Go ahead with the mic, though, because my poor hearing. So you said you want
swimming earlier. Can you hold it up? Yeah. You said you want swimming earlier?
Yeah. What's your relationship and connection to swimming and meditation?
What do you see in the overlaps of those? Oh, I know there's people who are
swimmers who feel like that's what they do. They meditate. They get concentrated.
They get absorbed. And just really right there with the swimming. I'm not a
swimmer like that. I just swim because I enjoy swimming and I like the exercise.
And I have a year and a half ago I got cataract surgery. And so now I can, for
the first time in like 50 years or more, I can see when I'm in the water. Because
I don't need glasses. And it's so wonderful to swim now in this lake up
here that is outdoors in the lake. And I just like look around at the trees. And
they have green herons sometimes there. And they have ducks. And I swim sometimes.
It depends how I swim. If I'm crawling, I look around. It's so nice. And then I do
breaststroke. I look around my crawl. I don't look. So I just swim. And with this
mindfulness practice that I do, it's kind of done it so long that it's second
nature for me. So no matter what I'm doing, I'm being attentive to what's
happening with me. But I'm not using swimming as a means of concentration or
getting quiet. Those are all great states. But the primary thing I'm
interested in these days, in terms of phases, I've had so many wonderful
states of mind and concentration states and all kinds of things. And they're
great. But that's not the point. The point is not to suffer. It's to be, and to
be, just to have some feeling of freedom. To be able to kind of have that
freedom as a current, as a thread that goes through everything we do. And so
I'm swimming. And one of the primary practices I do, whatever I'm doing,
including swimming, could be summarized by a simple question. Am I
suffering? And if I am, then I stop and take a good look at that, that I practice
with that. But if I'm not suffering, if I'm having fun, I'll just continue doing
what I'm doing. And I think, I think swimming is fun. Is that, how's that
quite answer for you? I mean, every answer so far has been amazing, so I can't
complain. Great. Maybe if we have one more, maybe time for one more question, if
anyone would like to ask, or comment, or you want to ask? Or you have a question
from chat. Great. Can we have the mic back so that maybe Svetlana can read it?
So we have a question from Robin. I have a question. Could you speak about
setting intentions at the start of your meditation practice? Can I speak about
using intention at the start of meditation? Setting intention. Setting intention at
start of meditation practice. Yeah, it's, some people, I've done it, and it's, some
people find it tremendously helpful to be conscious about the intentions that
you live by. One of the questions, one of the ways I've understood, I learned, one
things I learned from Zen practice, is that to be investigating, considering,
what is my deepest intentions? And it was one year that, yeah, anyway, what's the
deepest intention you want to live your life by? Don't take your life for granted.
Kind of reflect on what's the deepest heart-wish, or the deepest thing that you
want to do, and so this deep intention. So to live that intentionally, maybe, why
not follow your deepest intention? Are you scared? Are you, do you have some kind
of ambition or greed for something else? Or what about your deepest intention? I
think it's one of the greatest resources we have. And I trust it very much. If
you, I keep asking questions, what is in there? Is there something deeper than that?
Is there something deeper than that? And I spent a whole year asking that
question every day. And it was phenomenal, useful to do that. And there were phases
that I went through asking that question, asking that question every day. And so
as we get in touch with some intentions that are important for us, then it's
interesting at the beginning of meditation to remind oneself of that
intention, and then maybe make that the context for why you're practicing. So,
you know, or it could be the deepest intention is the way to reach it is
through becoming more concentrated, or becoming more mindful, or more clear. And
so to set an intention at the beginning of a meditation is a little bit like
setting a direction for yourself. But there's many ways of doing it, but the
way that I found it most useful is to set the intention at the beginning, and
then don't think about it again. And it works a little bit like it sets the mood,
sets the kind of general container for what we're doing. And so it's kind of
like rather than going along merrily and whatever motivations you were living
your day by. And there's a much bigger shift than to really be here
intentionally to practice. But also it works a little bit like some people
have the experience of going to sleep at night and saying to themselves I'm
going to wake up at 5 a.m. and without an alarm clock and boom at 5 a.m. they
wake up. And so there's something about setting an intention going to sleep. The
intention kind of can survive and live and be expressed somehow in the
subconscious, you know, that kind of offline because we're sleeping. So
sometimes setting an intention in meditation can be the same thing you
said it. You set the direction, the course you're going. And then you don't
think about it anymore, trusting that something has been set in place in the
deep conscious parts of the mind. And then sometimes you'll be surprised about
how it kind of there to support you or guide you or open new things up. So I
think it's a fun thing to do to practice with intention. But you don't want to
get busy with it. You don't want to have too high expectations of what it can do
for you. But it's a wonderful thing to do. So I hope that was okay. So it's just
about nine o'clock. So thank you. And thank you for accommodating me and not
coming with a talk. Maybe this was probably nicer. It was nice for me. So
thank you for coming. And we're going to probably change the, for July, change
the protocol for coming into the sittings here Monday. So it'll be posted.
I think you'll all probably get an email. You're probably all registered
writing at the email. So you'll be notified about the change. It'll be
easier to come. And now you probably will stop doing this sign up. So it'll
change and it'll stay in July. We'll get to July. So thank you very much.
