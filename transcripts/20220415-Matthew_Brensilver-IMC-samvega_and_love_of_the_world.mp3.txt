The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So I've appreciated being with you this week and I thank you for welcoming me as
the substitute. I know kind of develop relationship when there's a teacher who
holds a group down. You get wedded to that in ways that's very meaningful and
supportive and so when the new person comes in or something that's a little
jarring and so I'm appreciative of your generosity and welcoming me and I hope
that some something I've said has ignited some measure of curiosity in
your own mind or sort of like looking looking and of course if I've said
anything that's trespassed on your heart or I ask your your understanding.
So disciple asked the Buddha, tell me dear sir how you crossed over the flood. I
crossed over the flood without pushing forward without staying in place but how
dear sir did you cross over the flood without pushing forward without staying
in place? The Buddha replies, when I pushed forward I was world about when I
stayed in place I sang and so I crossed over the flood without pushing forward
without staying in place. Neither pushing forward nor staying in place what
does that mean? What doesn't it have to be one of those right? Some openness to a
parent paradox and it calls to mind another kind of feels fundamental to me
parent paradox namely disenchantment with the world and care for the world.
The Buddhist path begins with a kind of recognition of the vulnerability of the
human condition of aging sickness death and generally that is construed as a
problem to be solved you know as a kind of condition to be exited aging
sickness death and a lot of the sutras are something like get me out of here you
know that is a real trope in the tradition get me out of here like aging
sickness death separated from what is beloved joined with what is disliked
this is too much and so we can understand get me out of here and modern
interpretations of insight practice often it's kind of celebrate that
vulnerability and it's associated duty to care yeah because of the intensity of
this realm this realm of samsara there is this duty to care to serve and I feel
where we're really in the very early phases of extrapolating a lay path from
a monastic tradition and that will require innovation you know that will
require innovation in what ways I as a layperson am imitating monastic life or
doing something a little different and I do sometimes think of myself I'm just
like a deeply lazy defiled self-indulgent monk you know that would
be one way of construing my life the most inspiring but it's like okay what is
what is a lay path you know like that deeply honors this monastic lineage lay
life is often about redeeming samsara in one way or another redeeming it and
monastic life is about renouncing samsara and can a kind of disenchantment
with samsara and a love of the human condition can these coexist can they
fit together we don't grow much on this path unless there's some measure of
renunciation of renouncing the world of some Vega of spiritual urgency and
disenchantment this is a tennis aerobic who on some Vega some Vega was what the
young Prince Siddhartha felt on his first exposure aging sickness and death
it's a hard word to translate because it covers such a complex range at least
three clusters of feelings at once the oppressive sense of shock dismay and
alienation that comes with realizing the futility and meaninglessness of life as
it's normally lived a chastening sense of our own complacency and foolishness in
having let ourselves live so blindly an anxious sense of urgency and trying to
find a way out of the meaningless cycle Buddhism is not only confident that it
can handle the feelings of some Vega but it's one of the few religions that
actively cultivates them to a radical extent its solutions to the problems of
life demand so much dedicated effort that only strong some Vega will keep the
practicing Buddhists from slipping back into their old ways
we we can we can live our life sort of mesmerized by some sorrow from cradle to
grave mesmerized by the sticks and carrots of samsara and we can be kind
of perpetually seduced into fixing and achieving and becoming and acquiring
and owning and then it's time to die and everything is broken nothing can be fixed
nothing is owned
Ajahn Sajita said the hardest question for the human is what's enough because you
can always want more and so this movement of the heart this disenchantment we
we've become very conscious of the ways that this realm cannot bring deep
happiness that samsara cannot bring deep happiness we don't seek our redemption
in certain places we are not trying to build a refuge out of pleasure we give
up trying to build houses on quicksand we give up trying to make a home out of
our identities we practice diligently and make choices accordingly and in a way
we do get nauseated by samsara disenchanted by samsara and we fall in
love with sentient beings in a way one only wants to escape samsara the the
Buddha you know these like beautiful lineage of monastic practice they only
wanted to escape samsara because they cared so deeply about suffering that's
what prompted this kind of movement of the heart like get me out of here that's
a function of our care our care about suffering
ziggur control Rinpoche says you cannot stop having deep love and care for
sentient beings if you really want to suffer no longer within your own
self-centered emotions secretly you have to fall in love with sentient beings so
this is this is the middle path between everything means everything and nothing
means anything the middle path between everything means everything nothing
means anything when everything means everything you just can't stop caring
giving worrying can't justify even a moment of rest when nothing means
anything love dissolves and all goodness is at risk and so we we kind of
loosen our grip on samsara we loosen our grip on the world but this actually
dramatizes the plight of sentient beings dramatizes the plight of humanity and
maybe it's like we we get we get space through our letting go right but as said
like nature abhors a vacuum we get space through our letting go and then that
space is filled with care with love and we know that we will never perfect
samsara samsara will will not be perfected but yeah this this this little
patch of suffering I want to do something about that
it's kind of like what you know what else are we gonna do
Ria Khan said oh that my monks robe were wide enough to gather up all the
suffering people in this floating world and we know the rope will never be wide
enough but oh that it were so
so so thank you yeah I appreciate the chance to
now to talk about these things with you and it occurs to me that you know as I've
been theme of this week of kind of one factor balancing another factor I need
to be balanced by another factor and that is why Gil is coming back yeah so
so thank you thank you all thanks for your attention and good will and your
practice and yeah okay just open the chats and yeah yeah okay thank you
thanks thanks all yeah good to be with you
