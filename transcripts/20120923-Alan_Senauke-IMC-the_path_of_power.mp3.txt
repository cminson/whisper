The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org.
I'm happy to be back here.
I was thinking, I can't remember
various venues that I've been to for
IMC. I remember one
that was sort of up in the hills. Is that right?
This is going back over a long
period of time. And so every
year or two I end up here and every time I'm here
the group is larger. Do you have
is your retreat center functioning yet?
Wow, wow. That's great.
I'm sure that absorbs a lot of energy
but it will also give back a lot of energy.
It's really, it's terrific. I look forward to seeing it.
I was thinking
in the course of this week
I had
lunch with a friend, a woman by the name
of Miki Kashtan, who
teaches what it's sort of a
modality of peacemaking called nonviolent communication.
Have people heard of that?
And we had lunch because she had recently been
to India
and working with
Dalit or ex-untouchable
mostly Buddhists. And
I wanted to know something about her experience
because I've been going there for the last four or five years
working with some of the same
people. Mostly I've been
I have a circle of friends there
in Maharashtra
mostly in Mumbai, Pune
and Nagpur
and I've written about this actually. There's a long piece in
my book, the Bodhisattvas Embrace
and I brought some copies of that if you would like to purchase one
up by the donation box.
And mostly what
I've been doing for the last number of years after having
some experience of
some of the breadth of that community
and the sincerity of their practice
I've been going to a school called
Nagaloka or the Nagarjuna Training Institute
in Nagpur which is a
it's a kind of one year
they have a one year program for
young people from
all over India from 22, 23 states
and they're all, they're kind of about the age of my own
children so they're in the slot of about
18 to 23 or 24
and what they learn is
essentially the core of it is they learn meditation.
This is not something that's been available
to them, Buddhist meditation
even though their families are
consider themselves Buddhists but they're very few teachers
so they go to Nagaloka and then
twice a day they meditate much
as we were just doing. It's sitting meditation
it focuses
to the core practices are
mindfulness, Satipatana
which is something you all practice right
you're instructed in and also
loving kindness and these young
people are taught
the methods of these practices
and they're also taught how to lead them
and so every morning when I get up
and I go to the meditation hall
there are two of them, there's a men's hall and a women's hall
it's sometimes advisable
to keep really young people
in a separate practice so that the
hormones interfere less
effectively than they might otherwise do.
So I go to the men's practice and it's led by these
young guys who are
learning to present themselves to speak
so along with meditation they're taught
basic Buddhism and they're also given
some overview of
social thought and some methods
of social organizing so that
they can go back to their areas which are mostly
rural and be of use
first of all be of use by just setting up
meditation groups and also to
do relief and social projects where that's called for
so I've been supporting students there
and now as this is
about its 10th year
students who have graduated from this program
some of them have gone on to university
or to other kinds of professional training
but they're putting their energy back into their communities
and so I've been trying to support some of those projects
anyhow this is a long preamble
talking with my friend Mickey
very quickly we came
to looking at the question
of power
and power is a word I think that makes
me and some of us
squirm that it's like
just to talk about power it's very un-Buddhist
and yet
there's nothing in our lives
that's apart from
power in a very real sense
so her definition she has a very
clear and broad definition that
is useful as we were talking
and that definition is
power is
the capacity to mobilize resources
to meet needs
very straightforward the capacity to mobilize
resources to meet needs
of course
those of us with
certain kinds of critical minds
might ask what are resources and what are needs
and that can go on endlessly but
if I lift my left arm
that's a manifestation of power
to all of the resources that have been brought
to bear on this simple action I'm well aware
that there are physical and neurological
resources that enable me
to meet the need which I feel
for whatever reason to
raise my arm at this moment now I will meet the need of putting it down
because it's getting tired
so
mostly when we think about
power
we're thinking about
what one might identify as
external needs we're thinking of
power to somehow
control our environment
so in that case money is power
education is power
the ability to
own and drive a car
is power
we tend to think that our health is power our strength
then we can think about our position in
society which manifests a certain kind of power or lack
of it
what Mickey was talking about
and I think this is somewhat at the core of her work and I think
it points to what's
brilliant about the work of my friends in
India is that they're
very clearly identifying
that aside from these
external dimensions of power
what they're offering to these young people
will come from circumstances where they feel
relatively powerless is the first thing
and the simplest thing to give them is
what we might if we were going to make an artificial distinction
call internal power
and as I was thinking about that so that's the
it's the
power of spiritual practice the power of meditation
it's also the power for better and worse of our beliefs
and our ideologies
but
there's a very interesting
way of reckoning with this in
my tradition in the Japanese Buddhist tradition
which points to
the kind of
impossibility of distinguishing between internal and external
so in Japanese Buddhism there are schools of Buddhism
that are considered self-power
schools
Zen is nominally a self-power
school in other words
you know and
I'm powering myself I've got this engine
revving up inside and then
the other school which is actually larger
that you may know of well it's called
it's called
other power and
so the pure land schools of Buddhism
are considered other power where
it's about
acknowledging
that everything that we experience in life is a gift
they would say from the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas
and that all you do is you just
kind of surrender and align yourself
with that gift
there's a little
problem in the middle of that which has to do with
those words
surrender or align yourself who is doing that
so really
to me there's this distinction of self-power
and other power is not useful
if we went around
the room
every one of you got to this
room
morning you got here
weeks or years ago and
I don't think there's very many of you
who were born into a culture of meditation
and mysteriously you got here
you had to use your own feet
and your car or the bus or train
to literally get here
and then you had to sit down
and settle your mind
this is all
the self-power side perhaps
but the great mystery is
how on earth did you get here what drew us here
all the time what was it when I was in high school reading
Chinese or Japanese poetry that resonated
with me and why when I heard about
Zen and Buddhism did I think
I had to do it
and to have the
I could do it
this is in a sense I think of this as
the manifestation of other power something beyond
my understanding for which I am just grateful
so anyway
what I wanted to talk about a little bit is just thinking of
basic Buddhism
basic Buddhism has
this manifestation of power
so if you think of the four noble truths
the first is calls for
the power of discernment just to see that our lives are marked
with suffering
because we have an ability to
look into ourselves to mobilize that resource
and to analyze we get to the second noble truth
which is the cause of suffering
and that's variously described
as clinging
attachment
it's or desire
but it's
there are a lot of different manifestations to it but
you could also define it as
my wife tells me all the time
you're suffering because you want things to be different from how they are
and as much as I want to
argue with her she wins that argument every time
so we
have this power of discernment that's a resource
it's a mental resource that we bring to bear
the third noble truth is that
there is a way to be free
there is a way to be awake
and the fourth noble truth gives us
which is the noble truth of the eight fold path
gives us a whole map
and whole set of practices
it gives you
a variety of resources
that you can mobilize to meet
of simply waking up
so
you could call this
a path of power or a path to power
and I don't want to push this notion of power too much
but
this morning I've never spoken of it before and this morning I'm just sort of playing
with it to explore
so that's
the four noble truths is one thing that
I would say
it's one of two things that Buddhists of every
stripe can agree on
the other dimension
the other principle that I think is
essential to what we call Buddhism
would be
the three treasures or the three gems
and the
ability to take refuge in them so that's to take refuge
in Buddha, take refuge in Dharma
and take refuge in Sangha
and that's when people talk about
becoming Buddhists
in some acknowledged or
formal way usually there's
some process of taking refuge
in
refuge
means
I'm not sure that that's actually an accurate translation of what
the word originally was in
Sanskrit but I think it's
relatively close and here it means to flee
again
but it actually means return
to return to what was
originally ours
the original wholeness
of our life
so here it's broken down into three
aspects, three sets of resources
and three ways that we
embody what we're being taught
so
you could call
the Buddha treasure
generally when we think of religion we think of
these figures like Buddha's
or whatever as external but
really I've been taught and I suspect you have as well
to think of Buddha as
my own enlightened nature
in the Zen tradition
there's tremendous amount of literature
and poetry that boils down
to the fact that this very body
is Buddha
and that each being
is a manifestation
of Buddha so to take refuge
in Buddha is to return
to what Suzuki Roshi called
one's true self or one's big self
something that is already there
and is covered up or
obscured to us so in order to manifest power
the resources that we bring to bear
are just removing that covering
it's simple it's not
having to develop
you know, yogic strengths and
the ability to sit here cross-legged for
umpteen hours straight it's actually just
to remove
this covering that prevents us from seeing ourselves
that's powerful
the second treasure is the
Dharma treasure and I think of the Dharma treasure as
Dharma is sometimes
translated as the teachings or
it's the law it's the way things are
it's kind of like gravity
that's a Dharma treasure you know the way things are is
what goes up comes down
that's Dharma
but also Dharma is what goes down sooner or later comes up too
so it's the ability
as we are as it's the
more precise
mechanism of our practice
as a resource so
one as Buddha's we sit down
once we sit down
we have to do something
and what we are doing is
in one way or another
investigating the flow of our
body mind whether we're looking at
our body in a very minute and
careful way whether we're looking at
thought after thought breath
after breath watching how
a feeling arises and passes away
it's investigating
the self in one fashion or another and when we
investigate the self we see the self works
according to
certain basic rules rules of
impermanence rules of interdependence
and we understand
as we investigate this more widely that
actually everything that we encounter works that way
the whole universe
and also every person
sitting around us every person in the
wide span of
beings people we know
people we don't know
and that working
is the expression of the dharma and of course it leads naturally
to the third treasure which is the
Sangha treasure. Sangha has
various definitions
in the early
Pali teachings the Buddha
spoke of the four fold Sangha and there
he was using Sangha as community
of practitioners and he spoke of
the monks, nuns, laymen
laywomen in certain cultures
that's the Sangha is used
in a more technical way and quite
restrictive I'm afraid as basically
monks. The nuns are somehow
they're like in a different class
and the laymen and laywomen their job
is to make sure that the monks have food
and if they do this very well
then they can be reborn as a monk
good luck to you all
I don't think that's necessarily what the Buddha had in mind
here we are
essentially laypeople
we are all practicing we're being
Buddha's practicing the dharma in community
and it's one of the things that I love about coming here
is that even though we don't know each other
I'm not here that frequently when I come here
I see familiar faces
just as I do when I practice at Berkeley Zen Center
you are creating Sangha
which means in various ways
learning to support yourselves
by supporting each other so you are
mobilizing the resources of your humanity
to express
just the power of being alive
the joy of sharing this practice
and I think in the largest sense
this is the way we talk about it
and think about it at Berkeley Zen Center
think about Sangha as the community of all beings
so for me
when I think about
Buddhism
I'm drawn to India
I really like it there
it's really fascinating and people are completely alive
but that's where Buddhism came from
I also
I work in Burma
this is where many of our teachers
also learn the dharma
and if we have some power
and some opportunity
some resources to share with people who need it
we return it to the source
and that's true
the source
you could look it in a very particular way
humanity
the extent that we live
in a globalized
world, culture
we owe
respect
we owe
we owe our ability to
return gifts
to people all over the world
if we did a really interesting thing which we won't do
and everybody took off all of your clothes
right now in this room
didn't look around but actually just looked at the labels and the clothes
you would see
they come from all over the world
people made them, they made everything that we are wearing
somebody put their labor into
and whether it was labor that was given freely
or stolen
we have
we are the recipients of it
when you receive this gift
what do I give back
so I think to me this
the manifestation of power is
not just this power over to be able to extract resources cheaply
but it's also the power to return
what we have been given in gratitude
and we begin by
first of all
having to acknowledge and experience
the power that we have as individuals
and that's what we are doing
that's one of the essential processes we step back here
and then
one of the things I've been talking about lately
at Berkeley Zen Center most Zen centers
when you leave the meditation hall
before leaving you turn around and you bow to the altar
and then you walk through as if you are going from one
space of reality into the other
at Berkeley Zen Center we do something a little different
we leave the meditation hall and there is a door
back of the room we stand at that door
and instead of turning and bowing to the Buddha
we put our hands and we give a little bow
we stand facing the threshold give a little bow
we step over the threshold
out of the hall
and the sort of symbolic meaning
of that is I'm taking my
meditation mind with me
because this is the real purpose
of our meditation it's how to live
to enact some special state within this protected
place so
the enactment of power if you will is the ability
to really manifest
our mindfulness
our collectedness our connectedness
within the world
moment by moment and I don't think there is
any shortcut the sitting meditation we do
is a way of really bringing ourselves into focus
but we don't stop there
there has to be an offering back so I think that's what I wanted to
say this morning and we have a few minutes
I think for question and answer
and I
welcome your questions or your comments
let me just take a second to say that all of our teachers here speak to us on a
down a basis only and there are no salaries for the staff or
the speakers and so if you want to show your appreciation
today there's a box next to the front door for the teacher and I wrote his name
out there next to it if you want to write a check
and there's also a box for maintenance of operations
thank you so questions or comments
yeah I've just recently started
participating in an Allen on group which is you know so much talk of
powerlessness and just to get used to it I was thinking
when you were speaking that there's great power in
powerlessness right so
powerlessness when I was talking about this
distinction in Japanese Buddhism between self power
and other power I think that the
this other power
is what they're talking about I think it's pretty much the same thing as what you're talking about
in Allen on and what
I would say is I really agree
you cannot eliminate whatever you
want to call it the mystery of one's ability to do it and when
one honors that
but what is the
what's the first step
I'm thinking about the serenity prayer
but it's the prayer
does somebody know it
right so right there you have the complete
integration of self and other power
you better know the difference
even though in an ultimate sense they're not
separable thank you good luck
yes
are we on now no I think you are yeah great
I was a little surprised to hear you say
that there aren't many avenues for young people in
India to learn to meditate
when Buddhism started there is there an explanation
well there are many explanations but
now
there were outside
repressions of Buddhism there were inside repressions of Buddhism and there
was also I would say one of the problems
of any kind of organized religion of which
Buddhism was
it develops a kind of institutional quality
and then a lot of the energy of any kind of
institutional quality goes to having to support the
institution so it's maybe a little
obscure but gradually what evolved instead of
a practice that was for everybody
and you see this in Japan you see this in Thailand
you see this in all of the institutional Buddhist countries
but not so much here at least yet
that basically
they had you know they
had this big infrastructure and they had to have
then they became fundraising operations
so to speak you know they had to be able to support the monks so everything
is and support the temples
and that is not conducive to
a kind of horizontal
sustenance so that's another dimension
of what happened there but Buddhism has been pretty
more abundant in the
you know in the country of its birth and what you had
which was radical in terms of rebirth and I write about this in my book
a really remarkable
man, B. R. M. Bedkar in
the first part of the 20th century
who was a leader of the so called Untouchables
and built a large social movement
and also felt he needed
to provide a strong alternative
to the caste system
and after investigating all the religious traditions
he came to the conclusion that Buddhism was
uh
indigenously Indian and it was the natural
it was a highly rational system as he saw it
and in 1956 he converted
to Buddhism publicly in front of
400,000 people and then he turned around
and offered the refuges to 400,000 people and there were some
other mass refuges
that happened around that time
and then three weeks later he died
there was nothing nefarious about that he was very ill
and so that process was incomplete
but there are millions and millions of people who consider themselves
Buddhists in India now but their
access to teachings or places to practice are limited
so that's a short
overview
maybe a couple more minutes if there's
a question or comment
well I will be here for
I'll just be here for a little while
I'm not running off so if you had a personal question or
a particular comment you're happy to welcome you
to come up and talk with me and
I hope you enjoy this it's a really beautiful day
first day of fall
yesterday anyway enjoy the new season
thank you
