Dharmette: Using Reference Points

It can be very difficult to really see how our mind 
operates. It ’s very difficult to see how our mind gets 
attached, o r how our mind is limited by its perceptions, 
its understanding,  its attachments, it s own sense of self. 
Some times the way the mind operates – the way we 
think , and live in and react to the world  – seems  so 
deeply natural  that it ’s like the fish who doesn ’t see the 
water it swims in. We don ’t necessarily see the thoughts 
we live in, the reactions we live in, the attachments we 
live in. We grew up in a society, a family, of attached 
people  where they encourage d you to cling  to things . So 
it just seems like the most natural thing in the world, to 
cling, to hold onto all kinds of things. It ’s very hard to 
see all this, especially down at the more subtle levels of 
the mind.  
 
One of the things that ’s really helpf ul is to have a 
reference point  with which you see what is going on. 
The example I often like to give is of a very still, 
beautiful, shallow mountain creek.  You look in the clear 
water and you can ’t tell that the water ’s flowing. I t just  
seems like it ’s standing still  until you put a stick in the 
water . You put it into the water vertically, and then a little wake gets formed at the edge of the stick, and then you 
actually see that the water i s moving. In the same way, 
it’s hard to see how much our mind moves, un less we 
have a reference point – unless we have some kind of 
stick we put in so that can see the wake of our mind.  
 
There are  many reference points you can have , but 
most of the r eference points that are useful  are ones 
that limit the free activity of the mind – the mind doesn ’t 
have a free-for-all to do what it wants. For example , in 
meditation  being committed to sitting still and not 
moving  will pretty quickly reveal some of the 
movements in your mind, some of the desires you have, 
your reactions to discomfort, your belief system around 
discomfort and comfort . All kind of things kick into play.  
I’ve sat with  being  still and committed to not moving, 
and it ’s been a tempest in there, in my mind, about 
reacting to that, being upset about it, concerned about 
it, trying to solve it, trying to fix it. And I say, “Wow, this 
mind is powerful. ” But if I ’d given in and  just moved, 
then I wouldn ’t have had a tempest. So which is better: 
to have moved and have a quiet mind , or to not move 
and se e the tempest?  
 
The suggestion is it ’s actually better to see the tempest , 
because then you have the chance to see what drives 
the mind , what the reactions are , and then you can look 
at it carefully  and really address it . If you move , you give 
in to some kind of  clinging and you don ’t see it, because it is part of what seems natural or obvious. This  very 
simple thing  of not moving when you sit  is a reference 
point f or look ing at your life.  
 
To live by the precepts, fo r example, is a reference 
point: “I’m committing myself to n ot doing these kinds of 
behavior. ” When you find yours elf wanting to do those 
behavio rs, then you have the r eference point that shows 
you, “Oh maybe I shouldn ’t do this;  I’m committed to not 
lying, ” And then you see all the movements towar ds 
being a little bit deceitful or  not quite straight about how 
things are. That ’s a reference point.  
 
In Buddhism we give ourselves a whole series of 
different  reference points. One reference point that 
some people find helpful is to have a teacher. You check 
in with the teacher regularly. The teacher knows who 
you are , and you see your self better in the context of 
contact with a teacher. That becomes a referenc e point. 
You can ’t just think whatever you wish . You’re 
accountable to someone , and you offer  your 
understanding . And you get to see your understanding 
more clearly because you ’re sharing  it with someone , 
and they may  have some feedback.  
 
There ’s a referen ce point of choosing the brea th. It’s 
one thing to sit still. I t’s another thing  to say, “Okay I ’m 
going to stay  with my breath the best I can,  and that ’s 
my commitment. ” That’s the stick you put in the mind . Then  mostly what you are aware of  is that  you c an’t stay 
on the breath. You get to discover a tremendous amount 
of momentum in the mind. You had no idea there was 
so much preoccupation, concern, so much power, and 
everything, in the mind.  Then you discover you have all 
these judgments  about that:  “This is bad. I ’m a bad 
person, or a bad meditator , because my mind is 
agitated. ” You wouldn ’t have noticed that you had this 
tendency to judge yourself negatively if you ’d given free 
rein to the mind to wander freely.  
 
I’ve meditated without a reference point some times and 
congratulated myself for how good I was meditating 
[laughs] “You’re doing really great. ” Then it dawned on 
me that maybe I should try counting my breat h to find 
out, to test myself. “Are things really  as good as I think 
they are? ” I start counting my breath and I get to two 
and half , and I realiz e that  I felt comfortable and calm , 
but my mind was very powerful and was wandering off 
on all kinds of thoughts . I didn ’t really recogniz e how 
much my mind wa s wandering. It was easy going and  
relaxed . But i t wasn ’t until I did the reference point of 
counting my breath that I saw, “Oh I guess I ’m not so 
still or c oncentrated as I thought I was. ”  
 
Using the breath, I can notice, “Oh, I judge myself 
negatively. ” That’s useful information to know . If I’d 
given my mind free rei n, I could have said, “Wow I ’m 
doing really well, ’” and “I’m so gener ous and compassionate to myself; I never feel bad about myself;  
I’m just a great guy. ” And t hen I start counting the 
breat h, and I get to two and say, “Wow this mind is 
powerful. This is out of control , and I ’m a terrible person 
because argh , look at that, deep  inside is this latent 
tendency  to judge negatively , which I wasn ’t aware of 
until I tri ed to hold myself to something. ” 
 
It’s rather unfortunate that so many  people come to 
Buddhist practice and don ’t succeed well enough  
according to their standards, and th en judge themselves 
negatively and get depressed about that. What yo u’re 
supposed to do is to say, “Wow loo k at that! I have this 
tendency to judge myself negatively. I ’m so glad I see it 
now. This is good. This is progress. ” Then back off , and 
be relaxed about it , and hold it lightly.  Again , what we ’re 
trying to do is to use a reference point to learn what ’s 
going on. What ’s happening here? It ’s really important 
to try to meet that with compassion. To meet whatever 
you see, without further clinging, and being at ease with 
it. 
 
The one reference point I wanted to end with today, 
that’s really useful to have, is the reference point of 
ease itself.  In or outside  of meditation , you set yourself 
with some modicum  of ease. M aybe you can ’t do a very 
good job of it, but some modicum of ease, of being 
peaceful, being calm . And you let that be your reference 
point . Then  notice what takes you away from that. If you don’t have a reference point of ease  or calm, you might 
not realiz e that you ’re agitated. There are plenty of 
people who run around agitated and don ’t realiz e it. I 
know that I ’ve been agitated at times , but ther e are  
layers and  layers of agitation. I think, “Wow I ’m kind of 
calm right now – well I was compared to the argument I 
had with that person , but I’m still  spinning around a little 
bit.” The more profound your  experience of ease , the 
better reference point  it becomes. The stiller the mind 
becomes , the more ease you have, the more thoroughly 
you can see the subtle movement of the m ind. 
 
That’s one very powerful approach to Buddhist practice : 
establish ing yourself in some modes t amount of ease 
and then noticing  what takes you away. Use the ease as 
your reference point and notice what takes you away. 
Notice what happens to you, just notice, notice, notice. 
What ’s going on? What happens? Take refuge in the 
noticing, not in the judgments  you have. Notice, n otice, 
notice  and you ’ll understand yourself. I f you use that  
reference point , you ’ll understand yourself in many 
different circumstances and in deep ways.  
 
You might consider , what are your reference points? 
Some people have sickness as a reference point.  
Anything that limits you is a reference point. Sickness is 
a powerful reference point that  really highlights things 
that are  very hard to see otherwise.  Certain obligations, 
like family obligations, can be reference  point. “I don ’t want to do this, ” but you have  to do it. So that becomes 
a reference point , and you see how you normally 
operate.  
 
One of the qual ities of these reference points  is they 
limit the free ability for the mind to d o whatever it damn 
well pleases – not in order  to say that anything is wrong  
– but so we really see the power, the strength, and the 
subtlety of the attachment to clinging that might be 
operating  – all in the service of becoming free and 
having a greater sense of peace.  
 
May you a ll have a good refere nce point.
