So I'll start with the reading from Saroha that says that within my body are all the sacred places of the world.
Within my body are all the sacred places of the world and the most profound pilgrimage I can ever make is within my own body.
The most profound pilgrimage I can ever make is within my own body.
The Buddha has a very beautiful quotation about the body.
It says that within this fathom-long body, and a fathom is a maritime measurement, it's about 2 meters, 6 feet, in depth of water,
that within this fathom-long body, with its thoughts and emotions, lies our world.
Its origin, its cessation, the pathway to freedom is found within this fathom-long body.
So I appreciate what Saroha was saying, that the most profound pilgrimage we can ever make is within this body.
So to come to retreat, perhaps to come to get in touch with what's important, perhaps this place of refuge,
of finding some potential stability in the midst of all of the worldly winds.
And this has been an incredible time these past two plus years, living in a worldwide pandemic that's not over.
And more concerns with these variants.
In the USA we had two very terrible statistics, we just crossed over 800,000 Americans that have died of COVID,
and now over 50 million people in the United States have been contracted COVID,
and of course way more in the world, we're moving towards 300 million, and over 6 million deaths.
Uncertainty, and it's one thing to think about it, you know, yeah, things are uncertain,
and then it's another when it begins to go inside your skin, muscle, connective tissue, bone, marrow, and being.
It's another thing when we really realize that it's not going to last, and that there's uncertainty.
I've shared with some of you before that I've been to my retreat, you know, I had this realization when I was 4 years old,
riding the backseat of my parents' car, driving down Corey Hill Road towards my grandmothers,
and I'm not sure what my mother and father were talking about, but I had this very clear, really a life altering realization
that I was going to die, and that everyone was going to die, and that it could happen at any moment.
And I remember sharing what I just realized with my mom and dad, and I can't remember my mom turning around
and saying, don't worry Bobby, it's not going to happen for a long, long time,
and I can tell by the sound of her voice, she was friendly, it was warm, it was not wanting me to worry,
yet even at 4, I knew that she wasn't fully telling me the truth, because what I knew was that it could come at any time.
There was no guarantee it would be a long time, and again, what is a long time?
I know Mary Grace just, in October, had a birthday, and 80, and congratulations,
and I remember when my teacher had lined his setto, turned 80, I asked him, how long had he, as 80 years gone by,
and he looked at me and smiled, and snapped his finger, 80 years, 80 years.
Remember once, my wife Jan, who was teaching a mindfulness-based stress reduction class,
had a student in her class, and on the very first night, we often go around the circle,
and people share about what brings them here, and one younger man said, I'm 44,
and the last thing I remember, I was 21, that's why I'm here.
Like, what happened? I'm already 44.
Jane Kenyon, she writes, that I got out of bed on two strong legs, it might have been otherwise.
I ate cereal, sweet milk, and a ripe, flawless peach, it might have been otherwise.
I took the dog uphill to the birchwood, and on morning I did the work that I love,
and at noon I lie down with my mate, it might have been otherwise.
We ate dinner together at a table with silver candlesticks, it might have been otherwise.
And I slept in a bed in a room with paintings on the walls, and I planned another day,
just like this day, but one day I know, one day I know it will be otherwise.
One day I know it will be otherwise.
So we live with uncertainty in this world, it's part of what it is to be a human being,
and how do we begin to meet it wisely?
After that, my own personal experience of realizing the truth,
it just could come at any time, up to the, by the time I was nine, I had lost a brother,
a best friend, and a grandfather, and there was many, many years of confusion and pain after that.
Until eventually, I actually had to think,
Latsue of the Dao Dei Qing that in the program number 47 says, there's no need to look outside your window for everything you need to know is inside you.
And this was the beginning in my early 20s of beginning to look inwards.
Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist, says, who looks outside dreams and who looks inside awakens?
You must have borrowed that from Latsue.
It's a perennial wisdom found through the ages in many traditions, but who looks outside dreams, who looks inside awakens?
And so this journey of beginning to turn inwards became really the most important journey within my life that continues to this day.
And my mother said, no, worry, Bobby, you're not going to die for a long, long time.
Well, I'm going to be 68 this year, and here's 68 years gone.
So it brings me to practice is this realization of the fragility and the preciousness of this life and the mystery.
What is this?
What is this?
My son is a major in astrophysics in his particular area was dark energy.
And if you ask him, what is dark energy?
He says, we don't know.
Speak about the mystery. We don't know.
We know there's something that's moving the universe, expanding it.
We use black holes. They're like little buoys, like buoys in the ocean, but they're like buoys in the sky, these black holes that help us to do measurements.
But then I said, well, but isn't there just universe after the universe?
I mean, we don't know.
It's like, it's like, no, like, what is this?
The conventional conceptual world will make you lead to think that this is this is the world.
But what is this?
Solid, liquid, motion, temperature, change, atoms.
It's mysterious.
I relate to the mystery.
What is this? And then the complexity of our human condition and fighting over one another.
Carl Sagan, an astronomer, had once was part of a project where they took a picture from a satellite.
The Voyager around Pluto and looking back towards the Earth, and they took this picture from Pluto of the Earth, and the Earth was a small pale blue dot, like a piece of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
And yet on that piece of dust, that dot, all these wars, all this killing and narcissism and fighting and just competing against a little speck of this corner of the dot.
Very humbling.
He used to speak about astronomy.
It's very humbling when you begin to look at the vastness of the universe.
Like, what is this?
And yet here we are in this little dot.
And how much bias and prejudice and hatred and fear and otherang and complexities of this world is just amazing.
And I think in these last few years, the polarization has really shown itself even brighter and brighter in being named of what has actually been happening for thousands of years.
What is this, this life?
And I love the story of the Buddha.
I so much love this story because it's such a human story.
I can relate to it as a fellow human.
I know some of you have heard this story and I'll share a little bit of it now as well.
And then the Buddha's original name was Siddhartha Gurdama and he was born into a noble family and destined to become a king.
And it was very customary in ancient India when a new child was born, particularly one that was born into a noble family,
that they would bring some holy people to come to look at that infant and make predictions like looking at the limbs and the length of the ear and the color, the disposition, all of these different signs.
And five of these people came and four of them gave predictions that Siddhartha would become a great king.
But the youngest one, Kodanya, said, no, he's going to become a Buddha.
And Siddhartha's father heard that and even though four of them said, no, he'll become a king, somehow this younger one, Kodanya, said he'll become a Buddha, kind of disturbed him a bit.
Actually disturbed him a lot.
And did not want his son to become a Buddha, but to become a king like himself.
And so he very intentionally, the king, created the conditions where Siddhartha would just be filled with pleasure, palaces for each season and sports and entertainment and pleasure palaces and so forth.
And this went on for about 29 years, living in these pleasure palaces and just losing himself into pleasure and sports and everything else.
And in his 29th year, Siddhartha had this, not sure how it came up, but he had this inkling, this wish to go out into the kingdom and to see how the people lived.
He had just been in these pleasure palaces all these years.
And so he went out in his first outing and he came across an old person.
Now he probably had seen older people before, but for some reason in that moment, in his 29th year, he saw this older person and he got the truth of aging.
Actually his charioteer has been, China said, yes, Siddhartha is saying, this is an old person, no one can escape from aging.
And in that moment, Siddhartha really got it, that there is aging.
Soon after Siddhartha went back to the palace and once again got very much lost in the pleasure palace and all the things going on there.
But after a period of time, he had this other feeling again to go out into the kingdom again.
And he went out again with China, his charioteer or Uber driver, and this time as they were out, they came across someone that was really ill, really ill.
Siddhartha saw this person and talked about it a bit with China and China said, this is one that is ill and no one can escape from illness.
And somehow Siddhartha got it this time in a deeper way, like a piercing.
No one can escape from illness.
He soon went back to the palace again and this time he was a bit forlorn and it's like aging, illness.
But you know, the pleasure palace is so much fun and so again he lost himself into this.
But again a third time, there was this calling inside him to go out and went out again into the kingdom with China.
And this time they came across a corpse, a dead body.
Siddhartha could see right away that this person wasn't breathing, it was discoloration, and then he even put his hand on the arm.
This dead person felt the coolness, the coldness.
And it's always a striking part of the story to me because my father, he died in 2017 and I remember putting my hand on his arm and felt that coldness.
And it was like a piercing into Siddhartha's heart, the truth of death.
Siddhartha went back to the palace and this time was not so eager to go back into the pleasure realms and doing this and that.
He was really upset inside his heart, like somehow waking up from this dream world that he had been living in for 29 years and realizing deeply the truth of aging and illness and death.
And what is he to do? What is this life?
So he just really stayed with this now and wasn't into all these parties and pleasure things anymore, but didn't know what to do. What is this?
And so he called upon him again to go one more time out into the kingdom and sure enough, another encounter happened.
And he came across this person walking incredibly, slowly, deliberately, peacefully. This person had a very calm, serene type of gate and presence.
And Siddhartha said to China, who is this? I've never seen a person like this before.
And China said, this is a person who is dedicating their life to understanding the meaning of life. This is a sadhu.
Wanderer, holy person, one that is meditating and trying to understand the meaning of life.
And when Siddhartha heard that, there was a glimmer of hope that entered into his heart, like there might be a way.
There's actually people that do this. There might be a way to understand about life.
And so he came back to the palace with a little bit more of some inspiration.
And in time he realized that he needed to leave the palace and become a sadhu.
And devote his life to understanding what is the meaning of life.
There's something very powerful about this story. It always has been for me.
Particularly because of my own growing up and experiencing so much death and then being so confused for so many years.
And then eventually, sometimes we consider that when Siddhartha saw the sadhu, that is called the fourth heavenly messenger.
This is the messenger that says, maybe there's another way.
And I was very fortunate in my college days to have met a teacher.
It was like a fourth heavenly messenger to me that in his presence revealed to me, maybe there's some way in.
And again, this was this journey of beginning to look inside.
My professor introduced me to the Dao De Ching of Lat Su. There's no need to look outside your window for everything you need to know is inside you.
This turning inwards was the beginning of my practice that has been with me for so many years now.
And so these experiences that Siddhartha had, this encounter with aging, illness, death, awakening, fourth heavenly messenger, these are all messengers.
And I want to sense it. I trusted every single person here has met them one way or another.
I don't think you could be here. There's something that wasn't calling to you to look inside.
What is this? It's taking this time of the pandemic and so much polarization.
What is this? And so it's so wonderful that you are here to sit, to settle a bit.
Perhaps in time, things begin to get more clear.
What brings us here?
Perhaps I'd like to invite you a little silence now to reflect upon again that question that echoes.
What brings us here?
And can you relate to any of these messengers, messenger of illness, whether it's something that you're dealing with or someone you know or care about is ill or has it got aged aging as well as looking at yourself and your own aging.
Death.
Reflecting upon these messengers that perhaps have brought us into practice and reflecting on perhaps the messengers that were pointing that maybe this away.
To understand, to make peace, to gather deeper wisdom and understanding.
So sometime just reflect now like who's been your messengers of aging, of illness, of death, of awakening.
Just taking some time in the silence to reflect upon these aging illness, death, awakening.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And so these messengers awakening us, what is important, the fragility, the preciousness of this life?
And so one day Siddhartha Godama left the palace, left his family, his wife, his child to be knowing that they would of course be well cared for.
And actually it's nice to say that after his awakening he came back to his wife, to his son and family and taught them what he had learned in his awakening.
So we're going to share more about a few days.
But that's sojourn.
What is this life?
There's a beautiful haunting reading from Mary Oliver that I love and it speaks to this journey and it's called The Journey.
Perhaps it touches into our shared humanity of our journey.
What is this life? And she says, one day you finally knew what you had to do and began.
The voices around you kept shouting and the whole house began to tremble and you felt that old and familiar tug or your ankles as each voice cried out to you to take care of me, to mend my life.
But you knew what you had to do this time and though the wind pried with the stiff fingers and the melancholy was terrible, it was already late enough and it was a wild night.
And the road was full of fallen branches and stones.
And little by little as you left their voices behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of the clouds. I love that moment. The stars began to burn through the sheets of the clouds and there was a new voice, the snag deep in your heart.
There was a new voice that you slowly recognized that was your own.
And it kept you company as you drove deeper and deeper into the world, determined to do the only thing you could do and determined to save the only life you could save.
The stars began to burn through the sheets of the clouds and there was a new voice you slowly recognized as your own.
This journey that we're all on in life and how to meet it with wisdom.
So as we come to an end in a few minutes, we'll just sit for a little bit more and we'll end the bell.
Let's take these messages with you, let them sleep with you, let them live within you.
These messages of awakening, these messages of the fragility, the messages of the preciousness of life.
So precious that we're making this time for retreat, to pause, to look inwards, getting in touch with our own voice.
So we'll just sit for a couple of minutes in the silence and perhaps our senses open and awake and I know here in Northern California the sound senses are lovely with the rain.
Just sitting with your senses, whatever's calling to you, a sound, being with a sound, a sensation, being with a sensation.
It's exploring your senses, taste lingering in the mouth, visual impressions whether the eyes are open or closed, smells perhaps still in the nose.
Coming to our senses, this pilgrimage within our own fathom-long body.
Feeling the touch points of your body sitting in the chair or on the cushion, feet on the floor, in the body.
I'm just being aware of the breath as it comes in and goes out in the body.
Thank you for watching.

So thank you and our retreat has begun.
And of course there's times that we're gathering where we're doing formal practice of sitting and walking meditation and some yoga.
And of course there'll be times for meals, bring our mindfulness to eating and there's this whole category called the mindfulness or the clear comprehension of different day-to-day activities and so we can begin now.
The moment you might be shutting off the computer and being aware of the shutting off and the getting up and the walking, brushing teeth and all these different activities of day-to-day living we can bring our mindfulness to.
And no doubt it might discover pretty quickly that we're not mindful every single moment.
But one thing that's nice is a very short equation.
The moment you realize you're not present, you are.
It begins again.
So you can make it kind of like a mindfulness game.
The moment you realize you're not present, you are present.
Just at that moment of putting your hand on the doorknob, pressing down the lever on the toaster, getting the washing your face.
So many different activities of day-to-day living and so we can begin gently and kindly priming this pump of mindfulness, kindly attending.
So thank you very much for this time. It feels very special to be in retreat again.
And let us use our time as best we can to awaken.
Thank you so much and we'll see you in the morning at 6.45 Pacific Standard Time.
This is our next sit. And thank you very much.
