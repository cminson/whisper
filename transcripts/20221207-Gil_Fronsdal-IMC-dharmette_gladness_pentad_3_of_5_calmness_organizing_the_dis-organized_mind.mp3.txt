The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So we're now at the third talk of the gladness pentad and this is tranquility.
Specifically it's tranquility of the body and but I like to think of it
includes calmness of the mind as well. And here the language is not that we are
calming anything but rather there's a calming that happens from the momentum
of the meditation of the practice. It's like if you sit still and upright when
you're really tense the body just wants to relax and settle it just kind of you
find yourself settling without intending to do so. And so the same way for the
mind there's a way in which things are allowed to settle quiet if we get out of
the way if we don't perpetuate our busyness or activities. So being still
and it turns out that that deep relaxation of the body is supported by
gladness and joy the first two steps of this gladness pentad. It's kind of like
with the gladness and joy there's a contentment there's a sense of
well-being that it just feels safer to relax and let go. It just feels kind of
warm and cozy to be present so that the body wants to relax more kind of like
it's been tight and shivering in the cold and then it stands in the sun warmth
of the sun and soaks in the warmth and something begins to relax. So when in
meditation we can help with the relaxing calming and when we allow for it as part
of the art of meditation. Meditation is often associated with becoming calm
and tranquil and it's a very useful quality of meditation but it's very it's
not so often talked about how the calmness the tranquility that brings that
we create that comes along is not for its own sake. Many people feel like that's
enough I mean I was so stressed out it's not nice to be calm. That the calmness
begins to allow for a reorganizing of the mind and body especially I think of
the mind getting reorganized. Maybe a mind that's disorganized is all too
often our experience in life and you only realize that when we sit down to
meditate and see how much the mind is jumping around or fragmented or
preoccupied in a way you know so distracted we don't even know we're
distracted so preoccupied we don't even know that we're preoccupied until we sit
down and see it and and so the to begin and to be present and awake and clear
and see what's happening in the mind that begins allowing the mind to settle
it's kind of like making breathing room for something to settle and then we
could also participate in that relaxing sometimes and just kind of kind of being
with the breath and relaxing it being with our our mind and softening the mind
and the more that we're both awake attentive and relaxing the more the
mind will self-organize it's like the self-healing properties of the our body
and mind that are not enabled if we stay scattered and stressed it's kind of
like we're keeping ourselves away we're interfering with the self-healing
self-settling self-organizing aspects of our mind and as we get as the mind gets
more organized more less fractured more gathered together the the purpose as I
said is not just to be calm but is so that our intelligence our creativity
and our focus can operate in support of the meditation and because the idea is
that the calm is not an end of itself but allows for a deepening of
concentration is settling a greater sense of settled concentrated wholeness and
not another fragmentation we lasers focusing on something and pushing
everything else aside but rather everything is allowed to settle together
nothing is left out nothing is held at bay nothing is repressed or denied but
the self-organizing everything comes together and then can find a way to work
together cooperate coordinate for the purposes of meditation I was told
recently about a game that uses some kind of technology attached to the head
that can measure I guess the brain waves whether a person is agitated or calm
and apparently it's a game where there's a ball between two people at a table or
something and that's somehow connected wirelessly connected to these headsets
people are wearing and so when we relax the ball moves away from us towards the
other person and so it's a competition to see who can get the ball into the
other person's goal or in the other person's side of the table and but what's
required is to be relaxed so you can't strain you can't be competitive in a
forceful straining way and the person who wins is the one who is most relaxed
which probably also means the most unconcerned about winning and but I
imagine that you don't win by falling asleep you know you don't win by kind
of spacing out you have to be present very present to notice if the mind is
you know if the ball which direction the ball is going and whether or which
direction you know is the mind now more stressed more agitated or is the mind
now is in more places you can settle and relax quiet the mind and so learning
this art of being alert present tracking what's going on with intelligence and
keeping it relaxed at the same time many people only know one or the other but to
do both and then to use the our intelligence our creativity to gather
more fully and focus more fully just here in our meditation so in this last
meditation I suggested the idea that you know so image is a create a creative
image of you thinking of attention like a brush stroke and like a painter
painting something and that every inhale and every exhale is this is you have to
have the very precise and clear relaxed focus of an artist who's putting the
finishing touches on a very refined detailed painting that's maybe
exquisitely beautiful but you know when put the last little thing in it and not
mess up and so very present maybe there too if there's stress or tension in the
artist's hand it won't it won't be quite right that's be very relaxed but very
focused and so that every exhale is a brush stroke every inhales that brush
stroke of this painting and this metaphor is not partly borrows from the
ancient Buddhist language Pali that in one of these coincidences accidents of
the language that the word for mind Chitta is the same as the word for
painting Chitta they have different they come from different roots so that
themologically they're not related but somehow in the way the language is kind
of evolved over time the accents the pronunciations they came to have the same
pronunciations are homonyms so but it's kind of a wonderful coincidence that you
know that the word for mind the word for painting is the same because maybe
there's a way in which how we're present how we engage in attention is a way of
painting the mind painting our experience painting ourselves into being a
whole organized gathered together everything working in harmony and so how
do we harmonize mind and body and part of the way is to allow it to harmonize by
being calm by being settled and so some of that we can do ourselves we can
relax the tensions in our muscles while staying alert in the body to what we
don't want to do is relax and become limp limpness is not the tranquility that
the Buddha was pointing to it you know the most limp person would end up you
know like a cooked piece of spaghetti just kind of you know call you know not
no no tautness holding it up so we don't not push my not supposed to become
limp we're also not supposed to be tense and so some kind of tautness some
kind of vitality energy that keeps us alive keeps us upright and engaged but
also something it allows for very deep relaxation of the body in the mind it's
phenomenal that what can happen in meditation so I offer all this all this
to you is is as a suggestion or as ideas to encourage you to lovingly
relaxedly participate in support this orgasm organizing self-organizing
defracturing movement of meditation that part of the reason to settle the mind
is so that we can become more intelligent and creative and present for
experience for those of you who have mind to jump around a lot some image
might be helpful so the image for example that the as you exhale it's like
you're you have the focus of you know a painter with a paintbrush just right
there with the every little step of the exhale you're painting it you're right
there tracking it or maybe you know really present for I don't know the you
know what's the attention you need to if you want to some fruit like a mango or
maybe avocado where you put the knife down you don't want to cut through the
skin you cut it in half you don't cut through the skin but you know from the
half from the inside you're you're slicing it down to the skin so what's
that focus right there for that cut that you need to do maybe have other
images that you like that works for this a maybe an archer and you know just
really getting the whole body organized settled connected there also an
archer can't be tense but the archer has to be taught and everything is
organized whole body is organized for the purposes of the shot and then you
know that kind of in the mind everything takes its time to really be there to to
hit the target and so to or meditation as a organizing practice that is
supported by tranquility and the more we have gladness the more we have joy the
more that it's just natural for the body to feel cozy content and feel like it
can settle and relax and and be participate in this reorganizing from
the disorganization of stress stress and and resistance and you know agitation
so look for opportunities to be tranquil you know we'll sit in a park bench for a
little while sit look out the window and have tea look for opportunities to
relax your body standing in a shopping line don't read the magazines that are
there as you're waiting or don't be you know judging what other people in front
of you in line have bought you standing there is a chance to soften and relax
your body maybe relax your mind look for opportunities today to relax be
tranquil not for its own purpose but see if you can notice if in that
tranquility in that calmness if there's a way in which your body and mind kind of
comes together kind of becomes more whole becomes more organized or gathered
together or unified so thank you and may you have a tranquil day and and not
just because you're tranquil but because your whole system starts coming into
harmony you'll be better prepared for tomorrow's topic which is happiness so
thank you very much
