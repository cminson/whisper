 Good evening. In this setting, the first word is like throwing a stone into a very still pond. You don't even really recognize how still the pond is until you can perceive the ripples. I feel some reluctance to toss that stone, but that's what I'm supposed to do, so excuse me. It's really nice to be here with you. I think it's been a while since I've been, since I've been, since I've spoken here or visited here. Can you hear? Let me move this a little closer. Rather than turning it up, let me move it a little closer to my mouth. Does that make me better? Okay. I think I'm going to be back in June. Gil asked me to put together an evening of music and dharma, and so we're going to do that sometime early June with Betsy Rose and Venerable Hungsher and myself, which I don't know what it's going to be like. Those guys actually have Buddhist songs. All I know are old songs that embody the dharma, but maybe not so explicitly. Anyhow, tonight I'd like to talk for a while and then leave room for discussion. I'd like to talk about love. So I was thinking, you know, the question is what's love got to do with it? And by the time I finish this talk, you may really be asking that question. I'd like to start with a verse from Dante, from the Divine Comedy. In that abyss I saw how love held bound into one volume all the lives whose flight is scattered through the universe around, how substance, accident and mode unite, fused, so to speak, together in such wise that this, I tell you, is one simple light. Well, I'm not sure how simple the light is, but fused in substance, accident and mode. This is what our lives are. Every year or so, I've been at Berkeley Zen Center for a long time now and heard a lot of talks by my teacher, Sojourner Weitzman, and every year, you know, at the end of the talk we have question and answer. Sooner or later someone will ask, how come you never talk about love? Which irritates him greatly in his response. I've heard him say this several times, that's all I talk about. And I think that that is actually the essence of the Dharma that we're practicing. In Japanese, the word, there's one word or one character for heart and mind. Often in this culture we split those. We think, well the mind is here and the heart is here and we're not, we're a little vague on what the connection is. But in that one simple ideogram is the life of our practice, this heart and mind. I think a couple things came together to make me think about this for a talk. Last month I gave a talk during Sashine at Berkeley and someone quoted something from a book, a new book, it's called Blink, has anyone heard of that? By Malcolm Gladwell. It's about, essentially it's about our intuitive mind. And so she loaned me this book and I, it's really interesting and I read along in this one pack so it just really grabbed me. So he's talking about, in the context of talking about intuition and opening of heart and mind as one. He gets into a discussion about improvisational theater. And it turns out, I don't know much about improvisational theater, but he cites a book which I had read and forgot a number of years ago, a book called Impro by Keith Johnstone. And it seems there are not a lot of rules in at least Keith Johnstone's method, but there's one central rule, which is the rule of agreement, the rule of acceptance. That is the basic way to create a story, create interaction, create humor. Keith Johnstone writes, if you'll stop reading for a moment and think of something you wouldn't want to happen to you or to someone you love, then you'll have thought of something worth staging or filming. We don't want to walk into a restaurant and be hit in the face by a custard pie and we don't want to suddenly glimpse Granny's wheelchair racing towards the edge of the cliff, but we'll pay money to attend enactments of such events. In life, most of us are highly skilled at suppressing action. All the improvisation teacher has to do is to reverse this skill. Bad improvisers block action, often very skillfully. Good improvisers develop action. So here is an exchange in an improvisation in one of Johnstone's classes. A, I'm having trouble with my leg. B, I'm afraid I'll have to amputate. A, you can't do that, doctor. B, why not? A, because I'm rather attached to it. B, losing heart. Come on, man. A, I've got this growth on my arm too, doctor. The two actors involved in the scene quickly became very frustrated. They couldn't keep the scene going. Actor A had made a joke and a rather clever one, I'm rather attached to it, but the scene itself wasn't funny, so Johnstone stopped them and pointed out the problem. Actor A had violated the rule of agreement. His partner had made a suggestion and he had turned it down. He had said, you can't do that, doctor. So the two started again only this time with a renewed commitment to agreeing. A, ahh! B, whatever is it? A, it's my leg, doctor. B, this looks nasty, I shall have to amputate. A, but it's the one you amputated last time, doctor. B, you mean you've got a pain in your wooden leg? A, yes, doctor. B, you know what this means. A, not wormwood, doctor. B, yes, we'll have to remove it before it spreads to the rest of you. Then, A's chair collapses. B, my god, it's spreading to the furniture. So, this is, this is a way of thinking about love and it's a way of thinking about our practice. Johnstone talks about blocking and blockages and the Tibetan teacher, Cho Gyung Trungpa writes, The everyday practice is simply to develop a complete acceptance and openness to all situations and emotions and to all people. Experiencing everything totally without mental reservations and blockages so that one never withdraws or centralizes onto oneself. So that one never is caught by our self-centered thinking. There are a number of different kinds of loves that are love that's outlined in various teachings. In Greek we have the notion of eros, which is sexual love, passionate love. It's important. It's also, it just arises. It's the energy, we have passions for many things and that energy keeps us going. It gives us some oomph, it gives us some drive, but it's also very, it's a very sticky kind of love. First of all, it's sticky but it goes away because you can't, passion doesn't stay at that kind of intensity. You can't hold onto it, it just slips away. And also because of its stickiness, it's very easy for us to get caught on it and enter into our dream of self-fulfillment. To enter into a place where that passion, that eros is so strong, it's actually about us and we're not seeing the other person clearly. It's tricky. It's not that that can't be done in passion but that it's quite difficult. The second kind of love is sometimes known as philia, which is just this warm affection that we have for our friends and our family and a feeling of connection that is kind of special connection. That also arises naturally and is really important in our lives. The third kind of love, in Greek I think it's known as agape, and this is what's also in Buddhism we might call maitri or metta. It's unconditional love. In our tradition, in the metta-suta lines, at least in the translation we use, you probably use something similar, just as a mother watches over and protects her only child, so with a boundless mind should one suffuse love over the entire world. So that model for the connectedness and selfless caring of a mother and a child is the model that we should use, that we have to cultivate to apply to everyone. It's also similar to what Jesus was teaching in the Gospel of Matthew where he says, I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, and do good to them that hate you, and pray to them that despitefully use you. This is how difficult and challenging that kind of love is. And to think of it in terms of, that Keith Johnstone lays out, our lives are one big improvisation. And what we need to do is to keep turning towards the situation that arises. If we have a problem, we have to turn towards it. If we have difficulty with someone, we have to turn towards them. This is a very challenging spiritual teaching, and that's one of the wonderful things about Jesus' teaching, that he was willing to do that, even to endure all the consequences of that. We do this in our relationships, we do this in our partnerships, in our marriages. It's not to say that there isn't Eros, and there isn't Philia, but we cultivate this kind of total acceptance. We don't always like all the things that our partner might do, but if we're cultivating love in the context of practice, we turn towards them. We keep turning towards them rather than blocking. When you block something, nothing creative will arise. When you say yes to it, turn towards it, accept it, then something creative can happen. It may not always be fun, and it may not be what you bargained for. In fact, it's almost never what you bargained for, because that's just your mind thinking. It's what is really happening with another person, with the people in our community, with people around the world to turn towards them, instead of shutting them out. We can all think of, I'm sure every one of us can think of something we did today, that closed the door, for whatever reason, out of fear, or out of our own depletion. Out of busyness, out of concern that to say yes would mean to cut ourselves off from something that we might want. We can all see that we catch ourselves doing this, and the admonition here, the lesson of this improvisation, is just to turn towards it. This is something that is embedded in the meditation practice that we do. I'm not sure what particular teachings, what particular methodology or approach to meditation you use. I have some general sense. But I think that what's pretty common, certainly common in our Zen training, the Zen training that Gil has, which I think infuses his teaching, is not to reject anything that arises in your mind. Not to get stuck on it either. Now this turning may be very subtle. It's not like you have to throw your arms around your thoughts or feelings. But you have to see it. You have to see what is arising. And even if it's for just a moment, turn towards it in a completely accepting way. And similarly, let it go in a completely accepting way. This is what we have to do with our suffering. It's very difficult when we're ill, or when we see someone that we love who is ill. All we want is, you know, our habit mind just wants us to go away. And we have to train ourselves to turn towards it, to understand that as difficult as it is, it's actually what's happening at the moment. And there's nothing really more helpful or productive to do but to turn towards it. You can turn towards it, depending upon the situation, to take on something as a challenge. Even to, in a sense, engage or do, shall I say, battle with something, is also turning towards. But it's this engagement. It's rather that than walking away, or turning away, or trying to turn one's back, or trying to pretend that something doesn't exist. So this is, in here, in this room, in your retreats, in your practice at home, this is all a laboratory for love. We apply this love to ourselves, this complete acceptance, by turning towards ourselves. And we do something that's very interesting, very mammalian. We're sitting together in this room and are sitting together, it's a little crowded in here, but that very crowd creates comfort, safety, it creates a connection with that deep mammal part of our brain. Where, even though each of us comes in here with our difficulties, our concerns, and our suffering, when we're sitting together, we're creating this warm and loving atmosphere together. We're creating it, we're improvising this. And it's really amazing, because it can happen anywhere. I often go into the teaching of the federal prison, women's prison, in Dublin, California. There's a young woman who's working in the V.P.F.'s base program, who came in with me last week for the first time. She was really nervous she'd never been in a prison. This is not the harshest of prisons, but it is prison. You're thoroughly checked and searched, and there's guards patrolling, and there's three fences with razor wire on the top, and the atmosphere is quite controlled. When we sat in, we sit in the chapel, we go out weekly, one or another of us, we haven't done this for a long time, we sit in the chapel in a circle, and this woman, Sarah, as we were walking out, it was really, her first comment was, that was so normal. And I said, well, yeah, because it's just people sitting together. And we're sitting in a circle, even in this very unsafe atmosphere, where certain of these women might not, outside of this room, feel entirely comfortable being with her, talking with each other, in the context of the room, sitting together, doing this practice, breathing together, watching our awareness mindfully together, we do some chanting. It's a zone of safety and connection, and the feeling of love and warmth is really palpable. And usually, I mean, the women are very appreciative, and they flat out say that this is the only safe place that they experience all week. So that's an extreme situation, and yet we all crave the same connection. So today, everybody's here, it's really raining hard, when I came in. Sounds like it's end a little bit. But because of the love that you may not even be fully aware of, each of us came here tonight. This was our, you know, our participation in the improvisation was to come and not be blocked by the bad weather, but to accept the rain as, oh, this is the Dharma rain, falling down. You know, and get a little damp out there, and we come in here and we can get completely soaked. I think I'll stop talking and open up for questions. Let me close with this, again, with this verse from Dante. In that abyss, I saw how love held bound into one volume, all the lives whose flight is scattered through the universe around. How substance, accident, and mode unite, fused, so to speak, together in such wise that this, I tell you, is one simple light. So, thank you. The floor is open for comments, thoughts, questions. Do you pass around a microphone? You, you called the arrows sticky. And also the passion goes away. Could you say a little more about what you mean by sticky? I can imagine what you mean, but perhaps some of the implications of this? Right. What I meant by, I mean, I'm thinking from, even from a recent experience of someone that I spoke with who, the word that he used was, he found himself entranced by feelings that arose between him and another person that, frankly, if he had used his better judgment, he shouldn't have pursued them. But he was, it was like, sticky like a web in that sense. And I'm just, I'm talking about this, I'm just saying that this is an aspect. This is not, I'm not trying to be negative about it. I'm just saying one has to be really careful. So the, and what one has to be careful of is that the feeling that arises in me, say, if I think I have fallen in love with another person, especially if I'm not heeding this, you know, the other circumstances of my life, the stickiness is, we get caught in this web of this dream of self fulfillment, that you want better sex, you know, better love, better whatever than what you already have. Now, of course, it's not that you don't deserve it or that, or that that's not sometimes relevant. But often it is, a way of turning away from the situation that already, that really does exist in your life. It's really a matter of judgment. I'm not making a sweeping statement. Does that answer a little? Yeah. Actually, we are sticky. It's not, heroes is sticky. We are. We've got all these, it's like, it's like we're walking around like with this incredible Velcro suit and all these things come out and they stick to us. Yeah. Could you say some more about the dream of fulfillment, self fulfillment? Could you describe whether that's a positive or a negative or if it's just from, other people's viewpoint or your own viewpoint, whether or not there's any sort of bad catch to that? Yeah. I'm really, I'm trying to be careful here. If what we value is things as they are, and this is a Buddhist approach to just appreciate things as they are and recognizing that our lives are unfolding. That's, so that's the aspect of complete acceptance. Suzuki Roshi said, you are perfect just as you are and you need some improvement. So there's that side too. The dream of fulfillment, often, well, here's what I could say really succinctly. Most of the problems that we have are because we want things to be different than how we're perceiving them. Almost every, I mean, I very hard to think of a single problem that arises for us that where that's not the case. Sometimes it would be good for things to be other than as they are. And this is a side that Buddhism doesn't talk much say about justice. But all of us grew up in the context where justice is a very high and important principle. And we have to work out for ourselves just how we sit with that. Just how we sit with that tension between things as they are and perhaps things as we feel they appropriately should be. But just in a very direct way, so many of just most of the problems we have is because we want things to be other way than they are. We certainly want that person. We want him to be different from how he is because that would make my life a lot easier. We see that this is an expression of not agreeing. What happens when, say there's somebody that you're uncomfortable with and instead of wanting them to be some other way, you actually can turn towards them and accept them. This is exactly how they are and I'm not going to reject them. So that's just a beginning but this is infinite. It's not subject to, I mean I'm making a broad statement, it's not subject to a rule. And the thing is we also, we really experience this in our meditation. All the time. Am I doing this right? What's my concentration like? Or I'm tired or I don't feel like being here or my legs hurt or whatever. And just when we're sitting for a long time, we sink into some other place, right? That's beyond wanting it to be some other way. And I'm just once, when you can really, when you have an opportunity really to touch that and taste that, then you see another level of your life that is too often hidden. And you also, you want that for everybody. That's the, again the aspect of love you wish that everybody could really touch themselves deeply whether you like them or not. But that's our human wish. Thank you. I wish that you could say a few words about the situation that's going on in my life right now. In a word, insomnia. I'm having trouble sleeping lately and I don't like it at all. I go vastly between being angry about it, being afraid of it. What if I can't sleep enough? What's going to happen? So I wonder, I mean, I have trouble turning towards that and perhaps you could address that. Well, I suspect from having, actually I very rarely have that experience now because I have to get up at five in the morning and it's just, I'm exhausted all the time. So I go right to sleep. But, you know, I've had this in the past and what I remember, and it comes up in context of other illnesses, is that I get caught in my anxiety. I get scared. And I spin out from this momentary experience of not being able to sleep. I create a whole narrative about what it's going to be like because I can't sleep. And then that's scary. And then one might do relatively desperate things, kind of rising around in that fear or wiggling around in that fear, whatever it is. Instead of just accepting, well, I can't sleep now, sooner or later I'm going to sleep. And not resisting it, if you can. I know that that, I mean, again, this is simplistic advice or simplistic analysis because you may know, oh, I have to go to work or I have to do this or that. That's going to call for my attention. But still, the suffering arises with the anxiety. As you notice that anxiety rising, can you really try to see, oh, that anxiety and breathe into it, deconstruct it, just see, I'm holding on to the anxiety and the anxiety is holding on to it. And this doesn't really have to do with the fact that I can't sleep. So it's a very mindful deconstruction of the feeling that you're actually having. That's about as close as I can. Will you say more about the sitting with justice or injustice? Because it seems like if you don't want to accept injustice, it's not accepting it. So I don't know about that. I don't know about being an activist in certain issues and how that plays in with acceptance. Well, it's really difficult. It's a complete work in progress. You know, there's, what often comes up, invariably what comes up is the Hitler question or nowadays in some circles, and I may not even be safe to say here, the Rumsfeld question. But in fact, I keep going back to this teaching of Martin Luther King, where he said, you love your enemy, you love your opponent, and you oppose their action. And that's really the challenge. What I see in myself and in discussions with other activists is that again and again, we want to personalize. We want to hate that person for all that they're doing. And we have a very difficult time separating a person as a human being. I had this, this is maybe a good place to stop, I had this very powerful dream a couple of months ago, which I thought was, it was actually maybe the most encouraging dream I ever had in my life. I was sitting in some bedroom, face to face with a very old Ronald Reagan, who was close to death. And we were looking at each other in his eyes, and I can see his eyes, they were brown and sort of runny, the way sometimes an old man was. And I felt a person who was old and ill can be, and they were sad and bewildered. And I felt in this dream, a tremendous outpouring of love. And at the same time, in the dream, I just thought, what's going on here? I've been in total opposition to everything that this person did in his political life that I can remember. I think this came about around the time that he died, and there were various stories, particularly told by his children, that were very strong. And I just felt at that point, there was a real separation between the human being that was sitting very close in front of me, who was a human being in all the sense that any of us in this room is. Separating that from his misguided policies. And again, this has got to be, this is a very strong tension and dynamic that we work with in ourselves, because it is people who enact policies. And in certain senses, in certain sense, you have to, they need to be held responsible for them. But being held responsible is not the same as cutting them off from the source of our love or our compassion. I think that's a good place to end. Thank you very much.
