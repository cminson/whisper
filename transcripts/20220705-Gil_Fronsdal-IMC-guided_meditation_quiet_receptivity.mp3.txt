 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and welcome. There is a tendency for me when I approach my meditation time and sitting down to become quiet in my mind. So it's a little strange to sit down and meditate every morning with you this way and start with words. And this idea of quiet, it's like there are times, like in this vacation I had last week where we're in the mountains hiking and there'd be these places we'd come to, the beautiful mountain lakes and groves of trees. And it seemed that the way to approach it was to be quiet, not to talk so much, and also to kind of have a silence in the mind, a receptivity as if the place that we're in is to be respected and attended to and heard and seen and listened to on its own terms, not on what I think should be happening or what I think I want or what my thoughts are spinning stories about. And perhaps there are some times in ordinary life where that happens that maybe we go to a temple or a church and entering into it, there's a kind of irreverence and a silence. I call this is a place to open attention up and take in the ambiance, take in the presence that they are, they're quiet, and not come barreling ahead with all our thoughts and concerns. Going to a funeral can be like this. Going to a preschool class when all the children are napping, it's so peaceful and quiet and it's time to become quiet oneself. And so meditation is a time like this where we're trying to, where the receptivity, the available, that there's a presence, not a presence, but there's something we're attending to that we're quieting the mind. We're not living in the world of our thoughts and thinking and how we're interpreting things and the stories we make about things and the meaning we have about what's happening and the expectations of what should be happening or what shouldn't be happening. The mind can be spinning and sometimes it spins fast. There's fast food and now slow food, there's fast thinking and there's slow thinking and quiet thinking. There's thinking that is more receptive to the moment and to be present and not asserting itself and its desires and wants and wishes and fears on top of the moment. So we come to meditation and certainly to recognize how is it for us. Are we bringing a truckload of thoughts, ideas, stories, memories, plans, concerns to churn and to think about? And if so, then that's what should be listened to and attended to in a quiet way, as if something needs to be heard and you're the hearer, you're the one who will listen. And sometimes it's clear that coming into meditation, we're allowing ourselves to the thinking mind to take a backstage. It's not that important what we think. What's important is what we're feeling and what's happening or the presence, the attentiveness to the situation, allowing the situation to speak to us rather than us being the speaker, the talker. And so to sit in meditation with a quietude, a receptivity, a listening to whatever is there. So to assume a meditation posture, a posture in which to be receptive, a posture in which to listen better, a posture which doesn't, which uses the body to attend to be here with our experience. It means being many people sitting a little bit more upright or a little bit more intentional. And then gently sending, gently closing your eyes and noticing how this moment is for you, as if your body, your heart, your mind is the temple that you step into. Maybe something become quieter as you listen, sense, feel what is here. And within what's here, gently, gently and maybe slowly taking a few long breaths, as if with each breath you're gently touching your full experience, gently feeling, attending. And as you exhale, relax, soften this body. Letting your breathing return to normal. And as we continue meditating today and you notice that you might be thinking and lost in thought, involved in thought, remind yourself there's a different way of being that does not depend on thinking. Letting your thoughts get quiet, softer. Let thinking recede to the background so you're not living in your thoughts or so you're not seeing everything through the lens of thinking and stories and meaning. Let your experience of the moment be known quietly without thinking, a reverence, a respect for everything, which calls on, invites a quieting of the mind as you enter into a sacred place of your direct immediate experience, breathing here. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. For this meditation, don't center yourself on your thinking. Let the thinking recede so you could center yourself on your direct experience as if your thinking mind gets quiet so you can feel better, hear better. There can be a receptivity to the specialness of the moment. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. So as we come to the end of sitting, perhaps it's possible to feel, recognize the difference between being with other people and asserting our desires, our needs, our agendas, versus being present with others and listening, receiving the other, being available for the other to be. To feel ahead with your own wishes and needs and desires, or to relax and open up and to get to know the other person, to feel, to sense, to really know who you're with. And love and the family of love, compassion, care, goodwill, kindness, arises most easily in the second mode. It doesn't have much space when we are asserting ourselves and asserting our needs and our wants and our agendas. But love has much more time and space and availability. When we take the time to be quiet and receptive to know the person we're with. So perhaps you can imagine meeting someone today, stranger or someone you know, from that peacefulness or receptivity or calmness of meditation or whatever way in meditation, self-assertion has taken a back step, the background. And you can just be with someone without a need or a want or an assertion of self. And from this place to let there be kindness, goodwill, well-wishing, may others be happy, may others be safe, may others be peaceful, may others be free, and may you tap into your kindness and love with which to meet others. May we meet in friendliness and kindness today as we learn not to fill the space with our stories, our agendas, our needs, our wants. So there's more space to know and to feel and to love. Thank you.
