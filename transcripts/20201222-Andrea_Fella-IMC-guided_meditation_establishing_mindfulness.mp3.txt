Now is this being right now? No need to judge. 
Just a simple acknowledgement. 
Yes, this is how it is right now. 
However, the body is. 
This is how the body is. 
However, the mind is. 
Whether scattered, stuck on something, easeful, can there be a simple recognition? It's like this right now. 
It's kind of amazing that there is this capacity in our minds to be aware of what is happening in our minds. 
And that's what we're cultivating, that capacity. 
Cultivating that capacity of mindfulness, of awareness for the sake of being curious about the experience of this moment. 
That we could call the establishment of mindfulness. 
So this body sitting, breathing. 
Aware of this body sitting and breathing. 
The mind responding to experience. 
At ease with it, liking it, not liking it. 
Aware of that. 
And it is helpful in this process of establishing mindfulness to encourage support, relaxation. 
So perhaps the body can relax. 
It can be helpful at times to consciously scan through the body and relax. 
Noticing areas of tension and seeing if there can be a softening of physical tension. 
And sometimes we can actually encourage relaxation in an indirect way by kind of dropping in this possibility or a request. 
Maybe the body can relax, may the body relax. 
Not trying to do it, but just seeing how the mind and body respond to that request. 
I often find that with dropping something like that in, dropping in that request, may the body relax. 
There can be a letting go in some area that I didn't even know was tight or tense. 
Maybe the mind can relax. 
The exploration of relaxation is also a cultivation of awareness of experience. 
It's aiming or directing the attention at a particular aspect of experience of bodily tension and ease, mental tension and ease. 
Which is a support for this capacity to be aware of what's happening in the present moment. 
This amazing capacity. 
As the body and mind relax, perhaps you can let go of that particular exploration and then just see what's happening now. 
What's already available, easily available to be known. 
It may be body sensation, often that's a very obvious area of experience. 
Maybe the breath, maybe sound. 
It can approach this awareness of what's happening in the present moment from a kind of a receptive place. 
What is coming to us? It's kind of stepping back and letting experience come to you rather than choosing what to pay attention to. 
If you're not familiar with that, it can be a little wobbly at first. 
Just settling back and not having an agenda. 
What's here in this moment? And in this moment, it may change, probably will change. 
Kind of like settling back and letting things flow through us without having to hold on to anything. 
Without having to stop the flow. 
Oh, that's the next thing. 
No need to name what's coming. 
It's almost like being in a river and letting the water wash through. 
Thank you. 
And for some of you, it may feel simpler to approach this establishment of mindfulness from another direction, from a choosing what to be aware of. 
This is equally valid method, allowing the attention to connect with the breath, for example, or body sensation. 
Some area that's simple. 
There may be some ease in staying connected with that one area. 
In either case, the mind will wander. 
However, you're exploring being present in this moment, whether in a receptive mode or a directed mode, choosing what to attend to. 
While the mind is wandering, there's not much to do about it, but at some point there will be a recognition. 
Oh, the mind has been wandering, not been present. 
But that moment, that recognition, is mindfulness returning. 
And so in that moment, taking in, again, kind of where we started at the beginning, how are you in this moment? The mind wandering into thought, into memory, planning, whatever it is doing is a powerful shaping condition in the mind. 
It's very likely that wherever the mind has wandered, there's something that has been shaped. 
Some experience of body or mind. 
And so as soon as you recognize that, oh, I'm back. 
Taking in, and this is how it is right now. 
Giving yourself that opportunity to recognize that. 
And then opening to what's here in this moment. 
Whether that is just this flow, receiving whatever is available easily. 
Or for some of you, perhaps, choosing, directing, aiming the attention as a way to settle and establish this awareness that's curious about. 
That's this right now.
