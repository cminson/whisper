Viriya (2 of 5) : Right Endeavor  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on March 24, 2020  
 
 
Again, good morning. The theme for the  talks this week 
is effort. Yesterday I emphasized initiating effort. 
Initiating effort sometimes takes a lot of energy because  
the forces of distraction, preoccupation, or strong inner 
emotions or desires can sometimes take over, making it 
very hard to be present. Sometimes initiating effort 
takes a lot of effort  – sometimes  it takes very little. I n 
terms of meditation and being aware, i nitiating effort 
often has to be done over and over again .  
 
It’s not an incidental thing to keep beginning again. It’s a 
powerful conditioning: shaping, realigning, harmonizing, 
and resetting  us. What is it that drives us, that moves 
us? Where are we? How present , how aware  can we be 
in this life? 
 
As initiating effort takes hold, we begin to become a little 
more familiar with and able to see what is happening in 
the present moment. Maybe we can even dwell in the 
present moment more fully for some period of time  – 
just enough to see that we ha ve some choice about 
where we put our energy and effort. That comes with the second aspect of effort, which in the Buddha’s 
teachings is called “right endeavoring” or “right 
endeavor,” the sixth step of the Eightfold Path. It’s 
called ‘endeavor ’ because it  is what we are trying to do, 
what we are aiming towards in our practice.  
 
There is a very simple principle involved in 
understanding what right endeavor  is. It’s not a 
particular thing we do , but it is a way of finding our 
bearing s, our direction, what’s useful to do, what’s 
important to do. The analogy I’ll give for it is of a farmer 
growing plants for food. That farmer has four different 
activities that must be done in order to grow those 
plants. First, they must clear the ground , so that there is 
space for the plants to grow. The ground needs to be 
tilled and fertilized , so that the seeds can grow there. 
There is clearing away the weeds. The second step is 
that, if weeds do grow, one must remove them. The 
farmer  must keep tilling the soil to keep the weeds from 
growing. The next two principles are that the farmer 
needs to plant the seeds or the seedlings that will grow 
into a food plant. Then they must nourish the growth of 
the plants to allow them to keep growing : water, maybe 
fertilize, and protect them.  
 
In practice, t hese steps are called “avoiding, removing, 
cultivating, and maintaining. ” What this means in 
practice is that we want to remove and avoid unhelpful 
states of mind, unskillful activities, things  that are  psychologic ally, spiritually , or physically  unwholesome . 
We want to plant the seeds of what is  wholesome, 
skillful, helpful, or healthy. Once we have planted those 
seeds, we want to keep them going.  
 
Many years ago a friend told me about a kayaker in 
Alaska who came  up with his own analogy for these four 
right endeavors. A kayaker has to stay out of trouble out 
in the open sea. When the kayaker gets into trouble, 
they must get out of trouble. The y should cultivate good 
kayaking skills. And then the kayaker should mai ntain 
those skills.  
 
When we find ourselves meditating with enough 
presence of mind to recognize what is happening, we 
may have the capacity to  distinguish  between what 
leads to our detriment , suffering , or getting contracted 
and tight  – and what  direction leads to becom ing free of 
the suffering , contraction , tension , or pressure  in which 
we’re caught .  
 
One purpose of initiating effort in mindfulness practice is 
to bring us to being present enough that we  do begin to 
see, feel, sense, or perceive this very simple distinction 
between where the suffering, tension, pressure, or 
stress  is – and where we find non -suffering : that which 
is wholesome , freeing, opening, relaxing. What activities 
of mind  or body lean more in one direction o r in the 
other direction ? We want to s ee, and then make a very simple course correction, let ting go of what is harmful, 
unhealthy, unhelpful – and pick up what is heal thy.  
 
In terms of meditation itself, it might entail looking at 
how we are meditating . If we are present enough to see 
that we are meditating with striving or in a tense way, 
we can feel the tension , the pressure, and even the 
suffering, striving, pushing , expecting, demanding, or 
wanting something to happen. I have known people 
who’ve gotten headaches from trying so hard, push ing 
so hard to get something to happen.  
 
We can feel for ourselves, “Oh, this hurts! It’s not 
comfortable. It’s unhealthy to keep doing it.” Then we 
can ask , “Is there is another way ? Can we move to the 
other side , to what is wholesome? Can we bring a 
wholesome approach to mindfulness? Can we be more 
relaxed as we cultivate awareness of the present 
moment? How can we be relaxed and persistent? ” To 
see the difference between trying too hard and relaxed 
persistence  is very helpful.  
 
There might be things we are thinking about, or beliefs 
we have about meditation  that are operating . We might, 
for example,  believ e that it’s wrong to  have physical 
pain, or that we’re  a bad person for wandering off in 
thought , or that if we’re spiritual , we shouldn’t be 
thinking or feeling certain things. But if we pay careful 
attention to what it feels like to have those thoughts, we can feel the narr owing, constriction, dampening, and 
shutting down of the inner light. It hurts. There’s  an ouch  
in those kinds of thoughts  – so those are considered 
unwholesome or unhelpful for us. If we criticize 
ourselves for having those thoughts, that’s even more 
ouch , more unwholesome.  
 
Instead, what we do is to explore , and see if we can find 
other more appropriate  thoughts . Can  we cultivate other 
thoughts, look at other viewpoints in our experience ? 
One way, which is at the center of mindfulness practice , 
is to replace critical thoughts with equanimous 
awareness  – to have the thought that : 
This too is appropriate to experience right now. This 
too is appropriate to hold  in the field of open 
awareness. This too can be held as ok . This is how 
it is. I don’t have to be critical of it. I don’t have to 
support it. I don’t have to be engaged in it , but I can 
be simply aware of it.  
This kind of thinking is more helpful and more 
supportive. So, try to h ave th is thinking , and try to do it. 
Try to be there with it, not mak ing a problem with 
anything.  
 
This principle of right endeavoring is based on what we 
let go of and what we cultivate. Those are the two big 
areas  where the energy of Buddhist practice goes. 
Sometimes the focus is on letting go. Sometimes the 
focus is on cultivation , developing , or doing something wholesome or skillful.  
 
If you keep looking and reflecting on whether this is right 
endeavoring, then the very way you make the effort of 
right endeavor hopefully will be nourishing, satisfying, 
and relaxing. I say that because , for not a few , the 
language of effort is almost oppressive . It’s like a 
burden of striving , pushing , or walking up a steep hill.  
 
But always come back to being your own teacher, try ing 
to understand how you are  – understand ing if your effort 
is draining, contracting, stressful – or if it is supportive , 
easeful , and nourishing. Over time , we learn what is 
nourishing and supportive . We learn how good it is to 
make a certain kind of mindful effort  that it becomes 
more and more our home . The effort to be present 
becomes more and more second nature. We can settle , 
and be in the groove of being present.  
 
I hope that you can practice with initiating effort and 
right endeavor today.  
 
Tomorrow morning  we will take the next step in the se 
five talks  on energy and effort . Thank you for being 
here.
