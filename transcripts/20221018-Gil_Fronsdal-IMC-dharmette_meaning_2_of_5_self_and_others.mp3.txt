So, welcome to this second talk on a series of talks on the topic of meaning. 
Meaning, meaning-making, and relationship to meditation. 
And one of the areas that we. 
. 
. 
So, first I want to say is introduction that there's a clich√© that everyone is a philosopher, but they don't know it. 
Many people don't know it. 
And what that means, I think, is that everyone has a set of interpretations, meaning, understanding of what it means to be alive, what's important, what this life is about, that they operate from. 
Though sometimes it's not reflective, sometimes they don't even thought about it, haven't realized they're doing this. 
And part of a path of mindfulness is both to be reflective about this, to be clear and conscious, but also to discover what are some of the underlying assumptions, belief systems, interpretations that we are basing our life on. 
And as we sit quietly in meditation, it's possible to see these operate, and then also to question them. 
Some of them aren't really that helpful or healthy for us, and some of them are. 
To be able to distinguish between which is useful or not, which is inaccurate or not, is part of the wonderful power of meditation, of mindfulness. 
So one area that we can connect, one area of meaning-making and connection to meditation is our understanding of what it means to be a self and what it means to have other people in relationship to a self. 
That there's a lot of philosophy, a lot of ideas that come along with our notions of who we are and who others are and what that connection is. 
I think a wonderful story around this was some years ago, there was someone who did a study of different meditation centers. 
I think they're all in the United States. 
Some of them were primarily, the participants, the meditators, were primarily born and raised in the United States, culture-rated in his local United States-Yan culture, and some were culture-rated in an Asian culture that had a much stronger collectivist culture, a much stronger sense of communal sense of identity and who they are, whereas in the United States, many people who grew up in this culture have a much stronger sense of individuality and individual. 
So researchers studied these two different meditation centers and asked the participants, how was the retreat you did? They both did week-long retreats or something. 
How was the retreat and what did you gain or what was the benefits from the retreat? Both groups loved the retreat. 
It was fantastic. 
It was life-changing. 
So that they had in common. 
But when they discussed what they benefited from them and what way it was so great, in one way or the other, the people who had been raised in this local culture in the United States, they emphasized that they discovered who they are, they got a sense of real independence and freedom, and all the reference points were very individualistic. 
And those people who came from the Asian culture, they said, oh, I realized how much gratitude I have for my society, my family, how deeply connected we are, and I've appreciated so much more all the benefits I've received from my society, my family, my everyone, and the sense of connection and gratitude and being part of something was so powerful for me. 
And so in many ways, maybe they were having similar, you could say similar experience of settling, getting concentrated, becoming still, letting go of hindrances, but the meaning or the value that they took out of the experience, what they selected out of their experiences, this is what is important. 
It was so very different. 
One was very individualistic, one was more about how they are in their collective. 
And so this speaks to how, and often that's invisible, that we make the selections. 
It seems like this is natural. 
Of course, this is like, isn't this what it's all about? Because the view we have of what's important is not just taken for granted, it's built into the fabric of the universe that self is important and discovering the self. 
A similar thing happened to me many years ago where I was on a panel with a Christian minister, and I was kind of like the Buddhist teacher minister. 
And there also, the person that I was with was Asian, Asian-American, and I represented people from the United States, I guess. 
Europe was kind of this individualist, Norway where I'm from is very individualistic, maybe even more so sometimes than the way we are in the United States. 
And we were asked, you know, what brought you into Buddhism or into your religion? She was Christian. 
And for me, I was kind of happily, matter of fact, as if there was the most natural thing in the world back then, was talked about how, you know, finding myself or finding this inner freedom. 
And she talked about how her Christian faith, how much it put her into a community of fellow people in relationship to society and people. 
That was what was so meaningful for her and found a sense of belonging at home. 
And there again, we see this, you know, people entering into a religion have very different orientation of what they're looking for and what they want. 
So we also come with a lot of ideas, not just like that, but what it means to be an individual, what it means to be a self, what's important. 
And so when we sit down to meditate, it's part of what our motivation can be is about that self. 
It could be that we're, you know, we're looking for how to be a better, you know, get a career advancements. 
And so we've been told that we're too anxious. 
And so you need to meditate to get calmer and quieter because that's how you're going to, you know, be more respected at work. 
And so it's all about me attaining something, getting something. 
It could be that it could be, you know, it's another person has been told that, you know, you really don't fit into the community here very well. 
And you might try meditating because then you'll relax and start feeling more connected to the people around you. 
And so the meditation can have a different function for different people depending on what seems important for them. 
And then, so then also the locus of what's valued the most around the self is the self as an autonomous, independent person. 
What's most important and we have to realize that and find it or is a self as someone embedded in a system of relationships with other people. 
And somehow finding ourselves kind of connected to that embedment and embedded nature of society or social connections. 
That meditation is going to help us to really feel connected to that and feel much more part of it in a deeper and deeper way. 
I've seen, you know, my early years when I was first coming to Buddhism and was kind of here with a lot of new people coming to Buddhism, how many people, some people were really coming to find themselves. 
And what they found was instead of finding themselves, or maybe they did because they found themselves, then at some point they found themselves back into the deeper connection to the religion they grew up with. 
And so they will go back into a church or a synagogue or something and in a way that they then participated more in the collective life of it. 
Other people I've seen goes into Buddhism and also finds a sense of community there and that's what's kind of more important than the meditation. 
Because that's what they're culturally or personally, their philosophy, what they think is important. 
And some people, you know, just for some whatever reason find that their engagement with Buddhism is always very personal and they're happy to go off and be hermits and long periods of meditation without much connection to others. 
Is one better or worse than the other? I'd rather not think that way. 
There are all ways of organizing, meaning, purpose in this world of ours, and maybe they all have a place, they all have a role. 
There's a time and season for all things and there's a place and society for maybe all the different ways that we can construct our sense of self, our sense of meaning, our sense of being connected to others. 
And this is an adventure. 
It's kind of like a discovery. 
It's kind of like the, as I said in the meditation, kind of like the powers of ten. 
That meditation takes you into some deep, deep place, quiet still, letting go place. 
And then how do we interpret that around how we understand the self and what's important around the self and what the self is in relationship to needs and motivations and purposes and our place in this world in that deep place? Or what's that connection from that deep place of freedom as we come back to the powers of ten, back into the world, back into society? And not a few people have found themselves transformed so that their relationship and their understanding of what it means to be in relationship to other people has radically changed. 
A simple way of understanding would be that many people are codependent, very deep sense of neediness and need and really measuring their success and their well-being in relationship to other people and comparing themselves to other people. 
And to really delve deep into this kind of very powers of ten to go within, going within, within, letting go of the social world for a while can be transformative so that when we come back into the social world that the sense of neediness is not there anymore, the sense of comparing ourselves and measuring ourselves with other people. 
And then the social world can have a very different meaning than it had before. 
How much meaning it has, how important it is depends in part by the meaning-making understandings that we have about our place in the world and who we are and who we are in relationship to other people. 
And we shouldn't assume that two meditators share the same understanding in that range or in that of what's most important, where they most center their life and is it more in community or more in the individual and what other kind of secondary understandings come from that. 
So without saying any of us are right and wrong, I think that's very important. 
What I'd like to say is that it's important to become reflective about, to think deeply about, to realize what we're operating under, what are the assumptions, what are the beliefs we have around self, around others. 
And to dismiss this whole investigation of self, because Buddhism says there's no self kind of, not to focus on self, is it easy that we almost miss or not notice that we actually haven't, almost subconsciously, unconsciously deeply embedded notions and operating principles around what it means to be a self and what's important and what kind of selective process attention is used for to pick out and recognize and know in this world what's important. 
So I offer this with the hope that you will maybe spend some time today, maybe talking with friends and others, about your own central focus on understanding of what it means to be a self, an individual, and what beliefs and ideas come along with your sense of personhood and what is it to be in a person in society and what are the beliefs and ideas and understandings that come along with how you are embedded in society. 
Are you embedded or are you really removed? What's the connection there? And I hope that if you reflect deeply on these things and think about them, that when you come to do your meditation, some of those things can be put down, can be put to rest temporarily. 
And they won't be operating and turning away in some maybe quiet, deep way and allow something, some power of ten to open up for you, whether it's power of ten deeper and deeper in or power of ten further and further out. 
That's for you to discover. 
So thank you.
