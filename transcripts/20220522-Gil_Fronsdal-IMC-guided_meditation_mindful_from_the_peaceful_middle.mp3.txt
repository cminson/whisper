 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good morning everyone and welcome to IMC, in person and online. Just to say a few, just some brief words about the meditation practice. One of the wondrous, miraculous aspects of being a human being is having an equal ability to perceive what's happening externally to ourselves as it is to perceive what's internal to ourselves. And I like to think of mindfulness sometimes as sitting at the interface between the outer world and the inner world. And either one of those, or both of them, can be agitated, can be challenging. But the meeting place, the bridge, the interface between the inner and the outer, the mindfulness, that's a place where perhaps we can sit calmly. We can sit peacefully in our capacity to be mindful, that to explore what it means to be mindful, what it means to be aware peacefully, even if what we're aware of is not peaceful. And we have this ability because mindfulness sits not in the world, and not in the outer world, not in the inner world, but this magic place between the two. And with that kind of image and idea, maybe you can experiment today and sit here for the next half an hour with seeing what it's like to be aware of whatever's happening internally and externally, for the awareness, the perception of it, the mindfulness of it, is peaceful, even if the rest of you does not feel peaceful. So, assuming an upright posture, and to some simple way that's easy, maybe, setting your body at ease, taking a few long, slow, deep breaths and relaxing, setting your body at ease, perhaps relaxing the face, the shoulders, the belly. Maybe there's something about your mind you can set at ease, relaxing the pressure to think, and setting your heart at some ease, moving towards ease, no matter what challenges you have. And when we get preoccupied with the inner world, preoccupied with the outer world, there's a way in which awareness, attention, becomes narrow. When we're sitting in that interface, the meeting place of inner and outer world, and we're mindful of it from there, sometimes the mind can become broad, wide, aware of all things, but with awareness not troubled by any of it, you might be troubled, but mindfulness does not have to be, just aware. What is that place of peaceful awareness of what is? What is that place of peaceful awareness of what is? Are there any lines that you want to D Mindfulness. It can be aware of the outer world. They can be aware of the inner world. In a sense, mindfulness sits at the middle, and in that middle place. Mindfulness is also connected to our actions, what we do in response to our inner world, what we do in response to our outer world. And if awareness is agitated, so will our actions. If our awareness is peaceful, our actions will come out of that peace, carry with it qualities of the peace. May it be that whatever peace that we have from this practice, that it inspires us to act in the world with kindness, with wisdom, with compassion and care, may whatever peacefulness that we encounter support us in contributing to a better world for everyone. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free.
