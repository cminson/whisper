 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So... Hello, everyone. Thank you for being here. And... Today, the theme is release in relationship to emotions. Now, this process of being with emotions, to do so in a healthy, mindful way, increases our capacity to feel wholesome emotions. And one of those is joy, delight, kind of happiness. And it's useful when engaged in mindfulness to remember to allow for joy. It's maybe easy to overlook, easy to think other things are more important. But some degree of joy supports the process of waking up here in the present moment. And we might think about that release, letting go, is... Really works, really is significant or appropriate when there is something in the family of joy in the process of letting go of releasing. It feels good, it feels right. And so in these five kind of underlying themes, threads for each of these weeks, it's relaxation, recognition, respect, restoration, and release. Each of those steps has a little bit of release in it, each of the first four. And each of the first four, and having a little bit of release, it might be possible to look for a peaceful joy, a peaceful delight or well-being, appreciation that maybe is not valuative, it just kind of feels like it's part of it. So with relaxation, it's one thing to relax and appreciate and feel the good of it. But maybe it's possible to also appreciate a little joy or delight that, oh, this is good. This is a good fortune to be able to let go, to release all that. Recognition is also a kind of release, because when we learn the simplicity of recognition, really, simplicity is knowing something in and of itself. And then for that moment, at least, we've stepped away from being entangled with it, judging it, identifying with it, and just recognizing, oh, that's that. So if there is pain someplace in the body, it's difficult to be with pain, I don't want to belittle or minimize the difficulty. But in the moment of recognition, there is a kind of freedom, there's a kind of letting go. And it may be the last, just a fleeting moment of the recognition. But to learn to recognize the letting go, the release that happens in the recognition, and there's that potential in recognition. To respect what's happening is also a letting go of our disrespect, our entanglement, our caughtness. And there too, there's a kind of releasing of something that made the relationship maybe more complicated and need to be. And I think of deep respect to reality, to ourselves, to others, that there's a release that is joyful there. Rather than being subservient to offer respect to someone, it's actually a freeing of ourselves. Restoration, to feel, to allow for the movement of energy in the body, the healing, the processing, the unfolding of our life, to trust it and open to it and feel the goodness of how that unfolds, is also a kind of release, getting out of the way. And all this kind of sets the stage for appreciating the joy, the value, the wonderfulness of really being free, which is release. So I'm going to guide you in this today, a little bit more of an exercise perhaps, in two rounds of release, of going through these process, of these four or five processes, with the idea that each time there's a kind of release, and once just kind of do it to settle in, and once in relationship to emotions. So, and I apologize to those of you who want more silence for this, and hopefully you'll get it another time meditating on your own. So, to assume your meditation posture, and lower your gaze, and lower your gaze, can you relax your eyes? And with your eyes relaxed, if it feels appropriate, to close your eyes. And with your eyes closed, can you relax your gaze some more, letting your eyes rest in the eye sockets? And to make small, with your eyes closed, maybe you can be attuned, tune into your body a little bit more. Make small adjustments in your posture. And then as you take two or three, four deep inhales, let the exhale be a release, a letting go. A long, sustained, gentle letting go as you exhale. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And to go through the body to relax it some more as you breathe normally, but as you relax, if it's possible to relax these parts of the body, see if you can have some enjoyment of that, or some joy or appreciation, delight. It could be very, very faint, but see if you can recognize the goodness of letting go of relaxing. So, softening, relaxing the muscles of your face. Softening, relaxing the shoulders. As you exhale, relaxing the chest. And as you exhale, relaxing the belly. And as you exhale, a global relaxation throughout the body. And then to recognize a simple and relaxed, uncomplicated way that you can. Recognize how you are in the simplest way. And it's such a way that there's a little bit of letting go in the recognition, letting go of our judgments and entanglements. Letting go of being for and against. Recognition that's a kind of opening to experience. It has some modicum of joy, good feeling to let go of the entanglement. Just recognize, just let things be as they are and recognize them. And however you are right now, can you respect it? Letting go of anything that could be, that gets in the way of respect. Letting go of anything that doesn't honor. Whatever experience you have at this moment of being alive, any judgments or stories you have about who you are and what's happening, that doesn't respect the aliveness of the moment. And then to allow the restoration, to trust that there's something here within you. That if allowed to process, will heal and repair and cultivate, develop, unfold healthy way to let go of being the engineer of our experience. Let go of more judgments of it or resistance to it. And feel the goodness, the joy of allowing our system to find its way. And then we come to release. And with every exhale, let go. Let go of thoughts, let go of preoccupations, let go of preferences. And in the letting go, can you recognize some degree of joy or goodness in doing so? Thank you. And then ever so gently, see if you can make a very small smile with your lips, smile of joy. See if turning up the corners of your mouth produces any pleasant feelings for you, however subtle. And if there is any pleasant feeling or any joy, relax into that. Keep the half smile, but relax into the pleasure of it, the joy of it. Recognize the joy, the pleasure in the smile or in just being alive, breathing now. And in recognizing it, staying simple with it, letting go of complications and doubts and protests. Respecting your embodied capacity to feel joy, well-being, happiness. Breathe with it. And allow for restoration, healing. Allow for some kind of whatever wants to happen. As a simple joy, calm, quiet joy or well-being is given space to be here. And then release any grasping or holding, release any resistance or any stressful feelings related to how you are. And maybe feel the quiet joy of release. And then in the middle of it all, centering yourself on the breathing. And the more you give yourself over to breathing, the more all five of these processes, the five hours, have a chance to grow and unfold. Trusting yourself with the breathing, letting there be a joy in breathing in and breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. Breathing out. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, there's a letting go, releasing that allows us to turn our hearts out to the world, not as a duty or an obligation, but that the alternative is to stay closed or stay limited. And to allow our freedom, our liberation, our release, have a chance to become full. We also want to allow our capacity to feel, to know, to empathize, to be open to the world around us, to the people we know, our neighbors, our friends, strangers, people in our community. And what is it to let go so that we can capacity to empathize, to feel, to know, to connect, can grow so they can be a channel for our goodwill, our care for the world. And to turn our attention to offering care to the world at the end of a sitting is a way of supporting, protecting even our freedom. May it be that through our care, that we promote the happiness of others. May it be through our care that we support the safety of others. May it be through our presence that we offer a peacefulness to others. And may it be through our own freedom that we help spread a spiritual freedom in this world. May all beings everywhere be happy.
