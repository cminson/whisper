 Here we go. Okay. So hello and welcome everyone. Welcome to happy hour. So for today's practice, I'd like to talk about the secret to happiness. This is happy hour. So I figured we'd talk about the secret to happiness. What the subtitle of this practice will do might be the secret to happiness on Zoom. So the practice of metta, the practice of metta, wishing well, having kindness, good, goodwill, friendliness. For ourselves, others, people we know, people we don't know, people we like, people we don't like equal opportunity, friendliness, and goodwill as part of this cultivation. And it does make our heart happier. It makes us happier. So what I'd like to talk about specifically, the nuance that I like to bring in today is, you know, with the pandemic, many of us are still experiencing Zoom calls. They're not going to go away anytime soon. It is a part of the way we're going to be working remotely or perhaps also even if we go back to work with people who are not local with us. So teleconferencing, video chat, etc., video work will continue to be a part of the way both we work and maybe we socialize in groups. So this practice is, you know how we wish well, for example, you know, before the pandemic, the variation of this practice was stealth metta. If you got, if you were driving, you would wish metta for people on the road and you would be calmer, happier, you wouldn't be upset as much, especially if people cut in front of you would specially wish them well. Really in order to bring soothing and calm and ease to yourself and you would arrive at your destination feeling much better. Similarly, if you rode the subway or buses, you would be wishing well for everyone around. Now with what I'd like to bring in, and this is a Zoom practice meeting. Well, some people are on YouTube, but many of us are here on Zoom. You can see me, you can see each other. So this will serve as a perfect practice ground for many of the work meetings. So wishing well, so the idea, the invitation is that we will practice the wishing, wishing well for people who are on a meeting with us and we'll bring that, bring them to mind. You can start maybe if you wanted to, you're able to put in gallery view so you can choose someone to wish well for, kind of warm up your metta right now. But really what I'd like to focus on is a practice that we can take to our other Zoom meetings, other work meetings in this way. So why? Well, some meetings, actually many meetings, you might feel tired bored. It might be some like, I don't disagree. I don't agree with this person. I hear they're going on and on. You know, these little quirks we develop with people we know and work with. And actually choosing, choosing to find something that either you appreciate about them, you like about them, you like about them, or some way in which you are similar, the common humanity. Oh, yes, you, you're both dedicated to this work you are doing. You're both appreciate whatever project you're working on. And finding a way, finding a way to find common humanity. And for those of you who are retired, perhaps, I invite you to engage in this practice creatively, creatively. Cultivating metta is all about creativity. So find other ways. Maybe you are going for walks and seeing people in your neighborhood or going to the grocery store and, and feeling annoyed by someone's like, okay, they're taking forever during the whatever 10 or less items and they have 30 items, check out lane, you know, there are all these ways that that we find that that we get irritated. So stealth metta, this is stealth metta. And one one thing I want to bring in before we get into it into the practice is that some people say, well, when I'm in a meeting or doing something or other, it takes too much. It's too distracting to perhaps do metta for someone. Well, yes and no. So one idea could be before you go into the meeting, you know, spend a couple of minutes imagining people you'll be seeing you'll be either in a meeting with or even visiting in person again, be creative, you don't have to take it exactly the script that I will be talking about be creative, see what works for your life situation. Be your inner own inner Dharma guide. So can prime the heart either before and also what I have found is that if I don't do this practice, actually, I get more tired and more waned in my energy gets kind of waned in the meeting and my attention starts to not be here completely. Whereas actually, when I engage by no different people in the meeting, perhaps are talking, I wish them well, I even if I disagree, especially if I disagree with them, or there's something like, I wish you well, may you be well, and then I all of a sudden, I realize, oh, wow, I'm more attentive, I have more energy, I have more goodwill, I'm more present in this meeting, I don't feel like, oh, when is this going to be or I just I want to be done with me. So he changes the way I present, I show up, I'm present at the meeting, instead of actually being distracting, it's actually the opposite. So I challenge you gently to see that for yourself, to see that for yourself, how you can actually become even more present and available, your energy will be arisen, aroused, arisen. Anyway, there will be more energy present with this practice instead of it being a distraction. So, so I have said plenty to frame the practice. Let's practice together. I'd like to invite you to land, to land in your body, to arrive, to come here, right here, right now. Feeling your feet on the ground, or if you're sitting on the floor, feeling your whole upper side of your leg, feeling your feet on the ground, feeling your whole upper side of your leg, on the cushion, feeling your bottom on the chair, the cushion, the contact points relaxing, letting go of your body weight, into the contact points, relaxing, feeling the connection to the earth. Let's just hang out here, feeling connected. To the earth, sensing, feeling, appreciating the contact points. Thank you. Inviting your breath to move through the body, the lower part of the body. The abdomen, the contact points, enlivening, bringing more awareness to these sensations. Deeply rooted and connected to all the sensations. Fifty thousandanna same. Inviting the awareness to rest the lower abdomen, sensing the movement, the sensations of the breath.

As you are embodied, feeling your body sitting, lying down, standing. Perhaps bring to mind a recent scenario. Where you were with others. In a meeting, perhaps on Zoom. Again, feel free to adapt to what comes up for you. Feel yourself rooted in your body with your breath. Just take some time imagining yourself present. This meeting fully present in your body. Not leaving the body in order to be with others. Thank you. Stay with the body, staying with the breath. Feel in your presence while you are imagining being in this meeting.

Feeling your presence with others in this meeting or in this situation you've conjured up, something that has happened maybe earlier today or recently. And imagining yourself in relationship with these other beings. And as they speak or as they relate to you or as they're going about doing what they do in this interaction, wishing them well, one by one. Perhaps starting with the person who's easiest for you, the person who's easiest. You have the most warmth, ease, care, appreciation perhaps for them. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you have ease. Either sharing these meta phrases or whatever meta phrases you like or perhaps without words.

These are the people we are serving with We haven't chosen them. They're kind of like our family We don't choose our family and yet they can serve as our teachers and there's so much so And as you were saying in the meetings where it could in the Previously was a waste of time now.

Please spread it any other reflections or thoughts You're noticing that maybe it was challenging too is welcome Hey Hi, this is Megan I was thinking of a zoom meeting that I had By phone last week with people I have yet to meet I have a lot of people to meet. I just moved here to California. So welcome. Welcome to California, Megan but it's also kind of scary and there's a lot of nerves and just a lot of like self thing when it comes to Starting over and being in all of these groups and so it was really helpful to like to bring met To that with all these people haven't actually met in person yet and think about like little things I've heard That I just really appreciated about them So I'm gonna try it in real life. We'll see how it goes That's awesome. That's great. I love that and also the action ability of Of you know things that you've heard you appreciate the bottom. Oh, yeah, yeah here it is I'm letting that be the basis and also, you know as we know metta is is a antidote for Fear anxiety, you know various flavors of it. So Especially in the new situation made made support you made profoundly support you make it. That's great Thanks for your reflection Thank you Marnie Christine says in chat. I would like a life subscription to the happiness club That's great. You already have one I love it. I love it. Mike. Christine is great very sweet Another thing also again, feel free to raise your hand Another thing i've i've also done in the past is sometimes you know, if people have a virtual background, that's one thing, but if they if in their environment, sometimes in the background, you can see something that oh, yes, they like art, or oh, they have a child's painting, you know, drawing in the back, oh, maybe they're a parent, maybe they're a grandparent, there's something there's a way that you can really connect with them. There's so many ways to be creative and create the connection. So speaking of that, we are in a Zoom meeting, dear ones, let's take this as an opportunity for metta for one another. So in a moment, we will be in small groups, small practice groups. And let's start by, let's start by 15 seconds of metta silent metta for each other. And then you can share as little or as as much as you like, but maybe in the background have a sense of metta for yourself in this small breakout groups with others really actively and see how it goes. So, so I'll create the breakout room rooms now. And they are open and enjoy. Welcome back, everyone. So we have a few minutes for any reflections, questions, what you notice, what you observed, especially doing this, practicing this in real time, especially if you're new, if you haven't spoken before, we'd love to hear from you. Your observations are important. Yes, Terrence. I just want to say how important this group practice is. I was, you know, before the small group thing, I was this feeling kind of turned inward and not very happy. You know, we're doing happy hour, right? I've been a little group just talking with three other people. I felt the shift. Now, thank you for this group. Yay. Nice. Thank you. Thank you, Terrence. Yay. Thank heavens for community. Yeah. And for happy hour community. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for that. Yeah, I see hearts showing up on Zoom. Yeah. And the human connection. Yeah. The connection in this way and the safe supportive, as safe as supportive as we can make it and taking care of each other, really. Yeah. Glad to hear it. Thank you, Terrence. Other reflections, please. Yes. Melanie. Hi. Hi. Yeah. I was feeling the same level of gratitude for the breakout room. And there's one person in particular that I've happened to be in a breakout room with a number of times, just seems a bit coincidental, but there were a few, maybe three or four times, we've been in the same breakout room together. And he isn't here right now, but we did the exercise together once of what brings you joy, I think. There was something where we repeatedly asked each other the same question. I think it was like, what makes your heart soar? I think that was the actual question. And he was talking about how he loves going to St. Bart's and running and swimming naked in the beach. And he's actually not on the call right now. But I was like, oh, now I just think of such joy. He's not here, but I feel this image of feeling so happy for him. Maybe he made it to St. Bart's and that's why he's not dialing in. And so I think that was key to what you were saying of just getting to know little parts of someone, especially what makes them really happy. And then being able to think of those, it makes it much easier for the meta to flow for them. Beautiful. Thank you, Melanie. I love it. It just makes my heart sing also as you talk about this, makes me so happy. It's lovely. That's a lovely, lovely note to end on. Thank you both for those reflections at the end, both Terrence and Melanie and everyone else we shared earlier. So thank you all for your practice. Thank you for showing up to happy hour, supporting yourself and others in the world. This cultivation of goodwill, friendliness, meta, may all beings be happy. May all beings be free, including yourselves. Thank you. And now I'll stop.
