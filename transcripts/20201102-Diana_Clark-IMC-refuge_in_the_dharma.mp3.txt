The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Welcome, welcome. I want to say good evening because it's evening for me but
whenever you're listening to this, whether it's the morning, the afternoon,
and wherever you are right now, welcome.
So this is a talk tonight. It will be the second in a series that I am doing on
refuge. Just kind of exploring this topic and I have to say for me it's turned out to
be really tender, much more than I expected it to. Maybe in some ways we think like,
oh refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, that's old or tired or I've heard that a
bazillion times and for those of you who have done a lot of retreat practice know
that it's the custom to do the refuges at the beginning of each retreat and there's
a little talk. So I want to keep it a little bit fresh and new and kind of
explore this maybe in a little bit different way than perhaps we've heard it before.
So last week was refuge in the Buddha. Tonight will be refuge in the Dharma and
next week will be refuge in the Sangha. And each week I'll unpack a little bit more
about what does refuge mean as well as talk about either the Buddha, the Dharma or
the Sangha. So last week I talked about refuges being an orientation, kind of like
it turning towards a direction that we're going. And tonight I'd like to talk more
about refuge being a transformation. And one way to explore this is that the
commentaries, that is these texts that were written maybe around 800 years after
the time of the Buddha, maybe up to a thousand years. And for some Buddhists,
they hold the commentaries as authoritative and some other Buddhists not so much.
But however we hold them that they always have some interesting ideas for us to
explore and investigate. And they describe refuge as something that slays.
Kind of like this idea of slaying, kind of like whew with the sword in some way. Slays
fear. Slays affliction and refuge slays dukkha. So maybe to unpack that a little
bit, if refuge is something that slays fear, affliction and dukkha, then we can
imagine or consider that going for refuge is a process of putting an end to dukkha.
And how does that work? Maybe going for refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha
is a way that puts our experience in perspective. That sometimes just simply
saying, oh yes, this is dukkha, is a way that helps us to not get swept away, not
get lost in, not get overwhelmed by the experience, even though the experience
may be terribly difficult, may be suffering, or even if it just may be mild
stress, whatever it might be. Sometimes to just recognize, okay, this is dukkha.
It's a way that can help put it in perspective. And in the same way to
recognize that we're not the only ones that have this experience, that part of
the Buddha's teachings is that there is dukkha, there is suffering in this world
and the human experience. And we're not the only ones. So helps put our
experience in perspective and that way can help maybe slay some of the fear
or affliction. Also this going for refuge or taking refuge in the Buddha, Dharma
and Sangha helps the fear of the future or bitterness of the past help them to
be diminished and eventually just simply put to rest. In the sense that with
this practice we recognize that the role that conditions have, that is we can
put in place conditions, that it's more likely that there'll be some ease and
happiness in our future. We begin to understand, to behave ethically, to
gain clarity, to understand ourselves better is a way in which we can create
a future that has more well-being and more ease. Not only for us but for those
around us, those we care about, if we're behaving ethically or if we're gaining
some more clarity, some wisdom. So to take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma,
Sanghas, some way that we can have less fear about the future and also we can
start to understand the past. Oh yes, those were the conditions that were in
place and like of course things unfolded that way. I didn't understand things
or I was felt overwhelmed by my experience and I did the best that I
could at the time or maybe that person did the best that they could at that
time but they didn't understand or didn't have the capacity to hold things so
they acted out. So in this way there can be less bitterness about the future,
I'm sorry but the past, which can bring more ease, less affliction. And also if we
are going for refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, there can be a sense of
direction or maybe even a sense of purpose for our life and for some people
their Buddhist practice or the Buddhist teachings become like an organizing
principle that which helps them to make sense of their life and also help them
to prioritize how they're going to spend their energy, their effort, their resources.
Going for refuge can be a way and say okay this is important, this is what I'm
going to do with my life, I'm going to support this. And so many ways having a
direction for our lives, maybe even a purpose for our life to find greater and
greater ease and freedom for ourselves and for others can be a tremendous
support and maybe there can be some slaying around the affliction of this
wondering what should I be doing. Maybe the Dharma taking refuge doesn't give us
the particulars in which ways we should be, the particulars of what we should be
doing with our life or with this hour or with this day, this era, this season.
But maybe it clarifies what we shouldn't be doing.
Maybe it helps us to get in contact with which more our inner life, our inner
experience which makes it more clear what we should be doing or can be doing.
So in some way we could say it's a way that Dharma slays fear, slays affliction
and slays dukkha. But when we say the Dharma what do we mean?
So tonight I want to talk about two ways we can talk about the Dharma. One is
as the natural unfolding of experience. I'll unpack this a little bit so that's
kind of like just the natural laws or sometimes when we talk about Dharma in
this way it's closely associated with the words truth or law or natural
something like that. And of course we can also talk about the Dharma as the teaching
of the Buddha. And in this way we can think of the Dharma as support. And the word
Dharma is derived from the root der which means to hold, to bear, to support.
The verb that comes from that root der is dareti and that's often translated as
to carry or to hold. And for me I like this idea of the Dharma being able to
hold everything. It's not a perfect analogy but I like this idea that the
Dharma can hold everything and can support whatever is arising or whatever
our experience might be. So to begin with this idea of Dharma as the way things
are, the truth, the nature, the law of things, there's this quote in the sutras
that says whether there is an arising of a tatāgata or no arising of a tatāgata
so a tatāgata is the Buddha and this is the way that the Buddha often refers to
himself. So when he's speaking he refers to himself as the tatāgata.
Whether there is an arising of a tatāgata or no arising of a tatāgata that
element still persists. The stableness of the Dharma, the fixed course of the Dharma.
A tatāgata awakens to this and breaks through to this. So in this way they're
saying that the Dharma is something that the Buddha awakens to. So these laws or
truths or nature or reality or something like that. And then this sutra passage
continues by saying that a tatāgata awakens to this and breaks through to
this and having done so the tatāgata explains it, teaches it, proclaims it,
establishes it, discloses it, analyzes it and elucidates it. So on this passage,
so clearly the Dharma is more than just the Buddha's teachings and maybe I'll
talk from another passage that elucidates this or fleshes this out a little
bit. What are some of these truths or laws or nature? And this is a story
where there's a king. He's an elderly king and he looks out and he sees that
there's this monk but he recognizes the person and knows that this person comes
from a very wealthy and very high-standing family. And he's young and
this monk is very young and the king is wondering why would somebody who comes
from this has all the comforts of life and you know with young and has enough
wealth to have whatever is available and it comes from a well-respected family.
Why would a person like that ordain and become a monk underneath the Buddha?
So this king goes to the monk and asks him and the monk Rattapala was
pretty skilled I would say in the way that he responded to the king and he
spoke to the king using examples that the king could relate to, that is the
monk wasn't talking about renunciation, giving away everything and the monk
wasn't talking about these esoteric meditative attainments or anything like
that. Instead he used examples and language that a king could respond to,
could relate to. So Rattapala says, great king, the blessed one who knows
and sees the fully awakened Buddha has taught these four summaries of the Dharma.
And it was after knowing and seeing and hearing these that I went forth from
the lay life to homelessness. That's the expression when a monk ordains
is to go from the lay life to homelessness. And then of course the king
wants to know well what are these four summaries of the Dharma that would cause
this person to ordain and to go forth. And maybe I'll just say that I've been
kind of playfully in my mind I've been thinking about these just batting them
around as these four summaries of the Dharma as four laws of Dharma dynamics.
In some ways you'll see they're expressing empirical facts and maybe it's
not the same thing as the conservation of energy or talking about entropy
but it's fun to think about the four Dharma dynamics, four laws of Dharma
dynamics of these four summaries. So the first summary is the summary of the Dharma
that Rattapala says to the king is the world is unstable and swept away.
And maybe naturally the king asks for clarification what does this mean?
And Rattapala responds by well what do you think great king when you were
twenty or twenty-five years of age were you proficient at riding elephants
horses and chariots and archery and were you strong and capable?
And the king responds I was asked Rattapala sometimes it seems as if I had
superpowers then I don't see anyone who could have equalled me in strength.
So you can imagine here's a king who's aged and when he's looking back it
maybe feels like superpowers what we used to be able to do when we were twenty
or twenty-five. And then Rattapala asks the king what do you think these days
are you just as strong and capable? And the king responds no.
Now I am old, elderly, senior and sometimes I intend to step in one place
but my foot goes somewhere else. In my mind I'm kind of like whoop you know just
it's true right that we have we're less steady as we age.
And maybe we might think of this as one summary of the Dharma.
The Buddha has said the world is unstable and swept away.
Maybe we could understand this as that aging happens.
Of course no one gets younger as time passes.
The passage of time is associated with aging.
And this is maybe the first law of Dharma dynamics.
So the second summary that Rattapala gave to the king is saying is the world has
no shelter and no savior. And the king asks what does this mean?
And Rattapala responds by saying in this royal court you can find, I'm sorry,
the king says what does this mean? There's confine no shelter and no savior.
In my court you can find divisions of elephants and calvary and chariots and
infantry and they will defend us from any threats.
Yet you say that there is no shelter and no savior.
How should I understand the meaning of this statement?
And Rattapala says well great king do you have any chronic ailments?
And the king says yes I do.
And even sometimes my friends and colleagues and relatives and family members
surround me thinking well the king will surely die now.
So the king is sick and sometimes he gets very sick.
And Rattapala says to him well what do you think?
Can you get your friends, colleagues, relatives and family members to help?
Can you ask them, all of you here can you share my pain so that I may feel less pain?
That is can others take away your pain, your physical pain?
Or must you alone feel your pain?
And the king responds I can't get my friends and family to share my pain.
Rather I alone must feel it.
And so this is what the Buddha was referring to when he said the world has
no shelter and no savior.
He said we can't transfer our physical pain to another.
We can't give it to someone else or they can't take it from us.
Sure of course we have medicine and people are a support for us
but we can't just make it go away.
We can diminish it or find ways to work with it.
But having chronic ailments perhaps or some physical pain is part of the human experience.
Maybe this is the second law of Dharma dynamics.
The third summary that the Buddha gave was the world has no owner.
You must leave it all behind and pass on.
And the king asked for clarification with this means saying in my court
you can find abundant gold that is stored in dungeons and towers
and yet you say the world has no owner you must leave it all behind and pass it on.
How should I understand the meaning of this?
And Rattapala says well what do you think great king?
These days you amuse yourself supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
The five sense stores, hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, tasting.
But is there any way to ensure that in the next life that is whatever happens after death
that you will continue to amuse yourself in the same way
or will others make use of this property?
Will you pass on while you die according to your deeds?
That is whatever happens to you after your next life will be according to your deeds.
So pointing to the teaching on rebirth.
And the king responds there's no way to ensure that I will continue to amuse myself in the same way after I die.
Rather others will take over this property and I will pass on according to my deeds
going to whatever arises after death.
So this is what the Buddha was referring to when he said the world has no owner
you must leave it all behind.
So this idea that we can't take it with us
and maybe I'm pointing to this idea that ownership is really only a convenient social convention.
We don't really own things in the sense that we can't take that with us.
I mean this is the third law of dharma dynamics.
And then the fourth summary that the Buddha gave is the world is wanting
insatiable the slave of craving.
And the king asks for clarification.
What does this mean?
And Rattapala asks him well do you dwell in this prosperous land of Kuru?
And the king says yes indeed I do.
And Rattapala says well what do you think great king?
Suppose a trustworthy and reliable person were to come from the east
and they would approach you and say please sir you should know this
that I'm coming from the east and there I saw a large country
that is successful and prosperous and full of people
and they have many divisions of elephants, calvaries, chariots and infantry
and plenty of money and lots of grain.
And with your current forces you can conquer it and you should conquer it.
Go conquer it great king.
And what would you do if somebody came to you and said that?
And the king responds and says I would conquer it and dwell there.
Well what do you think great king?
Suppose a trustworthy and reliable person were to come from the west
a person were to come from the north, a person were to come from the south
come from all directions and saying oh just over there
there is this great country that has lots of people
and just money and grain and everything we need and you can conquer it.
Then what would you do?
Well so this is what that Buddha was referring to when he said the world is wanting
insatiable this slave of craving.
The king doesn't, the king responds it's incredible Master Rattapala
it's amazing how well said this was by the Buddha
for the world is indeed wanting insatiable a slave of craving.
So maybe that there's this always wanting or there's no freedom
and always trying to find more and more and more
trying to satisfy every single desire.
Maybe that's the fourth law of Dharma Dynamics.
So in these four different summaries
there's also a pointing to Rattapala and his wisdom the way that he's talking to the king
saying that aging arises but the first law of
maybe I should stop calling him that
when you're saying that the world is unstable and swept away
saying that aging arises
when you're saying that the world has no shelter and no savior
saying that sickness arises
and saying that the world has no owner
you must leave it all behind and pass on
saying death arises
and saying that the world is wanting insatiable the slave of craving
saying that there is dukkha
old age sickness and death and dukkha
many of you will recognize this
maybe the first three certainly is heavenly messengers
and the fourth one, often the fourth heavenly messenger
is a monastic, a mendicant
somebody who's striving to find an end to dukkha.
So just as the four heavenly messengers
were a support for the Buddha
to go forth and find the Dharma
and the four heavenly messengers in some way were for Rattapala
and maybe all of us can find in some way that we're like that king too
and maybe hearing some of the Dharma taking refuge in the Dharma
is a way in which we recognize that there is old age sickness and death
and there's dukkha
and to take refuge in the Dharma is to not run away from this
and pretend that it's otherwise
or to think that somehow if we just finally get all our daks in a row
these things will go away
but instead to take refuge in the Dharma
can be to recognize, yes, this is the way things are
and how can I create the conditions
how can I live a life
how can I practice in such a way that honors my experience
and helps me to find a way that's
with less suffering, with less dukkha, with less stress
and to find a place of safety
to align ourselves with the nature
the natural way that things are
these, the laws of nature
so maybe it's a little bit silly
to call these the laws of Dharma dynamics
but maybe in the same way that the laws of thermodynamics
make it abundantly clear
of course there can be no perpetual motion, machine
what do the laws of the Dharma make clear for you
and can you take refuge in that?
we all can use some refuge these days
this feeling of safety
a place where we feel supported
so in whatever way makes sense for you
may you find refuge in the Dharma
thank you
