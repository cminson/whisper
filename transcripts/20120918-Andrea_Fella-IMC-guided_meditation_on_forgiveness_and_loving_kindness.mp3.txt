So this morning I'll do a guided meditation. 
Again, we've been following the theme of loving kindness practice. 
And so I'll offer a guided meditation related to loving kindness practice, which is a different style than the usual mindfulness practice. 
We, instead of just noticing what's coming moment to moment, we actively incline our attention towards qualities of kindness, of caring. 
And this morning I'll also include a little bit on forgiveness. 
So we'll begin with a little bit of a forgiveness practice. 
And this is done through consciously using phrases in our mind, so using thought in our mind to encourage the qualities of forgiveness, of kindness, of caring, of compassion. 
But it's a blend of using thought and being mindful. 
Because with each thought we connect with in our meditation practice, and I'll offer the thoughts that I'd like you to explore, with each thought we come back and then check in, how did that impact me to allow that thought in my mind? Thoughts actually have a pretty strong impact on us at times, and we can begin to use thought more skillfully and consciously. 
So the guided meditation this morning, I'll begin with some general forgiveness practice, and then move into a loving kindness practice, a meta practice, the Pali word for loving kindness, meta. 
We'll move into a meta practice that begins with ourselves and someone for whom it's easy to wish kindness for, and then out to all beings. 
So beginning this morning by allowing yourself to relax and be as comfortable in your body as you can. 
Perhaps taking a few breaths through the area of your heart. 
I sometimes like to begin a period of loving kindness practice by thinking of breathing through my heart. 
And if it helps you, you could explore putting your hand on your heart as a way to connect with this area. 
There's no right or wrong about what you feel there. 
Connect with the experience that's there now. 
Forgiveness practice. 
We'll start with some forgiveness practice. 
Forgiveness practice isn't about saying that what happened was good or even okay, but it's about letting go of holding that you have in your heart or resentment. 
It's about allowing there to be a letting go of barriers that you've created. 
So we'll begin by allowing yourself to recall ways in which you've hurt other people in small ways, perhaps, or even some larger ways, many ways that we cause harm, even unintentionally at times. 
And sometimes even these unintentional ones, especially these unintentional ones, can really linger with us. 
Just allowing yourself to remember and visualize the ways in which you've hurt others. 
Feel what happens for yourself as you connect with this. 
There may be feelings of sadness or regret. 
Allow yourself to feel that. 
Not to restrict yourself from feeling that. 
Sometimes we have barriers in ourselves. 
See if you can also connect with your own confusion or pain or fear that may have contributed to those things that you've done. 
With each memory or recollection holding that recollection in your heart and feeling what you feel around it, the sadness, the regret, the ache. 
And as you recall that to the person that you harmed. 
Ask for their forgiveness for any way that I've harmed you intentionally or unintentionally. 
I ask for your forgiveness. 
I ask for your forgiveness. 
Allowing yourself to spend a few moments. 
Maybe another couple of minutes with this aspect of the reflection bringing up ways that you've harmed others. 
Ealing the feelings and asking for forgiveness. 
Ealing the feelings and asking for forgiveness. 
Ealing the feelings and asking for forgiveness. 
Ealing the feelings and asking for forgiveness. 
And now coming back into your heart and just noticing what you're experiencing in the area of your heart. 
No right or wrong to what you're experiencing. 
Breathing through the area of your heart and just feeling. 
Allowing your feelings. 
Now we'll explore forgiving ourselves. 
There are many ways that we do things that harm ourselves. 
Ways that we out of confusion or fear or pain act in ways that are not the most helpful for ourselves. 
Allowing yourself to recall these ways that you've harmed yourself. 
Again just recognizing the feelings. 
Feelings of regret, pain or sorrow even of self-betrayal. 
Sense the possibility of releasing these feelings through allowing, not through pushing away, but through opening to. 
For each situation that you recall ways that you've harmed yourself. 
Expressing the thought or the wish for the ways I've harmed myself intentionally or unintentionally. 
Out of fear or confusion I forgive myself. 
Allowing yourself to stay connected with the experience in the area of the heart. 
Just notice what happens as you explore forgiving yourself. 
I forgive myself. 
And if it's hard to forgive yourself, if it feels like it's not possible at this moment to forgive yourself. 
You could use instead the phrase, May I forgive myself someday and see how that touches you. 
Continuing for the next few minutes to explore this aspect of forgiving yourself. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Allowing yourself now to come back and connect with the area of your heart again and breathe through your heart. 
Just noticing what's happening. 
Noticing any feelings that may have been aroused. 
Allowing anything, everything within the stillness and silence of meditation. 
Everything is okay. 
All the feelings that are coming up are okay. 
Now we'll explore forgiveness for those who have hurt or harmed you in some way. 
Many ways that people harm us through their actions or even inactions. 
Things they do, things they don't do. 
Things they say or don't say. 
Sometimes knowingly, sometimes unknowingly, acting in ways that cause pain or harm to you. 
Allow yourself to connect with these memories of ways that people have harmed you. 
Feel the sorrow, the burden, the pain, the resentment, anger, frustration. 
That's been carried in your heart around these incidences. 
And imagine the possibility of being able to release these difficulties, release these burdens of resentment. 
And for each of these incidences, again expressing the wish that you may forgive. 
For ways that you have harmed me intentionally or unintentionally, I forgive you. 
Again, if this is too difficult or feels not possible in this moment, you might use. 
May I forgive you someday, connecting with the intention to be able to release these burdens of holding non-forgiveness. 
Forgiveness is about releasing the burdens we're carrying. 
Again, it's not about condoning any action. 
For the next minute or so, exploring this aspect of forgiveness practice. 
In whatever way you may be able to connect with offering forgiveness. 
Or the hope that someday you may be able to offer forgiveness. 
And if the pain is too strong to make even that wish. 
Allow yourself to hold that pain and be forgiving of yourself that this is where you are right now. 
I forgive myself for not being able to forgive right now. 
I forgive myself for not being able to let go, for not being ready to let go. 
Forgiveness can't be forced. 
It's a release rather than an act of will. 
Allow yourself again to connect in the area of your heart and noticing what's happening in the area of your heart. 
Whatever is there, allowing, accepting, opening to the experience in the area of your heart. 
Now we'll move into an exploration of loving kindness and bringing to mind someone who's helped you in your life. 
Someone for whom it's fairly easy to feel a sense of connection. 
Pick a being that makes you smile. 
Holding this being in your heart. 
Allowing yourself to recollect things that you appreciate about this being. 
Qualities that you appreciate. 
Or perhaps ways that they've supported you. 
When holding this being in your mind, perhaps with an image or maybe a sense of being with them. 
Beginning to express wishes of goodwill towards this person. 
May you be happy. 
With each wish of goodwill, allowing yourself to feel into the area of your heart and notice. 
How does it impact you to make that wish? May you be healthy. 
May you be safe. 
May you live with ease. 
Allowing yourself to join your benefactor. 
Imagine the two of you together. 
Envisioning yourself and exploring things you appreciate about yourself. 
If that's hard for you, see if you can envision or imagine things that this other being appreciates about you. 
Now the exploration will be to wish that the two of you will be well, happy, peaceful. 
May we be happy. 
May we be healthy. 
May we be safe. 
May we live with ease. 
In this way consciously connecting to the possibility of wishing well to others, not at the expense of your own happiness. 
Again with each wish, checking in. 
How does it feel? What's the impact of making that wish? May we be happy. 
May we be healthy. 
May we be safe. 
May we live with ease. 
Now allowing other friends to join you in a circle. 
Dear friends, people you care about. 
Allow your friends to join you and let anybody who wants to come, come to the circle. 
Envision the group of you again, wishing all of you well. 
May we all be happy. 
May we be healthy. 
May we be safe. 
May we live with ease. 
Continuing for the next few minutes in silence with yourself. 
Envisioning this group of friends and people who supported you. 
Anybody who wants to come. 
It may be from time to time you get specific images of specific people. 
Let's find to linger with that person for a few moments. 
Allow others to come in. 
Continue wishing. 
May we all be happy. 
May we be safe. 
May we be safe. 
May we be safe. 
May we be safe. 
May we be safe. 
And now allowing this circle to expand. 
To include even people that you don't know very well. 
People you see on the street. 
People you come into contact with in various businesses or perhaps at your work. 
People you see but don't know very well. 
Allowing them to join this circle of well wishing. 
Continuing to express these wishes. 
May we all be happy. 
May we be safe. 
And now allowing this circle to become so big that encompasses everybody on the planet. 
People you don't know in other countries. 
People you don't know in other states. 
Including all the beings on the planet. 
Not just the people. 
The whales, the polar bears, the raccoons, the snakes, the mosquitoes, the bed bugs. 
The deer, the kittens. 
The people in the South Pacific. 
The people in China and Russia and Afghanistan and Iran and Iraq. 
Everyone, all beings on the planet. 
And begin to express the wish. 
May all beings be happy. 
Again with each wish noticing how it impacts you. 
May all beings be healthy. 
And consciously recognizing you are one of all beings. 
As you wish happiness for all beings. 
You are including yourself. 
May all beings be safe. 
May all beings live with ease. 
Continuing for the last minute of the sitting. 
To wish all beings everywhere these thoughts of goodwill. 
Thank you for watching.
