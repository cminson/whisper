Now we come to the fifth of the five talks about refuge, 
saraṇa. And so the concluding thoughts about this 
topic. One of the strong emphases I've made in these 
first four talks is how much the Buddha himself did not 
emphasize refuge in Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, 
especially not as something external. But rather he kept 
pointing  more often than not back to one's own 
experience, and in oneself. When, in oneself one finds 
refuge or one makes a refuge for oneself, that refuge is 
found essentially, the most deeply, in the absence, in 
the letting go, and the destruction of these  human 
tendencies for greed and hatred and delusion.

And one of the ideas that is associated with refuge in 
this focus on discovering refuge, is a compound word in 
Pāli, avecca -pasāda . Some translators will translate it 
as "unshakable confidence" or "unw avering faith." And 
it's kind of powerful the idea of unshakable or 
unwavering, like we know something so clearly, that it 
can't be taken away. This is what the basis of our life is. 
The word avecca  that's translated as ‘unshakable ’ 
means “what is known fo r oneself. ” What one knows. 
What one has come to know. And so, even though 
unshakeable maybe speaks to what it feels like, it again 
points to what is known.  
 
When the Buddha was most clear about what's known 
is that we know the difference between a mind o r a 
heart that is caught up in greed, hatred and delusion, 
with  avariciousness or conceit or resentments or envy  
– and a mind that is not . He goes through a list of a 
whole bunch of unhealthy mind states, painfully. The 
word is afflictive . It hurts us to have these mind states. 
We don't like to have them , and we really know what it's 
like not to have them – to have them drop away, to 
know it in such a strong , qualitative way. Now I know 
this is possible , and this is worthwhile to base one's life 
on, to go in this direction, this freedom. And now one 
knows what the Buddha Dharma Sangha is about. The 
unshakable faith in Buddha Dharma Sangha comes    
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 3 - from knowing in oneself, what those three are really 
pointing to or what they really represent.  
 
So I've been emphasizing how much it's here in 
oneself. However, it is at the same time a radical, letting 
go of self so that we're not really self -centered. But we 
become, in a sense, situation -centered. It's not really 
right to say that instead of being self-centered, we're 
other -centered. That lends itself to some of the same 
problems that can exist with being self -centered, just in 
a very different way. But the idea of self -centered or 
situation -centered, is to understand  it is the conceit of 
self – the attachments to self, and all the complicated 
ways we get entangled with ideas of who we are  – that 
interfere s with our ability to see clearly , and feel clearly , 
and participate in the world in a clean way. We let go of 
the self -preoccupation , which is itself stressful and 
suffering . You can feel that it doesn't feel good to be in 
it if you're really sensitive.  
 
But instead of being other -centered, it's to still b e 
centered here in this situation. So we really take into 
account what's happening here in this body of ours. 
We're conscious, responsible, clear about what we feel, 
what we believe, what we're thinking. And we are clear 
and aware of what's happening aroun d us. There isn't 
this sharp line or wall or barrier between self and other, 
but there is clear awareness of both. So we can find our 
way, and be in a healthy relationship with all things.     
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 4 -  
What I want to point to when I say that this notion of 
going for refuge in Buddha Dharma Saṅgha represents 
one of the deep experiences or expressions of Buddhist 
faith is that in its essence, it is also a way of saying , “I 
trust something ; I have faith in something that is 
different than my little self, my self -preoccup ation, my 
conceit ” – all these problematic ways in which we 
construct a sense of self and defend it and assert it , and 
do all these things. Many people, whether it's conscious 
or unconscious, have so much focus on themselves  
that it's almost like that's wh at they have faith in. In our 
culture, sometimes family  and schools will often 
reinforce this faith we have, this sense of importance of 
the self.  
 
I remember when a friend of mine moved here from 
Japan, and put her child in kindergarten, she was 
horrifie d at the ways in which the kindergarten was 
immediately trying to create kids who all thought that 
they were special, and highlight their specialness. It's 
certainly a wonderful thing in some ways for people to 
feel like they're special. But to have it sol idify as a way 
of viewing oneself , and needing to be a certain way can 
cause suffering. And so this practice of meditation, this 
practice of going for refuge, is to trust something that's 
other than the small self, other than the contracted, 
constricted se lf. To trust nature, to trust something, 
some people might say that's larger than self, more    
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 5 - glorious than this little self. It's not a diminishment of 
who we are. It's an enhancement. It's heightened, what 
it looks like from the outside ; it's real confide nce. It's a 
real willing ness  to show up and be present , and 
intentional , and engaged in the world. It's not 
disappearing from being in the world, but it is a 
disappearing of this small , little contracted self that 
somehow gets in the way of things.  
 
So when we chant or go for refuge, it's also a reminder 
that there's something else that's supporting us here 
than our own efforts. In practice, of course, we have to 
make our effort. But we 're being supported by so much 
more. We're being supported by nature. We're being 
supported by the Dharma. We have amazing healing 
capacities. We have amazing capacities within for 
human development and growth. We don't just stop 
growing and developing as human beings when we turn 
18 or 21. There is psychological growth and 
continuation of human development that happens that if 
everything is normal and healthy, and i t keeps growing 
into old age. If we practice the Dharma, it's a way of 
supporting this natur al phenomenon of growth, healing, 
development, liberation, which  is inherent in our whole 
system.  
 
There's an inherency in this movement of wanting to be 
free. And to take refuge in the Buddha Dharma Sangha 
is to trust this inherency that something more t han    
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 6 - myself is supporting me. And by trusting that, we allow 
what's more than self to operate. If we're the only one 
responsible, the only one who has to figure out how to 
make it work, we actually, at some point start interfering 
with a deeper process  happ ening. So part of what it 
means to go for refuge is to trust something, to trust 
nature in a deep way.  
 
As we trust ourselves, as we trust the situation -centered 
world , at some point in this developmental process, at 
least that the Buddha talks about, the refuge gets 
turned inside out . Rather than being the one who 
receives refuge, or experiences refuge, we become the 
kind of person who offers refuge to others. And the 
orientation becomes much more being a person of 
refuge rather than being a person who has  refuge or 
receives refuge.  
 
The Buddha talks about it as making oneself safe for all 
beings. What a gift! He said  that with  the gift of safety, 
the gift of fearlessness, we can live in such a way that 
other people have nothing to fear from us. It might t ake 
a long time to develop and grow in confidence , skills 
and freedom to feel that we're ready to be a refuge for 
others , or to offer people the gift of our fearlessness so 
that they don't have to fear us whatsoever. So that's the 
direction of refuge – it isn't just I go for refuge, but it's 
also at some point, I offer refuge . I will become now a 
refuge for all beings. And this way  of going for refuge in    
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 7 - the Buddha, going for refuge in the Dharma, going for 
refuge in the Sangha, is going to that space, that  place 
of refuge  where we ourselves can be a refuge for all 
beings.  
 
And this is what the world needs, maybe more now than 
ever. It certainly feels like we've come to a point where, 
really, let's be a refuge for all beings. Let's be a refuge 
for Black lives  – people who for centuries have not felt 
safe, to say it mildly. Now is the time to offer them 
safety so that they can be suppor ted. It's their turn. So 
thank you for doing this.  
 
And I will see you on Monday, and we'll start a new 
theme on Monday.  
 
Q & A  
I'll stay here for a little while if you'd like. And I'll try to 
look at the chats. If anyone has any questions you'd like 
to make, I'll try to answer.  
 
The question here I see is , "Why are you talking about 
emptiness? " Emptiness is a very profound topic in 
Buddhism. Maybe one of these weeks I can make that 
the topic, the theme of the talks. But certainly I'm talking 
about the e mptiness of self, the emptiness of self -
concern self -preoccupation, self -attachment . 
    
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 8 - "Was the retreat tomorrow canceled? " Yes. So maybe I 
didn't cancel it on the website. I'm sorry, if it's still up 
there. But yeah, that's not happening.  
 
"How to meditate with pain? " Well, that's a good 
question. That question requires a lot of respect. Pain 
can be quite difficult and challenging. I've known people 
who've learned to meditate with very severe pain. So it 
is possible. And to say just one word briefly  about it, is 
that one of the things that's helpful with pain is to really 
study our relationship to the pain, because sometimes 
there's a second arrow that we add to it. We make it 
worse than it needs to be. It can be bad enough to have 
pain, but then the re's a lot of reactivity that can happen. 
And the practice can help us a lot with the reactivity. 
Sometimes as the reactivity settles down, the pain can 
be much more bearable. So that's just one thing. I'm 
sorry that we don’t really have time to talk a lot  about 
pain, but maybe another time we can spend more time 
on it.  
 
"SN Goenka talked about vipassanā being body 
scanning. And I think ānāpāna, breathing meditation. 
Can you comment? " Yes. SN Goenka was an Indian 
vipassanā teacher, insight meditation teache r, who had 
a very particular technique for doing vipassanā. The 
word vipassanā  is not a name for a practice. It is a 
name for insight  – the insights we ha ve as we do 
deeper and deeper Buddhist meditation practice. In the    
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 9 - modern world, in part because of SN Goenka and 
others, vipassanā  has now become the name of a 
technique – the practices that lead to insights. There 
are many different ways and techniques of practicing 
mindfulness  which lead to these insights of vipassanā . 
And SN Goenka ha d one. He taught  body scanning, 
just really staying and scanning through the body and 
feeling the sensations of the body. And then ānāpāna  
means mindfulness of breathing. It's a powerful way of 
practicing. It takes a limited range of our human 
experiences and really goes deep with it. The way we 
practice vipassanā here  is leading to the same goal, to 
the same purpose and the same insights. But we have 
a little different approa ch, which i s to not take such a 
narrow bandwidth of our human experience as the 
focus, but to be much more broad  – to include all of 
what we're experiencing. As a result we're sometimes a 
little bit slower to go deep, but then  at the same time,  
it's someti mes broader and more stable . But the 
Goenka practice is quite effective and wonderful.  
 
"Why is it not a good thing to make a child feel special 
or that he or she has special qualities? " When my 
children were growing up , when they did something 
wonderful l ike draw a nice drawing , we did not say, "Oh, 
what a good boy!" We said, "Oh, you had so much fun 
doing that," or "It's so much fun to watch you do that ." 
We wanted to celebrate the activity that the child was 
doing , because as soon as we started saying, "You're a    
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 10 - good boy; you're a special boy," it reif ies the 
expectation that they're supposed to get that kind of 
approval, and they deserve that kind of approval. And 
then they start looking for it and wanting it  – and t hey 
become more fragile if they don't get it. They feel upset 
if they don't get it. So what we  were trying to do with our 
kids was to have them really engage vigorously , fully 
confidently in the world  – but without needing to define 
themselves by the idea of being special. Researchers  in 
education have found  that this whole movement of 
developing self -esteem in children was certainly 
pointing to some kind of need, but that emphasizing 
self-esteem led to children who felt they deserved to be 
privileged. They  deserved to kind of be able to be 
provide d with things , rather than work for things.  
 
"Can you say something about how witnessing and 
having our hearts broken can change in ourselves? " I 
think that it's very important to be a witness of what's 
happening in the world, and to be a witness of suffering. 
I think that without really seeing and recognizing what's 
there, we can't be changed by it. We can't really see 
what's true in the world. Vipassanā , which  we talked 
about earlier, literally means “clear seein g.” And the 
ability to see clearly is what you know, partly a witness. 
And it's really helpful for others that other people know , 
feel, and experience their suffering. People have 
suffered in isolation . Our society has caused a lot of 
suffering  to so many people , and they look around , and    
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 11 - no one seems to understand the ir suffering, or 
understand how the oppression of society has caused 
them suffering. And when they bring it up and talk about 
that suffering, they're told they're wrong, or it's no t that 
way or, that wasn't the intention or something. But when 
people  really have their hearts broken, it actually makes 
it easier if other people let them  know that they're not 
suffering alone. It's also just a very human , natural thing 
for a heart to break. It shouldn't be a problem to have a 
broken heart. It's painful for sure. But a broken heart is 
how we grow , and how we develop. And if we can  learn 
to use this mindfulness practice, to learn how to not 
have second arrows, how not to add reactivity, th en a 
broken heart does not have to be a tragedy. It  can 
actually be something through which we grow and 
develop. To witness and experience the suffering of the 
world supports  growth for all of us. It's how to find 
freedom and peace. In Buddhism the idea is that, as we 
experience a broken heart, as we experience the 
suffering of the world, we want to change ourselves. We 
don't just wait and expect someone else to change 
things. The more we're distressed, the more the heart is 
broken, the more important is fo r us to do something to 
make the world better. For us to be changed by the 
experience , it doesn't mean we go out and fix the 
particular problem that broke our heart if it's a social 
problem . But we change ourselves so that we become 
someone who's part of t he greater solution  – part of 
what makes a difference. It could be as simple as    
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 12 - making a donation someplace, or volunteer ing 
someplace to make a difference, or hav ing stronger 
connections and care for our neighbors, or hav ing work 
that is meaningful and we  devote ourselves more to that 
work to really help society even more.  
 
"How are equanimity and  detachment different ?" 
Detachment is a closing down, a constricting. 
Detachment, if you're really mindful and attentive to it, 
has qualities of tension and suffering within it. It's not 
comfortable to be detached. Equanimity might look the 
same, but equanimity is not aloof; it's not removed; it's 
not contracted; it's not a shutting down. It's really an 
inability to stay open to the situation  – to be a witness  
without reactivity , second arrows.  
 
"Is it the experience of the absence of clinging that 
dissolves the stickiness of self? " It's a great question. 
I'm not sure exactly. I'd like to say yes. But the particular 
kind of formation of self that we're looking  at in 
Buddhism  is not all ideas of self, but rather the 
attachment to self, the clinging to it. So discovering the 
absence of the clinging to self dissolves the stickiness 
of self. And sometimes we can have very clear 
experiences where that self -attachmen t, self -
preoccupation, completely falls away. And we even can 
see that there's no self here  – just life being lived. Self 
will come back later, with the stickiness and the 
attachment, but we know this other place so clearly,    
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 13 - that we have a very different p erspective on the self that 
comes back. Now we can really recognize, "A lot of 
what I thought I was is a construction. It's a convention. 
It's a learned behavior and the idea of who I am that's 
been taken on by my culture and my family, my religion, 
all kinds of things  is provisional. It's conditional, and 
whatever is useful about it, maybe I'll participate in. And 
whatever is not useful and painful, maybe I can let it 
be." 
 
So thank you for participating, and I hope my answers 
were adequate in response. Th ey're great questions, 
and very important issues – not always so easy to 
answer, especially in this format  without getting much of 
the context for the questions.  
 
I look forward to being together next week. Thank you.
