 So this morning I wanted to tell a story. It's one of these stories that works kind of like myth or mythology where you're supposed to find yourself in the story and maybe all the characters of the story trouble-hearing. And I'll tell you another story first as a preparation for the main story. At the time of the Buddha there was going to be a party in Grow of Trees and a little park, pleasure park. And all these noble wives and husbands came to Frolic in the park. And one of the young noblemen didn't have a wife so he came along with a woman of Il Repute. And so they all played happily together Frolic in the park and then it was time for the siesta. And so they all took a nap and now the woman of Il Repute saw this as a wonderful opportunity to gather together all the jewelry that everyone was brought with them to the party. And when everyone woke up from their naps they found that their jewelry was gone and so was this woman. So the young noblemen then went chasing after looking for this woman to get their jewelry back. And they came across the Buddha who happened to be living in this particular park at the time. And they came up here probably meditating underneath the tree and they came by him and they said, hey have you seen a woman? And the Buddha said, what would you rather find? A woman or yourself? And this caught their attention and at least of the men in the party and they sat down and listened to what he had to teach and it transformed their lives. So the idea of finding oneself. So what is it to find oneself? What is it to pursue something outside of oneself? And when is it that these kind of pursuits maybe are and they go on counter purposes to each other. So the story is from a very famous, I mean told very famous story from China. And I don't know the Chinese name of this woman but in Japanese her name is pronounced Senjou. And Senjou was raised in a household where the mother had died and so she was raised by her father and she had an older sister who also died. So she was being raised by her father and she was the only daughter, only child. And as when she was quite young she played often with her father's nephew and they made a wonderful playmates together and people would joke, oh these two are made for each other and certainly when they grow up they'll get married. It was kind of like a joke. But the two of them as children took this to be serious and always assumed that was the case that they would grow up and get married. And in fact as they were growing up they fell deeply in love with each other. And then however the father had other ideas in mind and when she became of age to be married he found she was very beautiful in a lot of suitors. She was very popular and the father chose among some of them one of the more successful wealthy suitors that that person would be good for to be her husband. And so it was a arranged marriage and when the young nephew who had always thought that you know he was going to be to marry Senjo when he heard about this he was quite distraught and didn't feel like he could live in the village anymore. And so in the middle of one night he stole off and went down to the river and took a boat upriver. Now you can imagine that Senjo also was quite distressed that she was learning she was going to marry someone she didn't really know and was not going to marry the person she deeply loved. So anyway so this the nephew ran off up the river and at midnight in the dark not darkness of the night he saw running along the riverbank a vague figure. And so he stopped to see what it who it was and to his great delight it was Senjo his great true love was there and and she had gotten wind of the fact that he was running away and running away from his pain and and that she was going to go with him. And he was they embraced and kissed and they were both very happy and they went off to another country down river upriver and there they lived for five years and they lived quite happily for the most part and they had two children. And after five years of this kind of life Senjo missed very much her home village and missed her father and felt very bad about leaving him and really wanted to go back and they felt that was kind of problematic because certainly the father would be quite angry at both of them and certainly at the nephew and they'd be serious repercussions for having kind of eloped. But after a while the strong pull and wish to be back home became strong enough that for Senjo that her husband said well let's go back and maybe if we ask for forgiveness maybe your father will forgive us and when he sees our wonderful children everything will be fine. So they went back to the village and there in the village they arrived at the riverbank at the edge of the river the nephew said to Senjo won't you wait here and I'll go back and talk to your father and ask for his forgiveness for. So he went back and knocked the door and the father opened the door and he was surprised to see the nephew and the nephew said I'm here to you know to apologize for having run off with your daughter and I want to tell you that we've lived happily happily together five years and we've been somewhat successful in our endeavors in another country and now we have two wonderful children and we would like to come back and ask for your forgiveness and see if we can be can live here and the father says I don't know what you're talking about I know that you went away and it was a sad day when you left our village and especially since the day that you left Senjo has taken to her room in my house and she hasn't spoken to anyone since and she lives in a kind of a numb stupor in the room and she barely eats but and she's been there she hasn't left the room in five years and hasn't spoken to anyone and but you know she's they've been you know I don't know what you're talking about to her going off with you and so the nephew is quite confused or a little bit little bit confused and said what's going on here and says well please come down with me to the village to the riverbank where at the boat Senjo is waiting to meet you and so the father sends a servant down to the river to find out what's going on and the meantime he goes into the bedroom where Senjo is has been laying there for five years and explained to her that strange occurrence that this nephew has come back and he claims that she is in fact down by the river and she says two children and it's quite happy and and in the first time in five years Senjo gets out of the bed and walks out of the bedroom and out of the house into the street and at that time the Senjos down by the river is walking up the river towards the house and the two Senjos see each other and they walk together and they merge and they become one Senjo and and then the father says oh now I understand um the real Senjo stayed here but your soul who was so connected to my nephew ran off with him to live with him and now the real Senjo and her soul have joined together and then Senjo says I don't know which one of me was real maybe both of me was real but now we've come back together so that's a story and in the Zen tradition this story is used as a koan and kind of a question which the student will carry with them and the particular question that the student carries with them is which is the real Senjo the one who went up the river and the one who stayed at or the one who stayed at home so what do you think sorry both of them which is the real Senjo the one who had the children what do you think anyone else other options neither of them there's actually three Senjos in the story three to choose from then when it came back together so I thought it was a very interesting story the um because I think it happens to many of us is that we in some ways split off from ourselves and um and there's many reasons for that sometimes it's our aspirations we have something we love and something really wish to do and it doesn't go along with some other part of us in this story it's the social in sense the so perhaps the social obligation of being a good daughter in Chinese family or perhaps it's the love of being being in her village or these two loves were at odds in a sense and so she felt split and she chose one over the other and off she went um so sometimes it's some great aspirations some we have a great love we want to follow we have a career we want to follow a job a schooling um we have something that we really want to pursue but it we maybe feel that it it entails some cost leaving something behind um or perhaps we don't choose our aspirations our hopes our wishes our love but we choose to let go of that leave it behind in favor of staying home staying with the obligations staying the status quo staying with with our responsibilities or staying with the wishes of people around us our family our parents um our children or whatever it might be and then again some part of us doesn't uh get fed or get followed through on because we stay at home um and i think that this kind of dilemma of having to choose between two choices is particularly strong in our modern society my impression is that our modern society offers human beings more choices than any society has ever made in human history and um you know we we not only said you know which you know i guess the cliche is you know which pack of cigarettes to buy you can so many choices but um but uh you know there's choices left and right that people have to make it wasn't uh so long ago that people really didn't have a choice about what kind of career they followed in their lives or who they married these things were basically they were born into it it was given that if your parents were farmers you were going to farm if your parents were whatever else you were going to do the same thing so we have this very very deep and very important choices that we have to make in our lives and many people aren't really prepared to make these kinds of choices and certainly not the number of choices we have to make and often choices uh entail the cost sometimes maybe the myth is that if we really know who we really are and what our real wishes are that we'll know what we want to do and we'll just follow that we'll follow our heart's wish and never turn never look back but i think to some degree there's often some splitting off of ourselves so we have to choose one over the other and something is left behind and so the question is uh you know who is the real self who who really are we are there are we the one who follows our aspirations our love follows our bliss follows our our our desires or one who follows our responsibility or follows the social context that we live in and what society tells us we should do and we had a number of suggestions already um the first one was maybe it's both um many of us will choose one will choose one aspect of who we are is who this is who i am we'll say well my hopes my aspirations my desires my wishes that's really much more integral to who i am and i choose that part and other people will choose um especially in different cultures will choose our social self uh the sense of social obligation and responsibility and that's actually much more central to who we are than our wishes and our aspirations i in my own experience now being a parent is to watch how this uh kind of plays out in my own life because it's very clear to me that as a parent of a young child that in a sense um part of who i am now is my responsibility for my child and that takes precedence over uh that part of me which when i was younger i used to associate or identify more strongly with was was my own personal wishes and desires and be able to go off and you know travel around the world or whatever i used to do so the choices we have to make and what are the costs what are the consequences of choosing one over the other i read recently that that the froid uh distinguished between i think the expression in the book i read was real suffering a true suffering and false suffering and false suffering and entail the kind of suffering that arises when we um put up resistance to feeling the tensions of our life the real conflicts and tensions of our life so if there is a tension between in senjo's life between going off with her lover and staying home with her father the um uh if she has a certain kind of pain there i would imagine and if a person feels well i'm not going to i'm not going to be present for that pain and puts up resistance to it goes off to some other country far away lives there for five years and then starts feeling the ache and the sorrow of being separated from her father also and then says well you know i'm not going to you know then starts up starts kind of defending yourself against that and starts being deciding all the reasons why her father was a terrible person and and it's really a way of defending herself from her own sense of pain and conflict and so the suffering that arises out of that defense and out of that kind of criticism of her father whatever kind of whatever she comes up with perhaps froid would have called a false suffering and that true suffering would be to really be present there for the tension itself for what was she actually feeling and i think that's what i think mindfulness practice is helping us to do is to degree to which we do have suffering out of conflict is to not set up kind of a false suffering that is removed from the core suffering that kind of defends it and criticizes it whatever we do but allows us to let go into the actual source of the tension and in the in the story uh in a sense the healing of senjo is kind of like a fairy tale because the two senjos who lived separate from each other came together in the village and um we're supposedly they live happily of after but i don't know if it's always so easy for us to heal the separate parts of us if we but but part of meditation practice is to bring them together and end up bringing together maybe it doesn't resolve the worldly differences it doesn't mean that we get to get we get to have all our choices fulfilled um all the different options but rather there is some kind of healing that's possible in each of us some kind of wholeness that's possible that's not possible if we're simply always pursuing one or the other options um i've also read that in i don't know if it's true but i've read that in greek myths that often um the the downfall of a hero and the great heroes of or the great gods of stories is not um the heroes or heroines um failings or shortcomings but rather is the aspiration of the hero a heroine that the person is pursuing something and think the person thinks that they can um be greatly successful a certain kind of hubris and in that hubris of aspiration and thinking they can pursue things that that itself they overextend and overreach themselves um that somehow our aspiration which is a very important part of us is it lends itself very easily to us overextending ourselves and then losing ourselves in the process and this i think is very true in spiritual practice and certainly it was true in my own spiritual practice especially in my early years that i had great aspiration in my practice great wish great intentions and there were times where i pursued that um blindly where i pursued that was some kind of hubris some kind of dedication that um where i shut myself off from other parts of my who i was and the very attempt to kind of pursue a spiritual life uh was maybe um blind was maybe um too idealistic uh uh was an attempt to pursue some kind of purity some kind of um ideal of who i thought i could be or who i was or what i thought spiritual life was that blinded me to other parts parts of myself it was like i was pursuing the you know going after the lover and forgetting there are other parts of who i was and that's certainly possible a spiritual practice also and but sooner or later i think in spiritual practice a person will very clearly feel the tension of that split or that pull and that's what happened to me also very painfully i felt that uh that the tension i was kind of way ahead of myself into some ideal and which was very fragile and it didn't really work and i felt that the tension of that split was very fragile and it didn't really work part of the advantages of uh of throwing yourself into spiritual practice uh in a kind of gung-ho way is that you you run up against the limitations of your aspirations sooner rather than later some people who don't throw themselves seriously enough into the spiritual practice can spend a lifetime kind of dabbling on the shortcomings of the their way in which they're engaged but sometimes throwing yourself fully into it sooner or later your face goes up against the wall so in terms of mindfulness practice it then becomes very important i believe that at some points in our practice that we allow ourselves to sit with our tensions we allow ourselves to sit with the conflicts within us we allow ourselves to sit with that which is unresolved within us rather than always kind of going after the following our bliss this uh kenbal encouraged us to do or rather than always following our suffering which is in a sense live more with the buddha encourage people to do in a sense um is to sit and you know in the tension between them um to be willing to be someone who has conflict to have different aspects of our life and to sit there and then to sit right in the middle of that tension i found often brings a resolution brings a kind of um i don't know if it's the right expression but maybe it's not a wrong expression but kind of a dialectical synthesis of these a third possibility that doesn't exist as long as we stay in either or kind of camp um so in terms of you know which is the real senjo my feeling would be is that is that all the three are the real senjo and to assume that one is not the real senjo is to do uh you know her disservice to ourselves as a service so the one who went off with her lovers is the real senjo absolutely the one who stayed home is the real senjo and the one that you know was a combination of both was the real one and um so how do we embrace all these aspects of ourselves how do we allow ourselves to be these desperate parts and how do we bring them together and i'll end with a um a um a quote from the zen master dogan he said um um when when you are not yet filled with the dharma when you're not yet filled with the truth um then you could all too easily think that things are sufficient that things are perfect as they are but when you are filled with dharma when you're filled with the truth then you know that things are not quite perfect so i thought that was a kind of beautiful thing so the closer we get to the truth the more we maybe feel that something is always a little bit off so how do we live in a life where things are always going to be a little bit off do we want to maybe not maybe you'd rather not maybe you'd rather find a a spiritual tradition that says everything is just fine and but here you've came to buddhism and it says everything's always a little bit off i mean is that good news so i think that's good news because in this isn't a realistic assessment of that that we find our freedom and our love and our peace because ultimately the purpose of buddhism is to find those is to find our peace our liberation and our love so those are my thoughts for today i thought since this is a koan that you're supposed to grapple with and see and um that it might be nice if you divide it up into little groups here today maybe groups of three or four and and and try if you can um this is a difficult dangerous for me to say because then i'm choosing telling you to choose one senjo over the other but try not to come up with the simplest or the simple answer that you can but um really grapple with this question together little groups you know maybe you have your answer who you think the real senjo is but don't just kind of say it kind of likely or kind of simply but really kind of get underneath there and try to explain why you really think that's the case or why you think maybe doesn't work um so if you if you're willing um i would thought we have quite a bit of time left why don't you um we take maybe about 10 minutes or so and you just divide up into groups of three or four and um and take turns just speaking about this uh famous story of senjo and see what you come up with and then and in some time either when i feel like the energy is dropping or after about 10 minutes i'll ring the bell and then we can sit quietly for a few moments and and then have a few reflections about what came up in your discussions and then we can end the evening and end the morning at the usual time is it okay please quietly for a couple of minutes a minute or so so maybe we have a couple of minutes if someone would like to say something about the insights they had in having those conversations or what it was like to hear hear from others or um what your reactions were to the story talking about it that the common is about the inability of humanity to find happiness with us people and then we thought too that maybe he had some other options but besides but that the experience of um one of our groups made a very valid point that while he was out there in his listen to say who wanted to come home so that wasn't true but great thank you yes black and white and i think that it's as human beings are complex and i think that's something a lot of leads and ones that not only change you know for a moment to moment but over time and other things i wanted when i was younger um i really wanted to be interested in other things that i thought oh my gosh i'm just getting old you know i'm so i guess it is about the brain the question more than your answers thank you what was most interesting to me about your story and what i reflected on it myself afterwards was the the um and i'll use my own analogy to demonstrate this is the the conflict that i've had throughout my life in between a career and reaching financial security and my family on the other hand and as my family grew up and not being there in a like the the woman was in the home in a in a completely appropriate caring nurturing way for my family and yet at the same time i'm dealing with the other part of my life and the consequences at the end that you didn't go into whenever she's re-emerged or whenever we as people try to re-emerge our life as we become over uh those conflicts can be very difficult to get through and it's not the fact that we may want to emerge and we may see the differences and difficulties that have occurred but yet uh make uh having that happen is very difficult sometime you didn't talk about something like that on both sides of the her lives and she she came in and grief great thank you great thank you one um the question i had on the story was uh den joe who commuted back and forth from place a place be and i didn't story she was either in the bedroom unconscious or presumably happier whatever at the other village with her family and um i kept finding i try to find another angle on the story in what would be where she in modern-term maybe commuting back and forth my story is a person who's literally on a daily basis but certainly on a frequent basis from the bedroom to the village and went back to the bedroom into the village on a certain frequent basis great thank you i guess what came up in the group what interested me is what is the question of what is real why are you talking about what real means i mean can i say this this or that or what i think i've touched something that's real is is it real because it go away it seems i identify oh that's it so that was very good thank you please it became apparent in our discussion that people i can't talk about the real thing i explained the way she's really defined in some way or created by relationships so there's a real centro who loves the nephew who goes off and has a family there's also a real centro she's got a very strong relationship with her father we probably know her well and all of that so there's sort of two different people pending were defined by the relationships in the month said part of this is that the one who stayed home so perhaps if she didn't serve herself thank you well that was great so thank you all for participating and now and i look forward to see which centro comes next week which one you bring along
