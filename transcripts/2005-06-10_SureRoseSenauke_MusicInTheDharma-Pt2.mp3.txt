 Well, I've been playing this music for a long time. And I think that the music was actually my training. Before I formally took up training, it taught me how to pay attention. Almost all the music that I've done in my life has been with other people. So it taught me the joys and vicissitudes of relationship. It taught me how to take other points of view, ones that were quite different from what might ordinarily come my way. Going up as a privileged young fellow in the suburbs of New York, singing southern music. All the music that I sing is basically southern. And there's some resonance there. And these resonances are things over time that I really learned to pay attention to because they have some meaning. In the same way that I think for each of us, Buddhism was not what we were born to. The Dharma was what we were born to in that the Dharma pervades everything. But Buddhism as a particular path was not. Some people probably in this room, it was. I know that it was. But we were lucky in that there was a resonance there. And we responded to that resonance and as we responded to it, as we met it, it met us. And something flowers. And that's the way I feel about the music. So I don't know a lot of Buddhist songs. I learned one last week actually, which I'll sing for you later. But to me, the truth of life, Dharma as the truth of life flows through all of these songs. So that's why I was kind of reluctant to respond to Gil's request because it involves translation through me, which of course is, I don't know, there's something dubious about that. I'm going to sing you a couple songs. First one actually is a Bob Dylan song. And you probably know it, it's got a great chorus. It's called, Lay Down Your Weary Tune. And it fits very well, I think, with the kind of Zen and Chan teachings that the rocks and the trees and the waters and the sky are all teaching Dharma. They're all speaking to us all the time. And they're speaking in music if we can hear it or even where we can't hear it. If we just let the music come, that music is speaking. Those so-called incentient beings are speaking through us. So this is very much a kind of Zen perspective, I think. I'll play guitar a little bit. If we're in tune, I may have people damaged. I mean, she... Why don't you just check though? Lay down your weary tune, lay down. Lay down the song of the strong and rest yourself be the song of the strong. And rest yourself be the song of the strong. And rest yourself be the song of the strong. And rest yourself be the song of the strong. And rest yourself be the song of the strong. And rest yourself be the song of the strong. And rest yourself be the song of the strong. And rest yourself be the song of the strong. And rest yourself be the song of the strong. And rest yourself be the song of the strong. I was thinking about this one as I was considering what to play. And this is a Southern gospel song called, As I Went Down in the Valley to Pray. The Christians have all the best songs. But we're gaining on them. So the words are, As I went down in the valley to pray, studying about the good old way, and who shall wear the starry crown? Good Lord, show me the way. Oh brothers, let's go down. Let's go down. Don't you want to come down? Oh brothers, let's go down down in the valley to pray. Now, this is where we have to go inside ourselves. We have to go down deep to encounter ourselves, down into the valleys, down into the dark places, down into the places that we hold, where we experience fear or hesitation. And when we get there, we let go. And when we let go, we let go with prayer and we can let go with song. And I like about this song, it's kind of what's known as a zipper song. So we have, oh brother, oh sister, oh father, oh mother, oh friends, oh in-laws, whatever you want to put in. Send in the invitees. But the deal is that one has to go down in the valley to pray, but also one goes along with everybody and one takes everybody there with you. Even the stray Republican. That's right. Some of whom probably know some of these songs better than we do. So I don't need to say a lot more about it. As I went down in the valley to pray, studying about that good old way, and who shall wear the starry crown? Good Lord, show me the way. Oh brothers, let's go down, let's go down. Don't you want to go down? Oh brothers, let's go down, down in the valley to pray. That's it. As I went down in the valley to pray, studying about that good old way, and who shall wear the starry crown? Good Lord, show me the way. Oh sisters, let's go down, let's go down. Don't you want to go down? Oh sisters, let's go down, down in the valley to pray. You can sing louder then. As I went down in the valley to pray, studying about that good old way, and who shall wear the starry crown? Good Lord, show me the way. Oh fathers, let's go down, let's go down. Don't you want to go down? Oh fathers, let's go down, down in the valley to pray. It's better. As I went down in the valley to pray, studying about that good old way, and who shall wear the starry crown? Good Lord, show me the way. Oh mothers, let's go down, let's go down. Don't you want to go down? Oh mothers, let's go down, down in the valley to pray. As I went down in the valley to pray, studying about that good old way, and who shall wear the starry crown? Good Lord, show me the way. Oh friends, let's go down, let's go down. Don't you want to go down? Oh friends, let's go down, down in the valley to pray. As I went down in the valley to pray, studying about that good old way, and who shall wear the starry crown? Good Lord, show me the way. Sentient beings, let's go down, let's go down. Don't you want to go down? Sentient beings, let's go down, down in the valley to pray. Down in the valley to pray. Thank you. Give me that good old Dharma gospel. That was good enough for Buddha. That was the old time religion. That was. That was 2,500 years. That's right. During that song, I remembered where I first met Alan. I first met Alan on a bus in Vancouver, British Columbia, where we were both performing at the Vancouver Folk Festival in about 19, I don't know, 80ish maybe? It was 80, 81, something like that. Right around in there. You were sitting with somebody from Sweet Honey, I think, right in back of me on the bus on the way back. Well we got talking, and I'll tell you really, we had a profound talk, and I never thought I would have a profound talk with a bluegrass player at a folk festival. Who knew? Who knew? And it was the beginning really of, I mean, God, that's 20 plus years. Yes, a little time. Yeah. Don't put down bluegrass. I won't. I won't. I write in bluegrass now. It's better than it sounds. Another friend of mine says, I have a banjo and I'm not afraid to use it. I just came back from a Buddhist Christian dialogue down in Los Angeles, and three of the panelists were comparing the Blessed Virgin, the Holy Blessed Virgin, which my Catholic friends tell me is abbreviated to HBV, for those who know, and Aviloki Teshvara, Guanyin Bodhisattva. People are really paying attention to that happy crossover, that identity. So just as the HBV is this meta side of Roman Catholicism, there are folks who don't care necessarily for the institution of the church, but when it comes to the Blessed Virgin, she's their saint. She's their soul. And in Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Tibetan, Buddhism, Guanyin Bodhisattva, Chenrezi, Guanteam, Guatat, Guanteam, Guanyam, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, or probably in English, the Bodhisattva, who observes the sounds of the world, is a little too long. That's not quite catchy enough. So we'll probably stick with Guanyin. But it's that spirit of compassion that I think resonates across cultures, across continents, across languages to our hearts. So in my tradition, we pay a lot of attention to Guanyin. But what a joy to discover a song written by a Canadian songwriter about Guanyin Bodhisattva called She Carries Me, Jennifer Barrazan's song. This definitely is something we can all join in if you'd care to. Decorous goes, She carries me, She carries me, She carries me To the other side. Easy, huh? One line. She carries me, She carries me, She carries me To the other side. Sounds great. She is a bull, She is a lie, High on a hill, In dark of night. She is a wane, She is the deen, She is the dark, Where angels sleep, High on a hill, Where peace abides, She carries me, To the other side. Here's your part. She carries me, She carries me, She carries me, To the other side. She carries me, She carries me, She carries me, To the other side. And though I walk, Through valleys deep, And shadows chase me in my sleep, On rocky cliffs, I stand alone, I have no name, I have no hope, With broken wings, I reach to fly, She carries me, To the other side. Join me. She carries me, She carries me, She carries me, To the other side. She carries me, She carries me, She carries me, To the other side. A thousand nights, A thousand nights, A thousand nights, A thousand years, To hear my cries, She is my God, A thousand years, A thousand years, She is my cries, She is the gate, She is the door, She leads me through, And back once more, When day has dawn, When death is light, She carries me to the other side. Last time. She carries me. She carries me. She carries me to the other side. She carries me. She carries me. She carries me to the other side. Thank you. Kuan Yin's vows are that anybody who calls on her name, one of those thousand hands will come out to give you the help you need. So, as they say, don't be afraid the Dharma doesn't work, only be afraid that we won't work the Dharma. So, Namo Kuan Shui Yin. Thank you.
