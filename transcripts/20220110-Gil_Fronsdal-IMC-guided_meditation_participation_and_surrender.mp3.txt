 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning, my friends. Things are a little bit different today than usual. Not that I am seeing. I'm at our retreat center, our IRC Insight Retreat Center. Today is the 40th anniversary of when I was ordained as a Zen priest. So I thought I would like to mark this day. So we'll do a meditation as usual. And then instead of continuing with the Satipatana series, I thought I'd pause with that and mark this occasion as important for me in talking a little bit about that for me, my Dharma life. So that's the difference for today. So one of the ways in which my Zen training unfolded was that at a certain point the practice was one of learning how to participate in life, how to really put myself into whatever I was doing. In Zen training, a lot of practice was also in work and activities. So to really participate in the sweeping, be really there for it. I did my first three-month training period in Zen, sanding the platforms in which all the monks were meditating on. So I have my initial training in Zen and participating, practicing with sanding, wholeheartedly sanding, participating. And then at some point it switched to rather than participation, it became a non-resistance, just get out of the way. Maybe some people would say to open up, but maybe that's a little bit too neutral. It was still participating, but now rather than me applying myself, engaging myself, it was more like engaging was happening and the life was happening. And now it was getting out of the way, having no resistance to it. And so this participating fully in life, not resisting life, I trained to do in the monastery, outside of meditation, and then in meditation. And so as we sit today, the Satyapatthana series, it's experiencing the whole body. And what a great thing to mark this practice of participation. We participate with our whole body when we participate fully in life. That's the medium, that's the matter with which we can participate in life, is with our whole body. Very different than with our whole mind only. And then participating and feeling and getting out of the way and allowing ourselves to experience life, all of life, in the way that is three-dimensional, multi-dimensional, from all the different senses, all the different capacities for attention that we have. So to assume a posture of participation with meditation. So if you're going to bring all of your body, all of your posture, with you, to participate in meditation. So no part of your body is passive, but is alert, is present. Like if some important person for you walked into the room and you would sit up straight and really be present, now you're going to be attentive. And then to lower your gaze, maybe 45 degrees to the floor, letting your eyes rest, the gaze of your eyes rest. Not trying to look at anything in particular. And then to gently close your eyes. And the practice that we often do here of breathing in deeply is a practice of participation. To breathe in deeply into your body, to hold torso, expand, stretches, shoulders lift as you breathe in deeply. And then a certain kind of surrender into the body, into life, through your body, in the exhale. Breathing in deeply, connecting to this life, exhaling, surrendering to this life. The lived life of the moment, not the life that you can think about, anticipate, remember, but the lived life. And then to let your breathing return to normal. And every sensation you have in your body is there because you're alive. When you're dead, your body has no sensations. It's kind of like proof that you're alive, that you have sensations, even if they're uncomfortable. As you breathe in, feel the life of your belly. And as you exhale, relax, surrender to the belly. On the inhale, feel your chest, your upper torso. And as you exhale, relax your upper chest, your torso. Perhaps surrendering to the lived life that expresses itself through your chest. On the inhale, feeling your sensations of your face. Generously, openly, allowingly, feel your face. And as you exhale, relax, surrender your face, giving up your public face, how you feel like you need to present yourself to the world. Let your face have a break, deep relaxation as you exhale. And then the same with the mind. Maybe in the area of your brain, your forehead. Anywhere you tend to feel the mind. Feel it as you inhale. And as you exhale, relax your mind, soften. See if you can soften anyways in which you're driving your mind. Pushing it along with your desires and wants and fears. Surrender your fears, your desires, so you can better participate through your body in this moment to moment lived life. And then settling down into the body breathing. Either participating in this experience of breathing or surrendering to your breathing. The lived life of the body breathing, one breath at a time. Just the inhale when you're inhaling. Just the exhale as you exhale. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires, your desires, your desires, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. Pushing your fears, your desires. So then as we come to the end of this sitting, may the intention of this practice that we've done, may the dedication, the effort be for the welfare, be dedicated to the welfare and happiness of others. May it be that we practice in such a way that we help reduce suffering in this world, for ourselves, for those that we know and the whole world. We live in a world where there is incalculable suffering. And we live in a heart that has an incalculable capacity to love for compassion. And may it be that our care, compassion, our love grows through this practice day by day, week by week, year by year. May our compassion grow so that our care, our participation in life, is for the welfare and happiness of all. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. And may we live a life that contributes to that. Or at the very least doesn't contribute to more suffering. Thank you.
