 Very simple Buddhist teaching, but phenomenally profound teaching, the teaching of the Four Noble Truths. And it's simple in various ways. It's simple because it's simple to understand. A child could basically understand the Four Noble Truths if they were taught. But it's simple in a more interesting way in that the Buddha was trying to come up with a way, I believe, come up with a way of describing the path to release, the path to being free of suffering, as simply as possible. So the path itself, the practice itself, the context in which we practice was really simple for us. So we didn't have to make it really complicated or try to understand a lot of complicated religious dogma or teachings or complicated metaphysics. He tried to look for the most simple way that we could understand our life that could lead us to a life of release. And this is one of the hallmarks, I think, of the pastana practice, of Buddhist practice, as taught by the Buddha, is the effort to really focus at the simplicity, at the root of our suffering and our release, at the place where it actually happens, where it's most easy to understand. There's a famous story that I've taught maybe some of you, maybe all of you, heard from me before, I apologize, of this king in an ancient kingdom who wanted to... this is way back in ancient times before they had shoes. And he was out walking in his kingdom and he bumped into a sharp rock on the path and he cut himself and hurt. So he went to his ministers and he ordered that the whole kingdom be covered with leather so that no one would ever hurt themselves again on little pebbles or rocks on the ground. And his ministers explained, you know, well, we understand the motivation here, but there's a simpler way. We don't have to cover the whole kingdom with leather. All we have to do is cover everyone's souls with leather and then have the same effect. So the only thing we have to take care of is the place. We don't have to cover the whole country, we have to just cover that part of our body which comes into contact with the ground, the place of contact. And the pastana practice, the simplicity of the practice, if we understand it, has a lot to do with understanding the place of contact where we actually meet life directly. As soon as we meet life directly, many of us, all of us, start a whole chain of associated thinking. Start thinking about things and analyzing it, understanding it symbolically or metaphorically, understanding it in relationship to our history, our past, our hopes, our futures, understanding it in relationship to all things we associate with it. And it gets more and more complicated. And soon enough we're living not in the direct contact of our experience of life, but rather in our abstract thinking about what is happening. And the Buddha said that you go back to really understanding the point of contact, the place where we actually meet life directly. That will make your life a lot simpler and you'll understand the issues of suffering and the issues of freedom a lot more directly. If you understand the simplicity of direct contact, if you lose touch with direct contact and are dealing with abstractions, then abstractions are abstract and vague and different people have different abstractions and even they can use the same words and everybody nods and they agree. If we all use the word, I mean the classic word in the West is the word God. Do you believe in God? Yeah, sure. Most people in America believe in God, 97%, 107% of the people in America believe in God. I don't know. There's a lot of people in America believe in God. And yeah, we believe. And people can talk about God, this, God, that, and everybody kind of nods. But if you really kind of investigate what they're talking about, most people I believe are talking about an abstraction. They have associate ideas, ideas of what it is, and they have different references for the same word. So it's very easy when we're living in abstractions to either disagree or agree with people, seemingly agree or disagree, but actually don't have a clue what they're talking about because it's all abstractions. So what happens when we ask ourselves what is actual, our actual experience? What's the direct simplicity of what's actually happening as opposed to all the ideas we might have about it? And for someone who lives in the world of abstraction, which is most of us a lot of the time, it can be very hard to, it can seem very difficult to come back into the simplicity of direct contact. But that is a lot of what Mind-Twent's practice is about, is developing enough concentration, enough stillness of mind, stability of mind, so we can really fully be present for the simplicity of our royal feet touching the ground and just being there for that contact rather than spreading protection throughout the realms, places we don't need it. So the teachings of the Four Noble Truths belong to this realm of direct contact, of direct experience. And so our very simple teaching, I find them profound or very useful in that in the simplicity of them, everything else that is important for our lives seems to eventually come under their gaze, comes under their domain. Tanisirabeku has the analogy that it's like, if you go to the savannahs of Africa as a nature photographer and you want to get a photograph of most of the, all the animals there, you'd be foolish to go running around the savannah chasing after them all day long. What you need to do is much, much more relaxing, is just go hang out at the waterholes, because all the animals have to sooner or later come to the waterholes. As you hang out the waterholes, you make a little camouflage box for yourself. And sure enough, they come and you take all your photographs of the animals. So the Four Noble Truths are kind of like that, that it's kind of like being at the waterhole. Everything that's important in our life will come to the waterhole, will come through the experience of suffering and freedom of suffering. And you'll understand all the things in your life that you need to understand, or you'll understand you don't need to know them. I think some of the great metaphysical abstractions that religious people like to make, maybe we don't need to understand, maybe they're not really that essential or important. In Buddhism, the idea that there is a self or there is not a self, comes to some kind of absolute conclusion about this. We can maybe understand this being belonging to this world of abstractions. And if you understand the Four Noble Truths, and understand our relationship to these kinds of questions from that point of view, maybe you'll understand that it's not really essentially important to come to an ultimate conclusion about whether there is a self or there's not a self. It's very important not to contract around the notion of self, or resist the kind of identification to self, or get identified with our opinions about a self, or try to defend or project some idea of what the self should be. But those psychological concerns are very different from some metaphysical belief, I am a self, absolutely. So the Four Noble Truths, you all know. And the first is the Truth of Suffering. The Holy, the sacred truth, the Four Noble Truths, the Holy Truths, the sacred truth of suffering. It's kind of nice, I think, that suffering is called the Noble Truth, or sacred truth. The status of suffering is elevated. There's a way of seeing it, there's a way of perceiving it, that it belongs to the path of liberation. And so, rather than being oppressed by suffering, we can see the sacredness of it, or the sacredness in it that leads, seeing in a certain way leads to liberation. Most of you also know that Buddhism talks a fair amount about samsara and nirvana, these two dichotomies. And it's very important to understand that samsara and nirvana are not two different places or two different locations, not two different realities in a kind of ontological way. But rather, samsara and nirvana have to do with two ways of experiencing life. Samsara is when we experience life in a maybe normal way that people mostly experience it, when we're so preoccupied and lost in our clings, our concerns, our fears, our hopes, our greed, our identifications, that we don't even see what's going on. And we suffer. This is samsara. And nirvana is to see the same world, to be part of the same world, and not be under the sway of our attachments, not to be blinded from seeing who our things are because of our attachments. Two people can be sitting in the same room, and one person's sitting in the room of samsara, and the other person's in the room of nirvana, simply by the way in which they relate to the room. One person is trying to, you know, is lost in their concerns about how very beautiful room is and how can they, you know, make the same room at home. And the other person just sees it's a beautiful room, and thinks it would be a nice type of room like this, but there's no clinging. It's kind of the ease or coolness of the mind in relationship to it. The world of samsara is when the mind is on fire, and which is a classic image of the Buddha used for the mind to the heart of the people who are stuck in samsara, as their minds are on fire. And whether you like this image or not, it doesn't take much reflection and looking around the world to realize that there's a lot of minds on fire in the world, and how painful it is to reflect on these peoples whose minds are on fire. So to have a cool mind is the path of practice, or maybe a better word, maybe is a refreshed mind, a released mind. So the first noble truth is the truth of suffering, and the call of this noble truth is simply to see suffering for what it is. And that, you can say, maybe is 99% of what practice is about, to seeing suffering for what it is. We have tremendous abilities not to see suffering. We have tremendous abilities of the mind to live in abstraction, and then to project hope, to project pleasantness, goodness, project beauty, in places where those things don't exist. People who suffer a lot, for example, will sometimes, in spiritual circles, sometimes will project all their avoidance of suffering onto some other, onto the religion, onto the group they're practicing with, onto the teacher, as being that they represent ultimate goodness, they represent what's all right. And so they'll avoid paying attention to suffering by projecting goodness, and then relating to that goodness somewhere else outside of themselves. So this is common psychological knowledge. We put up defenses, we have projections, we're afraid, we get lost in fantasies, we get lost in daydreams or planning, we get lost in memories, we don't see things for what they are, but we either paint them over in a happy light, or sometimes we paint them over and make them much worse than they are. The human mind has a tremendous capacity to paint the reality over to make it look and be different than what it is. So that's one thing very important about the first noble truth, is to see suffering directly and simply. The operating word over and over again is simply, can we see it in the simplicity of suffering, and not see it to too many of our filters, and our hopes and our aspirations of what we want to be rather than what is. There's a very interesting suffering, and happiness, maybe a more interesting form of happiness that people experience. If you say that you decide to go on a really long hike up a mountain, and it's really grueling and difficult, and it's many hours of steep climbing, and most of the time you're underneath the cloud cover, and it's in the fog and cloud, and it's windy, and the sun's not out, and you kind of get cold, and you're getting hungry after a while, you're not allowed to stop and eat until you really get to the top. So you go and go and go, and finally you break through the cloud cover, and your sun's there, and you actually, at the same time you get to the peak, and it's just really great, you can sit down and rest and relax, and finally you've arrived. And there's a lot of happiness for having arrived, and some of that happiness is happiness of relief. Wow, you know, I'm no longer struggling, it's no longer so steep, I'm no longer in the cold, and the wind, and what a relief to finally arrive. So it's great, so we're up there at the top of the mountain, and feeling the joy of not being under the burden of this terrible climb, and difficult conditions. So it's nice, we're enjoying it down there, and we could probably just be up there forever. My accepted late afternoon sets in, the cold wind begins setting in, and we've eaten all our food, and it starts feeling a little bit uncomfortable again, and so we feel more and more comfortable, like this, I don't want to, this can't continue, so let's go find, you know, let's get out of here and find something better. So finally you make it down the mountain, you make it back to your wonderful, you know, little chalet where you're staying, or whatever, and sure enough someone's waiting there with hot chocolate and the fire, and again you're really cold, and you're back into the fog, and it's a long hike back, and finally you get back, and certainly there's a happiness that someone's there caring for you, and waiting for you to come back with a fire and hot chocolate, but there's also the great happiness of relief, oh I'm no longer in the cold, in the wet, and now I can relax. A lot of people experience of happiness, and the happiness they're pursuing, belongs to this category of relief. They're simply looking for relief from their discomfort, and it can, you know, as we know, it can be endless because life will always change in such a way that sooner or later if we don't do anything we'll begin uncomfortable. I mean if not the classic exercise in Southeast Asia is sit yourself in the most comfortable easy chair you can possibly sit in, and don't move, and see what happens, and eventually you'll get uncomfortable. Some people who are unmotivated to do anything in their life, you know, maybe you suffer from great depression or something, or you have no motivation at all, and report being really unmotivated, sometimes the teachers will tell them, well just okay don't do anything, just stay in bed. In the morning when you wake up just stay there until you're compelled to do something else, and you'll be compelled sooner or later, most people, unless you want to kind of pee in bed, you know, you'll be compelled, and after a while, you know, enough hunger sets in, and most people then will be compelled because of the discomfort. So there's a certain tendency of some kind of happiness that is the happiness of relief, and if a person is pursuing or is interested or wants that kind of happiness, then it becomes an endless effort because you're always having to look for the next relief, and the next relief, because life will catch up to you sooner or later with more discomfort. Discomfort is an inherent part of life, and unless we find some way to come to terms with that, we're always going to be, you know, either fighting it or struggling with it, or trying to overcome it in perhaps unnecessary ways. As human beings, we're always incomplete, and we're always not enough, we're always, you know, we're always incomplete, we're always growing, we're always in process of change. We never know all the information to take care of all the things just right and perfectly. But we have, you know, we have this abstraction, these ideas and these feelings that I am a self, and I'm not only a member of myself, but I'm a self that needs to be perfect, needs to get it right, needs not to make mistakes, needs not to fail in front of people, and so we feel uncomfortable with being kind of incomplete or being, maybe a better word is to be limited. All human beings are limited in some way, and we have, some people have this myth that we're supposed to be unlimited, unlimited intelligence, unlimited opportunities, unlimited, you know, everything. Part of coming to terms with the first noble truth is that there is inherently part of life and unsatisfactoriness, there's inherently a part of life that things are not going to go according to any kind of ideal standard of what you, how you think it's going to be. Things are just unfolding the way they do, and it's never quite adequate. It's always going to be unsatisfactory in some kind of way. So that's part of the suffering that the Buddha talked about. There's also the suffering of change, that things change all the time. It isn't that there's suffering in change, but there's unsatisfactoriness in change. It's closely connected to what I'm saying, in that things are always changing. We can't expect anything to stay the same, and if we can't expect anything to stay the same, any one thing that's occurring is unsatisfactory for the purposes of hanging our hat there and putting up our feet and thinking, this is it, I've arrived. And we never arrive, in a sense. If we think the, some aspect, something which is changing, if we expect it not to change, then we're setting it set up for suffering. So the first noble truth is seeing suffering simply directly, not pridding it up, not avoiding it, not making it worse than it is, and being willing to feel the discomfort. When it's there, I think it's very important to say that there's no need to go looking for it actively. Just, you know, it'll come your way sooner or later, and that's when we pay attention to it. But until it comes, enjoy yourself. Enjoy the beautiful weather, and the beautiful nature, and the good food, and whatever you can enjoy. The second noble truth is that of the cause of suffering, and I think all of you know that the Buddha defined that as tan-na, which is thirst. And I understand thirst, using his choice of the word thirst, he's using kind of a symbolic word, perhaps a metaphorical word, that covers a lot of different terrain, a lot of different ways of being. And I like the word drivenness or compulsiveness as being a translation. The suffering of the Buddha is trying to help us overcome is a suffering that gets born from our compulsiveness, our drivenness, the way in which we contract and cling or get attached to things in life. He's not overcoming the inherent kind of unsatisfactoriness of life, and the fact that we do hurt ourselves and get sick and get old, but rather the ways in which we contract around our experience of being alive. And maybe the word contraction is a nice word to describe the cause of suffering, that we contract. Our desires, our attachments, our fears, our neediness causes our mind and our hearts to contract. And that contractedness of the mind is a cause of suffering. There's tension, there's tightness. And I find it in my practice very useful to pay attention to tension. That tension itself is almost directly connected to the cause of suffering, the thirst, the compulsion, the fear. And it's a wonderful door into deeper practice, is a door of our tensions, to be sensitive to our attentions in our body, attentions in our mind. And then there's a third noble truth, which is the truth of the cessation of suffering, nibhana, which is release, the experience of release. And I wanted to talk a little bit what I mentioned at the weekend retreat, that the Buddha, the earliest description the Buddha gave of his enlightenment, of his release, the night he sat under the Bodhi tree. He described it as being the uprooting, the absence of the four asavas. And the four asavas, that's very interesting. This is the way the Buddha chose to define his release, was the absence of the four asavas. And the four asavas are, first the word asava translated into English is a little bit difficult. You find various choices by English translators. One is the corruptions. I don't like that one though, but the people like the corruptions is common. The outflows are like, is common one, the outflows, some people call it the influxes, but outflows is nice. I like calling them the drains. Nothing drains your energy anymore when you get enlightened. There's no drains. Now the word asava, if you look it up in the dictionary, the first definition, it's a secretion or fluid, secretion of a certain kind of certain plants in India that are intoxicating, intoxicating secretions. The second definition of the dictionary is the secretions of a wound. You know, some ugly wound, you have all these secretions, process of coming out, that's an asava. So in the psychological terms of Buddhism, asavas connected to this, in that it's kind of an outflow of some kind of gunk. And it's also something which intoxicates us, a mind. So the drains, maybe it's not quite, or outflows, it doesn't quite capture all those connotations, but the intoxicants, that's another translation some people call them, that asavas are intoxicants. So the Buddha was no longer intoxicated by the intoxicants, no longer, his energy wasn't drained anymore by these four. So there's four asavas that Buddha was freed of, the night there was enlightenment. And these are the asavas of the attachment to sense gratification, to gratifying the senses. The asava of existing, of existing as an identity, of being a self in a particular way, creating an identity, holding to identity, defending one, projecting it. The third is the asava, the intoxication of opinions and views. Many of us can recognize it in other people, right? They seem intoxicated with their opinions. And then the fourth is the intoxication of ignorance. And ignorance on the list is interesting because, you know, how can ignorance be an intoxication? How can it be a drain on the mind? Well, ignorance in the Buddhist teaching is the act of ignoring. It's not simply the absence of knowing something, it's not being ignorant. It's ignoring, it's the act of it. It's actually turning away from wanting to pay attention. It's not wanting to pay attention. It's avoiding, really knowing what's going on. And if so, in the Freud, I guess, according to the word denial, so that's a modern, maybe, understanding of the same phenomena. And what's interesting about that kind of ignoring is that it takes effort. You have to make an effort to turn away from something and not pay attention, to close down, to become numb. And it's a kind of mental effort. And all the asavas require some kind of effort. And I believe that if you pay attention to the quality of that effort, you'll feel that effort comes with a kind of mental tension, a kind of a sense of concern, at least. A concern of the mind is tense, is taught, is contracted. And what's interesting is that it's possible to function in life, to take care of everything we take care of, without the mind becoming taught, without the mind becoming contracted or tense. Without making a kind of mental effort, that the effort itself is tense. A lot of people don't know this, so they feel like they're always having to make straining efforts in order to figure things out or get by or get along in life. And many of us get caught up in life, and so we end up in that caught-upness, making that kind of straining effort of the mind. But I find it one of the beautiful things about life is that it seems that we have the capacity to process and function and make decisions about a whole realm of experiences in life in a way that doesn't require any mental effort. It might require physical effort to take care of things, but somehow it might take mental effort, but no mental effort would require a strain or tension. As I said on the weekend, Suzuki Roshi had this realization that it was very important for him when he noticed that he could have the ability to resolve at night one time to wake up in the morning. And he would wake up at five o'clock or four o'clock or whatever. And many people have that kind of experience in some degree that they can set a time they're going to get up in the morning and they can sometimes wake up then. I've had the experience often of setting an alarm clock for especially early time in the morning like to get an airplane or something and waking up one minute before the alarm clock is supposed to go off or two minutes or something. Some inner clocks and inner processing is going on that is outside of my conscious knowing that I can do that, but something in my mind is taking care of things in some certain way. I think it's Max Verity. I read about recently a famous scientist from a hundred years ago who was one of the great discoverers of the laws of thermodynamics was asked how he does it, how he came up with these fantastic, brilliant theories or formulas. And he said something like something inside of myself, which is not something inside of me, which is not myself, comes up comes up with them. Isn't that great? Something inside of me that's not myself, something larger in myself than myself, that there is, you know, we identify with such a small part of ourselves. You know, this is we identify often with our thinking mind, the mind that thinks. And there's a whole realm of processing, which goes on below the active conscious kind of thinking mind when most of us live most of the time. And it seems like a mismystery. You know, he didn't know where it came from. He wasn't going to attribute it to something outside of himself. It wasn't like the gods or the muses were speaking to him, but it wasn't, he couldn't take credit for it, but it was still happening in his brain, but it wasn't him. What was it? That was a wonderful description of kind of respecting self and not self at the same time. So the asavas belong to that realm of mental efforting that is tense, that is taught, that is trying to figure things out, they're trying to resist things. And what is possible to discover is that in finding actually trust. And it can be very scary to trust this capacity of mind, that somehow the mind will know the right thing to do at the right time. Maybe it won't always, sometimes you make mistakes. I'm not going to give my mind ultimate. It's not like my mind is God always knows what to do. But I'm really amazed at how much it gets processed kind of intuitively, you might call it, outside of my conscious ability to think about things. And as the years I've practiced, I rely more and more on disability. I had to learn to do it in a new fashion when I was working on my dissertation, when I was writing a lot. I'd have a lot of mental tension in my writing. It was like pulling nails, it was really hard to write. And I noticed that one of the things that made it really hard in mental efforting was that I felt I had to know what the end of the sentence was like before I started it. The sentence had to be composed before I wrote it down. And one day I realized I didn't have to know what I was going to write before I wrote it. And then it became much more easy to write, to kind of float more. And it came from, partly I didn't know where some of these things came from, just the sentences kind of partly just came. So the four asavas, which the Buddha was freed of in light of his enlightenment, belonged to this realm of tense, stressful mental efforting. And I was very afraid of that. And the second noble truth, the cause of suffering, belongs to this realm of this tense mental efforting. That in the very efforting to think a certain way or relate to the world a certain way, there's suffering in that way which we're relating. And on top of that, when we relate that way, we tend to perpetuate the suffering. We tend to make other decisions that become awkward and difficult and create further suffering. So as I said last night, one of the guidelines for helping you in your practice is to reflect occasionally, pay attention occasionally, to the effort in which you're doing the practice, the effort in which you're doing being mindful. Because you can actually feel sometimes when the effort's a little bit off, because there's a kind of mental tension in the efforting when it's a little bit off. And there doesn't need to be tension as part of the practice. There needs to be firmness. There needs to be great determination. But it doesn't have to be taught. It doesn't have to be kind of making a stretch really tight. And perhaps it requires a certain level of trust to do the practice, because there's something inside of ourselves which is greater than our selves, which is doing the practice in part, or cooperating in doing the practice. It's a cooperative effort, our practice, between our ability to bring our mindfulness into gear and then something else which is cooperating when we're doing that. As someone said today, that they felt that something like, you know, that the practice is doing them. So to pay attention a little bit to the quality of the effort you make in your practice is very useful. And some people don't take the time to notice that. They're so concerned with what they're paying attention to, or they're so concerned with trying to get concentrated, that they don't notice the way in which they're trying to do the practice. You'll have much more ease if you pay attention sometimes to the quality in which you practice. So mental tension, physical tension, to be willing to feel it when it's really there, when it really becomes prominent is a wonderful gate. Now we don't want to kind of, it's possible, I suppose, to spend the whole time in the cushion just chasing after all the tensions in the body and releasing them and releasing and releasing them and kind of, you probably, I've done that just a little bit, some degree sometimes, if I'm feeling kind of lousy. If I'm sick, that's what I do. When I have a cold, I mostly go around my body searching for tensions in my body and see if I can relax them. That seems to be helpful for me at least when I have a cold. It's not exactly what we want to do in mindfulness practice. We don't want to go chasing after tensions and all of them. But when we become aware of tensions, when they arise clearly in consciousness and become prominent enough, then to not be quick to dismiss them but see them as doors into understanding our life more deeply. And I found from my practice it's been very helpful to be sensitive to tensions, mental tensions, physical tensions, and use them as kind of help. To use those things is helping me stay on the path, to stay connected, know where the attention is usefully directed. So the second noble truth has to do with a particular way in which we relate to our experiences. And as you all know, mindfulness practice is not about adjusting our experience. It's letting our experience be as it is. But learning slowly bit by bit to understand that we don't have to relate to our experience with tension, with aversion, with fear. We can let our experience be what it is, to leave ourselves alone, to leave our experience alone, and not to contract around it. So some of you might find interesting to experiment a little bit, maybe on the retreat, maybe outside retreat. We're seeing what it's like to be on the retreat, the retreat, the retreat, the retreat. And the retreat is a kind of a side retreat. We're seeing what it's like to live life or to practice, follow the schedule and practice in a serious way. But to experiment, is it possible to do it without any mental tension at all? As if, what would that be like? What would it be like to go to lunch, to go to one of the meals, and not have any mental tensions around your decision about how much food to get or not to take, or whether there's going to be enough food if you're last in line, what are all the issues that come up? Comparative thinking, because comparative thinking and cause suffering, often arises with tension, tension in the mind. You stand there in the meal line and you're judging everyone because they took too much food or not enough food. Or you judge yourself because how could I have taken 13 potatoes? And so what would it be like to experiment with not seeing what it would be like to process, to go through something without letting there letting be any mental tension, to trust something larger than yourself, in yourself, to make the decisions? So then the third noble truth is the experience of release, or release, the cessation of suffering. And in short-term we can just call it happiness. The four noble truths in layman's terms can be suffering and its cause, happiness and its conditions. Isn't that nice? And so the eighth full path, which is the last of the four noble truths, is the conditions for happiness. So the conditions that are conducive to release. And it's important to see that it's not suffering in its cause, happiness in its cause, or suffering in its cause and release in its cause, because release, the ultimate release, is not something which has a cause, but it has conditions. We place ourselves in an optimal situation for something which is not ourselves, and to bring about the release to release. We ourselves are not responsible as an agent to do things. We're not possible to be agents, to cause the ultimate freedom that the Buddha pointed to. So it's very nice to know that you can't be responsible for the ultimate step in Buddha's practice. But you need to set up the conditions. The conditions have to be there. And so the eighth full path is the description of those conditions which we try to set in place. And the first one, the very first one as I said last night, is the right view, right understanding, right opinion. Not right opinion, but right view. And by the way, the asavah of opinion is very easy to kind of overlook it as being, you know, well I understand that it's not so good to have a lot of opinions and be opinionated. I don't do that. The asavah of opinions is all pervasive. We do it all the time. Any kind of judgment you have about yourself or someone else involves an opinion. Any kind of idea you have, I need to get more concentrated, I need to be more different. I need to be different than how I am right now. That's an opinion. I need to defend who I am right now and keep the way things are. If I don't breathe at all, do you think I'll keep this joy that I'm feeling right now? If I don't move, you know, will it not go away? We have opinions or views about things that are probably one of the single most freeing things in our life would be to be freed of opinions because they're so pervasive. I'm not good enough or I'm not, you know, we have all these judgments in all kinds of ways. To be free of our judgments. And one of the ways to help be free of these things, of these kinds of opinions, is to see very physically, as I keep saying, the tension that's part of that. If we just hang out and feel that tension sometimes, that feeling just being there with that tension sometimes allows for a certain kind of release that's very different than if we're trying to solve it and fix it. So the Eightfold Path. And the second, the first one as I talked about last night, is understanding the Four Noble Truths and understanding our experience through the categories of the Four Noble Truths. And the second one is right intention, having the right intention to practice. And I loved meeting all of you today. I thought it was really lovely to sit there and have all of you come and just talk about your intentions for being here. And they were all so beautiful. I felt all of them were just so right on and they're all different from each other to some degree. And just all felt it was very personal and that felt like it came from some place of great sincerity in each of you. And so I think the right intention is here. So we don't have to worry about that too much. But right intention also can be understood as being connected to the Four Noble Truths. That the right intention is the intention to not for wonderful states, not for wonderful becomings, wonderful identities, not for wonderful protections from everything. But rather, the right intention is ultimately the intention to discover release, to find release from our suffering, from our clinging, from our thirst. So this was the Buddha's, the Four Noble Truths was the Buddha's attempt, I believe, to make this spiritual endeavor really simple, kind of like putting leather onto the soles of the feet rather than covering the whole kingdom with leather. And the Vipassana practice itself is the same way. It is to learn how to discover, to learn how to be present for our direct experience, to be present for our direct experience. What is our direct experience? To be more interested in our direct experience of hearing the bird, of listening to a voice, of feeling our knees, to feeling our breath, to feeling the sensations of the body, to feeling the immediacy of our emotions right now, feeling the immediacy of our mental processes right now, what's going on right now. To feel the immediacy of things is to come into the simplicity of contact. To be more interested in the immediacy of things than to be interested in being in the world of our thinking. The world of thinking is mostly a world of aboutness. We think about things. We think about yesterday, we think about what's going to happen tomorrow, we think about the conversation we had, we think about what about those potatoes, how are they cooking, we're thinking about all kinds of things. But to live a world of aboutness is to live a world that isn't very alive. It's not very immediate. Most of us are interested in the aboutness, interested in our thoughts and our ideas. A very important shift in practice happens when we can appreciate that there's something more interesting to be done than living in the world of thoughts and pursuing our thoughts and pursuing our fantasies and being involved in fixing and planning and arranging our mental life. Spending too much time with a cushion, arranging our mental life, our cognitive thoughts, is just like rearranging the furniture on the Titanic. So it's maybe nice to do that, it looks nicer when it goes down. But if there's a very important shift then in practice, when a person understands there's something else to be done in life besides pursuing thoughts. And that has to do with being connected to the immediacy of our experience. And the immediacy of our experience is not an aboutness, it's not about something. It is what it is in the present moment. Now I think probably many of you here in the first day of the retreat have had lots of experience of the momentum of your past coming into the retreat. And it isn't just simply being tired, but we spent all week or all month, last month or all last year kind of pursuing a certain concern, maybe working really hard or concerned with a certain relationship or whatever. We have all these concerns that the mind is filled with and tensions of the body, that we hold ourselves a certain way, we're resisting the road a certain way. And I call those things, I call it sometimes momentum, because we can't expect these things to be released just like that. These things have to unwind in their own right. It's more kind of like the forest pond, which is all muddy. You can't just snap your finger and expect the pond to be clear. And you can't go and kind of stir up the pond with more, you know, the stick, thinking that's going to speed up the process of settling. But you have to allow, you have to be patient and allow the settling to happen on its own. And different things will take different speeds to settle. Some things will settle the first morning, one sitting. Some things won't settle for more pervasive or kind of underlying things might take three or four days to settle and they keep reoccurring and reappearing. Certain momentums might not settle at all in the course of a 10-day retreat. And they might not be ever present, but they're kind of there, kind of in the background, perhaps. We have to have tremendous respect for the momentum of things when we bring into the retreat to the beginning. And not to make it more complicated or judge it or resist it, but rather just to feel it. To paraphrase the Buddha, he said something like, the momentum we experience is the result of our past intentions, the past choices we've made. And your job as a meditator is simply to feel them, not to fix them, just to feel them. So part of the simplicity of the beginning of the retreat is the simplicity of allowing your momentum to be there and not fight it. And also not to give into it, but simply to respect it and and treat it in a way that seems appropriate. So in being with the contact of experience, to being in the immediacy of things, we can divide our experience into two aspects. One is connecting to the immediacy of what's happening right now and then sustaining the attention with what's happening right now. And a lot of what practice is about is learning to develop a sustainability to stay with immediacy of what's actually happening. And we do that in the first days of the retreat with the breath. The breath I hope is your great best friend. And some people the breath doesn't work and there's other things to be done besides the breath, other things to pay attention to other ways. But for most people, kind of the generic advice is the breath is the best place to learn to cultivate immediacy of contact and immediacy of sustaining that attention to the present. So that's enough. Thank you. Tomorrow.
