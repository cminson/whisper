The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
And so if you're like me, I would say many of you probably you find the
opportunity to hear the Dharma and there's probably a lot of Dharma talks
that you've heard. There's probably a lot of instruction out there that you've
heard. And so the encouragement I want to give you is really to wholeheartedly
take something from today's experience and put it into practice. Don't let it
be just one more thing that you've heard, one more collection of instruction, but
actually put into practice any one of the directions that you've heard over the
course of the day. Even if it's just a very small thing, you can find really
deep transformational qualities out of taking a very simple instruction and
then just practicing it wholeheartedly. So I want to give you a lot of
encouragement to do that. So I will probably say this many times before I'm
done, but you know there's there can be an entire you know maybe a paragraph in
the sutas that we read. And you know if we have that kind of motivation, you
know, if we can put forth that skillful effort, which is what we've been talking
about today, you could take even just a few words of an entire paragraph and
just work with those that very small bit of instruction. So making skillful
effort, you know, after we end our time together, your skillful effort starts
right here right now. And as soon as we're done, you know, where you can
like, okay, I can relax, the day-long retreat is over. What am I going to go
do? That's when you start practicing. That's when you really start looking at
okay, is this skillful? Am I cultivating wholesome states? What is the mind
practicing in this moment? Does it lead to a happy destination? If I'm practicing
kindness in this moment, I'm going to see some kindness in the next moment. If I'm
practicing resentment in this moment, I'm going to see resentment in the next
moment. So we really need to be vigilant and just notice what sort of wholesome
qualities are we cultivating? What sort of unwholesome qualities seem to be
prevalent? And you know, so I thought what I would do too is just kind of recap a
lot of things. So, you know, these four great efforts, preventing negative
states of mind. You know, our first line of defense is mindfulness. So, being
mindful. And what does it mean to be mindful? Present, aware, and allowing. So
the allowing doesn't mean condoning. It just means allowing like, oh, here's what's
taking place. Here's the reality in this moment. Now, how can I be in
relationship with this in a skillful way? So, that skillful way is abandoning what
is unwholesome and strengthening that which is wholesome. So, that first line
of defense is mindfulness. The other thing that I wanted to highlight, too,
about preventing negative states of mind is guarding the sense doors. You know,
there's this story, and I think I'll go ahead and read it to you, but
it's the story of a monk guarding the sense doors in a way. So, it's a very
short little story, so I'm just going to jump right into it. There was a monk
whose vow of celibacy was threatened by reoccurring sexual
fantasies. He practiced meditating on the body as a skeleton to rid himself of
these troubling thoughts. One day, he was walking on a forced path. A beautiful
woman came along the same path headed alone toward her parents' house after a
fight with her husband. When she saw the monk, she smiled at him as she passed. A
little while later, the woman's husband came along the same path, looking for his
wife. When he saw the monk, he asked him, Sir, did you see a beautiful young woman
passing this way? I don't know whether it was a man or a woman, the monk replied,
but I saw a skeleton passing this way. So, to me, that's, oh, that's some like,
that's some direct teaching. I can actually use that same technique. You know,
if that's something that I'm noticing in my own mind stream, then that's a
technique that I can use and really employ to really see not the appearance
of the body, but to be more in the recognition of that direct experience of
the body. So, that might be a skillful way of practicing with certain things. And
it's such a, it's an interesting story too, because while that's that worked for
that monk, he probably wouldn't be a good witness. If you needed a witness to have
a lot of some details, that's probably not the guy to talk to. But, you know,
again, the other thing I kind of think I'll just add here too is, you know,
there's been a lot of mentioning of judgment. And I think, you know, sometimes
in our practice of mindfulness, judgment can get a bad rap. You know, you hear a
lot about being non-judgmental. Well, there's some things that is very
appropriate to have a judgment about, like this is skillful and this is
unskillful. And so, one thing that I think of in regards to judgment is that if
we just give the judgment some space, if we're mindful of our judgment, oftentimes
that judgment, when given that kind of space in the mind, it has an opportunity
to mature and it matures into discernment. So, if there's judgment in the mind, just
be mindful of that judgment. And you might notice that it matures into some
discernment. Preventing negative states of mind. Again, another one that I thought
I would highlight is having boundaries. That's very important, having
boundaries. And one of the things that I think is really kind of helpful to keep
in mind when it comes to boundaries, boundaries aren't for others. Boundaries
are for us. You know, boundaries aren't a line that we draw in the sand and say,
okay, you don't cross my boundaries. It's those lines that we draw in the sand
and that's for us to respect and honor. So, and I think also when we consider our
boundaries, it's preemptive. And that's really so much of preventing negative
states of mind is all about how can I be preemptive. So, overcoming negative
states of mind. Overcoming negative states of mind. Wow, I love it. It's so
interesting when you find these patterns of mind. One thing that I think can be
helpful is noticing how there may be a tendency of mind to indulge in negative
states. You know, when we are feeling kind of defeated by life's
circumstances or we find ourselves stuck in a mood, we might notice that the
mind's just kind of lingering there. It's almost like, you know, there was a
mention of practicing gratitude that you don't have a toothache. That's a great
practice. You can, that's almost 100% of the time, hopefully, but you don't have a
toothache. Well, sometimes when the mind is overcome with a negative state, it's
kind of like we got that toothache and we're teasing it with the tongue. Only
now we're teasing this unpleasant mind state in the mind. We're just kind of
like, you know, there's some deluded wisdom thinking, well, maybe I need to
hear this, you know, these thoughts that are telling me that I'm unlovable or
that they don't really love me, you know, and I'm playing with these thoughts in
the mind. Even though there's an aspect that recognizes, oh, this is unwholesome,
this doesn't, this does not help. But yet we might just get sticky with it. We
might indulge in it and think, oh, no, there's wisdom here because I'm not
really lovable. And yet there's another aspect, there's a wisdom, an
underlying wisdom that recognizes that's not true. But yet we tease it like
we're playing around with a toothache. So I think, you know, maybe some of that is
relatable, maybe not, but there's that aspect that we sometimes indulge. We
indulge in ourself pity, we indulge in being a victim, we indulge in telling
ourselves the worst case scenario as a way of trying to prepare ourselves for
things not going the way we would like them to. So just notice if there's that
tendency where the mind is indulging. And if you notice it, other thing that
kind of came up over the course of the day, practicing forgiveness, practicing
self-forgiveness. Because sometimes I was practicing, my really was practicing
resentment. I really was practicing jealousy or or or greed for something. So
practicing forgiveness. And so what is it like to practice self-forgiveness? So
you might even use this phrase, this kind of phrase that you may have heard
from other meditation instruction. If I have caused myself harm intentionally or
unintentionally through thoughts, word or deed, I ask for my forgiveness. I freely
offer my forgiveness to myself. So again, if I have caused harm to myself
intentionally or unintentionally through thought, word or deed, I freely offer
myself forgiveness. Because even when we find ourselves in a negative mind state,
I think there is a little bit of us that recognizes, oh this is a negative mind
state. And maybe we look back on those experiences thinking, well I should have
got out of it sooner. I should have found my way out of that negative mind
state sooner. Then, you know, you can practice that self-forgiveness. And then
it can be really helpful just to remind yourself in a very rational way, we
choose what thoughts we allow to proliferate in the mind. We make that
choice. We choose what thoughts we allow to proliferate in the mind. And we can
make a choice. We can plant that seed in this moment that will give rise to the
next. And we can plant a wholesome seed. So this is this is the application of
that skillful effort. The other thing to keep in mind when it comes to overcoming
negative states of mind is opposing unwholesome states immediately. If we
think, well I can tease around with this, it'll grow, it'll grow in strength. And it
can get to the point where it becomes really overwhelming, very powerful state
of mind. But the importance of being mindful to see it initially, as soon as
you see it initially, really begin to use what you've heard over the course of
the day. Of how can I overcome this negative state of mind? As soon as you
begin to see it, as soon as that mindfulness recognizes that it is a
negative state of mind. Cultivating positive states of mind. Even when you
overcome negative states, just remember the mind is still vulnerable. So just
because you've overcome a negative state, just keep in touch with that
understanding that the mind is still vulnerable. When an unwholesome state has
been overcome, the mind goes into a neutral state. And you can use this
interval of neutrality to cultivate positive states of mind. So what do we do
to cultivate positive states of mind? Again, I hope my warning was a little
helpful that this was going to be kind of a recap. So overcoming, so what we can do
to cultivate positive states of mind, remember any skillful act that you have
done in the past and the pleasant states of mind that went with that action. So
you can use your memory, using memory of any good deed you've done. That's a
really wonderful way of cultivating wholesome states. And you can recall your
past success in abandoning greed, hatred, and delusion. So there's kind of two
sides of the same coin in a way, remembering times where you've experienced
wholesome states and remembering those times where you've overcome unwholesome
states. And then this one is kind of more something that I was just personally
thinking about earlier this afternoon, was how taking refuge in the Buddha, you
know, one of the three refuges, taking refuge in the Buddha, is a way of
cultivating wholesome states, reflecting upon your own potential,
practicing the wholesome states that you see in others. So my
favorite example of this is, you know, just kind of, in general, grandmother or
grandfather, you know, the kindness, the understanding that you see in them, it's
like, oh, that's possible for me. It's like, you know, maybe there's some,
maybe there's some generosity present. But here's grandmother showing me what
real generosity is all about. You know, and like, oh, that can be something that
helps me move into that place of cultivation, just reflecting upon those
wonderful occasions where I have been the benefactor of wholesome states that
they've been demonstrated to me. So then, like, maintaining positive states of
mind, maintaining positive states. So this was something that I think was, it was
mentioned earlier, this whole refining of your inventory, strengthening those
states that have already arisen through thought, speech, and action. So this is
something that I find really noticeable for me when I'm on retreat. And so, in a
way, this has been a retreat for you. You've practiced this day-long retreat. And
so, with practicing, you can kind of see, like, here's a quality of mind, and I've
only scratched the surface. I love that, that term, it has a lot of meaning to me
personally, because I went on a long retreat, and when I came out of that
retreat, there was just so much humility. Oh my goodness, I've only scratched the
surface of what it means to be generous, what it means to be compassionate. And it
was just a very humbling thing to see the depths of compassion. You know, there's
the practice of the Brahma-Biharas, cultivating these boundless states. You
can really begin to have a recognition of, wow, this boundless good will that we
can cultivate, that we can strengthen in the mind. So much good will. And, you know,
so it's kind of like wherever you think you are on the path, go further. And again,
go further. There's a rallying cry, a call to make effort, to be encouraged. And
I really like that, of, yeah, scratching the surface, and what's really possible,
and finding that the answer is, it's all possible.
Maintaining positive states. One thing I think is helpful too, is just to keep in
mind everything changes. Wholesome states arise, and they too pass away. So,
begin again. What calls up energy is making effort. Effort begets energy. So,
every time you're given this instruction, begin again. That's that
invitation to make effort. Begin again. And when you begin again, there's that
energy, and you can find that the joy might be there, the joy in this moment.
Maybe just in the mentioning of joy, you can, the mind is like, oh yeah, I see it,
there it is. There's joy to be had in this very moment. What robs me of this joy is
when the mind gets distracted, and runs off out of this moment. Joy is only found
in the present moment. Everything else is a memory of joy, or an idea of what joy
is. But when you're really present, that's where you can really find, oh, in this
moment, right here, right now, there's joy.
And then the mind wanders. You begin again. Come back to this present moment. Come
back to that wise effort of cultivating, or simply maintaining positive states of
mind. And then something else that I thought I would read is, so this kind of
harkens back to a comment that someone in the group made, and this is an
encouragement. Do whatever you know from your own experience and common sense that
leads to good qualities in yourself.
How's that for giving you a sense of agency in the cultivation of your own
mind? That's wonderful. It's a good reminder to remember that, hey, it's up
to you. So this is what the Buddha said. As far as the things you should do, or the
things you do that lead to good qualities. So the things you do, he said, should
lead to dispassion, not passion. Disentanglement, not entanglement.
Dispersion of causes of suffering, not accumulation. Wanting little, not much.
Contentment, not discontentment. Peaceful solitude, not gregariousness. Effort, not
laziness. Being easily supportable, not fussy and demanding. So these things, the
Buddha was mentioning, this is what you can do to maintain positive states of
mind. So the great thing about making these four great efforts is it really can
be very simple. So keep it simple. Smile at how wonderfully simple it is. If it
feels confusing, let the body help you feel into the present moment. Through the
body, feel into this moment and recognize, ah, they're suffering here. If
they're suffering, there's craving. Craving leads to suffering. So if there's
some form of suffering in this moment, you can trace it back to craving. When
you begin to recognize that cause of that suffering, then you can begin to see,
okay, what's being practiced here. Is there an unwholesome state of mind? So I
will leave it at that. And I will pass it on over to Maria Lai. Yeah, now we've
really come to the end of the day. And if you want more information about us, I
think Dawn has some links ready. Yeah. And if you, yeah, as you know, IMC is
supported by donations that called Dana in Bali. So if you are interested in
making a donation for IMC, then there's a link for that too, that I just put in
the chat. So the IMC and the teachers are supported by your donations here. Very
gratefully accepted. It's no obligation, of course. And let us then end with
sharing the merits. So you could take a moment to just close your eyes again if
that feels right to you. I really feel like what it was like for you today to
practice in this Sangha together with us. How wonderful it is that you could make
the time, the energy and the effort to be here present. Maybe there's a sense of
gratitude for yourself. And also for all others who are here and who've made that
same time commitment and put in the energy and effort. During a day like
this, a lot of goodness, wholesomeness is being generated. Just a mere fact of
listening to the dharma, practicing the dharma, discussing the dharma is super
wholesome. And this wholesomeness and goodness you can share with each other
and with all beings everywhere. May all beings benefit from this goodness and
wholesomeness that is being generated today. May it contribute to their well
being and to their freedom, freedom from suffering, just as it contributes to our
freedom from suffering. With that, well end the meditation, the day long. Thank you
all for your presence here.
