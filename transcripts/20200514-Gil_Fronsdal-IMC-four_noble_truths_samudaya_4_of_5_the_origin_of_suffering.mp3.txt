Today  we continue with the fourth talk on the Second 
Noble Truth . I’m offering different interpretations of the 
Second Noble Truth , and of the Four Noble Truths in 
general. The value of these different interpretations is 
that each of them is a different pragmat ic or practical 
way of exploring and freeing ourselves from our 
suffering.  
 
Rather than seeing the Four Noble Truths as a fixed 
doctrine that has a fixed interpretation  or fixed 
understanding, it ’s possible to see them  as a 
framework , which  can be applied  to understand our

freer and freer of suffering.  
 
Sometimes the first interpretation (Monday ’s) is useful  – 
the causal interpretation that there ’s a cause of 
suffering. And if you can understand that cause, maybe 
you can do something about th at suffering by letting go 
of the cause.  
 
Sometimes it ’s useful to look at the conditionality of 
suffering  – the conditions through which  suffering has 
arisen  – all the d ifferent pieces that come together, add 
up, and build up together to create suffering. 
Sometimes we don ’t address  the cause, but we change 
the conditions.  
 
A third interpretation (yesterday ’s) is that of inconstancy 
– looking at how thoroughly and complet ely things are 
constantly shifting and changing, appearing and 
disappearing. Somehow , in the inconstancy of 
experience, it ’s clear that the grip of clinging begins to 
release. We start seeing freedom because of 
inconstancy . As we go through these three 
interpretations , it’s like going deeper and deeper in to 
the mind  – into a stiller, quieter, more attentive mind  – 
one that is not overlaying a lot of ideas on top of things.

- 3 - And when we start seeing the fundamental, inconstant 
flow of experience in deep meditation, it ’s really clear 
that there ’s freedom in that flow  – freedom in between 
the things that exist. And that flow helps to release 
some of the deepest kinds of holding we have. This i s 
the liberating insight, the liberating interpretation.  
 
Today,  for the fourth interpretation , I’m going to offer 
one that talks about the origin of suffering. Some 
translators actually translate this word, samudaya , 
which in the Second Noble Truth means ‘arising ,’ as the 
noble truth of the ‘origin ’ of suffering. So w hy do they 
translate  it as ‘origin? ’ I believe  this has a lot to do  with 
the Buddha ’s so called first discourse.  
 
After the Buddha was enlightened, he went to find his 
six previous companions in the ascetic life, because he 
thought they were ready to hear  these deeper teachings 
about liberation, enlightenment. It is said that when he 
found  them, he taught them the Four Noble Truths.  
 
The simple Dharma teaching  (I don ’t know if ‘simple ’ is 
the right word ) will often say that the Second Noble 
Truth , the cause of suffering, is craving . The condition 
leading to the arising of suffering is craving. That idea 
comes from th is first sermon of the Buddha, and it 
begins this way (this is Bhikkhu Bodhi ’s translation):

- 4 - Now this , bhikkhus , is the noble truth of the origin of 
suffering. It is this craving .  
 
So, there it is: “It is this craving. ” I think many times 
when Dharma teachers and even scholars are writing 
about the Second Noble Truth , they stop there. It ’s 
craving. It ’s useful to l ook at craving  – the thirst, the 
clinging, this strong, compulsive desire.  
 
But the passage goes on, and often the rest of it is not 
discussed as much. “It is this craving, which …” So here 
we go: “the craving which... ” We’re talking about a 
particular kind  of craving now. So , what is the origin of 
suffering in this translation? The origin is the craving 
which... Which what? It ’s the craving which leads – so 
it’s going to go somewhere. It’s kind of like a cause  – it 
leads someplace. So, where does it lead?  
 
It is a particular kind of craving that leads someplace. It 
is the craving that leads to renewed existence  – to 
being reborn  – accompanied by delight and lust, 
seeking delight here and there. That is craving . Or to 
say it in different words : 
That is what th is craving is : craving for sensual 
pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for 
extermination, for non -existence.

- 5 - This is an intense passage. Some people, trying to 
understand what the Four Noble Truths  are about, are 
surprised to come across this particular explanation of 
the Second Noble Truth , because it focuses on rebirth. 
It’s this particular craving that leads to rebirth. The 
craving that human beings have in a previous life  – the 
craving to be reborn  – is the origin of the person ’s next 
life. And it’s also the origin of all the suffering that 
person has in their next life.  
 
So in this interpretation, with the understanding of 
rebirth across  multiple lives, all the suffering t hat you 
have in this lifetime has its origin in craving to be 
reborn. This is the  solution to not be ing reborn again 
and again into this world of suffering . It is to let go of a 
particular kind of craving – the craving for rebirth. That’s 
where we get this idea that the Second Noble Truth  has 
to do with the origin  of suffering – even though, as I 
keep saying, the word samudaya means ‘arising. ’  
 
Yesterday I talked about these four liberating insights 
into:  
• This is suffering . 
• This is the arising of suffering . 
• This is the cessation of suffering . 
• This is the practice leading to the cessation of 
suffering.

And I offered th e interpretation, which I think represent s 
what the Buddha was teaching over and over again. 
This little formula, without the words “noble truth ,” 
appears hundreds of times in the sutta s. People often 
think the Buddha is talking about the Four Noble Truths, 
because the wording is  so similar, but he ’s talking about 
inconstancy – the immediacy of experi ence here and 
now.  
 
The explanation in the first discourse of the Buddha is 
much more abstract. It ’s not about the immediacy of 
present moment experience. It ’s about a story, an idea, 
a belief in rebirth, and an idea of how rebirth happens. 
It’s a theory about rebirth. We’ve left the world of direct 
experience – at least in terms of the reader and what ’s 
being pointed to – to kind of a belief, a tenet, a creed 
that the problem of suffering  is the fact that we want to 
be reborn. And then we do get reborn.  
 
Some people may  be reeling to hear this. “What? This 
is getting complicated. I thought practice and 
mindfulness were just about present moment 
experience – seeing it here now, deep insight into how 
things are here and now. And now we ’re talking about 
this fundamental Buddhist teaching of the Four Noble 
Truths, and that in order to understand it, you have to

- 7 - understand rebirth , and believe that craving is the  
cause  of rebirth ? How do I get to this root craving – this 
origin of suffering? ” 
 
For some of us , it’s not so satisfying. For others,  it’s 
inspiring to hear this : “Ah, people who believe in rebirth 
really want to see how to get off the wheel of life and 
death. ” But for p eople who don ’t believe in it so much, 
it’s like, “What? ” It’s a little bit confusing , or maybe even 
off-putting, to have this wonderful teaching of the Four 
Noble Truths interpreted in this way.  
 
One way of understanding this  – and I received this 
from one of the great scholar monks  – is the idea is that 
this discourse of the Buddha ’s first sermon is not meant 
to be the definitive teaching on the Four Noble Truths . 
Rather , it is a very particular elaboration of how 
someone, when they become fully awakened  (like 
becom ing a Buddha ), no longer get reborn . How does 
that happen? How do es one no longer get reborn?  
 
The explanation is th at for this person, that particular 
craving for rebirth has been uprooted . It has been 
stopped. So , rather than the Buddha ’s first se rmon 
being the universal teachings on the Four Noble Truths 
through which  we can understand our lives  – it’s rather 
a very particular application of a framework to look at  
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: JAS _mg 
  
- 8 - and explain how someone who becomes fully 
awakened has been changed  – a particular mechanism 
for that.  
 
It’s irrelevant for someone who ’s fully awakened, but 
not necessarily for someone who ’s just trying to 
become free in this lifetime as they go through their 
lives. This idea is a little more complicated. But I think 
it’s important to those of us who are engaged in 
Buddhism, and trying to reflect on the Four Noble 
Truths. We’re trying to go back and see the teachings of 
the Buddha , trying to make sense of the teachings  of 
the first sermon of the Buddha . We want  to 
contextu alize it, and to really understand the 
particularity of what the focus is on , so that we’re not 
confused  – or we think we have to adopt a tenet, a 
belief, or apply this particular teaching to our practice.  
 
So in the origin of suffering, here the origin m eans the 
original place in the past life that gives birth to the 
suffering. Some translators translate th e word 
samudaya , meaning ‘arising ,’ as ‘origination. ’ Some of 
you reading the different translators will see this.  
 
I’m not sure what ‘origination’ means . I know the 
dictionary definition. I think it may  just mean ‘origin. ’ Or 
maybe it ’s a hybrid, or a vague way of talking about  
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: JAS _mg 
  
- 9 - conditionality  – talking abo ut origin  – not the 
fundamental, original origin  – but rather where suffering 
originates, any place you can see it originating in the 
conditions for it  – the more immediate cause today , or 
in current times.  
 
So, these interpretations  are all material to s wim in, to 
work with, and to apply to our lives. And the test , the 
purpose,  of all this  is to be able to be present with clear 
eyes, looking clearly into our life, understanding what 
we’re doing, how we ’re living, where the clinging, and 
where the craving is.  
 
And then we want to understand how it ’s useful to work 
through that to come to the other side of suffering. 
Sometimes it ’s useful to see cause, sometimes the 
condition (s), sometimes inconstancy. An d sometimes it 
may be that seeing the origin is useful or important in 
order to understand that this is part of it.  
 
We’ll review all this again in a (hopefully) practical way 
next week, when we talk about nirodha , the cessation of 
suffering. But for now,  we’re still looking at this Second 
Noble Truth . And we have one more talk tomorrow.  
 
I look forward to making efforts again to explain this to 
you, and hopefully you ’re finding it practical. Thank you.
