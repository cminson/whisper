Practice Note: Balance d uring 
Meditation

I feel that  my meditation practice is a balance between 
doing and not doing. Every person has  a different 
balance , and we all have  to find our own balance . When 
you have a sense of that balance – findin g that balance , 
staying close to it, be ing mindful of it – it can help  with 
staying present in your meditation.  
 
If it’s only about doing – about being responsible for the 
meditatio n, trying, actively engaged – then the busyness 
and the agitated activity  of the mind  tend to keep going 
– reinforcing the sense of the doer, the one who’s doing,  
the one who’s the agent . But if it’s only a matter of not 
doing anything at all , then that can lead to complacency, 
falling asleep, or being t oo accepting of what is , and 
letting  the mind  wander off.    
 
An analogy for this  balance would be  like floating on 
your back in water, as in a lake. T here’s a lot of not 
doing in floating. Y ou have to stop a lot, but you  also 
have to stay mindful and present,  moving just enough to 
keep  your bo dy flat and your arms out, just enough  to stay there and not tip to one side or the other. You have  
to keep your head in the right position , so there’s  
balance. Y ou can’t lose your mi ndfulness when you are 
floating . You can ’t just forget where you are and 
completely disa ppear. You have to stay mindful, but i t 
can also be very relaxing. You don’t have to do a l ot. If 
you start getting  caught up i n trying to d o things, then  
you may find yourself un comfortable with it all.  How do 
we float?  
 
[Cell phone sound :] It’s so easy to forget to turn off our 
cell phones when we come  here. [The sound 
continues.] This could keep happening, and every time 
it happens, we could all be grateful, and take it as a 
reminder  to turn ours off next time.   
 
Hopefully you can find the right balance here as you 
float on the present moment – not too active, not too 
inactive – but just staying in the present moment, 
floati ng in the present moment, keeping enough 
attention to be here in  the present, not trying too hard, 
not trying too little.  
 
Thank you.
