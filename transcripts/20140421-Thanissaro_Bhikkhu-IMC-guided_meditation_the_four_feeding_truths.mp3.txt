The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
I've been asked to give a guided meditation tonight.
So if you have a meditation method you already like, stick with that.
And if you'd like to try this,
you're welcome to try it.
Close your eyes and think thoughts of goodwill.
Goodwill is a way for happiness.
You're a true happiness and a true happiness of others.
We're the emphasis on the true.
True happiness has to come from within.
Your actions, your own words, your deeds, your thoughts.
It comes from resources that you develop inside.
That's why we're meditating, is to develop those resources.
Which means that your true happiness doesn't conflict with the true happiness of anyone else.
Because in developing these resources you don't have to take anything away from anyone else.
It's not like the pleasures of the world where one person gains something and someone else will have to lose it.
This is something where we work on our inner resources, each of us.
And so there's no conflict.
So when you wish for your own true happiness, there's nothing selfish about the thought.
So think that thought for a minute.
May I be truly happy.
May I understand the causes for true happiness and act on them to the point where I receive the results.
And then spread the same thought to others.
Start with people who are close to your heart, your family, your very close friends.
May they find true happiness too.
And then spread that thought out in ever-widening circles. People you know well and like.
People you like even though you don't know them so well.
People you're more neutral about.
And people you don't like.
Remember the world will be a much better place if everyone could find true happiness within.
And you don't gain anything by wishing ill on anybody.
Think thoughts of good will to people you don't even know.
And not just people, living beings of all kinds.
East, west, north, south.
Above and below, out to infinity.
May we all find true happiness in our hearts.
Now bring your attention to the breath.
Take a couple of good long deep in and out breaths.
Notice where you feel the breathing process.
The energy that goes through the body as you breathe in and breathe out.
When we talk about breath or breath energy, that's what we mean.
The air coming in and out of the nostrils is one thing.
One of the energy is what you're really interested in.
And if long breathing feels good, keep it up.
If it doesn't, you can change.
Shorter breathing, more shallow, faster, slower, heavier, lighter.
Adjusting the breath in different ways and see what feels best for the body right now.
Or you can just pose that question in the mind each time you breathe in.
What kind of breathing would feel good now?
Let's see how the body responds.
If your mind wanders off following a thought, just drop the thought and come back to the breath.
If it wanders off again, bring it back again.
Ten times, a hundred times, don't give in.
Just keep coming back, coming back.
Each time you come back, reward yourself with an especially nice breath.
Something feels really good as it comes in and goes out.
You might ask yourself which parts of the body feel starved of breath energy right now and allow them to share.
Because the movement of energy in the body isn't confined just to the torso.
You can feel it in any part of the body.
Simply that it's stronger in some parts than others.
If you're feeling tense, think of the breath relaxing you.
If you're feeling tired, think of it giving you energy.
Once the breath becomes comfortable, the next step is to be aware of the whole body as you breathe in and breathe out.
It's good to build up to that section by section.
Start down around the navel.
Locate that part of the body in your awareness and watch it for a while as you breathe in and breathe out.
See what rhythm of breathing feels good there.
If you notice any tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax.
If there's any sense of blockage in that part of the body, think of it dissolving away.
No new tension builds up as you breathe in and you're not holding on to any as you breathe out.
If you're feeling tired, think of it giving you energy.
If you're feeling tired, think of it giving you energy.
If you're feeling tired, think of it giving you energy.
Move your attention up to the solar plexus, the area right in front of the stomach, and follow the same steps there.
In other words, one, locate that part of the body in your awareness.
Two, watch it for a while as you breathe in and breathe out to see what rhythm of breathing feels good there.
Three, if there's any sense of tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax.
If you want, you can think of breath energy entering the body right there so you don't have to pull it from anywhere else.
It feels immediately nourished as soon as you start breathing in.
Three, if there's any sense of tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax.
And move your attention up to the middle of the chest and follow the same steps there.
Three, if there's any sense of tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax.
Three, if there's any sense of tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax.
Three, if there's any sense of tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax.
Bring your attention up to the base of the throat and follow the same steps there.
Three, if there's any sense of tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax.
Three, if there's any sense of tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax.
Three, if there's any sense of tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax.
Three, if there's any sense of tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax.
Now bring your attention to the middle of the head.
As you focus here, try not to put too much pressure on the nerves of the head because they tend to be overworked.
As you breathe in, think of breath energy coming in not only through the nose but also through the eyes and the ears.
In from the back of the neck down from the top of the head.
Reaching deep into the head and dissolving away any patterns of tension you may feel around the eyes and the forehead and the jaws.
And gradually dissolving those patterns of tension away.
Are there any parts in the head that seem to be unnerved by the breath? Think of the breath going deep in there.
So there's no room in your head for any thinking, just breath energy refreshing in the head.
Like a camera whose lens is a focal point that's actually in the lens itself.
So breathe in, breathe out, breathe out, breathe out, breathe out.
Breathe in.
Now bring your attention to the back of the neck right at the base of the skull.
As you breathe in, think of breath energy coming in there going down through the shoulders and the arms out to the tips of the fingers.
And as you breathe out, think of it radiating out from all those parts of the body into the air.
And as you become more sensitive to these parts of the body, try to notice which side may be holding more tension than the other side.
Compare shoulders, compare elbows, compare wrists, hands. If you sense that there's more tension on one side than the other, allow the tense side to relax.
So stay relaxed all the way through the in breath, all the way through the out.
And as you breathe in, think of breath energy coming in there going down through the arms out to the tips of the fingers.
Now keep your attention focused on the back of the neck this time as you breathe in.
And as you breathe in, think of the breath energy going down both sides of the spine down at the tailbone.
And as you breathe out, think of it radiating out from the entire spine into the air.
And as you get more sensitive to the back, try to notice if you're holding more tension on the left side than on the right side.
Whichever side is holding more tension, allow that to relax.
And see if you can keep it relaxed all the way through the in breath, all the way through the out.
And as you breathe in, think of it radiating out from the entire spine into the air.
And as you breathe in, think of it radiating out from the entire spine into the air.
And move your attention to the tailbone.
As you breathe in, think of the breath energy coming in there going down through the hips, the legs, the ankles, the feet, out to the tips of the toes.
And as you breathe in, think of it radiating out from those parts of the body into the air.
And as you breathe in, think of it radiating out from the entire spine into the air.
And as you become more sensitive to these parts of the body, again check to see if one side is holding more tension than the other.
Say in the hips or the thighs, calves, ankles, feet, wherever you sense that, try to relax it.
Allow it to stay relaxed all the way through the in breath, all the way through the out.
And as you breathe in, think of it radiating out from the entire spine into the air.
And that completes one cycle in the survey of the body.
If you'd like, you can go through the body again, starting at the navel and going up the front.
Do this as many times as you like it, whatever pace you like, until you're ready to settle down.
You can choose any one spot that seems most congenial.
The breath is most comfortable or it's easiest to stay focused.
Allow your awareness to settle there and then from that spot to spread out and fill the entire body.
So you're aware of the whole body as you breathe in, breathe out.
And think of the breath, filling the whole body as you breathe in, breathe out.
Your awareness will have a tendency to shrink, especially on the out breath.
So remind yourself each time you breathe in, whole body, each time you breathe out, whole body.
And allow the breath to find whatever rhythm feels best.
That's all you have to do, just try to maintain this sense of centered but broad awareness.
It's healing for the body, healing for the mind.
And because it's all around, it provides a really good foundation for insight to arise.
In areas where you ordinarily wouldn't look.
