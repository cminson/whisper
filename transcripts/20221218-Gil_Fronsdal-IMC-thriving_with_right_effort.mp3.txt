The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So what's on my mind on my heart a bit is a might seem it initially maybe a
little bit of an uninteresting topic. I hope I can make it interesting and and
that is the sixth factor of the Eightfold Path, which is right effort. And maybe
one thing that will kind of maybe pique your interest around this topic of
right effort is the first time many years ago, I'm over 25 years ago, that I gave
a series of talks on the Eightfold Path, one of the most important teachings of
the Buddha. And I did it, you know, I was going to do it to one factor for every
evening. And so I was going through the factors and then it was time to do the
factor on right effort. And I without any comment or explanation or
recognition that I was doing it, I consciously skipped it. And no one asked
me why'd you skip it. And the reason I skipped it was I couldn't, it wasn't
really behind it. I couldn't quite get myself inspired by it. And some of it
had to do with my background in Zen, where in Zen it was really clear teaching
admonition to not to any, not strive, not have any goal orientation, not try to
make anything happen, not try to attain particular states of meditation. Rather,
the instruction was to wholeheartedly, fully be present for what is. And so
there was a lot of physical effort that went into into Zen. You had to show up
early in the morning in the monastery, like at four o'clock in the morning, you
had to wake it up and get up to do no effort at all. And then you had to take a
very particular posture, sit very straight and upright. There's a lot of
effort that goes into the posture. And then they ring the bell, and then you
have to do walking meditation, they ring the bell, you come back to take this
posture to do nothing in. And so there's kind of nothing you do, but kind of a
lot you do. There's a lot of effort. And in fact, when I was practicing in the
monastery in Japan, I was admonished when I didn't make enough effort. And they
would say in Japan, I had to do things with Zen no chikara. And that means with
Zen power. So, so it was a little bit, you know, kind of how I learned Zen and how
I understood it was very peculiar maybe to myself. But, but it was clearly not
striving, not goal-oriented and not trying to make anything happen. And I
loved Zen and I put a lot of, in retrospect, I realized I put a lot of
effort into it. But it was kind of like the effort to show up. But the mind
wasn't trying to do anything. It was almost like it was a physical effort to
show up for the present. And physical was very important for me because a lot of
it was the embodied awareness that came in the embodied showing up. And the mind
was just trying to be present but nothing else. There's no effort there. So
that's how I defend myself a little bit or explain myself a little bit for
skipping right effort. But at some point I started appreciating as I kept
studying the eightfold path and looking at right effort and appreciating that
actually I put a lot of effort into it. And I love the effort I made. And even
when I went to Burma to practice Vipassana there, there too the teacher
made teachings about you should strive. And some people really did themselves in,
really suffered a lot because maybe with the kind of Western acculturation
striving meant stressing. And so people would stress at meditation, which was
not healthy. And there were people who were kind of basket cases from that
approach. But because I came from the Zen background, when I heard strive, I
mostly just shrugged it off. And then I did that anyway. In retrospect, I wasn't
striving to attain anything. But again, once again I was really trying to whole
heartedly show up and be present for what is, which was the instructions. And in
the background it was for attaining something. But I wasn't there exactly to
attain something. I was there to show up fully. And it was really wonderful for me
the very detailed precise instructions that I received in Burma in Vipassana
for doing this Zen thing. Show up really precisely for the moment. But in doing
that, it's had in motion an unfolding, a growth, a development in practice that
led to some of the states that they're pointing to, what you can attain. But it
wasn't like attaining it wasn't the point for me. It was kind of a by-product. So
I felt very lucky to have had this background in Zen when I practiced
with this fierce teacher Upadita in Burma. Because I was protected in a way
that a lot of other Vipassana students were not protected from the striving
element that he had. And so it took a while for me to get my handle on this
Theravadan, early Buddhist kind of idea of right effort. So to give you, maybe to
kind of, you can appreciate a little bit more the challenge I had to get behind
it. So right effort is made up of four different kind of practices or efforts.
And whether we should call it effort or endeavor, some people translated four
endeavors, the right endeavor. And maybe that feels a little bit more relaxing. I
don't know. But it has to do with recognizing the distinction between
wholesome states of mind and unwholesome states of mind. Unwholesome states of
mind are reactive qualities of the mind. We react compulsively, addictively to
experience with anger, with greed, with hostility, with delusion, with fear. The
unwholesome states of mind always contain some degree of suffering, of pain in
them. And that's what qualifies them as unwholesome is they are detrimental to
the person who has them. So if you have anger, which is not detrimental to you,
then it wouldn't be considered unwholesome. But that's the definition of
it in this tradition. So you have to be able to recognize what's unwholesome,
what's stressful, what's detrimental. And then there's what's wholesome, which is
healthy and beneficial for the person who has it. And these are mental states,
activities of the mind that we do. And so if there is an impulse for
generosity that has no conceit or no greed or no ill will in it, then it's
wholesome. But if it's mixed with these unwholesome ones, it kind of makes the
generosity unwholesome as well. So to be able to be generous, to be loving, kind,
these are all kind of just part of many, many wholesome states of mind that we
can have. So that's the distinction in right effort. And there's two
practices that avoid unwholesome states of mind and two for wholesome. The
unwholesome has to do with, first, if there's nothing unwholesome, if you're not
being in a reactive mode, not caught up in unwholesome states, then prevent them
from occurring. So do what you can so they don't arise. If they have
arise, then abandon them, let go of them. So the same distinction happens for
wholesome. If there are wholesome states that haven't arisen, evoke them. If
they've arisen, if they're there, then maintain them. So that's the kind of the
simple explanation for it. But in each of these four steps, this is what you're
supposed to do. And it's repeated for each one. You should make effort, arouse
energy, exert your mind, and strive to do each of those. So maybe now you can
sympathize a little bit for my skipping right effort in my talk. You're like,
what? I mean, this is a little bit strong, right? Now whether the English
translation is accurate is, you know, you've always questioned like the word
strive. Is that really the right thing? But anyway, that's, you know, just four
words, you know, for for doing this. So what, but when four words are being used
like this, what it does indicate is that for the Buddha, making some kind of
effort is super important. This isn't, the Dharma is not for lazy people. The
Dharma is not like, you know, to be easygoing. I'll get around to it
eventually and, you know, then I'll get, I'll do some of it. And in particular for
meditation, you know, to sit down in meditation, well, I'm sit here for a while,
but I'll get around to being presence, you know, maybe near the end, you know, you
know, I have some good, I have some good fantasies I have to get through first.
They're mostly reruns, but still I want to, I want to go through them. And, but
the idea, I love the word, word wholehearted. And for me, the summary of
all these powerful expressions here is do your practice wholeheartedly, do it
wholly, put yourself completely into it. But don't, don't stress. And then, and, and
I'll talk about that some more about this, but do it wholeheartedly. The Buddha
really wants you, don't be lazy, be wholehearted, give yourself to it, give
yourself, if you're going to practice, give yourself over to it when you're
practicing. So like meditation, there's a peaceful way of giving yourself over to
it, a way, a peaceful way that it doesn't cause more stress or tension, a whole
hearted way that actually, because the nature of the practice supports
de-stressing, letting go, relaxing tension. So, so in, in sometimes, sometimes
these four right efforts are summarized by the four words, prevent, abandon,
evoke, and maintain. That's nice. Nice thing to remember maybe. But it's, but if
you, then if you look at the instructions a little bit more carefully, there's a, I
find this is fascinating. And this is what I kind of came to realize the last
few weeks. And as I've been kind of seeing the teachings of the Buddha from a
new slant, the things that I overlooked before. And so sure enough, it says, for
unwholesome states that have an arisen, present them from arising. And for ones
that have arisen, abandon them. Just so each one of them has just as one word.
But for, for evoking wholesome states that have not yet arisen, it just says,
evoke them, bring them about, bring them up somehow. It's just one word. But this is
what I find fascinating is the fourth one. There are five words to describe what
you do here, not just maintain. So in this translation, it's continue, make the
effort for the continuance, the non-disappearance, the strengthening, the
increase, and the fulfillment by development, by cultivation of those
wholesome states that are present. That's a lot of words. So the other were
other, I have just one word, but this has a, so there's a kind of like, wow, now if
you're chanting this in the ancient world, people chanted this, it has a rhythm
to it. It has a heartfelt, it has an embodied feeling to it that I think has
that my guess is in the ancient world had a very different impact on people who
sit down to read this and start falling asleep because of these words and the
repetition. I mean, these, a lot of this tech, these ancient texts are not very
engaging to read if you're not, if you're a novice. But, but if you're chanting it
and you get the rhythm of the language and you're being carried along by their
rhythm, I can imagine that this language of it kind of almost suggests energy,
suggests kind of a embodied feeling of kind of excitement or, and then if you
chanted it a number of times and you heard it a number of times and you can,
it's like a refrain and you can get behind it and chant it yourself. There's
something that happens in chanting and communal chanting that there's a
concentration and a vocation, a deeper resonance inside of us for what's being
talked about. So one awakens effort for the continuance, for the continuance, the
non-disappearance, the strengthening, the increase, the fulfillment by
cultivation. So, by cultivate, so anyway, I don't know if this, you get a sense of
this rhythm and the energy behind it and how it might be conveyed in the ancient
way, in the way that this was originally meant to be presented. But what strikes
me is that a couple of things is, I think it's fair to say that this Buddhism
thing that we do is often associated with letting go. Isn't that kind of like
non-attachment and you have to, like you go to a, you know, a block party and
people's, you know, kind of like, you're doing Buddhist practice and, you know,
that's like kind of party pooper, you know, it's just about letting go and
you know, it's about letting go and non-attachment. This non-attachment is
overdone and, you know, my wife, when we had a little baby, went to
an organization called Bat-Bay Area Attachment Parenting. So we're setting
my parents, you know, my wife and my son, my little baby, was going to this
attachment, you know, place. But attachment has a very different meaning in
psychology these days, where it's a healthy kind of sense of bonding and
connection that's very important. But for Buddhists, attachment is all
bad in Buddhist English. And so we have, Buddhism has that
reputation, but it does not have the reputation for what we're supposed to
do with these wholesome states. And the, you know, to increase them, to strengthen
them, to expand them, to develop them. Once they've arisen, make them, have them
grow. And we find elsewhere in these ancient texts, where it actually uses
the word to grow the wholesome states to the point that they're abundant, that
we thrive with them, that we're filled with them. They fully flow through us. The
word for fulfill kind of actually means to be filled out by them fully. And that's
kind of dramatic. And then, you know, the Zen person in me, the way I was taught
Zen, kind of reacts as well. Wait a minute. We're supposed to be prioritizing
certain states of mind. We should just be with the way things are and accept it
for what it is. And the idea that you prioritize certain states of mind, you
know, that was kind of like, you know, if you go to your Zen, I went to my Zen
teacher and say, you know, wow, I just got really concentrated or really felt
peaceful or filled with joy in my meditation. I'd be lucky if the teacher
said something like, well, just one more thing to let go of. And then sometimes
it was worse. And in Zen, they have something called Makko. I think it's Makkyo,
which is Makkyo Makko, you know, delusion. Anyway, it means delusion. It's just
kind of, you know, it's just delusion. Don't bother with it. And so this
dismissing of these beautiful wholesome states makes sense in a certain
in the in the in the in the approach of Zen, I want to be respectful for it. It
really makes sense in the grand totality of what Zen practice is about. It's very
effective if you really understand the purpose in the background for it. But it
also when I lend someone like me to read these kinds of texts and be dismissive
of it or not be interested. But at the same time, when I did Vipassana practice,
or I do it, these beautiful states arise. And they're allowed to rise. They're
supposed to arise sitting in meditation and allowing yourself to feel deeply
calm, deeply content, deeply at home, being here right now in such a way that
it's kind of an embodied at home this feeling that comes sometimes with
delight and joy and happiness and a subtleness of the mind gets really
still and unified and peaceful. The mind gets the I was really surprised to
discover the upwelling in meditation for the first time of very powerful states
of loving kindness, of compassion, of equanimity that arose. And so these
things are supposed to be allowed and grow and develop. And some of the fault
for not recognizing this early on is that a lot of the early English
translators flattened the polylanguage into English. They kind of made it
I think maybe they were distrustful of a lot of
emotionality and flowery kind of language or evocative language. And so
some of the more beautiful and inspiring words like thriving, the word
thriving became increase. And abundance became like you know frequent or lots
or you know something you know you know has very different emotional tone or
feeling the words you choose. And I think we kind of flattened it in these
English translation. And so but when you start to getting this language of
abundance and thriving you get a very different feeling for what fills us,
what can happen, what's possible. It's also possible to hear these and compare
oneself and say well these aren't happening to me so then I'm bad or
wrong or it's supposed to be different. It's also possible to think that you
know well I have to strive now to attain these and huff and puff and try to
hold on to it. And so there's a lot of detrimental reactivity that can come
into play when we hear about these things. But that's why these four right
efforts are needed together. And we need to understand them together because if
we mix wrong effort with right effort we end up with wrong effort. And so if you
hear that you're supposed to develop qualities of joy and happiness and
practice that that's supposed to come up. But we do it with with the clinging and
attachment then it doesn't help, it doesn't work. So one of the examples I
like to give for the kind of proper striving if you were into that kind of
thing is strive to be relaxed. And if you try to if that's you strive to be
relaxed that's a protection because you can't strive with tension and relax at
the same time. If the purpose is to relax the striving has to be wholehearted
it has to be diligent it has to be kind of continuous really stay on it on top
of it. But in staying on top of it it's you're staying you're getting more and
more relaxed you're discovering the places within where there's tension.
Just relax. And in fact elsewhere the Buddha talks about the first stages of
meditation has a lot to do with relaxing calming our reactivity. And the in the
kind of stages of meditation that he gives it's not until there's been a fair
amount of relaxation of reactivity that we begin getting into the realm of
maintaining cultivating and maintaining and growing and with these wonderful
positive states of mind that can arise. And and so we learn to relax the body
the Buddha said the reactivity that stored in our body for someone who's new
to meditation this is one of the first things that's really useful to do really
really find a way to sit and meditate so the shoulders can relax the belly can
relax that the muscles of the face really work on sitting upright or the
equivalent for you and it let let things really unwind. Don't be in a hurry to
jump over that stage of a practice. And then and then the second instruction is
to do that for the mind for the mental world whatever is a reactive and tense
in your mental world that's important to calm to prank make tranquil to settle
to relax. And so this is a very important protective measure in this practice
is to remember how important it is to relax. So then we take this instruction
here which says you should make effort arouse energy exert your mind and strive
to relax. Do it wholeheartedly really give yourself to it but you know don't
if you do it give yourself to it all heartedly remember to do it in a way
of relaxing. And then at some point with enough relaxation and enough being
fully present here and this is not an easy thing to come to and many people
find meditation phenomenally beneficial just because it gets real helps them
relax 10% of their tension and they're 10% more here and more wiser because of
it. But at some point when there's enough relaxation of our reactivity the
reactive world that we're caught in and living in these beneficial states the
wholesome states begin appearing on their own. They're not something we have to
manufacture or require but rather there's kind of like almost like the
nature of who we are is waiting inside of us our states of calm, peace, generosity,
care, love, equanimity, wisdom, joy, happiness that are just kind of like in
the you know just off stage just waiting for a chance to come on stage when
just those reactive actors can just get off. But you know that the reactive
actors are there all the time and so they never seem to they think they have
an anchor. And but finally when they settle away and there's room on the
stage of our mind or heart there's all the stuff that can arise and what this
teaching here means for me of you know support the continuous the maintaining
of it the strengthening it the development of it the abundance of it
has a lot to do with allowing it to do so getting out of the way and this is
one of the things I learned from this way I was practicing was how useful it
was to get out of my own way and kind of make room for these things I'll make
space for them which comes from appreciating them and it took a long
time for me to appreciate these positive states of mind that can arise out of
meditation out of Buddhist practice they were rose for me but I kind of shrug
them off or didn't pay any attention to it because of this Zen background where
we're not weren't supposed to and but eventually I learned oh you're this is
okay to appreciate these it's okay to make room for them and value them
because doing that is the very thing that supports them to grow more and more
and more if you don't appreciate them they don't grow if you get attached to
them they don't grow if you tie them if you connect them to your self-worth they
don't grow just let them be let them be there and support and grow and develop
and don't make them complicated get out of the way for them don't interfere with
them but then do the things that support them and some of that that supports
these is the wholeheartedly showing up and being present for what is and when
the wholesome states of mind begin showing themselves maybe as small hints
at first to be wholeheartedly present for those and making room for them gives
room for them to grow and develop and and then we come to a point and practice
some point not an easy thing but is kind of the north star that we kind of know
that's possible is that we come to a point where the thriving the sense of
abundance and so thriving that is possible embodied thriving embodied
abundance body sense of wholeness of nourishment seems to begin having a life
of its own it seems to be well up and be present and support us in being present
and it creates a context a background a foundation for being present for all
kinds of things including our reactivity including what's really difficult in this
world that that is such a powerful support to be supported by deep
relaxation by joy by happiness by sense of calm so we can address the
difficulties of this life of ours is very different than meeting the
difficulties of this life from that place of reactivity from the place of
wholeness that many people are caught up in so with all that I want to read an
ancient poem and it's what's here I think it's written by a disciple of the
Buddha from the ancient world rather than by the Buddha so in sense what we're
talking about today is the distinction between also between wise and unwise
attention so unwise attention doesn't know what to pay attention to properly
and also pays attention in ways that may be involved attachment or clinging or
resistance or aversion so this poem begins with a sentence from unwise
attention your thoughts eat you what do you think of that none of you of course
there apparently the the Pali word might literally mean chew you up and build
them more than just a lot more dramatic than eating so this ancient line of text
you know they're very poetic and powerful the words they have been kind of
flattened in English and so sometimes you know even the negative ones are very
kind of juicy from unwise attention your thoughts eat you giving up what is
unwise think wisely basing your thoughts on the Buddha Dharma Sangha and your
own virtue you will no doubt obtain gladness joy and happiness then with
abundant gladness you will make an end to suffering so here you see a shift from
language here from something unwholesome unhelpful unwise attention we learn how
to pay attention wisely and to think wisely so our thoughts don't eat us up
don't you know pull us into their whirlpool of preoccupation and then
basing ourselves on the values the orientation in life that the Buddha Dharma
Sangha represents and virtue your own ethics you will no doubt obtain gladness
joy and happiness so here's the emphasis on these wholesome healthy
qualities of mind of heart and then here it talks about abundance with abundant
gladness imagine this language of abundance is used sometimes a kind of
in a way of talk about it they talk about inner wealth that faith is inner wealth
vigilance and kind of careful attention is an inner wealth loving kindness is an
inner wealth so the idea of becoming wealthy abundant like the spilling over
you have more than enough you feel completely you know content and happy
and then you will make an end of suffering maybe your suffering won't
come to an end until you figured out a way to relax deeply to allow some really
beautiful qualities of heart to arise and so you can really then from that
point of view address the root of the suffering that you have in your life so
that was a little plug for right effort maybe trying to make up for 25 years
ago when I skipped it so thank you and so we have a few minutes if some of you
would like to ask questions or comments and you're welcome to do that
send Martha over there
thank you very much that was very provocative for me many things swirling
around inside me I want to add that in that place as I've acknowledged over
time the wholesome thoughts if you will the positive states the joy the the
higher vibration if you will I feel very much that I work with that idea of
what nurtures it what how do I resource it because we're also in our human being
bodies and my profession is a therapist so as I was listening to you it was
difficult it was unavoidable to not think about how we live out here
externally practically what do we do what choices do we make to feed those
states of mind and just the one thing I wanted to share that got me very excited
was when you spoke about how do we grow those wholesome states and what came to
me was express it create service love love more here and here and so thank you
you fed me deeply today great thank you that's very nice yeah I think if there
are these wholesome tendencies or qualities that are in us they grow by
expressing them especially if we express them wisely you're not just you know
inflict people with them but the wise expression of it and and the relational
are so important because one of the most common if someone you didn't ask me
directly but if one of the someone asked me you know how do you make these grow
or these wholesome states the most common answer the tradition gives is has to
do with how we live interrelationally with other people they say you should be
ethical you practice your ethics and generosity ethics is all about how we
live in relationship to other people and others other things and generosity the
same thing it's a interrelational world that we're that is so important for all
this and and sometimes because it's a meditation tradition we have and we
close our eyes and our tradition even right it just seems like it's so self
focused internally focused but but a lot of this work also happens
interrelationally and just ethics and generosity is the beginning of it so
someone else
thank you for your comments and this session today I wondered if you have
tried to teach or you have taught meditation to four to five year old
students to you know the and what your ex I mean to more higher ages maybe nine
ten to eleven twelve thirteen fourteen I've been trying to teach like five
minutes meditation when I have been teaching last few weeks and just to see
how they absorb being able to close their eyes and feel you know the
generosity and the wholesomeness of relationships yeah I don't haven't had a
lot of experience a lot of I haven't had a lot of experience with four to five
year olds and I think that for that age and for even older some of the ways of
being that adults want to see them adults want to have kids kind of be
positively influenced by meditation so that can be different in some kind of
way but I think some of the ways we want them to be different or be changed or
be supported or be guided or I don't know something there might be better
ways in trying to get them to meditate there might be how how parents conduct
themselves slowly over the you know regularly becomes a model for how they
learn to be present and be relaxed the parents are anxious they learn that the
world is a scary place if they learn if the parents are happy they learn the
world's a happy place to be so how the parents are at that age is probably more
important when my kids were that age there was one one I have two sons and
one of them did a lot of meditation with but that wasn't because you know I you
know I thought it was I don't know how to say it the main reason for doing it is
that he was kind of a hyperactive kid like you know not not kind of and and
so and the more tired he got the more activity he would get which wasn't
healthy for him because he couldn't sleep and so getting him to sleep was a
big issue like was a little baby we could only get him to sleep if we carried
him or drove him in the car you know for naps and so I started doing guided
meditations for him going to bed at night and that would help him go to sleep
and and so I did a lot of creative imagine visualizations or imaginations
for him like imagine that he was a sea otter on its back on the ocean on top
floating on top of the kelp and the gentle waves are coming and lifting you
up and down and and so your breath up and down of the waves and he would lay
there and imagine he was a sea otter or a bird or I did all these animals you know
it's like every evening was a different animal for a long time and that would so
he had that and what how deeply that went into him I don't know the other thing
that we did with the kids were that young is we had cookie parties and cookie
party was a time where sometimes we did it because it was it was with two kids
at home things were you know I didn't know that people literally bounced off
the walls I thought it was just a just an expression and so there were times
when it just like was you know now they're bouncing off the walls they're
gonna bounce through the window soon so we we need something here so let's have
a cookie party and and they knew what that meant so we would they would get
involved in setting it up and we'd set up a kind of special kind of rug on the
floor and and they get a little kind of flower or centerpiece maybe a Buddha and
then we put Zoff who's like we have here sitting on around for them for the
four you know in each corner of a kind of a circle and then we get cookies out
and put them on a plate and maybe some milk for the kids and then we would sit
there I would my wife and I was sitting meditation posture and they would sit on
there's offers in the way that they do and everything got calmed down everything
settled and got peaceful and there was no meditation but there was a whole the
ambience the tone how the kids felt and what was going on for them maybe they
I don't know what was going on when they were activated but when they but they you
know they and then after that we had this cookie party they were so calm and
contented and cozy and it was such a you know whatever a parent wants a four-year-old
to get from meditation we got from cookie cookie parties that's a I could say
more but that's enough for now and I think adults do well maybe not cookie
parties but now we call them tea ceremonies it says our it's looking at
our team master so okay so thank you so if some of you would like to meet outside
now in the parking lot we can take some folding chairs out and we can take the
masks off there and have more discussion for a little while and be nice to hang
out and otherwise thank you
