 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and welcome. And to jump right in, there is a significant, very important teaching that the Buddha gave to a monk named Kachiana Gauta. And in this, I'm going to paraphrase or exemplify the teachings rather than to say them in relationship to support this meditation today. So the inhale, when we breathe in, when it begins, we cannot say that the inhale doesn't exist. But when the inhale finishes and we begin exhaling, we cannot say that the inhale exists anymore. And certainly we can't say that it exists continuously, non-stop. That's it. It's a solid, static phenomena. Rather, it's something that comes and goes. It exists as a process. It exists in terms of breathing, it exists in terms of a few moments, the inhale. And if we see the inhale as something we cannot say, so in a sense we can't say that it neither exists nor doesn't exist in a static, ongoing, non-stop kind of process. It exists as a process that's temporary. It exists as it's going through its motions. And the reason why this kind of teaching is emphasized, and this teaching to Kachiana Gauta, it's said kind of more universally, more generally, but that if we see that the breathing comes and goes, the inhale comes and goes, it doesn't make any sense to grab a hold of it, to get attached to it. Because if we grab it, get attached to it, soon enough it disappears. But if we get upset about it disappearing, it only reappears a few moments later. And so in relationship to breathing, we learn to trust the process. We learn not to be attached to it, not to hold on to it. We also learn not to resist it. And as meditation deepens, there becomes a deeper and deeper trust in the natural process of the body, just breathing by itself. Breathing breathes itself. So the same thing is true of the exhale. When it begins, we can't say it doesn't exist. When it passes, when it ends, we can't say now it exists. It exists as a phenomena that appears and disappears, comes and goes. So by emphasizing this with breathing, maybe you can appreciate one of the many reasons why mindfulness of breathing is useful. Here it's because as we get centered and focus on breathing, it's possible to kind of, I like, maybe it's not the best word, but savor. Or have an intimacy with that aspect of each inhale and exhale, which is how it begins, it appears, and it disappears. And in that appearing and disappearing, there's an opportunity for a spaciousness, for an allowing, for a non-clinging, for a trusting of letting it appear and letting it disappear. And one way to trust it is to not then get caught in thoughts about it, ideas and wishes and hopes around breathing, because those thoughts also have the nature of appearing and disappearing. And thoughts are kind of fickle that way, even though some of them might predominate. And as we center ourselves in the breathing, and seeing the coming and going of it, we might then also, with time, also begin appreciating how a lot of things come and go, and things that we thought were kind of, this is the way things are. It turns out to be related to thoughts that think that, but those thoughts themselves come and go. So, assuming a meditation posture, and gently closing your eyes, and with your eyes closed, to appreciate your body, your mind, your heart, appreciate that you have taken this time for an intimacy, for caring and protection and support that's provided with meditation. And then to bring forth something that maybe doesn't exist yet, but will appear for a while and disappear. You have appeared a few deep inhales and long exhales, deep enough, just enough, not too much, not too little, but just the right amount for a greater connection to the present moment, to your body, and to relaxing in your body. Letting your breathing return to normal. And some things don't come and go quickly, but some things they're passing, we can watch and see and support. So tension in the body, there might be some of it that you can relax a bit, support the passing of tension, maybe as you exhale to relax the face. Maybe as you exhale to relax the shoulders. There might be a feeling, a small feeling of relaxing that begins, and then after the relaxing it kind of fades away, relaxing the belly, relaxing the arms and hands, maybe the thighs and legs, and relaxing the thinking mind. Maybe with a feeling that as the mind relaxes, it expands or spreads out quietly in the kind of way that waves in the ocean might settle and spread out to create a flat surface. And then, breathing normally, follow the exhale to the end of the exhale, and when it's time to breathe in, allow the inhale to occur. Let there be as receptive as you can to the body beginning to breathe in. Receptive to the full inhale and recognizing it when it stops, when the inhale ends, no longer there. The inhale appears and disappears. Even if you're controlling it, it still appears and disappears. It in some ways exists and then it doesn't exist. If the inhale has ended, allow the exhale, allow it to begin. Let go as you end the exhale to allow it to finish. And staying aware of this way of inhales and exhales, you're connected to the fullness of breathing, the full experience of the body breathing, sensations appearing and disappearing, all connected to breathing. One. And as we continue, can you bring forth trust, the trusting of this process that allows breathing to come and go, inhales come, they go, exhales come and go. Thoughts appear and eventually disappear. There's a deep trust in this process of coming and going, the process of unfolding that happens best when we allow things to follow their own course of coming and going, trusting the awareness that makes room for all things to come and go. In the awareness which is intimate with breathing, trusting the coming and going, inhales and exhales. Trusting the coming and going, inhales and exhales. Trusting the coming and going, inhales and exhales. In that awareness, in that way of being, can you recognize freedom from clinging, freedom from resistance, freedom from resistance, a kind of freedom of letting it all unfold on its own, getting out of the way. Is there any even hint, small sense of that freedom? Is there any hint that you can come and go, and let it all go, and let it all go, and let it all go, and let it all go, and let it all go, And then as we come to the end of this sitting, might there be something within you that has a little bit more taste, feel for freedom. A freedom from being a little less preoccupied, caught, attached. And if there is something that gives you some sense of freedom, take a few moments to breathe with it, breathe through it, make space for it to grow. And to allow that whatever sense of freedom there is to grow and expand, maybe only with your imagination, imagining bringing this freedom to your whole life, maybe with a sense of ease or peace. And that you can bring this with you to your contact with other people. Imagine that that is so. And imagine that in this freedom and peace or ease, there is space for your goodwill, for your kindness, for your well-wishing and care for this world. May this practice that we do be for the welfare and happiness of others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. Thank you.
