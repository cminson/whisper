 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. One way to think about mindfulness is as a being with ourselves, being with our experience. This can be in a very simple way. Sometimes I use the analogy of a friend as if a friend were sitting with you asking, how are you? We can be a friend to ourselves and just kind of silently answer that question to ourselves by being with ourselves, being with your body as it is in this moment, being with your mind as it is in this moment, being with just your experience as it is. Each moment, this sense of mindfulness as being with experience can be explored with particular aspects of experience like the breath, for instance. We might just explore, what is it like to be with the breath right now? Just the breath as it is in this moment, just being with the breath as it breathes, being with the breathing in, being with the breathing out. Sometimes I find this language of being with, to be more evocative, more congruent with the experience than the word mindful, which feels like a mental doing something, just a language has that quality to me. And being with has more of a sense of settling back and just receiving, being with ourselves, being with the breath. We can also explore, for some of you being with the breath may feel very resonant and very comfortable. You're welcome to continue with that if that's the case. For some it's a little more restful to just settle back and be with ourselves in a more general way. Just being with yourself as you are, however the body is, with the attention perhaps drawn to a particular area of the body for a little while and then another area of the body, maybe a breath and then hearing and then a sense of a mood or an emotion and then another body sensation. And rather than trying to hold the attention anywhere, just allowing the being with to be with the attention, be with whatever the attention is drawn to in this moment. I sometimes like the analogy of being with our experience the way a naturalist might be with nature in going out to learn something a naturalist may just sit down and be available to take in whatever shows up in this day, in this moment, in this time. The attention drawn by a particular creature that comes out, a very natural the attention drawn there, allowing the interest to be connected with whatever's showing up. Sometimes a naturalist might choose to orient and look at a particular area to go and settle down under a redwood tree and be curious about what happens at the base of the redwood tree, focusing a little bit as you might be doing with the breath. So this being with comes with a kind of a sense of care, of connection like the friend brings but also with a sense of interest and curiosity like the naturalist brings. What is this breath? How is it felt? What is here in this moment receiving available and interested, curious about the human happenings in this moment? And of course the mind will wander, it will get pulled into something, it will lose track of being with experience in the present moment. There will be a moment when there's a remembering, a remembering about the present moment and in that moment there's nothing particularly to find or to do except to be with that moment. That momentous mindfulness comes back being with whatever happenings are here, here and now just being with this moment after moment. Alright, every present moment of Angelalli's You
