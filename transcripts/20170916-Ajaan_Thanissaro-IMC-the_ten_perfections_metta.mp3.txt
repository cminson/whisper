The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
I talked this morning about how...
Is that too resonant?
We talked this morning about how...
Yeah, there's too much echo in there.
Is that better?
Is that better?
Can you hear me in the back?
No.
A little higher?
That question, of course, is a trick question.
If you can't hear me in the back, then how are you going to know?
Okay.
We talked this morning about how discernment is basically pragmatic and strategic.
And this is pointed out in passage number two in the readings.
This is actually part of a larger sutra where the Buddha says there are four courses of action.
There is a course of action that is pleasant to do and will give good results.
The course of action that is unpleasant to do and will give bad results.
And those two are no-brainers.
It's pleasant, it gives you good results, you'll do it.
If it's unpleasant, it gives bad results, you're not going to do it.
The difficult ones are the ones that are mentioned in this passage, the one that's pleasant to do but will give bad results.
And the one that's unpleasant to do but is going to give good results.
And that's where you need your discernment to talk yourself into doing what is going to give good results regardless of whether you like it.
And what's going to give, talk to yourself out of doing things that will give bad results regardless of whether you like it.
And so this connects with passage number three which talks about the four ways that we go off course.
We go off course out of desire, we go off course out of aversion, off course out of delusion and off course out of fear.
These are the explanations for why people act in a biased or prejudiced way.
One of those four things will lead them to act in unskillful ways.
Which means those are four qualities that we have to learn how to overcome because those are the things that are going to get us to do things that are not in our long-term interests and not do things that are in our long-term interests.
So we have to look at those four.
Of the four you have to realize that aversion is always bad, delusion is always bad.
It's the fear and the desire you have to be more discerning about.
There are some desires that are actually good and there are some fears that are actually good.
There's fear of doing something unskillful, that's actually good fear.
The fear of causing harm to yourself, causing harm to others, that is something to be afraid of.
This would be the fear of heedfulness and the fear of compunction.
There is a fear underlying these things that you don't want to do anything that's going to cause harm because it just multiplies the harm more than what you're already dealing with.
You can't overcome this fear, your primary fear of course is the fear of death.
If you can't overcome this fear, you can't really trust yourself to act in your own best interests.
There will always be something to say, well my friend I'm going to die so I don't want to...
I could break the precepts out of fear of death, I could do other unskillful things out of fear of death.
You have to learn how to overcome this.
This is one of the areas where I think I learned the most from my first time with John Fuehring.
There was one night he said, are you afraid of dying? In any place in the world, everybody would say yes of course.
But I realized, okay if I said yes, it was not part of the custom or the culture of that particular tradition.
So how do you overcome fear of death? This is about passage, the next passage is about.
Basically there are four things that cost us to be afraid of death.
Attachment to sensual pleasure is attachment to the body. Fear of the consequences of the past things we've done that have been unskillful.
And then not seeing the true Dharma.
In other words, you're afraid you're going to die that when you once you die you're going to be deprived of the sensual pleasures you enjoy on the human realm.
You're going to be taken away from the body to which you're attached.
There is the fear that after you die maybe there really is such a thing as punishment after death.
Because all those horrible things I did, they're going to come and get me.
And then there's ultimately the fear of not seeing the true Dharma.
The true Dharma is basically realizing there is a deathless property that you can contact through the practice.
And if you haven't seen that, there's always fear of death might be annihilation.
The body dies and that's it.
And so it's learning how to overcome these four fears that make us more reliable.
So that when somebody comes up and even though there could be the prospect of,
we could die by following the practice.
Okay, I would rather stick with the practice and die rather than abandon the practice and try to survive that way.
This is illustrated in that analogy that I told you earlier about the band that's pinning you down
and sawing off your limbs.
And they're going to say, you still have to have good will for them, even in a situation like that.
Because you've got ill will for them, that ill will is going to then carry on into the next lifetime
and get you fascinated on, or fixated on those people, fixated on revenge.
And that could lead you to do all kinds of unskillful things.
So the way to overcome these four things, these four kinds of fear,
is a process where the Buddha says basically five steps.
He's learned how to develop dispassion for these things.
And the five steps started with one is when you see something unskillful arising in the mind,
you want to see it as it arises.
In other words, what causes, what is originating?
It's not just a simple arising. When it arises, there's a cause that goes along with it.
And you can apply this particular analysis if you want to, to any kind of addiction you have.
Number one, of course, is internet addiction.
It's endemic up here.
Yesterday, walking into an airport lounge, what do I see? Everybody on their screens, you know.
I have a friend who has a friend who's psychic,
who's been for many years getting messages from people who've died
and basically having to help them move on to the next level.
And it's discovered in the past silver years that the hardest thing for people to let go of after they've died
is their devices.
Can you imagine?
So, watch out.
So, suppose you have an internet addiction.
You have to see the moment it says, I've got to check my email,
even though you checked your email five minutes ago.
What is it that compulsion, is the compulsion to go back, to get in there?
So, see that arising. Don't wait until it's become a full-blown desire.
But what is the first spark in the mind? I'd like to do this again.
See what's going along with it. What sort of physical symptoms do you have?
What kind of metal systems do you have at that point that would induce you to say,
I've got to go with this.
Even though part of me knows that I'm way too addicted to the internet.
Then you want to see it passing away.
Because these impulses are not as constant as they pretend to be.
In other words, part of the mind will say, if I don't give in to this now,
it's just going to get stronger and stronger and stronger until it turns into the thing it takes over.
So I've got to appease it now while it's still manageable.
It's not really that way. The impulse will come, the impulse will go.
And it's not like it builds up to a kind of a crescendo. It comes, it goes, comes and goes.
The part of the mind that wants you to go, that will make it seem more like a crescendo.
But you have to see it does come and it goes. It stops.
Even desires or anger that seem to be unending do have their point.
Anger is one of the most difficult ones to see.
Because once there's been a moment of anger arises in the mind, there are hormones that get into your system.
And then even though the moment of anger will have passed, the hormones are still there.
And you interpret that, oh, it's a sign I'm still angry. Pick it up again.
You've got to remind yourself, okay, the hormones are one thing. The physical symptoms are one thing.
The actual anger is something else. Don't confuse the two.
So it's good to know that. You look for the arising of the thought, you look for the passing away of the impulse.
And then the third thing you look for is the allure.
The allure. Why do you go for it? What is attractive about this? What do you think you're getting out of this?
What are the excuses and what are the reasoning in the mind that says you've got to go?
And something about you wants to go for this.
Now in some cases where you know that the impulse is unskillful, part of the mind will try to hide it from you.
You don't like to admit yourself that it really does, you know, those thoughts of revenge.
There was that great New Yorker cartoon where two witches are over a big boiling cauldron and one of them is tasting the brew
and she says, it's too sweet, you put in too much revenge.
Okay, what is it about revenge that's sweet?
What is about something you know is unskillful that you like about it, basically?
You've got to look for that.
And then you can compare it with the drawbacks.
I mean, you may see the drawbacks, but if you don't see the appeal, you're not doing a fair comparison.
If you're seeing the drawbacks, this is where the Buddhist teachings are and say the three characteristics come in.
Is this something that's lasting?
The reward that comes from this, is it lasting?
If it's not lasting, it's going to be stressful.
And if it's not lasting and stressful, is it worth identifying with?
Now notice the Buddha is not saying it's stressful, it's constant stress.
He's not saying there is no self.
The whole thing about the perception of not self is that it's a value of judgment.
Is this really worth sticking with?
It's when you can compare the allure and compare the drawbacks and you begin to do this kind of analysis
that whatever appeal, whatever reward you get out of this is not lasting,
but the drawback is going to be much more, much heavier.
That's when you find the escape from it, i.e. you develop dispassion for it.
Now the question sometimes comes up, how do you know that this something is going to be for your long-term interest
as opposed to just a short-term interest?
The Buddha doesn't have you invent the Dharma wheel every time you have to make this decision.
This is why we have the five precepts.
If there's an impulse to break the five precepts, you know there's something wrong.
And that whatever would pull you away, your fear of losing money, your fear of losing your friends,
your fear of harming your health by sticking to a precept, you have to say,
I can't go with that.
My concern about my health, my concern about my friends, my concern about the wealth,
that has to be seen as something to develop dispassion for.
Similarly, when you're in the mind is in concentration,
everything at that moment that would pull you out of the concentration, you've got to say,
that is unskillful.
I've got to learn how to apply these three perceptions.
The Buddha never calls them three characteristics, by the way.
The three perceptions that you apply as an analysis for developing dispassion.
So in other words, while you're on the path, you don't apply these three perceptions to the path.
You apply them to everything that would pull you off.
And then as your discernment gets more and more refined, and you get further and further along the path,
you get to the point where, okay, it's the wrath that you have to let go of,
and then you start applying those perceptions to the path itself.
But up until that point, you regard your karma as your own.
You regard your virtue as your treasure, you regard your concentration as your treasure.
Hold on to those things, and you apply these perceptions to anything that would pull you away.
If it's a case of an obvious addiction, again, you apply them to the source of the addiction,
and then whatever you can find that will leverage you away from the addiction,
you're going to hold on to that for the time being.
This is one of the reasons why this is good to develop a state of concentration
that you can access when you need it.
It gives you an alternative source of pleasure.
Because a lot of the times, the mind will say,
I'm really hungry for something right now, I'm desperate for pleasure,
or I worked hard all day, I need to give myself a little present.
A little present of something that's going to be unskillful in the long term, that's not a present.
You say, well, if I can just breathe in a way that feels refreshing, breathe in a way that feels good,
that takes a lot of the edge off that hunger for immediate gratification.
So use that as your leverage, and then as your examiner detachment.
Question in the back?
Traveling mic? Traveling mic?
I have a question about how you go from the first one to the second.
So the first one was to look at the impulse.
Then the second you say is to see the impulse go away.
I guess when I'm under the compulsion of using the internet, for example,
it feels like I have to take your word for it, that if I do nothing, it's going to go away.
Because that's not what my mind is thinking at that time.
If that's not what's thinking at that time, your mind has already kidnapped you.
So I'm almost in disbelief.
Is it true?
You have to keep feeding that impulse for it to continue.
So is it thinking about something else, or just breathing?
You can ask yourself, where am I feeling tension in the body right now
that's making me feel on edge that I've got to give into this?
Can I breathe through that?
I guess the fact that you've asked that question has moved you out of the impulse,
at least momentarily.
Oh, so you're using this tactic that will naturally lead you to see it?
It can lead you.
There's a famous story in Thailand about this.
One woman who wanted to see each other, who was a monk who was reputed to have a very sharp tongue.
So you went in to see him at your own risk.
And she had just lost her only child, her son, who was twenty-some years old.
And she was just desperate.
Ever since he's died, I can't think of anything but how much I miss him and how sad I am about this.
And he said, are you just saying that to impress other people?
She was living.
And she didn't even bow down, she just left.
She went home, and after three hours she realized she hadn't thought about her son for three hours.
She was so angry at a chow koonupale.
So she went back and bowed down.
So that's replacing one defilement with another one.
But it does help you see that the things you think that are there in the mind,
they're eating, eating, eating away and seem to be relentless, they're not as relentless as you think.
Part of your mind is actually feeding them.
And when you can see that, that's when you realize,
okay, if I don't feed this, they're going to go.
And what feeds them, of course, is the thought,
okay, this is just going to get worse and worse and worse until I finally give in,
so I might as well give in now.
Or the other thought that says, well, you're going to give in anyhow,
so let's make it easy for both of us.
Those kinds of things.
Because those are the thoughts that continue the impulse.
Please wait.
I have a question on that.
Watching the impulse come and it go away,
and then the allure part, that seems to be a little tricky,
because it seems like sometimes the mind has got all sorts of stories to tell you,
like, oh, you need to look at it.
It's your work or something of that sort.
And I mean, in cases where it is not my work or something,
then it's easy to tell myself that those other addictions I can just tell myself,
no, there's no need to go there at all.
But when it comes to addiction to checking emails and things like that,
it seems almost like the only way I'm able to discipline myself is like saying,
okay, I'm going to have a set amount of time in the day that I will use for Internet,
and I'm not going to do anything beyond that.
It can work on maybe weekends or something or holidays,
but it doesn't seem to work at all on weekdays.
Comments, suggestions.
Okay, well, again, maybe on the weekdays you say, oh, on the weekends you look at the email twice a day.
At work you look at it four times a day.
Max.
I wish my work were that simple.
Obviously, this is a monk talking to you.
I don't have any competition for my job.
Thank you.
But at least you've got to figure out what is it reasonable about and when does it get unreasonable.
And then if you catch yourself, well, I look at my email, and then I look at Yahoo News,
and then I look at this, and then I look at that, and it gets further and further away from your work.
The next time you feel the impulse you say, okay, remember what happened last time?
I look at the news, and then all of a sudden, you know, I was off, you know, doing something else.
But it's never usually somehow for some, fortunately maybe, but I'm not particularly attracted to the news.
But it seems like I'm more attracted to an email message that comes from a colleague or something,
and I might have sent him something, and I'm expecting a response or something.
It's that impulse to go and keep checking, keep checking.
It's like pushing the L button.
Yeah.
Give me the response.
The button is not going to give me the response, but it seems like there's that impulse.
I don't know.
I don't know what to say.
Well, again, if you found that, you know, the last time I checked the email,
it was five times before I actually got the message.
Fifty.
Fifty, okay.
And, okay, I got to cut down.
And no message in the computer world is that time-sensitive.
Yeah.
You got to convince yourself of that.
You got to convince yourself of that.
And remind yourself, just because something is pressing doesn't mean it's important.
That's the other thing you've got to remind yourself.
So this is something where you've got to work out, okay, at what point does it get excessive?
At what point is it counterproductive?
Because that's what an addiction is, is counterproductive.
And the time you could have spent doing actual work instead of checking your email gets wasted.
So provide yourself with other arguments on the other side.
And as I said, you've got to get that answer from that colleague right away.
That's all I can offer.
Thank you.
But again, it's this five-step pattern.
You can find yourself, I'm addicted to something that's really interfering with what something is in my best interest.
And then you, okay, how does it arise?
How does it pass away?
What is the lure?
What keeps pulling me there?
And then the fourth one is saying, what are the drawbacks of what I'm doing?
Compare the two until you can get a sense of dispassion for it.
And then the dispassion is the escape.
Now, dispassion does not mean aversion.
It means kind of growing up.
Where John Chah's explanation is, it's like sobering up.
You know, you're intoxicated with how fast these things are and how quick these things are,
but it's an intoxication.
And a more mature part of your mind will say, look, I don't have to check 50 times before I get the message.
Basically, that's all the work I could be doing otherwise is getting wasted.
And then you remind yourself the next time you feel the impulse to push the button or click the mouse.
May I ask you a follow-up on this?
This is related to addiction to sensuality.
So I've been reading passages from your book on the comparison to sensuality that the Buddha gives,
like the comparison of a leper and the comparisons to a dry grass fire stick or whatever.
And it seems to me like there are very good ways for me to kind of, images for me to hold
when there is a kind of thought of sensuality that arises to kind of zap it.
So I can see that how the impulse goes away is related to how I'm kind of fabricating these kind of images
in my mind about sensuality, so it goes away.
But I'm not able to kind of see it as a dispassion.
I see it more like, in my mind, I tell myself, okay, this is a bad, this is something I just do not want to do.
It's not good for me. It's more like aversion sort of thing. I'm kind of building up.
How do you see it?
In the beginning it will be aversion.
And it's good aversion?
It's good aversion.
And with time it'll get more and more temperate, so you're just going to lose interest.
When I realized I had to stop eating sweet things, at first it was...
And so I developed a strong aversion to the sweet things, saying,
this is going to kill me if I keep on eating all these sweets.
And so I had to see the sugar industry as my enemy.
And then after a while it got so that being away from sugar, the smell of sugar became repulsive.
And then I lost interest.
And that's how it happens.
There will be an aversion to begin with because you really got to fight things in the beginning.
And then as you get more and more successful and you develop a better repertoire,
you don't need to keep on using the club.
But don't be afraid to use the club in the beginning.
They talk about being channeled, sitting, you're having your anger sit down with you,
whether you have a cup of tea, you can't do that in the beginning.
It's going to poison your tea.
So you've got to say, okay, no compromises with the anger.
And then after a while then you can back off.
You've gotten away from it more.
I'll repeat your question because you didn't have the mic.
Do you have to have positive aversion to begin to develop dispassion?
In the beginning, yes.
Again, it has to be aversion toward the raw backs.
This is going to really do me harm.
I don't want that.
And you have to make it strong enough so that all those other voices that come up in the mind
and say, oh, yes, you really do.
It's okay. It doesn't matter.
And then after a while you begin to realize, okay, that's excessive.
I don't need all that.
You have to artificially create the positive aversion.
Again, it really helps with the sugar industry.
Reading about the sugar industry helps with that.
There's somebody out there who's actually trying to hook me.
And so I'll show them.
It's like being a Western monk in Thailand.
On the one hand, you hear all these stories about how the Thais are amazed with Western monks.
It's kind of like the amazement you see with a dancing elephant.
The fact that they can dance is amazing in and of itself.
You don't expect them to dance well.
So people would come to see a John Foulding and say, I see these Westerns are dancing.
Do you think they really understand the Dharma?
And so my reaction was, I'll show them.
So that's using an unskilled from a mental state to counteract a more unskilled from a mental state.
So it's okay.
Can we have the mic?
I haven't really thought of this, but this just came up for me.
How do you do that for judging a judge?
Is the judging in your mind or judging another person?
Judging someone who is judging.
You judge them.
You have to have some compassion for them.
I mean, passing judgment on other people is not necessarily a bad thing.
It's just learning how to use the right criteria.
If I imitated this person, would this be a good person to follow?
You say no.
Do I have to hang around this person?
Maybe yes.
In which case, how do I train myself so that I don't get pulled into their way of thinking?
One.
And two, how I don't start getting judgmental about the person.
You've got to have compassion.
Would it be the same for judging your own judging thoughts?
Okay, well ask your judging thoughts.
What kind of criteria are you using?
And are you actually giving the person that you're judging a fair chance?
Because again, passing judgment on someone else as a potential person to hang out with,
a potential person to associate with, a potential person to emulate.
That's valid use of your faculty's judgment.
But passing a final judgment on whether this person is a really, really good person,
a really, really bad person.
You say, I don't really know that much.
But it's okay to say, do I want to imitate this person?
No.
Yes.
Whatever.
Don't be afraid of passing judgment.
There's a difference between being judgmental and being judicious.
You can't stop, you have to use your judicious powers.
But the judgmental powers, those are the ones you have to recognize.
Okay, I'm not giving this a fair chance.
I'm not really looking at all the evidence before I pass my judgment.
I've got to withhold judgment for the time being.
Thank you.
Question here?
Yes.
Here comes the mic.
Thank you.
So it's about the second passage.
It's about the fool.
So the fool doesn't do something which is unpleasant to do,
but which leads to what is profitable when done.
So he doesn't do it.
And then my question is, the non-doing of that course of action
leads to what is unprofitable.
How can inactivity lead to something?
Okay, but the fact that there's something you could have done
that would have been profitable, but you don't do it,
the results are going to be unprofitable.
Is that only, is that given the fact that he's a fool?
No, it's given the fact that he's not doing it.
But for an arhant, he can be totally static.
Yeah, because he doesn't have any work he has to do,
he doesn't have any work to do that they have to do anymore
in terms of perfecting their mind.
Maybe you can help me understand.
So the fool doesn't do what is profitable,
and then is it because there's an opportunity cost?
There's an opportunity cost, yeah, that he's missing,
or she's missing.
Okay.
All right.
This is particularly for the issue of being on the path
and learning so good.
If I actually develop powers of concentration,
it would be good for me, but I'm not going to do it.
Because gee, I'm going to be sitting all those hours,
and it's going to be painful, and so I just won't do it.
And there's a lot you're missing out on as a result.
Okay, I've got three or four pages on discernment,
which we've just got to skip,
because we're never going to get there.
Any last questions on the use of discernment in everyday life?
The discernment the Buddha is talking about here is pragmatic.
It is strategic.
Sometimes with strategy, that means, as we mentioned earlier,
you've got to learn how to use one unskillful mind state
to undercut a more serious unskillful mind state.
It's like being a crook.
Remember, the Buddha uses the image of feeding as,
in parallel to clinging.
We're actually fixing our food.
This is when we say something is fabricated
or something is conditioned.
It's basically like fixing your food
that then you're going to eat.
And to develop dispassion means basically not only seeing,
I don't want to eat this anymore,
but because I don't want to eat it anymore,
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to cook this meal anymore.
And that's how dispassion leads to cessation.
Now, remember the image that all experiences,
all phenomena come from desire.
There's an intentional element in there,
or else it wouldn't happen.
And what motivates the intention is,
the anticipation is you're going to get some good out of this.
The best image I can think of is,
you've got some chickens,
and you keep feeding the chickens
because you want to eat the eggs.
But our problem is,
is that we're pretty undiscerning about what comes out of chickens.
And we eat everything that comes out of the chickens.
You have scrambled chicken droppings.
And so we've got to learn, one,
we have to learn to be more discerning about this process
of fabrication that we do in our minds.
What can we do that's going to create a path
rather than just, you know,
willy-nilly fixing everything that comes out of our chickens?
And so on the one hand,
we learn to distinguish,
okay, what are the chicken droppings,
what are the eggs?
We feed the chickens for the eggs,
but then we learn how to develop the mind,
so ultimately we don't have to eat the eggs,
which means that we can let the chickens go,
and they're free to feed themselves.
So this is the basic image
that the Buddha is operating on.
So in the meantime,
we're learning how to think strategically,
because sometimes, as we pointed out,
now you have to use an unskillful mental state
to overcome another unskillful one.
A classic example in John Lee's autobiography
is talking about when he was a young monk,
and he and some of the other monks
would have meditation contests.
Who can sit longer?
Who can do walking meditation longer?
And of course, it's silly,
but it trains you to be a longer meditator.
And when you find you realize it's silly,
by that time you have to develop some good habits otherwise.
So sometimes you start out with something
that's not quite 100% skillful,
but it's leading you in the right direction.
When I was a young monk,
there was another Thai guy who ordained pretty much the same time I did.
We'd go up to the top of the hill and meditate.
And I'd be sitting there in pain from the meditation
and being chewed up by the mosquitoes
or stabbed by the mosquitoes.
And I was ready to give up,
and I'd look over at him and he's very quiet.
He said,
for the good name of America, I can't...
I can't let this.
So I keep on sitting.
And I found out later that he was sitting there in pain,
being, you know, in pain of the mosquitoes.
He'd open his eyes,
and there was a stupid American over there,
and he was sitting very quiet.
And so we kept each other going.
So there are times when you use something unskillful
to overcome something even more unskillful.
But it's all part of learning how to think strategically.
The actual practice teaches you're a discernment.
And you might come to say,
well, you shouldn't have any clinging,
therefore I'm not going to cling to my concentration.
That's wrong.
I mean, I was actually reading in a book,
someone saying that if you stay focused on one object,
that's obviously clinging,
so you just have to let go.
Which, you know, short circuits the whole path.
Any last questions on discernment before we go on?
Apologize.
Passage number four is talking about
perplexion over not having touched the true dhamma.
Yes.
So this is sort of one of the fears I have.
So what is the way to get over it?
The what?
What's the way to get over this fear?
Stream mentoring.
Something more.
You thought the perplexions were just
sort of talking down to lay people?
No, this you've got to work on getting the stream.
Okay.
All right.
Why do you look shocked?
No, well, it's a lofty goal.
Yes.
Because that's the only way you're going to totally overcome
your fear of death.
Otherwise, there's always that possibility
that maybe the secular Buddhists are right.
There is nothing after you die.
And you have to be able to see for yourself,
oh, that's not true.
There is a deathless element that you can contact.
There's something that doesn't die.
And then you realize, okay,
it would be better to die than to, you know,
break my precepts.
It would be better to die than to go away from the path.
And that confirms this for you.
Up under that point, there are always going to be doubts.
So you use fear of death to motivate yourself,
but we have to ultimately overcome this fear of death.
Right.
And the fear that you're using to motivate yourself
then turns into heedfulness and compunction.
You know, I don't want to do anything
that would be more dangerous than death.
And you've got to see it that way.
And when you have that set of values,
then that's when these become perfections.
Thank you.
Well, that relates to the next section, which is on goodwill.
And first, I want to give you a few general...
Notice we're not covering all the readings.
You can read them on your own.
But I want to give you the main points before we leave.
The word here is metta,
which I translate as goodwill rather than loving kindness.
Because love is a different word in Pali.
It's baima, lies in baima children.
And baima or love is not something that you can make universal.
And the Buddha points out how there is hatred that comes from love.
There's love that comes from hatred.
It's an interesting analysis, you know.
You love ex, someone else treats ex well.
You're going to love the other person.
You love ex, someone so mistreats ex,
you're going to hate that person.
You hate ex, someone else treats ex well,
you're going to hate that person.
You hate ex, someone else is bad to ex,
you're going to love that person.
It's all very arbitrary.
It's not universal.
It's something you can universalize.
Whereas goodwill, as I said earlier this morning,
is the desire for beings to be happy.
And realizing that, as we'll discuss goodwill under the heading of discernment,
what does discernment teach goodwill,
one of the lessons you learn is that people are going to be happy through their own actions.
So you're basically wishing, may this person be skillful.
And you can think of this as anybody.
And people who are already skillful, you can wish this.
May they continue being skillful.
People who are unskillful, may they change their ways.
This is what goodwill means.
One of the lessons I got in goodwill was,
John Fuhrman was talking one time about how he had a snake move into his room.
Sort of an unexpected roommate.
And he knew the snake was in there.
The snake would hide behind.
He had this one piece of furniture in the room, the snake would hide behind the piece of furniture,
as the John Fuhrman would come in the room.
And to begin with, he used it as a test for,
can I have goodwill for the snake?
And so for three or four days, he just spots a goodwill,
thoughts a goodwill, thoughts a goodwill.
He'd come into the room and the snake would hide.
Goodwill to the snake.
And then finally, at the end of the third day, he said,
okay, I've learned to overcome my fear of the snake.
I think this is enough.
And so he said, meditated.
He basically said in his mind to the snake,
he says, not that I don't like you.
It's simply that we're different levels of species,
and it's very easy to misunderstand one another.
I love that.
And there's plenty of room out there in the forest for you to be a happy snake.
Why don't you go out in the forest?
He left the door open and the snake left.
So I thought that was really interesting.
And he said, it was from his goodwill for the snake that that's how he wished it.
In other words, he's not saying, I'm going to sit there and love you and pet you.
Sometimes goodwill means we have to be apart.
So it's not really so much loving-kindness.
It's you wish well for the other, the other side.
And as I said this morning, there's that image and the,
in fact, the suit that we're going to be looking at in a minute,
where they talk about the mother willing to sacrifice her life for her child.
The Buddha is not saying you have to be willing to sacrifice your life,
love your life for everybody, or cherish people that much.
You are willing to sacrifice your life to maintain your goodwill,
as in the case of the bandits sawing your limbs off.
You still have to have goodwill, even though it means you're going to die.
But you want to maintain that goodwill.
Now this brings goodwill under the purview of what does discernment tell us about goodwill?
It tells you what it means to wish others well, i.e. may they act on the causes for true happiness.
May they understand them, be willing and able to act on those causes.
It also teaches you what it means to create a mind state in yourself.
The Buddha gives us analysis of what he calls the three kinds of fabrication.
There's bodily fabrication, which is the breath.
Verbal fabrication, which is direct to thought and evaluation,
i.e. the way you talk to yourself about an issue.
And then there's mental fabrication, which is the perceptions you hold in mind
and the feeling tones that you're creating inside you.
And to realize, if you have ill will for somebody,
you have to take that apart in terms of these three fabrications.
Change the way you breathe to ask yourself,
how am I talking about this issue that is aggravating the ill will?
Can I talk about it in a way that promotes goodwill?
And then that relates to the perceptions you're holding in mind,
which would be mental fabrication.
All too often we're passing judgment on somebody.
We're a way up here and the judge is sitting their way down there.
We feel that my passing judgment on that person has no impact on me.
I'm free to judge them in whatever terms I want.
But the Buddha is reminding you, if you go around having ill will for other beings
and seeing nothing but their weaknesses and their bad points,
it's going to be very hard for you to actually treat others well.
So you actually need to look for the good in other people as a motivation,
as a way of nourishing your own goodwill.
The image he gives of someone who's walking through the desert
and they're hot, trembling, thirst, tired,
they see a cow's footprint with a little bit of water in the cow's footprint.
They realize if they tried to scoop up the water it would make it muddy,
so what do they have to do? They have to get out and slurp it up.
Now you wouldn't want anybody taking a picture of you while you're doing that.
And you feel that it might be beneath your dignity,
but you've got to do it because it's for your own survival.
In the same way when someone's been mistreating you and saying,
I can't feel goodwill for this person or I can't see the good of this person,
that's beneath my dignity.
But then you realize, okay, I need that person's goodness in order to make sure
that I'm more skillful around that person,
at least keep that goodness in mind.
And so you're willing to, in what you might tell yourself,
lower yourself to look for the person's good points
so that you're not going to mistreat the person.
It's like it's not an image the Buddha has you hold in mind.
That would be a perception, that would be a mental fabrication
that you would use to take apart the mind's conversation that's telling you,
well, this person did this, this person did that,
and it's really outrageous, and how can I stand this?
And wait a minute, human beings are like this.
John Fung had a student one time who was, she was a nurse,
and she was the victim of some gossip among the other nurses,
and she was really getting sick and tired of the gossip,
and she was meant to meditate with him one time,
and she had this vision of her many lifetimes of being like a hall of mirrors,
going back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back,
and she was probably realizing,
I've probably been the victim of gossip many times in the past.
They just began overwhelming and oppressive.
And so she, after she came out of meditation,
she mentioned to me, it's just overwhelming me,
just how much gossip I've been subject to.
He said, well, who asked you to be born in the human realm?
This is the human realm.
You were the one who wanted to be born as a human being,
this is what human beings do.
It shocked her.
But then she said,
it was one of those messages that she remembered for the rest of her life,
and you're here on this realm, what do you expect out of this realm?
You can't let yourself get upset by the fact that human beings
are behaving like human beings.
You've got to say, I've got to raise my mind about that.
Now notice that when the Buddha talks about good will,
he doesn't say it's part of your innate nature
to have good will for others.
He says it has to be, the potential is there,
but we can also be just as,
we have the potential also to have ill will,
or to have very limited good will.
So he says, it has to be a determination.
You have to make up your mind that, yes,
this is something I want to do.
It has to be a determination to develop this.
And it's also a form of mindfulness.
You have to keep reminding yourself,
I've got to have good will for this person.
You turn on the news,
you see somebody doing something on the news
that you don't like,
you've got to have good will for this person.
And that kind of gets into the other next lessons
that the teachings on karma teach you about good will.
One of the questions is, why do you need it?
And the first reason is to guarantee the skillfulness of your actions.
If there are people that you cannot have good will for it,
it's going to be very easy to mistreat them.
So when you're engaging with somebody,
you've got to have good will for them,
no matter how difficult they've been.
Because what you're going to come away from the situation,
regardless of how it comes out,
is the karma that you create by your actions.
And so in order to guarantee for yourself,
I'm going to be more likely to treat this person
in a skillful way,
or act skillfully in this situation.
I've got to have good will for everybody.
That's the first reason.
Remember that the question of having good will for them,
this is not whether they deserve your good will or not,
it's not a question of deserving at all.
It's a question of, okay, you need it.
You need to develop this good will.
And it's interesting that Buddha talks about good will as a restraint.
It puts restraint on your unskillful actions.
Because we tend to think of good will as an open,
unfenced state of mind.
But it's there to put restraint on your impulses,
that would pull you in the other direction.
So it is a form of restraint.
The other reason why you need it is,
the Buddha says it can actually mitigate the effects of your past bad karma
by developing unlimited good will in the present moment.
The image he gives is of a crystal of salt.
He says, your past bad actions are like a crystal of salt.
Your mind is like a body of water.
If your mind is like a little cup of water,
you put the crystal of salt in the water,
and it becomes too salty to drink.
That's a limited mind state.
If you develop an unlimited mind state,
it's like a large river of water,
and assuming it's not polluted,
you put the crystal of salt in there,
and you can still drink the water,
because there's just so much more water.
In the same way your past bad actions come to you,
if your mind is unlimited,
it's going to have much less impact.
Then if your mind is still holding grudges
and holding resentments and plotting revenge.
It goes along with developing other abilities as well,
the ability not to be overcome by pain
or overcome by pleasure.
Developing your virtue and your discernment.
By having unlimited good will is an important aspect
of not only creating good karma now,
but also protecting you from your past bad actions.
Just a minute, let me finish.
We talked about earlier this morning that
your experience of the present moment
is not totally determined by your past actions.
What you're doing now also determines
how those past potentials are actually going to be actualized.
Because sometimes you've probably heard this
sometimes people saying that
if you want to see someone's future,
you look at their present actions,
you want to see their past,
you look at their present condition,
which is wrong.
Because you cannot see everybody's past actions
based on just what they are now.
Because in other words,
it's not like we have a single karma account,
and what you're seeing is the running balance.
The Buddha's image is more like
we have a whole field of seeds.
Some of the seeds are sprouting now,
other seeds are waiting to sprout,
and some of the seeds will sprout faster
because you water them right now.
You know, the seeds will sprout more slowly
because you're not watering them right now.
There's a lot more give and take
in the Buddha's explanation of causality
than a simple deterministic, you know, your past
is what shapes your present,
or your present is what shapes your future.
Your present is being shaped
not only by past potentials,
but also how you actualize those potentials
here and now.
And then finally,
one of the passages we have is,
look at this in a minute,
the karma consequences of karma
of unnerving goodwill.
You sleep easily, you wake up easily,
you have no evil dreams.
The devas love you,
human beings love you.
You're not going to be killed by
fire, weapons, poison.
And if you
you die
with a clear conscience,
and then if you don't have any higher attainments,
you become a brahma.
All but you're good things.
And then finally,
the other lesson you learned
from applying the teaching of karma
to goodwill is the question,
how do you express goodwill
in action?
And it's not necessarily through
being tender with people.
My own experience in the forest tradition
is that I had never been so criticized
in my life, in such
sharp terms, as I was
by my teacher.
And it was because
I trusted him that I was willing to put up with it
and see, well, I was actually benefitting
from the criticism.
Sometimes I didn't even know
how harsh the criticism was
until I tried it on somebody else.
I'll give you a brief story.
There was a woman who came regularly
to practice meditation
at the monastery. She was the wife
of one of the higher officials
in the local Rhodes Bureau.
And she had her own private
Rhodes Bureau
land rover
chauffeur driven that she would come out.
And she liked to park it right next to my hut.
Now this was after her husband had completed
a road into the monastery
with a parking lot.
But she still liked to park it next to my hut,
was killing the grass.
I didn't like this.
So one day I noticed
I was looking under the meditation hall
and I found a big railroad tie.
And there was a spot
where she had to go through a very narrow passage
to get into the spot next to my hut.
This is it. So I put the railroad tie
in the way.
And the next day they drove up.
She got her chauffeur to get out, move the railroad tie
and park up.
So I went back and put the railroad tie
back in place.
That evening as she was leaving the monastery
to go back home, she got the
chauffeur to move the railroad tie again
so he got out. So I put it back in place.
She got the message.
The next day she comes driving up, stops there.
She's getting the chauffeur to get out, move the railroad tie again.
And I have to be there.
And I happened to use a phrase that a John Fuhring
had used with me many times, which was,
don't you understand human language?
And they didn't realize
what an insult that was in Thailand.
It's like saying, you need to use dog language.
But she was livid.
And she went up
and she complained to a John Fuhring.
She said, I understand
David language in my meditation.
He's accusing me of not understanding human language.
And, you know,
it's like when your child says something, you know,
child should not be saying
and you realize you know where that child
got that.
There was another woman who was watching all this
and she said, all John Fuhring could do was laugh.
Because he knew where I got that phrase.
And so she went up
and she tried to meditate and she couldn't get into
meditation and she finally realized it was because
she was angry at me.
So she came down and apologized.
That was the end of the story.
At any rate, having good will for other
people does not necessarily mean
you always treat them with tenderness.
Sometimes you have to treat them with harshness
because it's the necessary way that's going to work.
The word himself said there are times
when he would say things that are unpleasant
because it was the right time and place.
And the skill, of course, is learning
the right time and place.
With gentleness, when you have to treat them
a little bit more harshness so that they actually
protect themselves.
So how do you really help other people is
you get them to be virtuous.
You try to induce them to
follow the precepts. You try to induce them
to overcome passion,
aversion, and delusion.
You're respecting the fact that they are agents
and not just recipients of your actions
but they are agents and they're going to be
experienced in the results of their actions.
So if you can get someone who's not
observing the precepts, to observe the precepts
that's how you show your good will.
If there's someone who's easily overcome
by passion, aversion, and delusion
you can get them to pull back some.
That's how you show good will.
So those are some of the lessons that Karma teaches
you about what good will is
and how to develop and why to develop it.
Any questions?
Yes.
Just on that last point
in terms of
trying to help people
sharing
the benefits of the Dharma
and the practice with them
but I find a lot of people are so resistant
to any kind of
new ideas or a different way of thinking
in terms of one based in generosity
versus
based in selfishness
and there's only
so much that you can engage with these people
before
just even engaging with them on a superficial level
will cause you harm
in terms of what they take from you.
So what's the
kind of balance there in terms of
the degree to which you engage with these people
and...
your efforts to help them
are now working
I've got to pull back for a bit.
This is where you have to develop equanimity
realizing there's some people you can breach
and other people can't reach
because they have to choose
to listen, they have to choose to
follow through.
You can't make other people's decisions
for them.
But you try.
And there was that great piece recently
that Steve showed me last night
on the show
where they were talking about
if you were being ethnically cleansed
by Buddhists, they're probably the worst people
to be ethnically cleansed by.
They were saying, we're not
depriving you of anything that really was yours
to begin with.
Which would be really
infuriating.
So you don't want to come with
the sort of Buddhist holier-than-now attitude.
But you have to look at
where are these people
and what would be the kind of lesson
that they actually might listen to.
If they're being selfish you say,
maybe you could advance
what you think is your own interest
by showing a little bit more kindness
to other people.
And I know in the case of my father
if I was going to give my father
some Buddhist advice I would never use
the B word.
This is basically common sense.
So again, you don't come with this
this is what Buddhism had to say.
Just basic common sense.
If you can present it that way
that makes it easier for some people to take.
But there are a lot of people out there
that you can't reach.
I mean just to fill up on that.
If you give them the opportunity
and then they decline it
and is it okay to just
move on from that relationship
and leave it behind? That's up to you.
It really depends on
how you read the situation.
My question was going to be
about
Goodwill for people who you know
are harming you right now
and the image
of the people who are sawing your limbs
and holding Goodwill.
Somehow
I have
a feeling that
a non ill will
rather is probably
a little better in...
What is better?
I was thinking that probably non ill will
would be a better image
of what a person, at least
I could hold in my mind
if I were in such a situation
rather than
a sense of positive Goodwill
like okay, may they be happy
or at least may they not...
I'd rather have it as
may they stop doing this
so that it doesn't lead
to their long term harm.
That's Goodwill.
But more than that
may they just stop doing this
so it stops harming me.
Whether or not I care so much about
their long term
happiness
is that...
It's useful to
take some of the sting away from the fact
that I'm being hurt right now
and just say okay I can accept the fact
that this person is harming me right now
but if I focus on the fact
that I'm being harmed by that person right now
or I want it to stop
to get my mind above that.
I'm trying to think of
something went through my mind just now
and then as I looked at you I forgot.
Sorry for that face.
What was it?
Come back to that.
Oh, the Buddhist example
when he was sick
David Dr. Rolls
the rock down on him
and the stone sliver pierces his foot
and so he's lying down
and Mara comes up to taunt him
so what are you sleepy head
just moping around
and the Buddhist says now I'm lying down
out of sympathy for all beings.
One, the fact that I have to look after myself
so I can continue to teach
but two, instead of focusing on the fact
that I have been hurt by this other person
I'm going to have good will for everybody
that takes you away from the fact
that I am a suffering being right now
why am I sick, why is this happening to me
may all beings be happy
that pulls you out of that
particular inner conversation.
You're spending at least two hours
on the freeways every day
getting back and forth
which is a lot of time
to experience ill will
and so what works
of late more and more work for me
is as soon as I start
like leaning on the horn
or something like that
it hurts me
I start to realize
then I end up carrying it
the way I finally think about it
is to let
the ill will stop here
and not keep circulating it
that kind of works for me
if I just kind of sponge it up
if I just kind of sponge it up
not protect myself
it's like it doesn't keep recirculating
and I don't come away
kind of polluted by it
well again
there's somebody up there thinking
who is that idiot leaning on his horn
and so you say
I don't want to give them more fuel
for passing this on
and this with any kind of bad karma
you think we may stop right there
and don't think of it as you have to sponge it up
it's stopped right there in front of you
it's your choice as to whether you're going to pick it up
or not
and John Lee has a great image of it
it's like other people say really nasty things to you
it's like they spit out something
and you go down and you pick it up and eat it
now who are you going to blame
for the fact that you get sick
it's okay there are idiots on the highway
this is part of the human condition
and don't say
this is real outrageous how could they do that
they're doing it every day
that makes sense
the idea that I'm hurting myself
realizing that they're not hurting me
not hurting me
any questions?
I thought we had more discussion on this topic
let's look at the passages then
the basis of goodwill is this
passage number nine
everybody trembles at the rod
or all are fearful of death
and it's drawing the parallel to yourself
neither killing nor others to kill
in other words you're basically
taking your own fear of death
all your own fear of punishment
realizing everybody else has that same fear
and then the follow up is
don't harm anybody
not only that but don't get other people
to harm
because that way you're doing a double
double layer of harm
it's interesting that in the
amongst rules
there is no rule against suicide
but there is a rule against
committing suicide in a way that harms somebody else
and even stronger rule
against getting somebody to kill you
because you're doing double harm
to the person who kills you
next two passages
you hear about metta phrases
well these are the buddhas metta phrases
think happy at rest, may all beings be happy at heart
whatever beings there may be
weak or strong, without exception
long, large, middling, short
subtle, blatant, seen and unseen
near and far, born and seeking birth
seeking birth, that's simple way to see
that's a character of
it's a class of beings
that haven't found the place where they're going to settle down yet
it's kind of an intermediate stage
where they're still looking around
and I've got some great stories about these
if you're interested
may all beings be happy at heart
and then the buddha goes on, not only may they be happy
but not only may they not do unskillful things
which is what the following passage is
let no one deceive another
or despise anyone anywhere
with their anger resistance
wish for another to suffer
so not only are you saying
I want you to be happy
but also I don't want you to
create the causes for your own suffering
by despising other people
or mistreating other people
so again, you're treating everybody as agents
not simply as recipients of your actions
that means you're not going to try to get somebody else
you don't kill but you get somebody else to kill for you
you don't steal
but you get somebody else to steal for you
that kind of thing
and then as a mother would risk her child
to protect her only child
even though so one should cultivate the heart
limitlessly with regard to all beings
that's the passage where the buddha is basically
you protect your goodwill
in the same way that a mother would protect her child
the sutra goes on to say
one should resolve on this mindfulness
this is where I was talking about
how it's, you know, you have to be mindful
to do this because this is not an innate quality
of the mind
it's not more innate than ill-will
you have potentials for both in the mind
so you have to cultivate this
make up your mind you're going to be determined
I'm going to treat this person
or wish this person well
and you turn them that
and then you've got to keep that in mind
passage 11
this is another mantah passage
may these beings free from animosity
free from oppression and free from trouble
look after themselves with ease
you're not saying
I hope that I'll be there for them all the time
they'll be there for themselves
because that's
nobody wants to be dependent
on someone else for their happiness
everyone wants to have their own ability
to maintain their own happiness
so you're wishing that for them
what's the mic?
can we talk a little bit about
goodwill to ourselves
and what form that should take
and let's say a pure form of that
would be may I act skillfully
what do we do when we make a mistake
and we don't act skillfully
okay what's the kind of thing to do
to agree with a mistake
on the one hand is to admit the mistake
and secondly is to resolve
you're not going to repeat it
and it's that point the Buddha says
again then you also extend goodwill to yourself
and other beings
goodwill to yourself
so you're not constantly coming down in yourself
or having made the mistake
remind yourself it's a human
it's part of the human condition
that we're going to make mistakes
and then
goodwill for others because that helps
confirm your motivation
for not wanting to harm others
to follow up to that question
suppose you know you've made a mistake
and you want to remember that you made that mistake
so you don't repeat it
but
when you remember you've made that mistake
and you tell yourself I made this mistake
isn't that
how do you
remember it
and still not get down on yourself
or come down upon yourself
because I do have things to remind myself
I did this, this was wrong
this was not what I should have done
and
I used that as a way to
kind of
maybe kill my
sensual desires or whatever it is
but
there's no way I'm able to
see this as not coming down on myself
it is a
I feel like it's okay to do that
or maybe I'm wrong
to an extent
I mean you have to make sure, as the Buddha said
there are times when you have to be harsh with other people out of goodwill
so there are times when you have to be harsh
with yourself out of goodwill
especially if you see yourself coming back
and making a mistake over and over and over again
you have to sort of up the
strength of your
tendency inside
but also
when you don't make the mistake
and the next day you feel better
oh I'm really glad I didn't do that again
remember that
and that becomes part of your motivation
remember the last time I was tempted to do this
but I felt better when I didn't do it
in the long run
don't I care for myself
so make sure that
underlying the harshness is
the consciousness, okay I'm doing this for my own good
I will be happier when I don't do this
question back there
so I have a question that relates to
goodwill and discernment
I've been
thinking about that a lot
lately in
kind of thinking that
the link between the two
I feel that goodwill
supports discernment
and discernment supports goodwill
and discernment
supports goodwill
they help each other along
can you talk a little more about
how goodwill
supports discernment
the example that comes to my mind
is
if you see someone else suffering
and you have
goodwill for that person
you will be
more able to discern
my accent
to discern what they may need
that you could do to help
could you talk a little more about
how goodwill helps discernment
goodwill helps discernment
the Buddha is teaching us the
Four Noble Truths
he's concerned about
putting that into suffering
he says this is the best use of
your discernment
this is where the teachings
and the suttas
really emphasize
the underlying
motivation
or the best use of your discernment
to put it into suffering
what is that motivated by
it's motivated by goodwill
may beings be happy
compassion comes out of goodwill
yeah
because basically you've got compassion
goodwill, compassion, empathetic joy
goodwill is the umbrella
and compassion is when you see somebody suffering
goodwill basically wishes for their suffering to stop
if you see somebody's happy
goodwill is happy for their happiness
which is it to continue
goodwill is what covers the whole
I guess when I see the Eightfold Path
I would be thinking
or
I interpreted it when
I was doing the program
as I'm doing the path
for myself
but the question
what I was asking was
goodwill for others
goodwill supports discernment
towards others
so I can see that
goodwill supports discernment towards
myself
if I hate myself
I won't be able to see
things to improve
or something but
the question
that interests me
is
how goodwill
would help
goodwill towards someone else
will help you have more discernment
towards them
that makes sense
dealing with other people it's the same sort of thing
our motivation for practicing
is not only to lessen our own suffering
if you get more
competent in handling your suffering
you're going to be less of a burden on others
you see this most
you know someone who's never really practiced
and they're on their death bed
and they're just miserable
and they reach the point where you really can't get through to them
and the suffering
the people there watching
this person's suffering
because they can't handle their own suffering
if you actually
are able to control
deal with the problem of your own suffering
so that you're not going to burden on other people
that's actually a gift to them
yes
I was trying to ask about the different
is
I feel it's not just my not being a burden
on others
but it's actually my
bringing
good things into the world
by being more discerning of the needs of others
because I have goodwill for them
if I had
ill will for someone
I wouldn't have as much discernment
of their needs
could you talk a little more about that
this is the basic principle of karma
is that if you
if you actually want
for your own happiness
part of your being happiness is learning
how not to harm other people
as you get more and more sensitive
in what ways am I actually harming other people
by actions and I'll learn how to stop
doing that because otherwise it's going to rebound
back on me
so it gives you your motivation
for being kind to others
that's what the discernment teaches your goodwill
and why you should treat other people
as you would like to be treated yourself
or avoid doing things
that you would not like to have done to you
and also if you're suffering less
you're going to see their needs more clearly
more objectively
because you're going through life trying to feed off of other people
you're seeing other people as food
and you're not going to see them
how are they suffering in the process
of my feeding off of them
that's like the hunters who say
the rabbit gave itself to me
it's because they want to eat it
if they didn't want to eat the rabbit
then they would go
oh my gosh, I'm just shooting this poor rabbit
so if you're able to take care of your own inner needs
then you see somebody else
that's not so much
how can I feed off of this person
the question is what can I offer this person now
so that even your help
to somebody else is actually
your way of feeding off of that person
watch out for that
question over here
just from my own understanding
I emphasize these Brahma vaharas
and goodwill as a way of refuge
using those skills as a refuge
towards unskillful acts
and my own well-being
is that a way of summarizing
again, it's protection for you
the Buddha talks about you
having goodwill for others
as a protection for yourself
and as you're doing the practice
that's also protecting others
the image he gives is acrobats
one acrobat standing on the other one
each one has to look after his own
or her own balance
so it's not to throw the other person off of balance
that's when which looking after yourself
is going to be looking after others
he says the opposite principle also works
there are times when going out of your way
for others being more compassionate to them
having more endurance as they abuse you
is developing your own inner strengths
so the two go together
the whole issue about you
are you going to be helping others
you're going to be helping yourself in the practice
there's no clear line
as you're helping yourself
as you're helping others
you're helping yourself
next topic
here's Michael
here's Michael
so then how do you discern
when
you're helping others
is not actually helping them
even though you think that it is
or it appears that it may be
this is where you have to
really look carefully
so what questions would you ask yourself
even to
broach that
because we've become so embedded
in oh I'm helping this person
I must be helping myself
it's a good thing
what would be an indicator
that there might be something
underneath that very subtle
what would be some
flags to say
maybe not
to know when you're overextending yourself
and how is my meditation going
is my meditation getting worse
as I'm helping more and more and more and more people
that's the first thing you would look at
and then they begin to show signs
that they don't like your help
maybe that's a sign that it's not really helping them
because sometimes
they're showing signs all over the place
and you're ignoring them
are you getting resentful
well again are you getting resentful
you don't want to help you have to give
then you have to ask yourself
this is my parent I have to learn how to put up with resentment
to teach myself not to resent
again if the student doesn't like the help
there comes a point where their resistance is so great
you realize they're not helping them
I mean you have to say things
that they're not going to like
but then you have to see
what is this person's reaction
which is one of the reasons why
as a teacher I have to say
some outrageous things to my students
just to see are they willing to put up with criticism
it's good to see
how they react to criticism
it's like when you're dating
you're dating someone
what is this person like
when he or she is angry
so you say something to make them angry
you never did that
I mean obviously
look at me I'm a monk after I've done that
but I always wanted to know
what is this woman going to be like
if I really make her angry
what does that mean to
what's her anger like
in some cases I didn't have to do anything
there was one particular one woman
I was dating and I saw her tear into her father
one time
that scared me
I said whoa
if she can do that to her father
imagine what she can do to me
that was the beginning of the end
but as a student
as a teacher you have to be able to
test your students
if I criticize a student
how are they going to take it
but as for resentment
there are times when you're helping your parents
and they're really really hard
and you have to say wait a minute
when I was a kid they cleaned up my shit
they put up with all the crying
in the middle of the night
I owe them a debt
so that's when you have to talk yourself into it
not to remember you have a debt of gratitude
to other people you don't quite have that debt of gratitude
so maybe I'm
doing this much for this person
they don't seem to appreciate it
they don't seem to be benefitting from it
there must be other places I can give my help
that would be more
more fruitful
yes, back
just in terms of
building Goodwill as a refuge
is there a particular kind of
strategy in terms of
say
you start with Goodwill for
a teacher that you've learned from
and then a family member that's cared for you
or an animal or a pet or something
and then you work your way up to
the people who have harmed you
I mean starting from
a point of stillness and then working
or do you just go straight to the person
who's harmed you and then just do your best
to wish Goodwill for them
sometimes
if you have the leisure
to be doing this
not in the heat of the moment
it's better to start out with someone
that you find it easy for
but then you also have to remind yourself
what does it mean to have Goodwill for somebody
this doesn't mean I would say
you continue sending out drones
and be happy
you may say well maybe
someday you may see it's a bad thing
to be sending out drones
because there are other times
when you have someone in the thick of the battle
or the thick of traffic or whatever
someone does something really outrageous
you guys go okay Goodwill for this
person
regardless of how easy
it doesn't mean I have to like what they're doing
I don't even have to like the person
just remind yourself
I don't want to act in a way that's going to harm that person
so I've got to think about their happiness
Goodwill is fueling yourself so you don't need the sugar
of revenge
so as a beginning exercise
you want to work your way up gradually
but then you want to be able to go right
to whoever you're dealing with
regardless of how much you like them or dislike them
to kind of think in the same way
of the foulness of the body
or the aversion aspect to think
of suffering and to use that as a way
to develop compassion towards them
that's one way of doing it
in fact the Buddha in that passage where he talks
about being able to think about the good points of other people
as a way of fueling your Goodwill
for these other people
he says sometimes you will run into people
you can't see anything good
about them at all and he says in that case
you have to have compassion
this person is creating a lot of bad karma for him or herself
and so it's not up to me to pile on
sort of to make things even worse
again this is a kind of restraint
this holds you back from wanting to do harm to that person
so as with the contemplation of the body
you start out with bodies that are easy to contemplate
and say oh yeah that really is ugly
and then you work up to ones
that you find more and more attractive
but then when it actually comes
you're confronted with someone who's really attractive
but if you got involved with that person
it would really be bad
that's when you've got to right then and there
be able to think about that
to pull up that perception
so when you're dealing with someone who's really difficult
you have to be able to pull up their perception
okay I've got to have goodwill for this person
and then remind yourself well how did I create the ill will
through the breathing
I've got to change the way I breathe
change the way I talk to myself about this situation
okay should we break there for a few minutes
come back in about 15 minutes
