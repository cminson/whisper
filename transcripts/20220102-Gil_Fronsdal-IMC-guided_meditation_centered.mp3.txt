So good day everyone, and on this beginning of the year,
and on this day I offer you my best wishes for this coming year,
for all of you, and imagine that each of us is doing that for each other,
for the rest of us who are logged in now, wishing ourselves the best.
And may it be that this meditation practice, and the mindfulness practice we do,
it contributes to that, not only contributes, but maybe even supports,
provides the most support for discovering the greatest happiness and well-being,
that will carry us through this year.
So one of the ways in which this Buddhist practice locates us is,
it talks sometimes about the four cardinal directions.
Often the Buddha is described as sitting, facing the east, the rising sun.
And so there's the east, the south, the west, and the north.
And for each of us, we sit at the center of those four directions.
And each of us is smack at the middle of what comes to us,
and away from us, away from us to the east, to the south, to the west, to the north.
And this little reflection is meant to place us at the center of our personal world,
the center of the world of our experience.
And of course, not to be self-centered, but to be situation-centered,
clearly here, present, at this location, at this center,
so that we can begin centering ourselves not only in the location we're at,
but also center ourselves in ourselves, within ourselves.
And the more centered we become, the meditation can be seen as a process of centering.
The more centered we become, the more the world opens up.
The more our eyes can see, our perceptions can become clearer,
until we start having some deeper wisdom about what it's like to be in this world.
So to center yourself in the middle, the center of your cardinal directions,
to feel how your body makes contact with what supports your weight,
the bottom, your bottom against a chair or cushion, your feet against the floor,
whatever way your body is supported, feel that support.
And then take a few long, slow, deep breaths.
And as you exhale, relax into that which supports your weight.
Let your weight release your weight to feel the solidity, the firmness, the support that's provided you.
In this place where you're supported, it is a kind of center of your world,
the world of your lived experience.
And then letting your breathing return to normal. And if it's comfortable, gently close your eyes.
And then become aware of how your body experiences breathing.
Especially feeling the experience of breathing in your torso, the movements of the chest, movements of the belly,
the expansion of your torso as you breathe in, the gathering back together as you breathe out.
And the breathing is also a centering place to center yourself.
Not only begin centering yourself in your location, but centering yourself in your body.
Experiencing where the breathing, the inhale begins and where the exhale returns.
Years come, years go, years begin and there's years that end.
So there are inhales that begin and end, exhales that begin and end.
Gently, slowly, calmly.
Be aware of the comings and goings of your breathing.
The rhythm of inhaling and exhaling.
As you exhale, the expansion and the growth of inhale releases and things settle back.
As you exhale, allow your body to relax with the exhale.
So your body can return also to a more relaxed state, a relaxed centering here.
And your mind might wonder often thought,
when it does, don't be worried or concerned.
See it as a rhythm of wandering off and then returning back to center where you contribute the returning.
And let it be a relaxed rhythm through how you contribute, being aware, waking up,
letting the mind return to here now.
You can see wandering off and thought as a natural process.
But not one that you want to stay with, but one that you want to add rhythm of returning, coming back.
Almost like a massage of the mind.
The mind wanders off, you return, relax.
Until it's easy to stay with the rhythm of breathing, here and now.
The mind wanders off, you return, relax.
The mind wanders off.

We are where we began, at the center of the four coordinate directions.
And also at the center of time.
In front of us is time past, behind us is time coming.
Or vice versa.
And in the middle is the present moment.
To be centered, clearly centered in time and the present moment.
In space, in the location where you are.
To be at ease and find your peace here and now.
And allow this centeredness here, the degree to which you are peaceful here.
Allow it to be an opening for a connectivity, a connection to others.
To all life.
So that your capacity to feel care.
To feel the value, the specialness, the wonderness of other beings and other people.
Allow them into the space of your centered awareness.
And from here, if you'd like, you can wish wealth to others.
You can live with thoughts and intentions, actions, dedicated to the welfare and happiness of the world.
Maybe one very small step at a time.
May we all live together to make this a better year, 2022.
May we all contribute to do the best we can to make this a better world for all people to live in, for all beings everywhere.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
And may all beings everywhere be free.
Thank you.
