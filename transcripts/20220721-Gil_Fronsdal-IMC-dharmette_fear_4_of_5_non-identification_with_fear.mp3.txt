Good day everyone. 
Continuing on this theme of fear and kind of following on that meditation, I wanted to discuss not taking fear personally, or maybe another way, not to identify with fear. 
Fear will occur and when we identify it, you know, in a really full kind of way, it's in some ways we become, I become afraid. 
I am afraid. 
And this language of I am afraid, sometimes that's wise to see it that way, to really own up to it and really acknowledge it, especially if it's something that's been denied and avoided and held at a distance or its value has been denied. 
To say, yes, I am angry, I am happy, I am whatever, is somehow appropriate to really let it become more full. 
But this sense of I am is also dangerous. 
It's also a source of a lot of suffering, that identification, this is who I am. 
And part of the delight of meditation practice and the freedom that comes with meditation practice is a healthy form of disidentification. 
Not that denial of anything, not paying attention to anything, everything that is happening has full permission to be there and included in awareness and clearly know that it's happening. 
But on top of it, we don't put, we don't put on the idea that this defines who I am. 
And because once we define ourselves by something, then it tends to be a magnet for all kinds of ideas of what the self is and who you're supposed to be and how you should be and what you should not be and what you should be able to do with the, I should be able to or this means I am. 
And there's all these implications that ripple out. 
But if we just allow something to be without identifying with it, it tends to be a lot simpler. 
We can still be responsible to it, but I prefer to avoid the word responsibility then and you simply divide that singular word into two words, response ability, that we have an ability to respond appropriately. 
So in terms of fear, it isn't that we want to dismiss fear or diminish its value, but it is possible to not identify with, not define oneself by the fear. 
When we define ourselves by fear, sometimes the fear is magnified and it becomes all-encompassing, it's all of who I am, and it's easier for it to be overwhelming. 
With intense fear it might overwhelm us anyway, even if we don't want to take it personally, that movement. 
But there are times when the fear is not so strong, that the anxiety is not so strong, that it's possible to have a shift in the mind that's represented by going from I am anxious to there is anxiety here. 
I am afraid, which is to, there is fear here. 
In some ways that's very respectful of the fear, the anxiety, because now we can bring our attention to the fear and anxiety in and of itself. 
When I am afraid, it's such a nebulous field, it's such a big cloud. 
Where is the fear then? It's everything. 
Sometimes it can be so much so that the whole world feels afraid, it's so big. 
As I said, it can be that intense sometimes, but even there there's a way of recognizing, oh there's chaos, it's everything feels afraid, that it's not as opposed to saying I am afraid, that makes a little bit more room to breathe, a little bit more room to be attentive to it, to not be enmeshed or caught in it. 
And that's the primary reason to not take things personally, not identify with things that arise. 
So there's more room to be wise and respectful and appropriate with how we are with things, rather than it being a confusing mass of stuff. 
So with fear, it can be simple, the practice of intentionally switching in your mind, maybe even saying these words, switching from I am afraid to fear is present. 
There's fear here. 
And then to ask, where is that fear? And if it's fear, generally if there's fear, it's someplace in the body. 
Maybe it feels like it's the whole body, but where is the locus? Where is it most strong? And then if you find such a place, that's the place to bring the cupped hands of attention and help that fear feel safe. 
If you can find the locale within your body where fear is strongest, sometimes then it's easier to disidentify with it, to not identify it so strongly, I am afraid. 
There's fear here, there's fear in the chest, there's fear in my legs, I want to bolt. 
And so there's a more breathing room for the experience. 
And as we go along here, then it's also possible to accompany the fear. 
And so if anything is personal, there's our ability to be present and attentive to what's here. 
And there's a world difference between being fear and accompanying fear, being fear and being attentive to it, being aware of it. 
And generally I think we can do good policy is that fear needs our companionship because fear is always a message. 
And so either we want to understand what the message is, there's a danger, and we see that and understand it better sometimes if we don't get enmeshed in it and caught in it. 
And sometimes the message that is there's danger, but as we study what the threat is, it turns out there's no threat at all. 
We're carrying with us anxiety, a preconditioning from the past to view every situation with fear. 
And in that situation, that fear is really, that's kind of fear that really needs to be accompanied. 
Someone needs to be present with it and hold it kindly and help it feel safe and not push it away, not deny it, not criticize it, just, oh, I see you. 
Let me be with you, let me accompany you. 
And I would suggest it's harder to do if we identify with the fear, like, oh, I'm afraid and this is so hard and so difficult. 
And so with practice in time, it's not easy to do what I'm saying here. 
But with time, as the mindfulness gets stronger, as our ability to relax becomes deeper, as our ability to see clearly what's happening in their experience, at some point, the shift from identification to the shift from defining yourselves by something versus just accompanying something as a subset of the whole, as a piece of nature, this is phenomena that's arising. 
And so with fear, it's possible to accompany fear that this way. 
Over time, as we begin to become more and more disidentified with the fear, rather than us accompanying the fear, a nice movement would be the fear accompanies us, meaning that we can live our life without being inhibited by fear. 
We know the fear is present, but it's kind of like it sits on the shoulder, left shoulder perhaps, it just sits there and comes along, it accompanies us. 
And we're not denying it or ignoring it, but it's not interfering with anything, it's not directing the show or directing our thinking and our concerns, it's just a companion. 
And you know there's fear, but we live our life fully, even with it, with the anxiety or whatever it might be. 
And so this movement towards not defining ourselves by fear is a powerful movement. 
And if you kind of are generous with the use of language, we can say we're not taking fear personally. 
Generous because it's not happening to anyone else, it's happening to you. 
So some people say, well of course it's personal. 
But what I mean by not taking it personally is not defining oneself by it or not taking full responsibility, like this has something about me and I have to do something and I'm a bad person, I'm a good person or whatever. 
And so you might try today if you feel some anxiety or feel some fear. 
And probably what I'm talking about today works best with something that's not too strong, but some of you might have some intense fear that you might find it interesting to try to do this with. 
And that is see if there's some way you can shift from it being I'm afraid or even this is my fear to there's fear. 
Fear is here. 
It's kind of impersonal. 
Maybe it's just accompanying you like there's a little person sitting on your shoulder and you know it's not you exactly, but it's there and part of the scene. 
See if you can see the shift that happens when you don't define yourself by the fear, but consider the fear as just something that's accompanying you. 
It's part of the whole. 
It's not the whole. 
And so freeing ourselves from this coagulation of self, of self-definition of that doesn't give us breathing room. 
And so one of the shortcuts to peace is not defining ourselves by our experience, not asserting or the self-definition who me because of that me that we carry with us. 
Of course there's a you in a certain kind of way, but when we start living that way, it becomes a magnet for so many different ideas and assumptions about what it is to be a self that they can be overwhelming. 
It can be one of the major sources of suffering in our lives. 
So I hope that your fear appreciates being accompanied today. 
I hope your fear appreciates its chance to be there and not be appropriated by you. 
So thank you.
