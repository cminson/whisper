 I did not prepare a talk for tonight, partly because of last Monday night's talk. Those of you who were here, I was wondering if you had any follow-up you wanted to do in that talk. That talk could be seen as being controversial, it could be seen as being subversive, it could be seen as being a great challenge by our guest speaker last week. I thought maybe some of you would like to follow up and have some discussion about that, your reactions to it and whatever. Or if there is no reaction or discussion to be had about it, then we can just take tonight as kind of an open forum to have Dharma questions, questions you have about your practice or practice. We don't do that that often on Monday nights. I think it's very helpful to hear where people are at in their practice and questions they might have. Is the speaker working okay? Is everybody hearing? Is the light okay? People happy with the temperature? So, do you have any questions from last week or concerns? Would you like a summary? People who were here last week want a summary? And why was it an important talk? Okay, so the guest last week, Tanjia, for Tanisiro Bhikkhu, is unusual in various ways. And one of the unusual things he brings to American Buddhism is he's an abbot of a Thai forest monastery in San Diego County. So he's definitely a player of developing Buddhism in the West. But one of the unique features of him is that when he was a relatively young man, he was introduced to enough Buddhism at Oberlin College where he went to school, that he went to Thailand. At first he taught English in Chiang Mai for a couple of years, and then he became ordained as a Theravadan monk. I think he was ordained for a year and then he disrobed and came back to America for a short while and then went back to Thailand, reordained and then stayed ordained since then, I think since about 1976 or 1977, something like that. And a lot happened in American Buddhism between 1976 and 1975, and the time he came back again about 1990 or so. And it was a very fertile time for the development of especially the Theravadan branch of Buddhism in the West. People like Jack Kornfield, Joseph Goldstein, Sharon Salzburg in particular, had studied in Asia Theravadan Buddhism, the Vipassana practice, and they had brought it back to America and in a sense repackaged it from the way it was introduced to them in Asia and began teaching the Dharma in Western idiom, Western ways, trying to make sense of it for Westerners and Western audience. And they adapted various teachings. Some teachings they left behind and didn't think Westerners wanted to hear because they didn't want to turn people, they felt the practice was really powerful and they don't want to turn people off by telling them about the Buddhist hell realms and how you're going to be reborn there if you step on an ant. And it's not that there's a lot of fire and brimstone kind of Dharma talks in Asia, but there are some, right? We have our Sri Lankan here who remember from your childhood fire and brimstone Buddhist hell kind of. So when's the last time I talked about Buddhist hells and if you would get reborn there if you stepped on the ant? Not so often. So there were a number of, I'm making fun of this now, but there are certain kinds of teachings which didn't make the mindfulness practice so inviting for Westerners so they were left behind or not talked about very much. Certain teachings which really spoke to Westerners a lot were highlighted in the West so that they had greater importance for us. So that's what made it interesting for us. And certain things in Buddhism might have been misunderstood and we evolved or changed or transformed in the transmission to America and certain things which were presented as Buddhist could be certain, anybody can say they're Buddhist and who's to say they're not, but they're quite different from what the Asian tradition is and sometimes this appropriation of Buddhism to American culture involves seeing ourselves. We really love Buddhism because Buddhism sometimes Western Buddhism is just a mirror of our own interests, their own worldview. And so that's part of the reason why Westerners like Buddhism so much. And one of the best-selling books on, I think the best-selling book on Buddhism in the West is a book called What the Buddha Taught. Who's read that? This room, What the Buddha Taught. And most people who read it in the West are quite inspired by that book. How many of you who raised your hand were inspired by that book? Some of you. And you know what the Buddha taught, this is the teachings of the Buddha and you know it's direct teaching, direct transmission, this is how it really is. And that book has been very popular in the West, it's sometimes a textbook in college classrooms and introduction to Buddhism. But while Pula Rahula who wrote the book, he was educated in Sri Lankan. He was a Sri Lankan who was deeply educated. He certainly studied Buddhism in Sri Lanka but he also studied Buddhism in the West at at Sri Ban and probably Oxford and different places in the West. And his understanding what Buddhism is was very much influenced by his contact with the West and Western philosophers and Western Buddhist scholars who were trying to make sense out of Buddhism. So when he wrote What the Buddha Taught, he was writing the kind of Buddhism he thought would work for Westerners. It's of course that it worked for Westerners. Westerners saw themselves in that book in a sense, they didn't recognize themselves but so they really loved the book. Am I making some sense to you? So there's a way in which we sometimes appropriate Buddhism, understand Buddhism in our own terms because we have certain categories of understanding reality, worldview, frames of references. That's how we see reality, how we want to organize it. And then we look at Buddhism which comes from a very different culture, very different cultural background and we either pick those pieces that work for us or we actually see things anew that maybe weren't there originally but kind of seem to be there, we kind of interpret it there and then we create a kind of new Buddhism for the West and it really works for us because it's we've invented it. I think I'm driving this home kind of, it's not as dire as it sounds, I hope, but it's a little bit like that. So Tan Jeff, the monk who was here last week, his Buddhism that he studied was almost entirely studied in Asia, in Thailand, in a very traditional Thai Buddhist setting. He learned Thai, became fluent in Thai. He entered very deeply into the world of the Thai forest tradition and really got to know it really, really well in a way that people like Jack and Joseph didn't because they kind of came and went a lot. They weren't there for 15, 20 years, they were there for a lot shorter period of time. And he wasn't here in America as Buddhism was kind of being formulated and interpreted for the Westerners. He wasn't even interested in Western interpretation he was there getting, trying to absorb very traditional teachings of what Buddhism is in the Thai forest tradition. So when he came back to America in the 1990s, he, because he was so deeply steeped in a different kind of Buddhism, he could see much more clearly than we can who are living in our culture those parts of Buddhism that we had kind of transformed in the American setting. And those parts of Buddhism which, you know, which we hadn't because when we're in the middle of it we can't often see what we've done. I remember, you know, some of you know this little book that I helped edit called Teachings of the Buddha and it's a nice little anthology of a few inspirational teachings of the Buddha and other and later Buddhist teachers down through the ages. Someone came to me with that book once in their hand and said, is this all the Buddha taught? And, you know, kind of the kind of almost symbolic meaning of that for me was that this person had taken this book that we had edited and which edited means that we had selected those things which we were inspiring for us and we thought were inspiring for you all Westerners and taken this to be the definitive work of the Buddha's teaching. So I hope many of you didn't think, don't think that. I hope you enjoy the book but not take it to be, you know, this is all there is. So that makes Tanjaf a little bit unusual and worth listening to because he has this very different perspective to understand what's happening in American Buddhism because he's a Westerner who can read all our books, you know, Asian teachers often can't and he's interested in doing that and studying reading those books and he has this very different vantage point from understanding it. So he can pick out those things that seem that seems a little bit odd to me. You know, where did that come from? I never heard that in Thailand or I never read that in the suttas. Oh, and he's a scholar in part and one of the things he is and so he's, and then he was pulled into editing a college textbook on Buddhism and the last chapter had to do with Buddhism in America. So he started studying much more carefully so he can write this college textbook chapter and he got very interested in what's, you know, where did some of the American Buddhist teachings, where did they come from? What's their origins? What are the influences that fit into them? And that was a talk last week where he was arguing that one of the important Western influences on the teachings of Buddhism in America is the European Romantic period, the romanticism of Europe in the 1700s. And how does that work? And his argument is some of the basic assumptions we have of what the religious life is and what we expect out of the religious life, how we see it and how we understand it and therefore how we appropriate Buddhism comes kind of indirectly from the idea of what religion is that was first kind of expressed by the romantics. So is this okay? I don't know. I don't want to give this whole talk over again. So, okay. So the Enlightenment period in Europe was a time of science, the kind of explosion of science, scientific method, and there was, to say the least, a big questioning of the earlier framework for understanding reality which had been a religious one. In Europe it was primarily Jewish and Christian. And so the whole Jewish and Christian way of understanding reality was questioned and sometimes criticized and sometimes seen as being inadequate. And scientific method was seen as being the great hope for progress and the great alternative to this sloppy thinking of religion. And that the faith and experiences were really of much lesser importance than the kind of knowledge you can get from the scientific method. So that went on for a little while and the romantics came along and said, they said a similar thing where they said that religion has to do with feeling, which is part of what the Enlightenment critics of religion said, just the feelings. The romantics said the same thing. Religion has to do with feeling, not about knowledge and understanding. It was very hard to argue anymore that religion was going to give you a valid information and knowledge about the nature of reality because the Bible just didn't hold up for a lot of these people. So they didn't want to denigrate religion. Religion still has a place and has a place higher, more important than science. And they said yes, religion does have to do with human feeling, but human feeling is more important than knowledge. And what religious life is about is cultivating or developing certain feelings about nature, about reality, about oneself, about God. And your feeling relationship you had to God was more important than what you knew about God. And Tanjith said that this is also a very important strand of one of the most influential Protestant religions in America in the 1800s, which was Methodism. Methodism also said that it's all about the method by which you have this feeling of the connection with God. The knowledge you have about God and how he works, or the knowledge about the world, is really secondary to establishing this piety, this pious feeling that you're going to have with the deity. And so the focus was on feeling, the feeling you have, the feeling of, and the particular kinds of feelings were important. A feeling of being connected, a feeling of being whole, a feeling of being interconnected to things, feeling of being intimate with the world and yourself, feeling of being whole inside, no longer fragmented, different, all these kind of fragmented parts of the psyche were no longer fragmented and you became whole, inside your psyche became whole again. It was a very important part of this romantic movement. This then influenced the next layer that built the foundation for us. And there were people like William James, Tanjith said, Carl Jung and Abraham Maslow. And Carl Jung particularly was very much influenced by the Romantics. William James also put emphasis on feeling as being the important thing about religion. He studied many different religious experiences and talked about the feeling and how they influenced people. William James said that it's not how you interpret the religious experience which is important because different religious people having very similar experiences but they interpret it differently. The interpretations are optional but the experiences are important in and of themselves. So the focus became again like the Romantics on the nature of the experience, not the knowledge or the interpretation that came out of the experience. So let's have an experience. Experience is what's important. Abraham Maslow also experiences what's important, these peak experiences. And Carl Jung very much said integrating the self. There's these fractured parts of the self, there's a shadow part of the self and to become whole you have to somehow integrate it all to become whole. And that part of this integration is a feeling of wholeness with the universe, with a cosmos in sense of interconnectedness. So and then you come to the modern American, you convert Buddhism, Buddhism of white, mostly European Americans for the most part, which is you know makes it whatever that's you know that's a whole topic in itself. And what you find in the writings of some of these people, like is a common kind of discussion about what Buddhism is. I'm still talking in for Tanjaf here. Is your you find people like Jack Kornfield and Joseph Golsan, Sheryl Salzberg, Joko Beck, Pema Chodron, Surya Das, kind of the big figures in American Buddhism, from very different Buddhist traditions in Asia, giving a very similar kind of teaching about what Buddhism is for us in the West. And in the eyes of Tanjaf, these teachers are almost interchangeable in the kind of way they present Buddhism, because they're kind of in the same milieu of kind of they're influencing each other for sure, they read each other's books, and they're kind of contributing to this invention of American Buddhism. And one of the things that Tanjaf wants to say is that what's common, one of the things that's common in these teachers is they describe their kind of goal of the religious life very much in terms of becoming interconnected, becoming whole, having a sense of oneness. So Jack Kornfield, for example, talks about there's a smaller self, which is a problem, and you want to realize that there's no separate self, which the Buddha never taught to use the word separate self, because that implies that there's still a kind of a self, the non-separate self, when you deny there's a separate self. And then Jack will go on and say, well, the point of practice is to transcend the small self and have some experience of the big self, where we all feel interconnected. And Joseph and all these teachers have this kind of flavor in their teaching. And in Tanjaf's ears, this is a lot in common with what the romantics and this lineage were teaching. And in fact, scholars of religion will point out that this is actually very common themes in the modern development of religion in America in general, not just in American Buddhism, and this is the theme of interconnectiveness and wholeness and and oneness with things and the feeling and experience and all this. And so Tanjaf says, this is a little bit, you know, so we're understanding Buddhism through these romantic glasses, the glasses of the romanticism and all these people. And so, of course, we love it because it's in our Western tradition. It's what kind of we're kind of grown up in it. And then he made this very provocative thing. So of saying that the teachings of interconnectedness, which is really strong in American Buddhism, I asked Joseph Goldstein once said it's still unusual to have a strong emphasis on interconnectedness in Buddhism. And when did this enter into where they first appear in American Buddhism? And he thought about it for a while. I said, well, I think I think it entered the scene with Thich Nhat Hanh, that he has observed as an interbeing, which partly is because partly it's out of his own particular Mahayana tradition that he does that. But it's also partly because of his political agenda, kind of the way he sees the world as engaged Buddhism. Interconnectedness works really well for that. And we love interconnectedness, a lot of American Buddhists, partly because it's really important the world has become so interconnected now. And many of us have very strong environmental ethic and the teachings of interconnectedness lend itself to a certain kind of to the ethics of environmental engagement in the world. It lends itself to an ethic of engagement in the political realm in the world, this social service realm in the world, when the world has become like a village and we all feel so interconnected. It's a very powerful teaching because part of our life is phenomenally interconnected. And so it speaks to that part of the modern Western psyche, which is really appreciating this interconnectedness. And so to give it kind of ultimate status by enshrining it in Buddhism by saying the goal of Buddhism is to have this feeling of interconnectedness, of being interconnected, feels really good to us. And what Tanjak said also is that part of the romantic notion and other people, this strata of influence he was talking about, is that things feel good become the validation for their truth. So interconnectedness, you have a feeling of interconnectedness and it feels good. Therefore it must be true, must be right. And is just feeling good the right criteria for measuring what religious life is like or what it what's possible. So one of the more challenging things he said to what is was that in his study of the Buddhist history, and I think he only using one data for his evidence, but he said it more broadly, is the teaching of interconnectedness was mostly became an issue in Buddhism when Buddhism was being practiced or taught by the wealthy. And most of these interconnected American Buddhists as a sociological group come from a group of demographically of people who are relatively well to do. They tend to be middle class. They come from middle class background. Some people report that their contact with Buddhism has made them downwardly mobile. But their background maybe is this kind of more privileged parts of society, the European American for the most part means a lot of exceptions, of course. And so this teaching interconnectedness maybe has something to do with the economic status of a group. And he said someone who is really poor and struggling for existence is not going to be celebrating interconnectedness, what he said. So it was a very challenging talk last week, I think, and very challenging to some of the basic notions we have about what we're doing here in the West and our teachings here in the West and our practice and maybe for you. And it could be seen certainly as a challenge. It could be seen as subversive what he was doing. It could have, in many ways, you could have interpreted last week. Some of you might have despaired upon hearing that talk. Some of you didn't even come back. It's more or less you were people today than last week. And breath of fresh air. Yes. What did he say about that point of Buddhism was that there was an interconnectedness. So I don't remember that he actually said that last week in his talk, did he? Yes. He did. Okay, someone fill me in. The end of suffering. Yeah, that was it. Basically, the Buddha's asked for a blank, what is your teaching? I'd say he's pointing alone. So one of the reasons why Tom Jeff's talk is useful, I think, is a degree to which our minds fixate or settle or get attached to viewpoints as being the point of our life or the meaning of our life or what we think religious life is all about. And if Buddhist practice is really going to be up to the task of really uprooting suffering completely, it's really helpful to have the rug pulled from under the viewpoints that we use to hold ourselves, support ourselves, so that if we're attached to those viewpoints, we can somehow be liberated from them and go all the way. Because certain viewpoints that can seem very enlightened are still viewpoints that get in the way of us becoming free. So that's one of the reasons why I talked like last week, it can be very helpful. And in his end tradition, they specialize in pulling the rug from underneath all our views. And that's part of the power of his end tradition. I just wonder if Buddha had actually emphasized interconnectedness, how successful he was being in the Indian subcontinent. That's where it's particularly difficult because there's a very rigid class system and a strong sense of pollution and people not touching each other and God. Interconnectedness there meant? I don't think we're really going to operate. Yeah, because we're too connected. If you get too connected to someone of the wrong cast, you get polluted. So I don't think any religion really ever operates in a cultural life here. And it seems to me it works for you. So one way of looking at Western Buddhism is that it's the appropriate medicine for this culture. That's one interpretation. But I think Maria had your hand up. One of the things I found interesting is that there seems to be a confusion between philosophical viewpoint and how people approach Buddhism. That is, they don't have to be the same. The fact that we come from a particular philosophical perspective does not mean that we're necessarily distorting Buddhism, which I think is the implication of this talk. And one of the things that I was very stimulated by that talk actually, and I thought a lot about these issues, and one of the things that it seems clear to me is that I personally have not approached Buddhism as a source of interconnectedness. I have a sense about interconnectedness that has to do with my philosophical framework, but it does not derive from Buddhism. And I can't really measure how much it influences what I feel about Buddhism or what I think about Buddhism or how I experience Buddhism. But I think that there's, he detected that there's a lot of philosophical thinking that becomes interconnected, it gets blended with Buddhism in the West. But it was unclear to me what his point was as far as how it distorted Buddhism for us, because I don't think that's what Buddhism means, interconnectedness. But there are people who take that, you read some of these books and they specifically say that's what it's all about. Well of course, I, you know, I've read those books. I've read those books, but it doesn't mean that I adopt that point of view. Yeah, he'd be very happy if you heard that. I think that's the point, is that I think there is a tendency when you get something that affects how you look at your inner being to relate it to philosophical and psychological concepts, which you may also be dealing with. Right. And to the extent that they blend, then you know, somehow you have to integrate yourself as a person. And I'm sure that that exists, I know that that exists. Certainly I've dealt with the same issues together, but it does not necessarily mean that Buddhism is somehow polluted by that point of view. Right. If you distinguish practice from philosophy and then the practice is not interrupted by the philosophy, then there's not a problem, because the practice will just take you all the way to the goal. I don't know, so many hands. It seems to me that what you're saying, the explicit was that the Southeast Asian tradition was the real Buddhism, and they had something here in America that was a deviation or a variation on it, but I don't accept that people. I think historically Buddhism at a time started in India, a time hundreds of years later went to China and had to change. And China had to accommodate to Chinese culture and change, and it went from there to Japan. God's hand Buddhism was agro-authentic. Then it went from there to Southeast Asia, even by the time you got to Thailand, we've gone to several countries, the wants of evolution, comes here and it's evolving and it's different. Here, maybe, you know, we're just as good as they were, we're creating things as good as we're able to understand and practice and teach it. So that's a beautiful kind of ecumenical, very accepting view of all the different schools of Buddhism. Now, would a Southern Baptist in Florida look on Mormonism as, you know, it's all Christianity and it's all equally valid? It's not considered Christianity. By who? By Mormons? I understand it by all of the Christian churches. But the Mormons, don't they consider it Christian? They don't? So what do we do with the Buddhist Mormons, the equivalence and Buddhism of the Mormons, you know? What do we do with them? But who's going to decide? I mean, it's the same thing in Buddhism. There's some phenomenal religions within Buddhism that are as wide ranging as, you know, the Catholic Church and the Mormon Church or, you know, Luther. And so there are Buddhists in Asia who look at those, they're not Buddhists. So in your beautiful description, you're kind of accepting it all as Buddhism. Any permutation, any developments, it goes into a different culture. And I'm taking devil to advocate with you, but there are certain people who simply wouldn't accept what you say. Right. So traditional Buddhists like Tanjia have a traditional sense of being rooted in Theravada Buddhism, which is one of the most conservative surviving schools of Buddhism. And someone who's deeply grounded in the teachings of the historical Buddha is interested in the radical possibility of nirvana, of uprooting all suffering in the human psyche, totally free of suffering being released. And then they go to Japan and they hear this teaching that now, actually, that was a fine teaching in the time of the Buddha. But we live in the period of degenerate age. And it's not possible anymore in the degenerate age for anyone to really practice and have any real attainments. It's not possible anymore. You can't really meditate and get any kind of progress in meditation. It's not possible in this degenerate age. And therefore, the only thing that we can do is to chant the name of Amida Buddha and hope that when we die, we can be born in the heavenly Ramana Amida Buddha, where we can have a little bit more hope for some kind of progress. Now, someone who really believes it's possible in this lifetime to sit and meditate and practice and attain that full release of suffering, to hear that this is Buddha's teaching that now says it's not possible at all. And what you should instead do is chant this name of this Buddha, which you've never heard of before in your life, and hope to get reborn in his pure land. That's going to seem really odd. And so, so there's an interesting question is, which I'm not going to answer, I don't feel like I don't want to answer, or I have a very ecumenical answer, is who is to decide who are Buddhists? There's no one who can decide that. Some inclined to accept anybody who says they're Buddhists as being Buddhists. That's fine with me. So that's kind of the direction I think you're pointing towards. If a Buddhism adapts to a new culture, it's supposed to adapt, it's fine to adapt, but it's possible that as it adapts, something gets lost. And what Tanjith is concerned about is that for him, from his point of view, the core emphasis on nirvana is lost. So if he hears Western Buddhists talk about a wonderful kind of fuzzy feeling of interconnectedness as being the end goal of Buddhist practice, and he kind of feels good to feel interconnected, he feels frustrated because you're shortchanging yourself. He actually told me privately, he thinks that's a fine experience to have. Somebody is critical of that experience, it's a fine, valid experience in and of itself, but he doesn't want people to stop there. And if the teachers are saying that's the goal, then people don't know any better that they can practice further beyond that. So that's his frustration, I think. I'm a little bit shy to speak for him here. He's a coyote. And it feels ironic to me that what they were talking about was interconnectedness. And that when I listen to your description, I feel just delighted for your synopsis, I want to thank you for that. And that I guess it has always seemed to me that while interconnectedness feels like a good thing, and that my heart opens when I think about it, I don't think and I don't feel that that is the end of practice, is a means to see an opening and a place to experience and practice compassion. Beautiful, thank you. Just a couple of observations. I think that when you live in an individualistic, preoriented society, the tendency is to look for connectivity. I mean, we just sort of naturally get pushed there, as you were saying. I think the difficulty we have is that it's very hard for us to really reach the point where we can continue to develop skillful views. I think that Buddhism is really based on interconnectedness in the sense that karma is interconnectedness. And that's the whole basis for the view. The problem is that we become so attached to the view that it's very difficult to let go of it and move beyond it, as you were saying. So I think it would be very difficult to separate interconnectedness from Buddhism, but I think it would be a mistake to recognize it as an end point or in a sense a final target of Buddhist practice. I think it's a very good point. I think it also points to that the word interconnectedness can have a broad set of meanings for people to listen to it. And it could easily be seen as being, you know, karma is involved, a certain kind of interconnectedness. There's a lot of things that are involved interconnectedness. So we have to define our terms to really understand what we're talking about. But if you take karma as being the, you know, the same thing as interconnectedness, then the Buddha didn't talk about interconnectedness, specifically using those words. But I think that it's valid to say that if you read the discourses of the Buddha, interconnectedness is not the glorious goal and solution or the, it's the problem. It's the problem that Buddhism is trying to address and to free us from. It's trying to free us from interconnectedness because the Buddha, interconnectedness has an impressive quality to it. I think the, it might be the best, but I still have the problem. I think the key part is why interconnectivity is so appealing is because it still preserves the iron view. Whereas, you know, traditional Buddhism, I mean, the Anatta, the timelessness part is very heavily emphasized. So I think, you know, all religions get packaged to be culturally acceptable. So here, interconnectedness is emphasized, whereas in the same way, come from Anatta, the black aligner is emphasized. So there's a whole lot of ritual around humility to alleviate the concern about the eye. So that's a big contrast in the state in the two forms of Buddhism. Beautiful. There wasn't, there wasn't offensive, not at my ears. Yes, please. When you said the speaker last week, he said the fighting goal was the bottom. So does that mean like a literal permanent enlightenment state? Literal what? A permanent enlightenment state that one would reach in his life act. The terms you use are a little bit problematic, but basically, yes, you'd agree. Okay, because I don't know if that's, it seems to me that the bottom in this lifetime, and the idea that it's more of something that I view as a metaphor, as I view interconnectedness, and perhaps the feeling of interconnectedness is the closest we can get to something that is not speakable through the language. That's an interesting point. I would, speaking for Tanjaf, I'm very confident he would not see nirvana as a metaphor. And I also don't see it as a metaphor. I see it as an experience. I see it as a real possibility for us that, so that's made for me, the whole trust of Theravāda Buddhism is to lead the person to the experience of nirvana. And rather than just being kind of a metaphorical carrot that keeps you going, I see it as a real possibility that attainable. That's it. Dandana. Yeah. If you agree with, or find what Tanjaf said to be attractive, which I do, what implications does that have for our practice, given the fact that we're kind of enmeshed in so many other ways of presenting and thinking and teaching and practicing Buddhism? So what are the implications for us with his teachings? I think one of the implications is to be very careful that our views don't trip us up, or our views don't inhibit our practice, kind of where we feel like, I've arrived, this is it. That we settle for some lesser nirvana. I mean, someone could have great mystical experiences, great states of consciousness that are attainable, that come with a very strong sense of being interconnected. A feeling of being one with the world and others is a very powerful mystical state that some people experience. And it gets very compelling. Some of these mystical states, meditative states, are very, very compelling, very kind of compelling interpretations that are almost built into them. And one of the implications is it's fine to have those that can be helpful along the path, but don't settle for it. Don't say, I got, that's it. And say, now I've reached the end. There's lots of stories of people who think they've attained liberation or nirvana, but they've actually not really gotten that far yet. And so now the comforting aspect of feeling interconnected is maybe appreciated by the person who will continue their practice beyond that. Yes, Ken? The one thing I wrote down that you said, which may have been the only thing I heard that you said, is that a truly mature person is one who doesn't have to have certainty all the time. That means we can be liberated from the idea that it is this, or it is this, or it is this. And I sort of have a sense of Buddha having said, do it if it works for you. Don't take my word for it. Don't take the teacher's word for it. Don't take the Scripture's word for it. Do it if it works for you. So we don't have to know, oh, this is the practice of Buddhism, and oh, it's distorted in the West. Or no, it's not distorted in the West. To me, it's a walk towards the end of suffering. It's that simple. So whether or not it's all this or that categories of things that we've sort of packaged it into tonight, that doesn't lead me down the road in my practice. So you hear that? And I think some of the things he said was a little bit confusing last week, I think. And one of these was this very, very point here in that Ken remembers him saying, mature person can live with uncertainty. And I think he was actually quoting the romantics. Maslow. And Maslow. It starts with the romantics. Maybe we have conversations. I had conversations with them too. But then it started with the romantics, that idea, and then it built from there onto others Jung and maybe Maslow. But I think there can't be any freedom without some acceptance of uncertainty. Because where are you going to get certainty about everything? Last one, and it makes you stop because it's over time. I see that anything that we do less than suffering would be called a wood. It seems like the more I do this thing, the less and less I suffer, the more I come out of my house in times. But when I went to Burma, they were very clear that the way you can actually end suffering. And so there was a bit of a cleanie out, like, oh yes, this is all very good, a bit less than suffering. But what we're trying to practice and train will actually get you to the goal of the end of suffering. And that's a very tangible outcome of these particular facts. But I know this question, I got very torn up around the goal of achieving the goal. I got very frightened of that. So I can see some wisdom about not introducing the goal. Of course, you do putting it in and making a lot of wisdom about not striding, making a kind of torture of what to get somewhere. And yet, I was neglected by the fact that you're speaking of other cultures that wasn't afraid to say that we've become somewhat afraid to say in our own culture. If you want to represent a terrible, a traditional, terrible teaching to talk about goals, you're ruining your day. That's great. That's great, Temple. And yeah, there was a sense of people in Burma not being afraid to say it as they saw it. And some of it is because they were very direct and good teachers, and some of it because they were fundamentalists. You know, you guys were the fundamentalists tend to do anyway, right? And this is the way it is. And sometimes it worked really well for people, and for some Westerners, it was a disaster. And some of those teachers had the wisdom to be direct at times, but they didn't have the wisdom to match the student sometimes. And some students got into big trouble in Asia practicing with teachers like that. And here in the West, one of the flavors of the American Bipassana movement is a real attempt to try to meet the student as a student is, and not to overlay a particular kind of idea of the path, but really meet the student where the student is at and try to kind of tailor make the path so it works for them, so they can follow their way. And so because of that, sometimes the flavor of the Bipassana teachers' teachings in America, the public ones tend to have a, tend to be, some people would say is to talk to the common denominator, but it's kind of like it's trying to, it's giving those kind of teachings that's going to work for the general American audience, because that's who's in the audience. And then when you meet with a teacher one-on-one, then you might get to practice tailor-made in a very different direction. You might go to the Bipassana teacher, one day you go to the Bipassana teacher and the teacher says, practice goallessness, that's really where it's at. And the next day you go, you go to a different teacher, and next retreat, and the teacher tunes into who, what's right for you, that particular retreat, and the teacher says, go for it. So how do we accommodate the individual psychologies of different people is a very important issue in practice. So are we distorting Buddhism in the West, or are we adapting it for the needs of the particular audience? And I think it's very hard to actually make it clean either way, the decision what's what, but I hope this evening has made you a little more sensitive to some of these issues. And when you hear American teachings and also Asian teachings, because I could do talks on those too, and the problem is there, the important thing for me is that you engage yourself in whatever you hear, and you don't just accept it because it sounds good and feels good, or because you have respect for the person sitting up here, but you really kind of take it to task what you're hearing and engage yourself with it and think about it and try to understand what's really being said, and try to understand even sometimes the logic. Notice when a speaker is speaking, when they make a declarative statement, and they make a declarative statement, you notice that, notice what a declarative statement is, and they notice how the rest of their teaching follows met declarative statement, but the assumptions behind the declarative statement have never been looked at. That's very important. So it's fun. I hope this has been useful. This is just confusing for you or discouraging, and maybe that's good. And I feel like we've raised more questions and concerns than we settled tonight, and there's a whole range of them, and if any of you find some of them are still active and interesting for you, and then over the weeks and months we can address some of them or you can talk to me directly, because some of the things I've said this evening could raise concerns, worries, maybe makes you feel a little bit alienated even from the very tradition you're sitting in, and that's not the intention. So my intention is to have a community here where we can all be quite straightforward with each other and talk about even what we don't like about us ourselves, what you don't like about me or the teachings I give, for example, that the communication flows freely. We can talk about what doesn't work and what does work, rather than someone leaving because something doesn't seem comfortable. Let's duke it out. So thank you.
