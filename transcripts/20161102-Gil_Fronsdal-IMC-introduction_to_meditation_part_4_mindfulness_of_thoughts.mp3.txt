Nice ball fans. 
It's going to be that kind of refuge from that world. 
So, welcome back. 
And as we have before, we start informally, which is if you have any questions about what I taught last week, about your own practice, or if you want to just simply report how it's working for you to do the meditation at home. 
Any questions? It all seems crystal clear. 
This is a nice time to have a little informal beginning because people are still coming in. 
So, I don't want to be reluctant to start with my talk. 
So, anything that you'd like. 
Gail, I've been trying one of the forms of meditation that Buddha did not recommend, but I'd like your comment on it. 
I kind of call it meditation while driving, because I do that a lot. 
But in trying to be in the body, which I do during other meditation, I focus on the sensation of the palms of my hand and the wheel, or the features of the other driver, or of course the other car. 
Could you call me about that? I think two Buddhist teachers that I know, colleagues, have written books on mindful driving. 
And I think it's an important area to be mindful of. 
It's also very interesting to study the nature of awareness while you're driving. 
Because even though you might be daydreaming and thinking about the things, having a conversation with someone in the car, there is a kind of heightened awareness that has to be in the present moment when you drive, where it's usually more consequential if you're not than almost any other thing you're doing. 
So, it's interesting to kind of notice what kind of attention you have while you're driving that keeps you driving safe, and how that's in the present moment, and the kind of alertness that it has, and the kind of relationship it has with destructive thoughts and hindrances that might come up. 
Because usually you stay on track well enough, usually driving, so what is that that's going on? And sometimes by studying that, you can get a sense of a heightened, kind of nice heightened awareness for meditation as well. 
There's many choices of what to do when you're driving for people who have a tendency of getting very concentrated, choosing one thing like the hands on the steering wheel could actually be a problem because they can get so focused on that sensation that they're not paying attention to what's going on around. 
Other people will find that having some primary grounding like that keeps them in the present moment, and they're actually much more present and alert than they would be if they were not having, didn't have that anchor. 
So, that's possible to have that. 
I find that it's helpful to stay in my body and have some attention to my posture when I'm driving. 
Same is true in working on a computer, that's paying attention to the posture because if the posture goes, if we become inattentive to the posture and the posture slumps or does what it does, it makes it less likely that we're going to be alert in the mind. 
So, take a posture that has some semblance of being alert. 
For me, the most important thing about driving and being mindful is in fact to stay in the present moment and stay open and aware of what's happening in my surroundings as I do it. 
So, to have my awareness be open and relaxed and moving so I can see the rear of your mirror, what's going on left and right, what's going on in the front, but all of the time staying in the present moment and sometimes being more than mindful, there's, in Buddhism there's a companion mental activity to mindfulness and that's in the Buddhist language is called clear comprehension. 
So, you wouldn't just simply be mindful, you'd clearly comprehend what's going on. 
Like you notice it's a car coming in from the right, but you can just notice it and just keep driving and have a wonderful collision. 
Just notice that and, you know, or you can notice it's a car coming from the right and say, oh, this I need to pay attention to. 
There's a stop sign there, but I notice that, but sometimes people don't stop for stop signs. 
So, I think this is a time to have heightened attention there and not kind of lose track of that person who's coming. 
And so, there's kind of a heightened kind of engagement, questioning, wondering, understanding what's going on that sometimes is really key for driving and sometimes is also key for mindfulness practice. 
There can be a kind of a clear, a clear comprehension of what's happening in present moment more than just simply being aware of it. 
So, I don't know if that addresses your question. 
Great. 
Thank you. 
Just an observation about emotions this week. 
And I think I never noticed the embodiment of the emotion so much. 
I thought it's mostly in my head and I don't know where else, but anyway, it helps me not react so much right away as soon as I feel something. 
Fantastic. 
So, feeling it in the body, which is a surprise for you, but if you do that, you're less likely to be reactive. 
Do you have any guess why? How does that work? How does being aware of it in the body help you be less reactive? Because I was busy feeling it rather than getting back. 
So, you're more involved in feeling it rather than caught up in the story and the event and all that. 
Another thing that can happen is once we're in the body, there's a deeper understanding of what's happening. 
It's more embodied. 
And when you really feel an emotion in a body, if it's a tense motion, an emotion that's kind of afflictive or problematic or painful, it tends to soften and relax if we feel it in the body. 
If we know we're having it and just know it mentally, it's too easy that the mental reactivity to it becomes second arrows, add to it and fuel it. 
Yeah, exactly. 
It was very unfamiliar to try to feel it. 
And the more familiar it gets, the more wonderful it is. 
It's really nice to feel it through your body. 
I have actually felt two experiences. 
The first one is that when I could be able to notice the body sensation more, even before coming thought or emotion, I could be able to notice how my body reacts. 
Before you feel the emotion? Emotion. 
And then I noticed that my breath is very fast or maybe I'm anxious. 
After that only I could be able to see the story. 
So that was kind of a little bit surprised. 
And another one is that last week was kind of very stressful for me. 
And I noticed I was trying to test that raft, whatever it was, and in one incident when I was just noticing and I was just seeing how my mind creates so many arrows, but I have kind of gone so down here. 
You know, maybe I got engrossed in the story. 
I didn't realize when I engrossed in the story versus when the body sensation. 
Yes, that becomes one of the things of practice. 
And the more you become familiar with what it feels like physically in the body, the less likely you are to be tripped up or influenced by the story mind. 
But if we're not grounded in the body, it's very easy to be swept away by the story. 
But I noticed that I could be able to understand myself better, how I react and how emotion actually affecting the body and not even mind actually the body so much. 
Fantastic. 
Yes, so as people become more mindful, there's a variety of connections they start seeing in their system here. 
And one is that the connection between thinking, stories, and the emotions and how it affects the body. 
And sometimes it's the other direction, which I think you alluded to. 
Sometimes you feel what's going on in the body and then you see how that triggers an emotion or that triggers a story. 
And so seeing the cause and effect relationship can be freeing because it starts seeing more impersonal. 
It's like, I didn't direct this, I didn't plan this out. 
Look at that. 
There was a sensation in my body and I remembered, you know, being on vacation. 
And then I started having vacation thoughts and planning my next vacation. 
It all started with a sensation in the body. 
Or you have some thought that was unbidden comes up and it's your, you know, your high school sweetheart who you hate. 
And so, you know, you still have resentment towards. 
And so suddenly you feel all this heat coming up. 
It was just a thought about that sweetheart. 
And so you see that cause and effect relationship can go in different ways. 
And it's very helpful to see that. 
And I noticed when I went very downhill, I noticed that it was too much. 
And after that, I kind of got very disappointed, like, oh my God, I notice it so early and how did I got so tripped down. 
But after that, when I became kind of very self-compassionate to myself, saying that, okay, fine. 
Then I could able to come out of fantastic. 
Very good. 
Very nice. 
Hi. 
I have a question. 
Oh, yes. 
Is there a light? Hold it this way. 
So it's kind of more horizontal. 
Yeah. 
Thank you. 
My question relates to pain. 
I've been having some neck pain the last days. 
And today, it became much worse. 
I was trying to use some of the Buddhist practices to deal with it. 
And I didn't know if I should focus on the pain or if I should get some distraction from it so that it wouldn't hurt that much, so that I wouldn't be so impressed. 
How should I do that? It's a good question you're asking yourself. 
The general approach in mindfulness is to feel physical pain, to bring your attention to it. 
And the primary reason is not to make it go away, but so that we don't have any second arrows. 
So that we don't react to it or contract around it or hate it or be upset with us or get angry. 
So we don't have all these secondary layers to it. 
So it can just be kind of simple pain. 
And many times pain gets worse if we get complicated mental reactions to it. 
So sometimes by focusing on pain, you can begin teasing away the secondary reactions. 
And it can be a lot easier then. 
So that's one possibility. 
The other possibility is some kinds of pain is actually useful to distract yourself from them because it lets something go or relax that can't relax if we're focusing on it. 
So sometimes it's useful. 
And sometimes with some neck pain, you have to be careful. 
I don't know what kind of pain it is because sometimes a very important option is do what you can so you don't have it. 
So some people like for meditation will do meditation lying down. 
Or I've known people who've had serious neck problems and they sit up with a chair against a wall and they put a cushion or pillow underneath the back of their neck like this so they're resting so their neck doesn't hurt. 
Because depending on the kind of pain, if you want to be careful, it's not a pain that aggravates it. 
It makes it worse. 
So here, yeah. 
Yeah, I just want to share something, what happened last week. 
So I was kind of running for a half marathon and I never run more than eight miles in my life and whatever practice I did. 
So I was kind of completely killed that I'm not going to make it. 
And when I was kind of running nine miles, I'm kind of complete the nine miles, I found that there is a wall in front of me. 
I can't do it. 
My body is in pain and I can see myself that I have two personalities there. 
One personality is telling me you can't do it. 
You're a loser. 
You can't make it. 
Another personality is kind of teensy. 
No, you can do it. 
You can do it. 
So at that time, I was kind of doing whatever I've learned in this class. 
Kind of body meditations and the mind and all those things. 
The good part is that I made it. 
So I kind of like to share that. 
Great. 
And what do you think it is about being mindfulness to your body, your mind? How did that help you? So naturally, one part was that my body was in complete pain. 
My legs are paining because I've never done that. 
So I was kind of completely focused on those pain areas. 
I found that, okay, the pain is going to go away. 
If you focus on it? Yeah, focus on that. 
So I still am walking, though I cannot run, but I still am walking while doing the meditation. 
So that's one part. 
Other part was that because I can figure out that there is two of me, one which is saying that you are a loser, you can't do it. 
So I'm focusing on that part, that emotion and I figured out that that's kind of mellowed down and my positivity become more stronger and kind of give me feelings that I can do it. 
Plus at the same time my body pain is completely gone, I can say, okay, I can move. 
And actually after that, I will start running. 
So which I can't believe in myself that how can I run after that big while. 
And normally if you have these voices in your head that says I can't do it, I'm a loser, what would the usual effect be for that, for you? Naturally it will give me negative impact plus the pain is coming, so it will stop me. 
Stop you, it's going to give you, you feel more drained and more tired and more painful and just discouraged. 
Excuses saying that, okay, my ligaments is not holding me or something. 
And I'll say and I'll kind of say, okay, I can't do it. 
Great. 
So you saw it as just part of your mind that you didn't have to believe. 
That's right. 
And so you didn't get pulled into it. 
Yeah. 
And so it didn't have any much influence on you. 
That's right. 
What a great story. 
Thank you. 
Yes. 
Hi Gil. 
I wanted to circle back to the first question you answered where you talked about clear comprehension in relationship to mindfulness and gave that example of you could see a car merging into your lane and respond to it or just note that it's coming and have a crash. 
And I'm so glad you brought that up because I've been thinking about clear comprehension in relationship to mindfulness lately. 
I had a situation yesterday where I noticed myself being rather greedy about something trivial. 
There was some chicken in the house in the refrigerator that I didn't want to share by roommate. 
And I didn't even know that this discursive thought was happening until suddenly I just it became very apparent that I was thinking this thought and my relationship to the preset precepts came up not being possessive. 
And as soon as I saw that next to not being possessive my ethics it was very easy to drop it to drop that thought just to let it go. 
Oh that's not useful. 
I don't want to be doing that drop. 
And so that struck me as an example of mindfulness unifying with the teachings. 
And so what my question is relates to what I hear a lot of modern day mindfulness teachers saying which is that mindfulness is bare attention. 
Or I think what John Kabat-Zinn says is paying attention to the present moment on purpose without judgment like just blank screen. 
And that doesn't have that aspect of clear comprehension in it. 
So I was just wondering if you could talk about that contrast of teachings there. 
Well I mean if we go back to the Buddha's teachings he sometimes used the word for mindfulness which is sati and the word for clear comprehension. 
Sampajana as a compound word so that they're really integrated together. 
They work together. 
But sometimes they're treated separately as two distinct things. 
And I think of mindfulness in the teachings of the Buddha to be what we would nowadays call awareness. 
And that sampajana that's clear comprehension is just that it's clearly recognizing and understanding what we're looking at, what we're aware of. 
And the two work really well together. 
The modern practice of mindfulness as it comes in the Buddhist tradition tends, at least what I learned in Burma, tends to emphasize clear comprehension more than the awareness part. 
And so when they use the word mindfulness as if it means clear comprehension. 
But the two go hand in hand. 
You can't get very far from one if you do the other. 
They kind of support each other, they come together. 
And if you develop strong, stable awareness in the present moment, it's kind of natural to start having clear comprehension. 
It's just kind of what the mind does. 
The cognitive functioning of emptiness. 
It's called sometimes. 
Would you say that the teaching of that bare awareness or bare attention teaching is lacking in a sense because it doesn't always include that clear comprehension aspect? Yeah, I don't know what to say. 
And your questions are quite good, but this is the beginning class. 
You know quite a bit. 
So I don't want to lose everyone who's here to get into the subtleties of all this. 
Sure. 
Yeah, thank you. 
I can always ask you later. 
Good. 
And so, okay, so today we're going to talk about thinking. 
And to introduce this topic, I want to teach you a analogy or a little story, a teaching story. 
Imagine that you're out for a nice walk. 
And it's a nice day, sunny and beautiful day out in nature and some nice forested area, meadow area. 
You're walking along and enjoying it and all that. 
And then in the distance, there's a nice river that's going down and a nice river bank and a beautiful oak tree that's up in the edge of the river. 
And so you say, that's a good place to rest. 
And you go there and sit with your back against the oak tree and you bring out your lunch. 
You're just watching the river go by and it's so relaxing, peaceful. 
You're so content. 
You feel safe. 
You feel like it's been a good day. 
Nothing to do, nowhere to go. 
Just be here and it's nice. 
And then you notice that coming down the river is this big New Orleans showboat with dancers and music and bands and probably casinos and great food and whatever the temptations might be. 
And the next thing you know, you're on the riverboat. 
But the next thing it means two or three days later, you realize what happened. 
I was so content and happy on the river bank under the oak tree. 
And now I've been like several days on this riverboat and I'm getting tired. 
So you finally get off the boat somewhere, managed to trek all the way back up to your oak tree and you sit there finally, oh, this is good. 
This is heaven to be here again. 
And then this big war boat comes down the river. 
It's fighting the great war, the good cause. 
And guns are shooting and big banners, the cause. 
And next thing you know, you're on that boat. 
And you're on that boat for a few weeks because it's really justified. 
And after a few weeks, I was there sitting so nicely on the river bank. 
And what am I doing on this big war boat? So you go back up and you find your way back to the oak tree. 
You're there again. 
And next time there comes this like coming down the river is this decrepit, you know, barely held together all little kind of raft that, you know, just half under the water and just like it's, you just feel sorry just looking at it. 
Sorry for it. 
Just looking at it. 
Poor raft, you know. 
And the next thing you know, you're on that poor raft. 
It's so hard. 
It's good. 
This is terrible. 
We're going to sink. 
We're going to drown. 
This is going to be the end. 
And it takes you a few months to realize you're on that boat. 
And then you finally get yourself off and get back to the oak tree. 
And then finally sitting down the oak tree, you realize, you know, I don't have to get on any of those boats. 
I can just let the boats go right by. 
So this is an analogy for what we can do with our thoughts and meditation. 
We can get on those thoughts. 
We can get involved and ride those thoughts for a few hours or days or years or a lifetime, you know. 
Some people get onto certain thoughts and they never get off. 
Or we can learn to get off onto the dry, secure shore where we're kind of safe and, you know, solid. 
Or we can learn how not to get on to begin with and be able to just watch the thoughts go by. 
And then, you know, there's a river boat. 
I know that one. 
There's the war boat. 
I've been on that, but I don't need to do that today. 
There's the poor me boat. 
Bye-bye. 
You wave as you go to wave as it goes by. 
But you don't get on. 
So what mindfulness allows you to do if you're in the present moments well enough to track what's going on, to kind of notice when things happening, is you can notice a thought coming. 
You can notice it passing by. 
And you can notice the tendency to want to get on. 
Or you can notice the tendency to stay here. 
No, I'm going to stay here. 
I'm just going to watch it. 
You know, and I don't have to get. 
And one of the ways just to watch it is not to take it personally, which means don't, you don't judge it. 
You don't feel bad about it. 
You don't feel bad about yourself because you're having that thought. 
You don't praise yourself for having the good thoughts. 
You don't criticize yourself for having bad thoughts. 
You don't even see, almost like you don't even see the thoughts as my thoughts. 
One meditation teacher I know, he made the exercise of whatever thoughts he had in his head while he was meditating, he imagined they came from the person behind him. 
And so then he took them much less personally and he would just, they would just, you know, let them just go right by, you know, and not get involved. 
And part of the reason I'm not getting involved in thoughts is that thoughts have a huge influence on us if we're in their grip. 
And the shape of this thoughts, the subject of thought, the emotions connected to the thoughts can have a much bigger impact on us if we're involved in the thinking, if we've gotten into them and thinking them and all that, then if we just sit back and watch them. 
In this regard, I like to distinguish between thinking and thought-ing. 
Thought-ing is what the mind does. 
The mind kind of is a thought-ing machine. 
It means it just makes thoughts will bubble up and then it bubbles, it's kind of apt for, the thoughts just appear. 
Thinking is when we get involved with the thoughts and we start associating, you know, one thought after the other. 
So a car goes by and you think, oh, that's a car. 
Okay, you had a thought. 
Then you say, that sounded like a really good car and I need a new car and I wonder what it was and probably I should get a red car next time. 
And there's a chain of associated thinking and you've gotten hooked in, one is hooked into the next because I'm interested in it, I'm involved in it, as opposed to just letting it be, oh, there's a car going by. 
It's a very simple, innocent thought. 
So those simple, innocent thoughts often can be what the mind does. 
The thinking is when we start getting involved and the idea in mindfulness is to stay on the solid shore, relaxed, back against the oak tree, at ease and just leave it alone and let it go by, let it go by. 
Just let it go, let it go. 
Almost as if this has nothing to do with me. 
Just let it go by. 
Does that make some sense? So we're going to do a couple of meditations today. 
And the first will be a very simple kind of mindfulness meditation that's kind of, well, introduced mindfulness of thinking in the most simplest way. 
And then we'll talk a little bit more and then after this I'll do another meditation which will be an exercise. 
An exercise where you explore the terrain of your thinking. 
So you can become much more familiar with what actually thinking is, what kind of processes it is, all the different aspects of it when it occurs. 
So you can learn to pay attention to it without getting mesmerized by the content of the thoughts, what you're actually thinking about. 
So those are the kind of the plan here. 
So we'll start with a basic meditation so you can take an upright sitting posture. 
And gently close your eyes. 
And then take a few long, slow, deep breaths. 
As you breathe in deeply, feel your chest torso expand. 
And long exhale in which you relax and settle into your body. 
And then letting your breathing return to normal. 
And taking a minute or so to scan through your body to see if there's any obvious places that you can relax. 
Soften. 
Maybe you can soften the muscles of your face. 
Soften around the shoulders. 
It'll be helpful to soften the belly so the belly hangs forward and down a little bit. 
And then see if you can find some place in your body that feels like a neutral place. 
There's not any particular discomfort where there's not any strong associations that make it complicated. 
One possibility is to feel your right hand. 
Or it could be anywhere. 
It's a place that's neutral. 
And let your awareness roam around in that neutral area in the hand, for example. 
There's no particular purpose for this exercise except to help you be in the present moment in a relaxed way, feeling something simple. 
And seeing if you can let your awareness be clear, clearly aware of that part of your body, so clearly aware of the sensations of your hand. 
At the same time that the awareness is not leaning into it, pushing, straining, or the awareness is not casual or indifferent or hesitant. 
A simple, direct, relaxed awareness. 
So then bring your awareness to that part of your body where you most clearly experience breathing. 
And as you feel this part of your body, see if you can have the same kind of relaxed, clear awareness as you did for the neutral place without being for or against anything, without trying to do anything except to be present and aware. 
Thank you. 
And if the mind wanders off into thought and you notice that, begin again with your breathing. 
Feeling equally the inhalation and the exhalation. 
Perhaps letting go of your thoughts as you exhale. 
Adjusting your awareness so it's not pushing or straining, but also not casual or indifferent or hesitant. 
Awareness which is direct and present, is clear of the breathing as the body breathes. 
And if the mind wanders off into thought and you notice that, begin again with your breathing. 
And now you can stop paying attention to your breathing. 
And instead, just be attentive to your mind thinking. 
You're allowed to think, but turn your attention clearly and directly to recognize that you're thinking. 
That you're seeing the boats go by. 
If the thoughts disappear as you look at them, you can go back to your breathing until thinking begins again. 
And then look thinking right in the eye. 
Recognizing this is a thought. 
Some people think more in words, some people think in images. 
Whatever it is, just know it's happening as it's happening. 
Being careful that your awareness is not straining or pushing, but also not pulled back or hesitant or too casual. 
Clear awareness of thinking. 
And as thinking occurs, or as thinking reappears, is there any emotion connected to your thinking? It could be quite subtle, or any mood associated with your thinking. 
And if there is, be aware of that. 
No need to get involved. 
Some river boats are emotion boats. 
You see it, go by. 
And now return to your breathing. 
And allow yourself to feel the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out as it's experienced in the body. 
And then the last couple of minutes of the sitting. 
If you find yourself thinking, take a moment to clearly recognize thinking. 
Look at it directly, recognize it as thinking. 
And if it feels like it's well acknowledged, maybe then you can come back to your breathing without being easily pulled into the world of thoughts again. 
And then you can come back to your breathing. 
And then you can come back to your breathing. 
And then you can come back to your breathing. 
And then to end this sitting, you can take a few deep breaths. 
Feel your body. 
Feel yourself sitting against the chair or the floor or cushion. 
And when you're ready, you can open your eyes. 
So the idea of mindfulness meditation is to learn how to be mindful of what's happening. 
Anything that's happening that's prominent in the moment. 
So when we do mindfulness meditation, it's not pushing things away or ignoring things, but rather learning to turn towards what's happening so we can see it clearly rather than being pulled into its orbit or rather than resisting it or pushing it away. 
So we start with breathing, but we're ready to let go of the breathing if something else is more prominent, more compelling. 
And then in a matter of fact way, bring our attention to that thing which is a compelling event. 
If it's physical sensation in the body, we bring the attention there. 
And I don't know if it worked for you, the neutral place to feel like in your hand or something, where you can kind of be present for something without any reactivity, without being for or against it, without judging it or feeling bad. 
Just feel it in a very simple way. 
So the idea is to try to bring that kind of awareness to whatever you're feeling, whatever you're present for. 
So even if you feel pain in your body, you want to see if you can bring that quality of attention to the pain. 
Just a matter of fact, not being for or against it, just to feel it fully. 
Or if there's a lot of pleasure, same thing, you feel it fully but you're not for or against and you're leaning into it and say, ah, finally, now I'm really going to have a party here. 
Just feel it. 
If there's emotions that are compelling, then we would again let go of the breathing and turn ourselves to the emotions and do emotion mindfulness, mindfulness of the emotions, and in the way we talked about last week. 
So the same is true of thinking. 
That if thinking is in the background and not really disturbing anything, you can stay with your breathing in the foreground, you can just ignore your thinking. 
But when thinking comes into the foreground, becomes the predominant thing happening, or your lost in thought preoccupied with thinking, then the instructions are to let go of the breathing again and turn your attention to the thinking and be present for that. 
See that clearly. 
Hopefully in the same non-judgmental way or non-reactive way, not being for or against as you did for that neutral place that we felt in the beginning, the real key to mindfulness is the how you're mindful. 
And so how you are is really important. 
So you're not pushing, straining. 
Some people have the sledgehammer approach to mindfulness. 
And they want to get rid of things. 
They bring their mindfulness like a hammer, just kind of just bore down on it and zero in. 
Some people are lazy or complacent or afraid or resistant. 
And so they don't really think, well, I'm supposed to be mindful. 
I'll kind of be aware. 
And you kind of like just tap it lightly and turn the other way and kind of not really there. 
But the idea is to kind of bring this clear, present, relaxed awareness to what's happening. 
So we can do that with our thinking as well. 
Just watch the thoughts go by, watch them there. 
And in this regard, it's very important not to think of the thoughts as problems, as something that's wrong or bad. 
If you're a good meditator, you shouldn't be thinking. 
And it's very common for meditators to have those thoughts because thinking is the most common thing that distracts us from the meditation itself. 
And if you feel like we're not succeeding at what the task at hand, what we set ourselves to do, many people have the habit of getting discouraged or disappointed or angry with themselves. 
But in the mindfulness meditation, the idea is to just know what's happening in a very simple way. 
And if what's happening is distracting, we just turn our attention to notice the distraction. 
And then you're doing the practice. 
So distractions are no longer the distractions as soon as you turn your attention to them. 
So it's a wonderful piece of Aikido. 
The very thing which is the problem becomes the, I don't know if we want to call it the solution, but the very things that's the challenge becomes the meditation itself. 
The challenge to meditation becomes the meditation. 
So if there's loud sounds outside, I can't meditate because all the sound outside, my neighbor's dog is barking. 
That's the challenge. 
So we make that the meditation. 
So we just turn our attention to listen to barking. 
The barking is happening in the present moment, and we're trying to find a way to be relaxed and open with awareness, feeling that. 
When these other things are no longer compelling, then the instructions are to come back to your breathing. 
So if thoughts are compelling, you want to notice them. 
You want to bring your attention and look at them directly. 
So what happened to some of you when we did that in this meditation? I instructed you to kind of stop focusing on the breathing and just completely look at thinking, and that's the only thing you were supposed to do. 
What happened to some of you? So there's a mic that we can bring to the outer hall there. 
It's coming. 
Hi, Gail. 
Yeah, so I found that naming the thoughts could help achieve that sort of detachment, remembering or judging, and the thought that really hooked me was planning, even visualizing whether I would volunteer this question or these thoughts right now and how I would go about that. 
I guess to make a question out of it, should I expect to. 
. 
. 
Because the naming is sort of another layer of thinking. 
So should I expect that in practice I might sort of stop this naming? You could. 
And so what he's referring to is, I think I mentioned it briefly in the earlier classes, that one of the techniques that supports mindfulness is naming the experience that you're having, so noting it. 
So if you're breathing, you can note in, out, in for the in breath, out for the out breath. 
If you're having a strong sensation in your body, you can note that heat, heat, or pulling, pulling, or, you know, tight, tight, or something, itching, itching. 
And the idea of the noting is not so much. 
. 
. 
The noting is not that important. 
It's more, it does a couple of things. 
One is it encourages you to stay present, stay there with that. 
It's like a little cheerleader says, stay there, stay with that, stay with the breath. 
And it also gives the thinking mind something very simple to do, because if an idle mind will get in trouble, it's so easy for it to wander off in something, you know, in more complicated thoughts. 
So you're giving the mind something very, very rudimentary kind of thought to keep you from drift. 
. 
. 
It's a thought that keeps you from drifting into thinking. 
So it can be very helpful to do. 
And the other advantage sometimes of these mental notes is that it's also a fuller acknowledgement of what is it you're paying attention to. 
And there's something powerful in the mind about acknowledging something. 
It's like something settles, something gets freed up if we name it. 
Oh, that's what it is. 
And so you did. 
. 
. 
That was a great thing that you did was with thinking you can note planning, remembering, and sometimes having that label can be freeing and help you not get onto that boat. 
It's like you step back from the shore and say remembering as opposed to getting on the boat. 
But you're supposed to monitor yourself, and there'll be a day you might find where it's no longer helpful to do that naming. 
And that's the day you stop. 
Yes. 
So I find this exercise much more difficult than in the past because I find it easier to just observe physical sensations or emotions even without getting engaged. 
But to be present for thinking but not starting to engage in it, I find it very challenging. 
And in a way it got me out of that kind of more relaxed, like, distance kind of space. 
And I think I might need a lot more practice in that. 
So you're saying that it was too easy for you to get to thinking about thinking. 
Right. 
And so it is a kind of a silent mind that we're watching the thinking with. 
So it takes a while to learn that. 
Someone else? Someone else? Just reacting on what you just said. 
How do you do that? Silent mind, noticing the thoughts. 
Because for me, the awareness comes in a voice. 
In a voice. 
But how do you know it comes in a voice? Because I hear it. 
But is the hearing silent? I don't know what to answer. 
I know there are thoughts during meditation that are very much still identified with, which are the thoughts that keep me engaged in the breath, or correcting my posture. 
And that comes through some kind of voice that tells me to stay there. 
Or I don't have to go into that emotion point. 
So there are different layers, there are different aspects of attention. 
So some of them involve cognition, words. 
And sometimes we only know something and we don't have a word for it, really. 
But sometimes another layer of awareness is silent. 
Where you don't have a word, you don't have a label for it at all. 
It's just an experience. 
You might hear a very strange sound, and you never heard it before, and you have no label for it. 
You might not think about what it is, it's just a sound. 
You hear it as a sound. 
Or you're listening to music that's really nice. 
The richer the music, the quieter the mind can get. 
But if you start thinking about the notes, and you set the right note that the composer used, and maybe you should have been in a different beat, you kind of lose the music. 
Or if a wonderful car drives by here with a really good bass speaker, and our whole body begins vibrating, we can know and think about the vibration, and we can also feel it. 
And that feeling is more silent. 
And so feeling is more silent than thinking. 
So there's a variety of different kind of silent awarenesses that operate that are kind of the foundation for mindfulness. 
That makes a lot of sense. 
So for body feelings, or hearing something, or understanding this silent awareness, for thoughts, I don't know if I've ever experienced that. 
Have you ever listened to people speaking, speaking a language you didn't know? Yes. 
And so you couldn't have any thoughts about what they were saying? Yes. 
And you might just kind of relax, you know, it can be in the background, but you're not trying to understand it, or judge it, or analyze it, it just becomes ambient sound. 
So you can have the same relationship to your own thoughts. 
There can be this images, or ideas, or words in the mind, and they can just be there, and be known in silence. 
Thank you. 
So did some of you, when you turned your attention to your thinking, so in the earlier half of the meditation, you were supposed to let go of your thoughts and come back to your breathing. 
And now in the second part, you were supposed to stop letting go, and just look at it. 
So now that you're allowed to think, that some of you found it hard to think, that it was like thoughts went away, but when you let go of it, they came back quickly? Isn't that interesting? That's a really important insight. 
That sometimes if we're trying to get rid of thinking, and have a negative attitude towards it, it's the very thing that keeps it going. 
Or it can kind of create the conditions where it keeps flourishing. 
But if you turn towards it directly, and acknowledge it, and see it for what it is, sometimes then it quiets down. 
Partly because seeing something doesn't fuel it, doesn't feed it. 
And if you don't feed it, the thoughts don't continue making thinking. 
Those generate more and more thinking. 
So if you're sitting in meditation, and you start thinking, and it becomes a problem, in the sense that you have trouble being in the present moment, then you can just very relaxedly turn your attention and acknowledge thinking. 
It can be done silently if you know how to do that, if you can do that. 
Or you can use a word, thinking, thinking, or remembering, planning, fantasy, whatever it might be. 
And that allows you to kind of be present to see it, watch the boat go by. 
It allows you to acknowledge it. 
As I said, acknowledging is a powerful thing to do. 
And you just keep in a very relaxed way, keep the noting going, the naming going, mostly for the purpose of to continue to kind of stay right there, be present for it as long as it's there strong. 
And then, if it stays, because it's really strong, then it's a time to investigate it, to get to know more about it. 
Because a tendency for most people is to focus on the content of their thoughts, the story or the drama of their images, if they're thinking images. 
And in mindfulness meditation, we like to say that the content is generally not very important. 
So we're actually going to do something different than most people habituated themselves to do. 
We're allowing ourselves to think, but we're going to focus on other aspects of the thought besides the content. 
So it's like listening to someone speaking a foreign language you don't know. 
So you can't know what the content or what they're saying is, but you can pick up the tone of voice. 
You can pick up the emotional mood that's in it. 
You can pick up how loud or soft the voices are. 
You can find out how fast they're speaking or how slow they're speaking. 
There's all kinds of other aspects of the speech that you can be aware of besides the content. 
So the same thing is true for our thinking. 
We can become aware more than just the content. 
And that becomes a more holistic awareness. 
It's more open, taking in the full experience in a better way. 
And it's more difficult to get seduced by the content if you're able to take in the fuller experience of what's actually happening. 
So you might use very rudimentary kind of thinking and say, okay, now I know I'm thinking, let me try to feel more of it. 
What else is going on here? Am I thinking fast? Am I thinking slow? Is there a lot of energy in my thinking? So there might be some very, very simple thoughts that help you to connect and to see what's happening clearly. 
That's okay. 
Does that make sense? And so we make a distinction in meditation between discursive thinking and directed thinking. 
So discursive thoughts is when you tell ourselves a story, we're having a conversation, we're figuring out where you go on vacation. 
A directed thinking in this regard is thinking that is directed towards being attentive to what's happening. 
But very, very simple. 
It's not analytical. 
It's not like saying, oh, I'm thinking about my high school sweetheart who wasn't so sweet. 
In fact, she was kind of bitter. 
And why do I keep choosing partners like that? And I must be something wrong with me. 
So you're thinking about what's happening at present moment. 
You're thinking about your high school sweetheart, but you're analyzing and analyzing yourself. 
You're thinking. 
Whereas this directed thinking is very, very simple. 
It's like, what does it feel like to be thinking this way? I keep thinking about certain things, but how does it feel for the body? Physically, what's it like when I keep thinking about this? Because if thinking is strong, you're going to feel it in the body. 
There's some place in the body where that thinking is usually as energized or it might be like people really think hard. 
Their eyebrows go together and tight. 
Or they put their hands up in the mouth and they're thinking like, what's going on here? And there's a physical aspect that comes into play when we engage in thinking. 
And so if you can feel the physicality of thinking, that gives you a way of being present for thinking without getting involved in the content, the story. 
Does that make sense? For me, when I really get involved in thinking a lot, I feel pressure or tension behind my forehead between my ears, kind of in my skull someplace. 
And I call it my thinking muscle. 
And so then I'll relax that. 
Relax the thinking muscle. 
And when I relax that thinking muscle, then I'm less likely to think. 
The other thing you can notice when there's a lot of thinking is incessant thinking tends to be fueled by emotions. 
And so it's almost as if emotions are the factory for persistent thoughts. 
So you can look around and see what's the emotion that's connected to this kind of thinking. 
So for example, planning, 90% of the time when people are planning a lot of meditation, they're anxious. 
And so I like to think of the thoughts then as kind of like a flag that says, hey, you, over here. 
But it is not the flag you're supposed to pay attention to. 
It's the factory. 
So you kind of drop down and feel the emotion out of which that's connected to the thinking. 
And if the emotion gets taken care of and acknowledged and settled, then there's less need to think. 
But if you're anxious and you're planning, you can let go of your plans forever, and that anxiety is going to pump out more plans. 
So you have to keep letting go. 
But if you can get to the factory and settle that, then it doesn't produce a lot more thoughts. 
So you can feel the physicality of thinking and you can feel the emotionality of thinking. 
And that's different than the content of what you're thinking. 
And so if the thinking is persistent, then you want to investigate or feel or be present for the emotion or the physical aspect of it. 
And so for the physical aspect, you're doing mindfulness of the body, which we talked about how to do. 
Just bring your attention to that part of your body and feel it. 
For the emotional part of it, you're doing mindfulness of emotions and feel the emotions of it. 
And generally, if you do that, it will settle down quickly and you can go back to your breathing. 
Or if it continues, you're doing very worthwhile mindfulness on the realm of thinking. 
It doesn't have to be a problem. 
You don't have to judge it or feel like you're doing it wrong. 
I'm not supposed to be thinking when I meditate. 
It's fine to think when you meditate as long as you develop this clear awareness that, oh, I'm thinking. 
And one way to test yourself to see if you're really clearly aware that you're thinking is use the naming, but use the naming emphatically. 
Thinking in your mind. 
Thinking, I'm really thinking. 
And that's a way of kind of pulling yourself out of the world of thoughts onto that dry river bank and not be glued to the thought. 
Just pull back, pull back until you're free of it. 
Is this making some sense? Now, it might sound complicated, all this, some saying. 
The idea is to keep it really simple. 
The idea is simply to be aware of what is. 
And if what is is thinking, bring your attention to the thinking. 
As you're aware of what's. 
. 
. 
Shall thinking be aware of what's obvious around thinking. 
The physicality of it, the emotionality of it. 
Just be there, be with it. 
Be very attentive that you're not turning it into a problem. 
I shouldn't be, it should be different or something. 
Just be there. 
And when it finally settles or no longer compelling, no longer grabs you, then you can go back to your breathing. 
Does that make sense? So, do you have any questions about that before we do our second meditation? Does that seem clear enough? It's kind of as it described again in the handout that's there. 
You can read some of this again. 
What we're going to do now is not exactly a mindfulness meditation. 
It's in the area of mindfulness. 
But it's really meant to be a guided tour of what thinking is like for you. 
To look at thinking from many different angles. 
So you can start getting a sense of the full experience you have of thinking. 
And many people, you know, have never really noticed what this phenomenon of thinking is really about for them. 
It just kind of gets pulled into the content, the thoughts, the ideas, and get lost in them. 
So, take a meditation posture. 
And then gently close your eyes. 
And take a few long, slow, deep breaths. 
As you exhale, settling into your body, into your seat. 
And then let your breathing return to normal. 
And take a minute or so just to hang out with your breathing. 
Feeling being with your body, the breathing body. 
And then as you're thinking, if you think, bring your awareness to it. 
Allow yourself to think. 
But be mindful of the fact you're thinking. 
Be aware that it's happening. 
And if it goes away, just wait until it comes back. 
And as you're thinking, do you tend to think more in words, or do you tend to think more in images? If you think in words, is there an inner voice that speaks them, or is there an inner book where their words are spelled out? And is there any sense of a location for where the words are spoken, or the speaker where they get projected from? It doesn't have to be, but is there a location for your thinking? Or if you think in images, is there some general or vague sense of a place or location for where those images appear? And as you think, what's the general amount of energy that you're even thinking? Is the thinking energetic and strong? Is it weak and soft? Does it feel tired? Does the thinking feel or seem alert and clear? Are there any emotions or moods or attitudes connected to your thinking? And if there is an emotion or a mood or an attitude, is there some place in your body where you tend to feel that state more than others? As you think, is there any pressure or tension or energy associated with your thinking somewhere in your body? As you're thinking, how strong is your interest in your thoughts? How strong is the attraction between you and your thoughts? Are you kind of glued to your thoughts or are the thoughts kind of in a distance? Awareness is free, it's kind of on the river bank, and you can just watch the thoughts go by. 
Are there any gaps between your thoughts, any space between the end of one thought and the beginning of the next? If the next sentence makes sense for you, see if you can notice what goes on, what's present beyond the edges of your thoughts. 
Do your thoughts fill the entire universe? Or are there parts of you and parts of the experience beyond the edges of what you're thinking? And then as you exhale, see if you can relax your thinking muscle. 
Relax the tendency or drive to think. 
And redirect your attention to your breathing. 
Feeling, sensing the body's experience of breathing. 
And every time you exhale, letting go of your thoughts so you can let go into the body breathing. 
And then you can take a few long, slow, deep breaths and really feel your body and feel yourself here in this room against the chair or your cushion. 
And when you're ready, you can open your eyes. 
So if the human body is a pyramid, then the bottom layer, bottom half, which provides stability to the pyramid, is the physical body. 
And the next, almost the rest of the next half of the pyramid to the top, to the point, would be the emotions, the moods and attitudes. 
And then the top little piece of the triangle, the top of the pyramid, where the dollar has a subtle eye, that would be the world of thinking. 
If our being is placed with the base on the ground, solid and firm, then the whole pyramid is stable. 
But if you take the pyramid upside down and try to balance it on its point, the ability to keep it stable is very small and it will fall over pretty soon. 
If we lead our life with our thinking, then we have the pyramid upside down. 
And the world of thinking, surprisingly, is not a world of much stability. 
But if we lead with our body and really connect to our body, kind of live in our body, feel our body, be embodied as we go through life, then we have a stability, we have an anchor, where it's a lot more difficult to be pushed around and to fall over and lose our equanimity, lose our balance. 
And so to have the bodies in Buddhist meditation is really important. 
We're learning to be embodied as much as we're learning to be mindful. 
Bodyfulness more than mindfulness. 
Bodyfulness means to be aware with your body and feel stable and grounded here. 
And then the thoughts, they're just a small. 
. 
. 
Thinking is kind of insecure, so we give it a good place in the top. 
It gets to be in the top. 
So you're okay. 
We'll take care of you, you get the good view. 
So you can kind of relax. 
But we tend to overvalue our thinking. 
Thinking is a very important part of life. 
So it certainly deserves a lot of respect. 
But the amount of time human beings tend to spend in thinking tends to be more than it deserves and more than it's helpful. 
And they get the right balance back of being kind of rooted in the body and then have thinking kind of supported by this firm body makes a whole different kind of life. 
So in that exercise we did, if I asked you the different questions about your thinking, was there anything that was useful for you to notice about yourself that you feel like you can share here? Anything that was helpful you think might have been helpful for you? I did not know that I thought in pictures. 
Is it a little bit louder, please? I did not know that I thought in pictures. 
Ah, so now that you know, how is that helpful, you think? I don't know. 
You'll find out now. 
So it's a big surprise? It was a big surprise. 
I'm a word person. 
So the advantage of knowing is that if you don't know, then it's kind of not really connected, not really seeing what's going on or where what's going on. 
And so it's hard to be mindful in a clear way. 
But once you know you're thinking in the images, then it's easier to say, oh, there it is, I see it. 
I know it, I'm aware of it. 
And if you're clearly aware, then we tend to not be glued to it or caught entangled in it. 
Great, thank you. 
Yes? I just noticed that I use both. 
But with the picture, I could recognize that right away and go back to the breathing. 
But the discursive thinking, I think, goes on for quite a while before I see it. 
Ah, so when you couldn't go back and you're talking out with it, what did you learn about it? I need to meditate more. 
Great. 
It's just something to look at for now. 
Okay. 
A question which I didn't ask, which I usually do when I do this exercise, is ask people, what's the tone of the voice that's doing the inner thinking? There's a voice, what's the tone of the voice that's doing the inner thinking? Some people, like their eyes pop open and they go, I have no idea how harsh I am or how frightened it always is or something. 
Sometimes people see in images, they have no idea that all the images were dark. 
So anybody else that saw something or discovered something interesting for yourself? Yes, Kate over here on the stage. 
Yeah, when you asked about where the voice or images were placed, I found it very strange that I thought about the narrator back here. 
Sure. 
He was behind my head and then it kind of freaked me out a little bit. 
Like it was God or something and it's not. 
Did you ever see Wizard of Oz? You know, so it's like pulling the curtain more than seeing God. 
Oh, it's a little guy back there, a little gal. 
And part of it, it's not so much, don't believe it's like a person there or some of your hearing voices, but rather it's by knowing a location, it's another way of kind of not being caught in its grip or being fooled by it. 
It's like stepping, oh, there it is. 
I see it and then it can be there and I'm here and I'm free of it. 
I don't have to take it so seriously, but we don't know where it is. 
Then it kind of has a way of meshing itself in it. 
Then I guess they have this word, journalists who are embedded. 
So then the thinking is embedded in us. 
But if we can see where it is, we're no longer embedded and we're kind of a little bit distinct from it. 
Okay, so if some of you have this seem too complicated, all this in this exploration, just leave it here, forget about it. 
Because it's supposed to be simple. 
But it may be this kind of showed you a way to be mindful of thinking, hopefully in a simple way, that gives you a chance to connect to it, a bigger picture of what it is or more of what it is than just the content. 
Because that's the primary place that people tend to get entangled with their thinking or to get involved in it, get on the boat, is by paying attention to the content of what you're thinking about. 
And if you can see other aspects of the experience, then it's easier to be disentangled, pulled back, and let it kind of drift away or lose interest or see, this is not worth thinking about. 
I'm better off just being present with my breathing and I can do that later or something. 
So next week was our last class. 
I'll do a little review. 
Hopefully it's to make it all simple and straightforward about how we do it. 
We'll do a guided meditation that covers all these different aspects. 
And then I'll talk about how we can bring this into our daily life. 
And it's very, very rewarding to bring what we're learning in meditation about how to be present into the rest of our life. 
In fact, in some ways, that's the whole point of all this. 
It's not just a sit and becomes peaceful and calm, but be able to bring some of the higher quality of how to be present into our life. 
The line between meditation and not meditation is an arbitrary line. 
So at some point, it's very nice to be interested in extending this out into our life. 
And then I'll also talk about how to go deeper into the practice, ways of going deeper into the mindfulness, and how the deeper realms of mindfulness gives birth to wisdom, and how wisdom becomes part of this whole mindfulness practice. 
So thank you all. 
And please don't. 
. 
. 
I hope that this whole mindfulness of thinking, with time, some of you might take a while, that in good time, you'll become friends with your thoughts. 
That they're not your enemy. 
But they become your good friend. 
You can drop them if you don't need them, or you can let go of them if they're not being helpful. 
You're kind of a mastery over them. 
But really, you become a friendly relationship between you and your thoughts, and your thoughts and you. 
May your thoughts become your friends. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
.
