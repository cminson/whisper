 breathing and mindfulness of your body. I'd be curious to hear if there's any questions about the practice so far or your experience or if any of you would like us to report how it's going. Please consider it to be a precious opportunity, the opportunity to be able to ask questions. That's when I've been very busy like that and I feel like there's no way I can find time to meditate. That's when I need to meditate the most. And there's some kind of almost magic. I don't know how it works. Because the mind is so tricky and we get caught up with our preoccupations and what has to be done and all that. And we think there's no space. But if we create a little bit of space for ourselves just to be present, just to be in a very simple way and the way we are in meditation, it tends to spread off into the rest of our life and it becomes like a lubricant. And I actually find that I can actually end up doing more or just as productive if I give myself that time to have an hour to sit and create kind of a little bit more spacious feeling for myself and for what I do. I find it's very helpful. But it's very compelling. The demands of all that we have to do in daily life are so compelling at times. It can seem like it's ridiculous to take the time to do anything like meditation. So the next time it happens like that, you might actually experiment and stop and meditate and see if it's really the case or if it's just a belief you have. I think a large part of it was to get renewed in meditation. I would imagine that after doing a while that whatever that situation again would be a little easier than it was last time. Easier to do it, yes. I mean it's easier to get yourself in the cushion in that sense. But once you start recognizing the benefits of it, then the great compelling compulsion to kind of continue with all our activities won't dominate because we realize, wait a minute, there's another way here and the other way is valid and is actually very helpful. So then it balances the compulsion. Many of us are very compulsive and meditation is a great antidote to compulsiveness. When I was at training in the monastery, I was in the kitchen for a week, for a month, for a year, working in the kitchen. In the Zen monastery, the meals have to be served exactly on the right second. Zen monasteries are very strict about the schedule and they have all these bells that happen. This bell happens at the heart of the monastery and this gong happens over here and that means this has to happen and therefore the food has to show up. So it's all very precise. And so there's major consequences if the lunch is late. So you don't want to have a lunch late in the monastery. The lunch is served at 12.30 or so. I don't remember exactly the time, but 12.30, it's very precise. And you have to have the food hot and ready at a certain point, certain time. So the whole ritual, because it's a whole very ritual way to eat in Zen Buddhism. But then, so you can imagine, it's all just work to try to get food out. And during the summer at Tassahara, there's two lunches you have to get out. You have to get a lunch out for the guests and you have to get the lunch out for the students. The summer is a little bit more relaxed the time, but in the winter time it's very precise to the second. So to say it's 12.30, lunch has to be served up. And so 20, 30 minutes before people are quite busy, as we often are, in deadline for a meal. And every day at 12 o'clock, absolutely, everybody has a stop in the kitchen for five minutes and do this Buddhist chant. The Buddhist chant, you know, it's not helping you stir the soup or chocolate vegetables. The Buddhist chant is a Buddhist chant, it doesn't do with food directly. So we can't do it. We have to get the food out, we're late, and no one can do it and everybody gets uptight. We can't do it and you feel all this resistance. It's time to do the chant. And so many times I was a kitchen foreman for nine months and I'm responsible for getting the food out in time. And oh, I can't, it's impossible. So I would always stop and we'd all stop. And it was just amazing. It didn't matter. Or it actually helped. Somehow the food always came out in time, even though we felt we absolutely could not stop, it was impossible to stop. And so I'd encourage you, if you found yourself, those times when you find your life overwhelming with activities, too many things you have to do, that's maybe the time you most need to stop and take time out. Yes? Well, as you know, I've been coming for a long time to hear you and prior to that I was with Bob Stahlholz group and I'm finally getting to the point where I can actually do that. And that's been a couple of years now. Or will that be? I'm still finding that every morning when I wake up I get out of there and I'm completely at work already. But I sit and the first 40 minutes is just planning, planning, planning. And then finally somehow it seems to sort of stop. Or even if it doesn't, when I get out of the whole time, stay in mind. So the compulsiveness you wake up with is quiet now. But sometimes it takes a whole setting. It's wasted. How many of you find your life at times could be called compulsive? I think it's an infectious disease of this part of the, I think our society, the society in this area here. And it is infectious in many ways. We feed it to each other or we affect each other, influence each other a lot. And it's not particularly healthy. Yes? I guess my experience has been in the last week or so I seem to be concentrating quite a bit on my posture and what's going on in my body as opposed to my breathing. Like I find myself not coming back to my breathing for five minutes at a time. It's not necessary to do the breath at all. What's happening with mindfulness practice is we're cultivating the ability to stay in the present moment, to be here, here for what's happening for us right now, to be in our lived experience rather than in the virtual world of our compulsions or our thoughts or our preoccupations or our memories or planning the future or whatever. We often, many of us have a great amount of investment. It's a good word in our thoughts and our preoccupations. And it takes us away from our lived experience right now. Mindfulness is mostly about coming back and being in the midst of our lived experience to bring presence and mindfulness and recognition of what's happening now. The breath is a tool for that to come back, but you don't have to stay with the breath. If you can stay in your lived experience and some other aspect of what's happening in the present, you don't have to pay attention to your breath at all. So if your physical experience, your bodily experience is more compelling or more pronounced than your breath, then the instructions you stay with that more pronounced experience of the body. And that can be the whole period of meditation. You can do a whole period of meditation and never once pay attention to your breath. If your bodily experience is more pronounced and you're able to stay present in the present for those experiences. Does that make sense? Yes. I had a new experience. I was paying attention to my posture while meditating. And I noticed that I was kind of slumping and I thought, my first impulse was to correct my posture. And I thought, no, I'll sit with it in a moment. And it was interesting because I got this rush of feeling that, oh no, I have to correct my posture. Everything's going to fall apart. And I sat with that a little bit longer and I realized how I do that with just about everything else I do. I have to keep control over it. And I'm not able to just sit with it. Let it be. That was a real eye opener. That's profound. And there's a way in which meditation is not really so different from the rest of our life. It becomes, as we settle into it, for many people, a microcosm of our rest of our life. Or the attitudes which subconsciously run a normal life stand out and get highlighted in the process of meditation. It's part of the great usefulness of mindfulness meditation. That's what happened to you. And also what you said points to the fact that it's very useful to do the practice in the context of not trying to change anything that happens. And allow things to happen. So if your posture slumps or changes, not to be in a hurry to change it back. Because then you're involved in changing. You're the agent of change rather than allowing things to be and see what unfolds. So in terms of having a good posture, I say two or three times in the course of a sitting you might adjust your posture. But if you find yourself slumping or leaning or something, you might spend some time just hanging out with what that's like in your body. What the slump or what the leaning feels like. And go into those muscles that are contracted or the muscles that are loose or compressed or whatever. And just sense it and feel it. And two things might happen. One is you start letting go of our control and we learn it's possible to accept our present reality as it is as opposed to compulsively always changing it. And we also learn that there's kind of innate wisdom of the body perhaps that will process itself if we can find some way to get out of the way. So for example, sometimes you see this with posture. Sometimes if people start slumping in their posture and then you go in and feel where the slump is happening. Maybe it's how it's happening because there's kind of a tightness in the front of the body pulling you down. And you feel that tightness and just feel it. You don't have to change it or let go of it. The mindfulness creates, it's kind of like it creates a room in which things which you had before have been really constricted have a chance to unfold. So when you bring your attention to something which is constricted, it creates space for it. So if you bring your attention to the tightness in the front of your body, it gives a chance for that tightness to begin to unravel. And you'll find that your posture will straighten up by itself sometimes. And it's not your doing, it's the wisdom of the body's doing. And learning that there's deeper wisdom than your little ego's idea of who's in charge is actually quite profound and lends itself to a kind of trust and relaxation that allows deeper wealth springs of wisdom to act in our life. Yes? Granted I've only been doing this for a week, but I found myself really looking forward to it. It wasn't a struggle to meet this. However, I did notice that I had a lot of dreams, or at least dreams that I remember, significantly more training. That happens, yes. It doesn't happen to everyone, but to some people that happens and to appreciate it. I could say more, but probably just leave it as it is. It's fine, you don't have to worry about it. But you can appreciate that perhaps the deeper movements of your life are showing themselves. And one of the tenets of Buddhism is it's much better to be aware than it is to be numb. It's much better to be aware of something that exists, a movement within you, than it is to let it go unaware. That functions in many areas, certainly our subconscious areas of our life. There's a lot of things going on, and to be aware of that is better than letting it continue going on unconsciously. It's also with bodily tensions. When people meditate, often bodily tensions will reveal themselves. Sometimes people will say, oh my God, this is terrible, I feel pain in my shoulders and my neck. This is not good, and so I better stop what I'm doing, or maybe I'll have a glass of wine, or do whatever I do to numb out, to avoid it. If what you're doing is numbing out and avoiding the tension in your body, that in Buddhism is considered to be to actually add to greater tension and stress and suffering. But if you're bringing awareness to it, that's actually healing, a very, very, very important process to bring awareness. So some people prefer to be numb, because not to be numb is to be sensitive to pain, either emotional or physical or whatever, for some people. And many of us recoil from any kind of pain, because we have a lesson. Somehow we've got the lesson that pain is in and of itself bad, and no one should get close to it. And the Buddhist approach to pain is that, I mean, usually a common sense, but a lot of it arises out of our deeper psychological and emotional life. And to wake up to those and bring our attention, our loving, compassionate attention to the pains of our life is much more valuable than avoiding it by numbing out. So if some of your dreams are a little bit uncomfortable, there's still a way of appreciating it. Yes? I've had some interesting experiences with thoughts, and I've noticed frequently when I'll be going from one place to another, thoughts that just randomly come up are mostly about worries, but am I going to get this done? And then also become aware of, like, I have a project to do and I need to think about this project, so now I need to do constructive thoughts about planning and thinking about contingencies and things like that. So I, and I tell myself, well, training myself basically, you know, to not have so many thoughts, but I say, now I need to think, just have constructive thoughts, and do this. And it's kind of interesting to see the different kinds of thoughts. That's very, very much. Next week we'll talk much more about thoughts and how they incorporate them in the field of mindfulness. One of the interesting things about thoughts is, who's in control? Are any thoughts in control or are you in control, in a sense? When you sit to meditate, do you have an ability to stop thinking about your plans when you're meditating, or are you swept up in the midst of it? You don't have to answer, but... I will, and it's sort of washing up, and I just sort of... Let them go. So for me, there are times in my life where I'll intentionally think about things, but I don't try to do that in meditation, because I don't want to be a slave to my thoughts and my compulsions. So when I meditate, I try to just sit there and open awareness, and sometimes I go for a walk when I'm driving or sitting at my computer or whatever. I'll do the kind of thinking that involves planning or whatever needs to be done. But it's more of my choice. Now I'm going to think, and now I'm not going to be very lost in my thoughts. Last one. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of a related point is that I sometimes think about a new thought occurs to me that I want to remember. And it's hard for me to let go of it because I want to remember it in the end of the sentence. Well, I know some teachers will say we should have... You can have a pad of paper next to you, and just jot on a little note so you can let go of it, because then you can wake up from your... At the end of your sitting, you can kind of refer to it and it all comes back. So that's one way to do it. I think that there's sometimes a creative side to meditation. People get somewhat settled and calm and somewhat concentrated. That concentrated ability of the mind gets focused on particular ideas, and the mind can be actually more creative in its stillness than it is in normal life. And then there can be an attachment to that creativity, to those ideas. And it's up to you to do what you want to do about that. But if you want to use this meditation practice for the potential it has within it, for full liberation, for really to discover what it's like to have a heart and a mind that's really free, you don't want to succumb to the temptation or the attachment to even hold on to good ideas. There's nothing which you want to... You want to train the heart so the heart can actually find a way to feel comfortable regardless of what's happening, and not having to get on board anything that happens. That's a training. So if you want to participate in that training, you want to also do that with those wonderful thoughts. Learn that letting go there too. If you don't want to do the training so thoroughly, then you can do all areas except for the most wonderful thoughts. So let's do a sitting. So take a comfortable but alert posture. And then softly close your eyes. And then take a couple of deep breaths. And as you breathe out, let go and settle into your posture. And then let your breath breathe itself in whatever way it wants. And then take a couple of moments now to discern what is the basic emotional state that you sit with. What is the mood or mental state that's present right now? Are you calm or agitated? Happy or sad? And then very softly, if you can recognize a mood or a mental state or emotion, very, very softly acknowledge it by naming it with some approximate name. Allowing it to be there. And take a few moments to just sense and feel what it's like to have this mood be present for you. Where in your body is that emotional state most manifested? Where is it clearest in your body? It's in the head or the torso, the hands, the stomach. Simply feeling the emotion, however subtle it might be, allowing it to be there. And then having acknowledged it fully, then turn your attention now to your breathing. As we breathe, there are sensations of the body breathing which inform us that we're breathing. There are sensations of movement, of tingling or expansion, contraction, pressure, tautness, sensations of loosening or letting go. Let your awareness sense those sensations of breathing, being aware of what it feels like for the body itself to experience its breathing. Allowing it to be there. Allowing it to be there. Allowing it to be there. Allowing it to be there. Allowing it to be there. The basic attitude of meditation is to allow all things to be as they are. There's a sense of allowing while staying present, staying aware of what is actually happening. Mindfulness is tremendously forgiving, accepting. Allowing it to be there. Allowing it to be there. Stress or tension that's sometimes experienced when we sit and meditate is often a sign of holding back, of resistance. See if you can let go. Yield yourself into what is happening. Yield yourself to the experience of breathing. Allowing it to be there. Allowing it to be there. Allowing it to be there. When the mind drifts off in thought and you notice it, come back again to the breath, letting the breath be the anchor to the present moment. Allowing it to be there. Allowing it to be there. Allowing it to be there. If it's easy, you can relax your stomach, soften the belly to give a little bit more freedom to your breathing. Allowing it to be there. Allowing it to be there. And then in the last minutes of the sitting, notice again what is the most predominant mood or emotional state that's now present for you. Alert, calm, anxious, restless, angry, content. It may be very subtle, but everyone was sitting with some emotional state, their mood, mental state. And if you can discern what it is, can you notice what is the experience in your body that most clearly tells you that this emotion or mood is present? If there's apprehension, maybe the stomach is tight. If there's calmness, maybe the breathing is smooth. If there's resentment, maybe the jaws are tight. If there's happiness, maybe there's an upwelling in the heart. You notice what physical experience informs you of the mood or mental state that you have. Maybe a tightness in the head. And if you can find some physical manifestation of the mood or emotion, very softly, tenderly bring your attention to that physical manifestation. Just to sense it and feel it, to create room around it, to allow it to be there. Noticing what happens as you do so. And then come back and just be with your breathing for three or four cycles. If you can feel it, please feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to start feeling free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to fuck up feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free to feel free As a religion, Buddhism is concerned with the sense with what is sacred. Perhaps a better word in Buddhism is the word holy, what is holy. And the particular Buddhist take on sacredness is not to find it outside of our normal life or everyday life or normal experience, but rather what is sacred or what is special, holy for Buddhists is this life as it's lived, this life here right now, when there's no sense of separation or barriers or boundaries within it, or say better, when there's nothing which is excluded from awareness. It's the awareness that can hold everything, the awareness that has no resistance to things, the awareness it doesn't judge or condemn or hold on to things and it doesn't have any boundaries that this is appropriate and this is inappropriate for awareness. That is when the world becomes sacred in Buddhist terms. It doesn't mean that in other realms we can't judge or say no or say yes to things, but in the realm of awareness itself we want to have an awareness which has no divisions, nothing which is outside of what's permissible, outside of what we're going to become aware of that's not permitted. One definition of mindfulness is it's unconditional and total permission to feel everything. Then once we can feel, once we're fully aware and have an awareness which is open, then we can decide wisely what we want to do in different situations. We might then vocally or intentionally kind of make decisions or wise decisions whether it's appropriate or not, different things. In the field of awareness, awareness can stay open. Many of us create divisions in our life. There's parts of our lives that we don't pay attention to and parts of our life that we select out and are kind of obsessed by. Some people are obsessed by work and that's all they think about and they don't notice their family or they don't notice their neighbors, they don't notice their own physical health, for example, and so they're living an imbalanced life. Some people only know they notice their emotions and what's happening in the world with their emotions is the most important central event in international news. The whole experience of life and how they relate to others and themselves happens through the lens of the particular emotion they happen to feel at this particular moment. There's a way in which this particular emotion has some kind of absolute truth to it and we forget the fact that three hours earlier it was a different emotion that's the absolute arbitrator of how things should be. Some people select that, that other people select away from their emotional life and have no sense of what their emotions are at all. They don't have any even emotional vocabulary to talk about what their emotions are and they don't notice it. For example, myself, hopefully many years ago now, I was a person who wasn't supposed to get angry and having that kind of self-image made it that I would not recognize anger when I was angry. I'm not an angry person, not my angry, because it was outside of what I permit myself to be aware of because if I felt it, it would in a sense go against the image I had of myself. So some people are completely out of touch of what's going on in the physical body and so they kind of treat the body as just kind of bulldozer to get around life with. But as long as the bulldozer has a lot of fuel in it, here we go. And that also is a little bit my approach to meditation or life many years ago. I thought the body was something you just brought along with you and got in the way and made things more difficult. You sit and meditate and the knees hurt, legs hurt and that was too bad and I would just kind of try and ignore it because meditation wasn't about paying attention to painful knees, it was about great cosmic bliss. So it was a part of my experience that I considered to be outside the scope of awareness, my physical pain, in preference for some other kind of so-called ideal ideal that I had. It's all too easy for us to compartmentalize our life, to separate things out, what we pay attention to or are willing to pay attention to, what we're not willing to, what we're afraid to, pay attention to, what we resist paying attention to. And what we're trying to do in mindfulness practice is to break down or soften all those compartments so that at least our awareness is willing to be open and allowing and accepting of whatever happens to us. In the process of doing this, one of the places that we come to is to pay attention to our emotional life. Our emotions are a very important part of our life and as we open up the awareness to be all encompassing, emotions are included as part of that. And what we're trying to find, I think, in a mindful life is a kind of a balanced approach to the emotions, not one that pushes them off and denies them and not one that with emotions are what has control of our life and running our life. But some kind of balance, we can see what our emotions, we can allow them and respect them, but they have their own proper place in the full range of our humanity of who we are. There's an image I like to use for this practice and that's the image of a spider in a spider's web. And the way it works is that a spider sits at the center of the web and just sits there, mindful, alert, I suppose, until something happens somewhere on the web. And when something happens elsewhere on the web, the spider leaves the center and attends to what's happened there on the web, you know, if it's a fly, it eats it. And then when it's finished, it goes back to the center. We do this with our, this is how the practice works. And then we sit in the middle of the mandala, the web of our life, by placing our attention on our breathing, we're letting our breath be the center. And we sit and just sense and be with the breath the best we can. The mind, of course, wanders away to whatever thoughts it has. And then we come back again to the breath. We're training ourselves to be present and to relax with our breathing. Very simple matter of fact kind of thing. It's such an order later, something's going to happen to us, something's going to happen on our mandala and they're well on our web of experience. When something happens that's more pronounced than our simple ability to be with the breath, then our practice is to let go of the breath and attend to that which is occurring that's more pronounced. And we attend to it. We usually don't eat it, but we attend to it and pay attention to it. And one of the differences with analogy doesn't work is that for the spider, the center of the web is always a center, a physical center. But for us, we take the center with us. Our center is our awareness really. And so we just bring our center along to whatever is now pronounced somewhere else on the web. So that can be many different things. It can be our physical experience, which we talked about last week. If there's strong physical experience or a strong sound that's more pronounced than our ability to kind of pay careful attention to the breathing, then we let go of the breath and we bring our attention and place that in the center of that physical experience. Or that's listening, listening, listening or whatever's going on in the body. If it's an emotional experience and the emotional experience is the most pronounced thing, then the practice is to let go of the breath or let go of the physical experience and attend to the emotion, bring our attention carefully to the fact that we have this emotion, to explore it and get to know it better. And when it's no longer predominant or pronounced, then we come back to our breathing. And the idea is to kind of find a way to be with our emotions that respects them, that allows them to be there and doesn't judge them, doesn't try to push them away and doesn't indulge in them, doesn't try to hang on to them or fuel them in different ways, but simply allow them to be there in their own glory, in their own kind of simplicity, just allow them to be there. I call this uncomplicated emotions. They have uncomplicated presence for our emotions as it is. Many of us have complicated relationships. And because we feel guilty, we feel deflated and we get depressed. And then we get depressed and then we get discouraged. And then we think, well, I'm a meditator, I shouldn't be discouraged, I'm supposed to know better. And then we feel another round of guilt. There's all these complicated ways, reactions and relationships we have to our emotions. What we're trying to do in the practice, this idea of kind of allowing things to be there in their kind of full, in their full fullness is to allow them to be there just in and of themselves in their own simplicity. Anger. How can anger be there without me judging my anger? Joy. Can joy be there without me trying to hold on to it or try to get it again? Just allow things to be. If there's experience, so last week I talked about the foreground and background of experience. If there are emotions that are in the background of your experience, they're kind of there but they're not really that pronounced. You're kind of aware they're there but mostly you can stay with your breathing. Just stay with your breath. It'll be really simple. But when an emotion comes into the foreground of your experience, that's when you leave the breath and you attend to the emotion. You get to know it. So in this meditation we just did, I asked you at the beginning and the end to check in and see if you can notice what your mood or emotional state might be and to hang out with it a little bit and allow it to be there and see what it was like. At the end I asked you to kind of notice where in the body that was housed, that emotion. I'm curious what happened to some of you. What did you notice? Well my emotion changed. I started off feeling happy. And then at the end I just feel just calm. So you noticed a difference between before and after? How many of you noticed a difference between before and after? What else did you notice? Yes. Great. Yes. It was a good thing. It felt like I was turning towards the center of the body. And not paying attention to the heartbeat, just paying attention to it as a regular thing where you're constantly focusing on it. But if the heartbeat is kind of the house, the seat of some strong emotion like fear, then for certain bring your attention there. I felt restless throughout the entire meditation and I was playing around with how you feel restless and not fight it, but not go with it either. To go with it would be to jump up and run around and do something like that. So sitting here right now, do you feel any of the restlessness still? I feel less restless. But do you feel some of it still? Yes. Close your eyes for a moment. And what part of your body is the rest of the most pronounced? I'd say it would be in the center of my back. And to feel it there, is it more on the surface of your back or deep inside? It's just to the right of my spine, fairly close to the surface. And how big of an area would you say it covers the back? About a centimeter wide and about four centimeters tall. And what is the sensation there that tells you that you're restless? Just a burning, something that says change something, something asking for change. But what was the actual sensation in the body? Not the message, but the sensation? Kind of a pulsation, a tightness. It seems white, I don't know what that means. Feel the tightness, allowing the tightness to be there. Bring your attention carefully to the tightness. And as you do that, what happens to the tightness? Does it get bigger or smaller? It gets smaller. So keep paying attention to the tightness and keep noticing what happens to it as you allow it to be there, but pay careful attention to it. It's increasingly difficult to find. And as it becomes more difficult to find, what's happening to the restlessness? Seems to transform into calmness. You can open your eyes. So that's what we do in the practice, is we bring, when there's anything like restlessness or any strong feeling, is we bring our careful attention to it. First, just allowing it to be there as it is itself, then to feel it in the body. Because almost all emotions are all feelings, are feelings they're actually experiencing in the body itself. And so you bring it, one way to bring careful attention to an emotion is to actually feel its physical manifestation. And then bring very careful, even loving attention to it, accepting attention to it, and then notice what happens. And something interesting will happen. You said earlier that you said you felt you were emotion. The word emotion has the word motion in it. The E of emotion means out, moving out, things are moving. And what our emotions are, what they want to do is to be moving in process. Often what happens in our life, because of our attachments or our fears or resistance, we tend to freeze our emotions. So for example, resentment is frozen anger. And many emotions can be frozen in different kinds of ways. And frozen because we are, you know, these things I talked about, in and of themselves, in and of themselves, they are frozen. The ways in which we relate to them that freezes, freezes them. So as we begin bringing careful attention, this attention that makes room for them, allows them to be there. That room allows them to begin moving in the way they want to move. Sometimes they'll get softer and disappear. Sometimes they'll get stronger. And that's quite appropriate. Sometimes your emotions or your physical experience will get quite strong. And that's the direction it needs to take in order to process itself. And your job is simply not to create anything or have an expectation, but simply to allow whatever's to happen to happen as you bring careful attention to it. And some experiences will become a lot more manageable and a lot easier. Like yours, your restlessness was transformed to calm only by the power of your attention. It's nice. Other comments? Yes. I've worked with a center of gratitude and a healing. That's a constant result of one in which pain is needed. I've never thought about it in this realm, but it's giving full attention to pain and just to disappear. It's really amazing. It is quite something. But what we want to be very careful for is that we don't do the practice for the purposes of getting rid of our pain. You can do that and you can have that intention if you want. But what you lose then by doing it that way, this practice, is you lose something much more radically and more transformative, which is learning the ability to allow things to be as they are, even if it's painful. That's really a transformative thing to be able to learn. To learn to get rid of something can be helpful and empowering, but it could also very subtly add this notion that we're in control and that things should always be a certain way. They should always be painless. They should always be happy or always be joyful, always be a certain way. There's something actually much more radical about learning to let things be. But the paradox is if you bring that careful attention and letting things be, the pain often goes away. It's a little bit tricky. It's very easy to... It often happens with a practice like your experience of restless is going to come. And then the trick is that all of us will succumb to... All of us will... The temptation that all of us will succumb to is, ah, now I'll use mindfulness to change my experience into a better one. Am I making sense to you? I probably haven't convinced you about the usefulness of what I'm suggesting, the usefulness of just allowing things to be. So the practice is to allow things to be. Yes. Well, you might decide you don't need to anymore. And that's one possibility. The other possibility is when we can allow things to be there without our habitual reactions kicking in, then it's possible to make wise choices and act responsibly. And life often requires us to make decisions. But if we have discovered that zero point, we can allow things to be without compulsively or reactively kind of demanding them to change. We create some room for the situation. And in that room, where we're not kind of composed to respond, these other resources within us and around us have a chance to inform us and we might act responsibly. I have a question to that. I can pick out one decision that I have made in my lifetime that was a very, very difficult decision, but it was probably one of the smartest things I ever did. And then I seem to just lose energy for a while in my desire to have to make hard decisions, I guess. I've made so many for a certain phase of my life that I don't know if that happens to people, you kind of run out of energy and you have to restock a certain amount of core energy before you can go on to the next big thing. I can imagine that. However, I think that what tends to exhaust people is when we're caught up in our reactivity around things. And our relationship to it is complicated. And what mindfulness does is very relaxing and calming and invigorating because we learn to kind of not live from a reactivity, but in that spaciousness or in that room that we can create to allow these deeper well springs of wisdom and compassion to kind of come out of us in a sense. Yes. In terms of allowing things to be, might you fall asleep? Yes. Well, it depends. It depends. If it's not painful, you might just keep it, let it fall asleep. It's no problem. If it's painful and you can just bring your attention to it and let that become that computer meditation. Because you used to have an allowing presence for that. Just explore, get to know it. And instead of doing breath meditation, you're doing pain meditation. It's great. However, if you're getting discouraged and you find it really grueling and so that your mind keeps kind of wandering off and you find yourself lost in all kinds of thoughts and ideas and you're hating meditation, you're hating yourself, you're hating the teacher, you're hating the... At some point you cross the line where it's no longer useful and you can change your posture. But the basic approach is always is to allow things to be first. That's the basic strategy. And allow things to be while bringing our careful attention to it if it's pronounced. And then we try to negotiate and sometimes push our edge a little bit further than we think we can. I've seen, can I really stay with this? Rather than give in to my restlessness or give in to my aversion or can I know, can I notice what happens to me? Oh, here's that aversion. It's possible to have tremendous amount of physical pain and have a completely equinanimous mind, even a joyful mind. So the aversion and the hate and the contraction that we have around it are often quite extra. So you can actually kind of practice for a while with the discomfort and see if you can find that ability to be present for it in an allowing way. And when you feel like you've crossed some line, it's not useful anymore. Change your posture. Yes? You're talking about pain in the context of sitting when a pain arises. What about when you're having really bad pain and you're not in the middle of meditating? Well, that's up to you. Use your good sense. But one of the abilities, one of the usefulnesses of meditation practice is that this is the one realm in our life where we're really going to be serious about cultivating this ability to bring attention to our experience rather than bringing aspirins to our experience. And also we study our reactions and our relationships to what's going on. Then outside of meditation, when something important happens in our life, we can actually bring some of our skills we've learned in meditation to bear on that experience and react to it in a wiser way. So it might mean that, for example, someone has an operation. And is going to have an operation. And the doctor says, you know, this is going to be painful. I think I would like to give you pain medication. Fine. Most people would say fine to that. And the doctor says, and I'd like to give you valium. And you've had enough experience with being with yourself and being with your emotions and feelings, being with discomfort, being with your fear when fear arises, that you know how to be present for all these things, that you don't have to take valium. I think that's quite a wonderful thing, for example. Or at the end of the surgery, you might have enough kind of ability and grace around feeling some discomfort that you're willing to stop taking morphine or narcotic medication a little bit earlier so your mind can become clearer earlier. Rather than because of your fear of pain, take more and more and more. Just take it for longer than you really need to. So I don't know if those are good examples for you, but the skills you learn in meditation can really be helpful outside of meditation. And it's your decision about what actually you should do. But you might respond differently having a meditation background than you would if you didn't have one. But, you know, if sometimes it's important to go to a doctor if you have pain. You know, not just sit there and I'm going to allow all things to me. You know, that's stupid. I oftentimes feel restless and anxious like I do when I started this meditation. And I'll confine my thoughts, being focused on the future, what I could do an hour from now to an hour from now, whatever. And it seems to me that oftentimes what that does is it's helped me avoid feeling what I'm doing right now presently. So I guess my question is, do I put my attention to the anxiety and the restlessness which may contribute to me not focusing on what's happening now or do I notice and then come back to the present? I guess I kind of struggle with that. Well, don't struggle with it. Just you can just kind of make, you know, if you're not sure, you can just make the best guess you have or the most interesting guess or be playful, experimental with it. Sometimes stay with the restlessness. Sometimes just come back to what's really going on for you now. You know, what you're avoiding, just be with what you're avoiding. That's easy. However, in the pure practice, we pay attention to what's most pronounced in the moment. And if the restlessness is the most pronounced, the practice is not to go digging for what's under it, but just to be with the restlessness or the fear. And then as you learn to be with it, as an event in the present moment, it'll begin to kind of break up and soften, maybe even dissipate. And when it's soft and dissipated, lo and behold, what replaces it is what's really happening. So you don't have to be in a hurry to get to there. It'll come in its own good time. But this is what's very important to learn how to be with our experience, with our emotions, in our direct experience of them, rather than being in the story. Because we're planning, we're feeling anxious and we're planning into the future. It's very easy to get lost in the planning story. And that only fuels our avoidance of what's actually happening in the present moment. You have to step back from the story and actually be in the felt experience of planning. And the felt experience of planning is anxiety sometimes. Does that make sense? And so one of the things we do, a very important part of mindfulness of emotions, is to feel the physical manifestation of the emotion. And one of the reasons for that is not to avoid the emotion, but it actually allows us to be more present for the emotion without getting fueling the story. Because for many of us, there's a story behind an emotion. And we get hooked onto the story and off we go talking about who did what to who and what I'm going to do and what I should have done and all these things. And it's very compelling for us to be in the story, to drop down to the physical sensation of the emotion, the physical presence of the emotion in the body. The body is not a story, it's just what's happening in the present moment. So it's a way of being with the emotion without being in the cognitive part of it. And that's a very important part. Some people might argue, well, I'm not with the emotion, but actually the emotion and what happens in the body, it isn't like the emotion is separate from what's happening in the body. They're one and the same. The part of what an emotion is, is a physical sensation in the body. It's not a sensation, not separate from it. Makes sense? Yes. And how to have an awareness of the phenomenon that doesn't just become thought, thought, thought. Yes. When you asked about trying where the body of the emotion was, I found it was in my job. And there were two places I could go in that moment, and in that moment it happened that the job was just allowed to be the job. And it became a physical, vulnerable to gravity. And the idea of the job went away. So there's a different way of inquiring. Nondiscursively, right. And that's what, at least this training is a training in nondiscursive presence to our experience, and not thinking more about it. That's what it is. I don't know what to say. Next week we'll talk about thoughts, by the way. So meditation means you can't think. But what we also learn to do is to bring nondiscursive awareness to the process of our thinking. It's a very respectful way to do, think to do, to our thought process. So don't think until next week. I wanted to make a few more points about emotions. I want to talk a little more detail about how to include emotions as part of the meditation practice. So the first thing to say is that mostly we stay with the breath. We give some preference to the breath. But when an emotion becomes more pronounced in our ability to stay with the breath, then you just let go of the breath and be present for the emotion. Just feel it in the way I suggested during the meditation practice. There's four aspects to paying attention to emotions. You don't have to necessarily do these step by step, but I'll just lay them out. The first is to recognize that there is an emotion. I think for some people, recognizing the presence of an emotion is 99% of the work. Like, for example, me when I couldn't see my anger. It seems to recognize that, oh, I'm angry, oh, I'm happy, is quite something. I see myself, even still to this day, I see myself getting lost in an emotional response to something and all the thoughts associated with it. I've gotten onto the train, the train is going out of town, and I'm on it, but I'm not on it also, right? Because I'm here and the thoughts are already in Chicago. So it's to recognize what's going on, recognize the emotion. The second aspect is what I call acceptance or allowing it to be there. It's not condoning it or justifying it or anything. It's just in the field of awareness to allow it to be there without it having to be anything else. I sometimes call it respect, to respect that it's there. I like the word respect a lot because the word respect means to see again, literally, respect. And vipassana, which is a Buddhist word from insight, means almost the same. Vipassana means to see, and v means special or clear, so clear seeing. So to bring respect, and that's a hard one. Many of us have all these stories and some of us have manifestos about our emotions and what they mean, which is supposed to do with them. Some people are willing to die for their opinions about what to do with emotions. We're simply allowing it to be there in a very simple way. Just, oh, this is how I'm feeling, you don't have to feel bad or if you're a wrong person for having certain emotion. Can you allow it to be there? It's not so easy to allow emotions to be there. Therefore, it's also have to learn to allow yourself to be a person who doesn't allow emotions to be there very well. Maybe that was too convoluted, but it means, what it basically means is you're off the hook. You can be, you don't have to, whatever way you find yourself to be, it's okay. All we're doing is bringing awareness to that. Ideally, we try to let emotions be as they are. Practically many of you can't, so then we allow that to be. So it's very forgiving, it's a very compassionate practice, it allows you to be as you are. So the first thing is to recognize the emotion, the second is to allow it to be there, to accept it in some way. The third is to name it. In a very useful aspect of Vipassana practice, is to label or name our experience as it's happening. Very quietly, kind of in a soft kind of rhythm, we kind of name our experience. So if you're breathing, you name it in, out, or rising, falling, as the stomach rises and falls, or the chest rises and falls. If there's a pain in your knee, you might name it pain. If there's a sound of a bird, it's very pronounced and pulls your attention away from the breath, you just name it hearing, hearing. If there's an emotion, let's say there's sadness, you just name it sadness, sadness. And the naming is a way of using your thoughts to nudge your attention, to stay present for what's happening, rather than letting your idle kind of thoughts kind of go off into Chicago, which they'll tend to do. It's kind of using the thoughts to help you to be present, rather than your thoughts will just do whatever they want. It's a very useful tool. But with emotions, naming an emotion has another function. And it kind of works in the way that the myths or fairy tales of old worked. If you name the dragon, the dragon loses its power. Or in some traditional cultures where you're not supposed to name, you're not supposed to tell anybody because you tell them they have some power over you. There's a tremendous power in naming. And it isn't that we want to kind of let our, you know, it isn't that we want to kind of become emotional and neutral people by naming it away. But rather, what gets a weekend is our identification with it. We tend to get preoccupied and wrapped up in our emotions. And by a matter of fact, naming the emotion, part of who we are is kind of creating some space and room for the existence of that emotion at that moment. And that creation of self-realm means that part of you is not identifying with it so tightly. And it's the power of identification that gets weakened. And then the emotion will do whatever it wants to do because it's in process, right? Emotions are moving. So we want to get out of the way and let them move the way they want. So naming is very powerful and very useful. The fourth aspect of paying attention to emotions is to feel the emotion in the body, like I talked about. You might feel fear in your stomach or anger in your jaw or joy in your chest or in many different places you might feel it. So feel it in your body. And then to bring a careful, even tender attention, presence to that physical experience, allowing it to be there. If it's uncomfortable, we allow it to be there. If it's tremendously pleasurable, we allow it to be there. We don't fuel it or lean into it or we just allow it to be there. And then sense and feel what happens as we do that. And there's a wonderful, sometimes magic that happens around the physical manifestations of emotions as we bring our attention to the physicality of it. Sometimes it opens up to deeper things. Like for you, you talked about the anxiety. And so as you be with the anxiety and the anxiety begins, you feel it in the body, wherever it is, attention. And as attention softens, then a tremendous amount of grief comes up because maybe that's what you're trying to avoid. I don't know. Or you're feeling your restlessness and then all this calmness is what's under and comes up. You don't know what will happen. Having something happen, something particular happen is not the point. There is no particular experience, which is the point of mindfulness meditation. Now, maybe some of you are disappointed to hear that. There's no particular point, which is a point of mindfulness meditation. There's no particular experience, which is the point. And people come to meditation, they know the point of meditation is to get calm, to get joy, to have bliss. The point of mindfulness meditation is to cultivate the ability to be mindful, to have this allowing presence for whatever arises. It's kind of like to have this wonderful container. We as human beings are containers for our life, our life experience. What we're trying to do is to be an open container for our life experience and let whatever that experience be what it is. So that's why I say the point of the practice is not a particular kind of experience. So, recognition, acceptance, naming, and exploring the emotion in the body are kind of four aspects of this emotion. Now, you don't have to make it so complicated. You don't have to go through a checklist of whether you do these things. But as you kind of notice a strong emotion, you kind of bring your attention to it and begin feeling these different aspects of it and naming it. Some people don't feel much emotions when they're meditating and you don't have to worry about it. Don't worry about anything. Just pay attention to what's actually happening in your present experience. And then when the emotion has abated or no longer is compelling, then you can come back to your breath in a very simple way, just being with the breath until something else arises on your mandala. Is that clear? Do you have any questions around that? Yeah? The naming one is the one that kind of confuses me a little bit in that because the name is the concept, right? Or there's a concept behind the name. And those kind of get associated with the stories and stuff like that. So a lot of times I wonder, by naming, am I making something that isn't? It's like you sort of jump to conclude it's like, oh, that's sadness. And all of a sudden you start taking yourself down this path of what sadness is. And it's like you've been to everything in seven emotions. This is where you have to kind of know what your own experience is. If naming becomes more of a distraction, then just don't do it. It's unnecessary to do the naming. So if that's your tendency, maybe you don't want to do it. Or maybe what you do is you keep doing it and slowly with time you'll learn the ability to be present without having the particular name trigger all these associated thoughts. It's important to be accurate with your naming, the word that you choose. The function of the naming is not to have an accurate label. The function of the labeling is kind of to move you in that direction, your attention in that direction, keep your attention there. So sometimes if my mind gets very quiet and subtle, I won't name it with a name anymore. I'll label it with just a, uh-huh, just kind of acknowledging there. So if what's happening is resentment and you named it anger, it's okay. What you're trying to do mostly is to feel it anyway. The name isn't that important. The name is encouraging you to stay present. However, the dragon kind of aspect where you name the dragon and dragon loses its power, the more precise you can be with the naming there, the better it works. And you can actually have great precision with names. Some of us have very limited emotional vocabularies, but to develop a wider range, for example, to know the difference between anger and resentment and frustration, irritation and wrath and fury and rage. And there's a whole, there's a couple of dozen words we have that belong to the category of family of anger. And to actually be able to differentiate very carefully is actually gives us more clarity in the situation at times. But we don't want to develop that clarity by conjugating, thinking and analyzing and trying to figure out. The name should be the most simple, obvious, even generic thing you can come to. You might even just name it emotion. Yes. A couple questions. Could you say something about if the naming of the emotion may not be accurate and the emotion continues? And also, if the emotion does continue, is there a point or a way to determine that maybe that's enough and maybe then switch to something else? You could. Again, we want to be very careful not to succumb to the idea that something is supposed to happen when we do the practice. If I bring my attention to the emotion or if I name the emotion, it's going to become something different. We're bringing attention to our emotions in order to bring attention to our emotions. What we're cultivating and developing is our ability to be present, our ability to be the container, not to have something change. So it's fine to let an emotion be there for a long time. Let it be there for hours. Just keep noting it and be present for it. And then you get impatient and then the impatient becomes the meditation. And then the impatient stops and then you're back to the emotion. And then you feel despair that is still there. And then despair becomes the emotion. And then despair goes away and you're left with the emotion again. So it's very great. Just keep doing this. So you don't have to be very careful with that. However, your question was if you're naming it and the emotion stays the same, it doesn't change. Nothing happens. So it might not be a problem. You could also, if you want to stop naming it and just bring more gentle, tender attention to really feel it more fully. Sometimes the naming can function as a very subtle barrier holding a person back actually. So you might go with the naming to kind of... intimacy is the name of the game. So to really kind of yield yourself more fully to it. And sometimes some emotions can be very difficult, overwhelming. Some people feel at times. And the same thing as I talked about your knee pain, your pain of your leg, your leg falling asleep. Sometimes very strong emotions. We find ourselves getting lost in stories or kind of lost in it or kind of overwhelmed by it. And we find ourselves getting more and more caught up in the tummulate of emotions and feelings. And rather than becoming more present for it, we get more lost and more confused and more discouraged. If the emotion is really too painful or too difficult that way, then sometimes it's useful not to pay attention to it and just kind of leave it alone. Just kind of bow to it, respect its presence and come back to the breathing. Just be with the breath in a very simple way. Yes? I had laughter come up. What do you do with that, particularly if you're in a room of white people and it interferes with your brother? Well, that puts me... because I'm not so wise, in a little bit awkward position, how to respond. The pure response is as long as you're not indulging in it, as long as it's kind of spontaneous movement within you, then the instruction just allow it and be aware of it. And it most often comes up around crying. That happens more often than people want to cry rather than they want to laugh in meditation because a lot of people have just built up feelings like that crying kind of feelings. There are a few people who have built up laughter. I don't know why that is. And when people ask that question about crying, then I'm very clear and say, it's completely fine to cry in a meditation hall and it's not a problem. If you're crying so, you're wailing and sobbing so loud that the earth, the ground is shaking, then quietly kind of going outside and continue to crying outside is maybe a good idea. But if you're crying quietly, the people around you hear you, no problem. It only opens their heart. It's not a problem. So I would like to be able to say the same thing about laughter. But where my lack of wisdom or clarity comes up is actually I'm thinking maybe with laughter there should be a little bit more sense of restraint. And I should ask my teachers about that. So take the time being you can decide. If you're at home, laugh away. Yes. I think I see the importance of sitting in a particular time every day because certain things in my life happened this week when I would think to myself, so this really is kind of like a pressure cooker. I think I'll just meditate. And I can see that if I, is meditation that way, it's manipulative rather than accepting. So instead of running to meditate when things get emotional, if I meditate at the same time, then it just passes through me during this time. Right. Exactly. And if you sit every day, then it'll help in those situations. But more importantly, you're developing that ability to be the container for whatever actually shows up at any given day. Thank you. Very, very well said. So it's getting the last one. Yes. My experience of feeling my emotions come up when I meditate is I'm very good at controlling them. And in the past in meditating, I just sort of say, oh, well, there's anger and I sort of shut it down again. But I've been working with, you know, letting them be feelings of them not doing anything to them. And my primary experience of most emotions as they come up is one of just being overwhelmed, losing control. But then I let that sort of overwhelmed feeling come up and goes away. And I'm left with the emotion there, except it's not nearly as threatening. It seems kind of like a friend at that point. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. So one of the things you're developing by doing this over and over and over again is you're developing more trust in that it's okay to not resist, that you'll be okay, you'll survive. And many of us have a tremendous resistance because we have a sphere or whatever, but actually if we open to the experience, it's not so bad. Let's end with just a couple of minutes sitting. It's already 8 30, but just two minutes or so. So when there's resistance in the meditation practice, the resistance becomes the practice. Pay attention to that. We yield ourself, yield ourself to what is actually happening rather than holding ourselves at a distance from it. And in this way, we give ourselves to ourselves. Probably one of the best gifts you can give yourself. So thank you everyone. I think I'd like to repeat what I said the first evening for those of you who didn't come the first evening, that this kind of class is offered on a donation basis, that there's two baskets out in the hallway. One says rent, I think. And we have to pay for the rent of this room. And so we need everyone to contribute to help pay for it. Those of you who would like to contribute. And the other basket is you want to make a donation for the teaching for me during this time. So thank you all and I'll see you next week.
