So part of our practice is learning how to think and you may consider you have no problems
with knowing how to think. You know, sometimes sense, so I just want to stop thinking so much.
But the skill of thinking is to just think what's necessary to think and not to think what
isn't necessary to think. Those are two, both two quite careful understandings and we need
guidance from that. The guidance comes from your own process, your jitta, your body, your
experience. So much of the time we're just thinking what isn't really appropriate right
now, really on the mark right now. So it just spins because something needs to be thought,
something needs to be expressed, something needs to be articulated, something is asking to be,
you know, because the thinking gives us a place whereby a point where we can refer as that,
now I can operate around that, I can develop a relationship because it's that and it's clear.
And so therefore a relationship can occur. There's what's happening. Ah, so now a relationship can
occur. So the relationship isn't something you can think. Because of clear thinking,
you clearly sense the object that needs to be touched, held, known, referred to, related to,
felt, allowed to express itself, sensed, whatever. Let it sing its song. And you want to, so letting
it do that is your relationship. It's not your relationship, it's another factor that you've
got to put in and prepare and strategize. And I want to have a relationship of kindness. Now a
relationship of mindfulness. Now I'll practice with something. So we add another item to the mix
and it just gets really solid, jammed up. Because the essence of relationship or the
initial relationship is just space. And it's a space of not disconnecting space. So often the
visual sense gives us a sense of your disconnection and we can certainly have disconnected space.
But this is a connecting space. This is a space like the space of listening. So it doesn't speak.
But it opens. And this is something that, you know, then what needs to be heard, understood,
felt, comprehended, open to, can speak. And we stay in that relationship and seeing what can
arise from that. So this is, say, skillful, contemplative thought. Thought that gets to
the point of yourself, your acquisitions, your territory. And it doesn't add more to it.
So it's a specific kind of careful expression. Clearly, you know, because we do,
think and speak a lot. But do you ever study how a word or an idea comes into being? It's just
an ordinary idea that I'm going to go downstairs and wash up. This credible thing happens, isn't it?
There's a sort of, I don't know if you've ever witnessed that or sensed that. So often we're
just immediately on the message and following it. Well, where did the message arise? Where did it
come from? So we can say, I thought it, but no, no, if you're contemplating your sense,
what actually happened? Maybe it's sort of an image or something happened, perhaps even your
body, or there was some sense of a vibrancy there, you know, something moving. And then it comes
into form quickly. And then maybe sort of an image of the kitchen starts to arise. So it's
often very fast. And in just in training practice, you're really around ordinary things like going
to the kitchen or going back to my room, just a simple, ordinary, non-issue topic that doesn't
require, you know, you to be that profound or excellent or spiritual or anything, just simply
not going back to my room. And you practice with things like that. You can practice using your
own name. You know, my name is, and we'll just stop. Can you go back to the beginning again? My name
is, just where's the M come from? Nearly there. Now, could you get just to the beginning of the
word my? You don't just see the forming something coming into form. My name is, and then the ending
of it. So particularly when you come to your name, whatever your name is, that's a certain quality
of familiarity. My name is Dave, slightly different quality to it. Actually, the name isn't Dave,
of course. And so, could you get like, oh, that's me. Yeah, and a slightly different tone to it.
And something that's just pretty ordinary, my name is, and then something heightened. Yeah,
like, okay, it's three o'clock. It's three o'clock. And suddenly, I'm supposed to be doing it three
o'clock. It's heightened with emotional tones. We feel we're late, or we got to remember that or
get there on time. It's a heightening. So you just sense all that the forming of thought with
nuances of meaning. And with the meaning carrying, say urgency, or, or appreciation, or anxiety,
reading it. And then it's possible as you as you read that, you come to the end of the thought
before you come to the next one. So you start with something that's pretty ordinary, not very
volatile, going to my room, going to my room. Maybe the word room, you get a sense of, on my
own, quiet, bed, comfortable, comfortable, the nuance of that. And then sensing that and letting
it trade away. It's just the thought, ordinary thought. Notice the feeling with it. The evocation
of words. So practice with that. I really recommend it. Just when you're coming to thought
conception, it's slightly fuzzy, and it comes in. It's like sort of, mind is slightly turning
around, and then it catches. And that's it. And it swells into this thing with various nuances
and sense and felt senses, and it probably starts initiating another one. That's the way it goes.
It goes to my room. Oh, yeah, I could take a shower and look out the window and the trees are doing
it. Time will be as we're away. But there needs to pause around ordinary thoughts, things that are
not tremendously charged. This is beginner's practice. So you just want to contemplate the
movement of a thought, even a thought that isn't quite true. Like I'm getting my bicycle today,
when you don't have a bicycle. What do I say that for? Getting on my bicycle today. I don't have a
bike. Getting on my bicycle. It's just the image of a bike comes up, perhaps. So you just play with
it, and notice it as something bringing something into form. Form is called perception. An image felt
sense, and it can be toned, can't it? A bicycle could be, you've got one, could have a certain
promise of the open road, or moving along, or carefree, or wind in my hair, or whatever. Sometimes
getting on my bicycle, if it's in the mid-winter, not a pleasant tone. Going to see, so and so,
my friend, warm feeling. Going to the doctor, uncertain feeling. Going to the airport, when I
get there on time, feeling. You know, perceptions. These perceptions are these images that give rise
to a feeling, kind of a tremble in the mind, the quality of agreeable or disagreeable. Practice
that with fairly, you know, non-intense subjects, if you can think without getting intense about it.
It's ordinary stuff. So this is just something you begin to learn to use thought as a meditation
object. Using thought as an object, it's much better than using thought as a subject. In other
words, if thought tends to be the driver, then it'll take you wherever it goes. And if it's volatile,
it's going to take you into territory. And most of it that happens compulsively is, you know,
volatile, potent, and of the territory. That's why it's talking. It's coming up, it's talking. So
if you follow it, it's going to take you in there. But you can't not have such thoughts. I would like
to not have such thoughts, but, you know, sooner or later they're going to take you into that
territory. And therefore, you want to be able to feel them and get that sense of lifting from them,
contemplating them. This already is spacious. So in the full presence of something, the full
presence of something that's fully felt is already spacious. You don't have to have silence,
you know, complete silence or vast amounts of space. You just need a cigarette paper thickness of
space, which is just that which is enabled to name what's going on. If you name it, just that
naming is already that fine degree of space. That's that. And it's just this is the beginning of the
lift, the lift off from the territory. And it starts right in the territory, right in the
aggregate, right in the landscape, right in the self, as she is manifesting, and you know her or
him, and you're pretty probably, oh, no, her again, me again. So that's, this is a place where we
cultivate this quality. And it's naming. And naming to name so you can particularly so you can get
its perception, its felt meaning. And hear that. So it's, you know, to learn to cultivate this,
you did really cultivate it with a lot of fairly nondescript issues, nondescript topics, so that
you get that, that, that particular way of thinking established, called vitaka, placing the
thought, vichara, sensing what the thought is, what your naming is referring to, sensing it.
This vichara is often the lost piece in people's thinking. They don't really know how to think.
They know how to, to half think a lot. The half thing is just vitaka. And this and that,
that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that's the vichara quality. And this
vitaka vichara is the, you know, that is the beginning of meditation. And so it's, it's this
skillful factor, if it's cultivated skillfully, this is the initiation of, of meditation, you know,
as a, as a system, if you like. So we can do this with breathing. We can do this prescribed
object. So yes, how do I know I'm breathing? Am I breathing? Is there any breathing? Maybe there's
not. So actually finding, don't assume you're breathing unless you are. And you imagine you're
breathing as you'd be dead. But what tells you that? Well, that swelling, that, that sort of
change of pressure. Okay, call that breathing. Yeah, that's definitely breathing. So then you've
got vitaka, place it on that. How is that? Trembly, slight warming quality, opening quality
sense, and you're just listening to it and speaking it quietly. How is that? And it allows, this is
what's giving the right kind of attention to a suitable object. The right kind of attention gives
you, will bring the right kind of energy in. Whereas attention, there's energy. Whereas attention,
there's energy. With the right attention, the energy is, is harmonious, opening, suitable. Where
does the wrong kind of attention, energy gets distorted, pressurized, unhappy. To notice in
proper attention and improper attention. So with improper attention, you remind me, oh, you know,
so breathing in, breathing out. So, okay, focus the mind on the breathing in, breathing in,
say, wish I do that, perhaps in the nostrils, breathing in there, right, I'm breathing in and
out there. And you haven't asked anything. You haven't said, where are you? You've decided. You've
already claimed it. You've already led it. And then you're holding it now. The space isn't holding
it. Mindfulness isn't holding it. You're holding it. And as you're holding it, then the qualities
of your, the you-ness, your subjective tense begin to be projected onto the breathing. And this can
be extremely confusing because I'm doing the right thing. But I seem to be getting tense and
tight. Yeah. Because it's the me doing it. I started, my beginning meditation practice was
using a system, it was kind of patented, as I suppose, as the Marci side or system or Burmese
Satyapetana, we do a lot of naming. And they said, just note what's going on. So, but then my
noting wasn't actually that skillful. So I just have a series of things, noting, so noting, rising,
falling, then rising, falling. So okay, rises and it falls, rising, falling, noting, rising,
falling. And then lifting the foot and then lifting the hand, lifting, lifting, lifting,
lifting. And then intending to turn the hand, intending, intending, intending. And then moving
and moving, moving. And then dropping, lowering, lowering, lowering. And then touching, touching,
touching, touching, the floor, floor, floor. And this is going on so because I wanted to really
do it properly. So it's going so insistent. The effect I couldn't actually feel anything,
because there's this loud voice in my head telling me what was going on. And eventually,
I found out that I was saying rising when actually the afton was falling. So the noting,
it wasn't appropriate because I wasn't really listening. I was so, you know, concerned to get
this thing right. I just slapped all these words on it. I didn't know how to think. Really, you
know, I didn't know how to wait and what is happening. And then, is that right? Yeah,
that's about right. No, it's not right. It's that. Listening. How is that? So we can try
to, you know, just not have any thought, but then the mind can get very dreamy, drifty. We
swing and we sway and we kind of drift into things, into territory. We drift into territory,
or they are the opposite extreme. If we're too full on, then we carry our territory into,
into, onto our breathing. We carry our territorial thumbprint. So it's quite a skill to be able
to just let the experience talk. Let the, let the felt experience talk. So it's a certain openness,
let the experience talk for itself. When I don't take a swelling and just sensing really what's
happening, come to the quality of the feeling itself, the felt experience itself very direct.
Since this is a truly subjective or internal, not so really, when we come to that, there really
isn't any breathing. There's just flushing, flowing, warming, tingling, pulsing, rhythmic.
And there's no nose, there's no belly. There's just some embodiment factors are changing and
morphing. Factors of embodiment are arising. It definitely feels like a body. It's got a
quality of pressure warmth to it. It's arising and moving and changing. And there's no arms and legs.
Those are secondary, those are derived, those are interpretations, generally quite reasonable
interpretations. But to really get to the skill of meditation is to be as direct as possible.
And to feel the feeling and let the feeling be expressed, speak the feeling. This is particularly
important as we come into, you know, what I call our Territory or acquisitions. Because they are,
they have the potency to catch hold of thought and infuse the thought with their own qualities.
So, you know, the fearful experience generates a certain panic. And then we have thinking gets,
what can I do about this? What can I do about this? What can I do? Try to stop being like this,
you know, be more mindful of it. I'm supposed to be more kind and be kind and get it working on
that. So actually the panic begins to infuse the Dhamma. Words are okay as words, as suitcases,
but it's the wrong luggage, the wrong stuff inside. It's better to say panic, you know,
or even better, tightening, speeding, tightening, speeding, tightening, speeding, pressure,
and it's name it. And, you know, is that right? It's not loosening, slowing down, it's tightening,
speeding, pressure, you know, those qualities. So you might experience something like that.
Name it. And just keep it like that. And listen more deeply, as deeply as one can. This is
relationship. This is like when you're with a person and you're doing a relational process,
you just want them to say exactly how it is, and not understand it, and not fix it, and not,
you know, add loving kindness to it. The fact of listening is loving kindness. You know,
it's the beginning of it. It's the initiation of it, and then it will grow. You start with it. All
you can do is initiate potencies. And if you initiate potencies carefully, the Dhamma will take
over, it will arise by itself. So our task is to initiate, to set up right relationship. The
relationship is right. Intention is right. The energy is right. The heart moves in to relational
fruition, because that's the nature of it. That's the nature of it. You don't have,
if there is relationship, the heart is in it, and it will grow in it. Yeah, it just does it.
The heart is relational. And so often what is needed is just that heart entering the relationship.
But it's not like, where's my heart? How to put it in the relationship? Once there is
relationship, heart enters it, with a sense of, you know, how is this, feeling affected by that,
you know, and staying with that, don't know what to do. Feeling affected, don't know what to do.
Sensing that, naming that, it's trembling, vacillating, wanting to go forward, don't know
what to do, how to make this work. Sensing that, you know, so you gradually move through the
territory which is layered. There's the, what we say, the first experience could be of, you know,
a painful memory, or a sense of compulsive pattern, compulsive habit, you know, the first level of it,
and then there's a secretary level of it, where we begin to know that and become self-conscious
about it. You know, that's that, oh, that's the, that's where the things, you know, that level of it,
where we recognize we are, you know, panicking or getting up tight or losing the plot or whatever,
and then that acknowledgement of that. And then this is then, at that point, it can be,
the self can come in as, oh no, you're fixing this and you've been told so many times you
shouldn't do that, you should be more spacious, and you've gone and blown it again, and then more panic,
and then holding, tightening up. Can we get to that acknowledgement place, and you know,
the sense there that we don't know what to do. It's opening, holding the space.
This thing, as soon as you establish that respectful relationship, even to crisis,
to your, to your most disappointing territory, respectful relationship, and you hold that,
and then, you know, what will happen? Once relationship is established, heart comes along,
and this is all the macrocosm, and all the microcosm, you know, with other people who
establish that sense of she's who she is, that's her, and I mean her no harm, that's better be
how she is, then pretty, you know, as that becomes clear, then I find this sense of warmth happens.
I don't have to feel warmth to people. Right, so establish the sense of she's that,
seems that's what I'm experiencing, her is that, okay, now I know, that's that, and then not doing
anything about it. It doesn't take long actually, sometimes just for me now, just like half a second
or so, or perhaps just a little bit longer. Once they get a kind of sense of a reference,
I don't intrude or make something out of it, and this quality of goodwill starts arising,
coming through. I found that kind of quite amazing really. I think I've had people I
felt really, you know, disliking to be frank about it, so and so, he's such a pain, so conceited,
never helps out, always demanding his own way, carving out his own territorial control freak,
obsessive narcissistic, you know, and you're getting all these things building up, it's the
kind of people you'd least like to have in a community, there's a real pain, you chuck him
out, you want to have to deal with these people anyway, I mean what is it for me, trying to live
my own life, it's a basket case like that, it comes in and messes it all up, yada, yada, yada,
I say it really gets quite, I've created this demon in my mind, this guy, you know,
and that can happen, you know, it could be there, you know, kind of actually see the person,
you've really got to love this guy, how did that happen, how did that happen,
it's just because the other person, it was something I was creating in my head,
you know, the potentials were there, you know, certain disagreeable perceptions I could pick up
and put there, and I created a person out of it, and the person was just my latent tendency for
ill will, actually beautifully formulated this monster, my latent tendency for ill will, you
know, people are like, not cooperating, I'm not noticing the fact I'm getting so grumpy about
it all, like I do, but I think I've justified it being grumpy because he's such a pain,
you probably find somebody to talk, who agrees with you, yeah, here's a pain,
and then you get to have a grumble together, and you really get your ill will community going
on this person, and some people, you've got a lot of potential for doing that,
and certainly giving you ample conditions to feel annoyed by, and then, yeah, but
what's happening here in me, in this, I mean, it's territory of resentment, and it's not fair,
and I have to do this, and he never helps out, it's kind of stuff,
I'm doing that, or something he is doing that,
and it's even, you know, particularly if the person's actually now got 100 miles away,
and you're still doing all this stuff, and they're off, they got waste, got free,
you're still seizing this bitterness, and like, get him out of my life,
actually, he's in here, how did he get in here,
through incorrect thinking, incorrect attention,
so when there's a sign of the irritable, that which causes irritation, there it is,
sign to prickle, sign to sour, catch it now, catch it and speak it to yourself, or something sour,
bitter, and even goes into the, it's always, I always have to be
with people who make me, who don't care for me, who don't respect me,
the sense of punching up is bitter, prickly, I have to be with all these stupid people,
speak it, and you kind of, you can witness it,
speak it, witness it, and then, you know,
well said, well said, people get up,
just speak it, and so you speak it just to get the perception, the feltness, the crabby,
embittered, beautiful, that's a beautiful crab, you know, you've done it really well, congratulations,
okay, now we can go home, you know, because we're sort of owning one's pain and speaking it,
so speaking it is not, it's just that very act of doing so is just that millimeter of space,
once you get the millimeter of space, something in your heart is no longer welding into that
and pushing it along, it's not pushing it along, you kind of, it's just that lift off
and thing probably rolls along for a while because it's got some juice in it, it rolls
along for a while, but if you just keep with it, it rolls along for a while, it begins because
you're not actually putting any more juice into it of conviction, of desperation, or I
shouldn't be this way, or got to sort it out, or when we'll ever go out of this sort of stuff,
I should have sorted this out years ago, don't add anything to it, it kind of, it loses its
momentum and you feel, I said my bit, it's expressed itself, it's said itself, it's
got to the end of its sentence, it seems a lot of the time just, you know, mindfulness of
mental objects, of mind states, it's just like this, it's as if, you know, this kind of
crippled disease being leaps up and you take it by the hand, let's go this way as it comes along,
you're going to have to say, could you please speak up, you carry it along, it's mumbling and
groaning and moaning a bit, please could you tell me a bit more, you're carrying along,
just like you're helping somebody, then eventually it kind of says it's say, it's been heard,
and it changes, or perhaps it changes to something else, it becomes
the tired, or the sad, or the disappointed, or the hurt, and if you're listening to that,
when you come back to the first noble truth, that's where it all comes back to,
very simply, carry it, stay with it until it comes back to, or returns to the first noble truth,
which is unpleasant feeling, feeling hurt, and there right there, it's finally said what it
need, what it needed to be said, and it says, it's gone through its story and it's come to the
place where it's finally said what it needed to say, which is very simply hurt, painful feeling,
and right there, if there's that kind of attentive space, then this is where
Adama sings its song, which is always sweet, it's always loving, it's always releasing,
it's always comforting, it's always settling, you hear the tone of it,
so as we follow our processes, our struggles, our uncertainties, our waverings,
our panicking, and if possible try to avoid using interpretations like, I'm anxious,
or I'm confused, that's true in a way, but it's not quite the right language, if you can get
closer to it, closer to the experience, this is the spinning, this is the spinning, this is the
running around, this is the tightening up, this is the sinking, feel the sinking, noticing that,
naming it, how is that felt, it's like you're saying, could you give a little bit more of the
feeling of that, the sinking or the spinning, feels hot, feels cold, feels fast, feels dirty,
shamed of it, anything more, listening, you bring it and then as it comes, so you're allowing the
thing to fully unfold, and fully unfold, then when it's fully unfolded, it feels it's said it's
what it needed to say, and then because you've been with that in a heartful way, in a heartful
way, then as it comes to it's completed, the heart then presents the dharma, which is the release,
the forgiving, the warmth, the humor, or the sadness even, the sense of, oh yes, it's like that for
everyone, so it is, but it does not express itself in terms of self, it doesn't come in and say, well
you know, you're a pretty unhappy person, that's not the dharma, as it comes to it, the story is
completed, the sentence is completed, it comes through, yes, there is suffering, yes, and probably
a recognition, like, it's not me, it's not self, it's, you know, as you come, yeah, but everybody
gets this, and just bear in mind, you know, if there's a word for something, if you can name it,
if it's in language, it must be something other people experience, otherwise it wouldn't be a
word for it, wouldn't it? And some of these words are very simple words, but there's a word you
don't want to hear, or the word you're supposed, both not to hear, the word you're supposed not to say,
so it's only when you speak the truth that you can come to silence,
and that's the sign, if it hasn't come to silence, because you haven't quite really spoken the direct
truth, so okay, this is me feeling struggling, what am I supposed to do here, what am I supposed to
make this work, how's that, wavering, uncertain, so forth, wherever we can catch it, that's the beauty
of it, is that wherever one speaks the truth, however, you know, humbling, or pathetic, or repetitive
that pattern is, as you speak it, and listen, and then there's anything more, I'm fed up with this
thing, oh fed up, anything more, tired, more, stopped, you know, the outbreath, and certainly
you can track these things in your body, you can track the crystallizing, the tensing up,
and you can also track something I call the deep outbreath, which actually can occur as a physical
outbreath, but at least it's an outbreath of the heart, some sense in which the heart goes, oh,
cooling, spacious, and so yeah, and then just remembering that's, that's a gift, and we can't,
oh no, I've got the spaciousness, oh, oh, once you get that sense, yeah, once you get that sense of
got it, then we should always dismantle about to suffer, so dismantle stood me in good stead,
because they've got these very, very crystal clear, strong, crystal clear, absolutely rock solid
opinions about somebody, they're really solid, really rock solid, I feel totally convinced and
certain of it, and this mantra about to suffer, save me from this, in many ways, just hold back
on that one just a moment longer, how's it feel, did you realize how angry I am, how much anger
there is potential for anger, because I'm not a particularly angry person, you know, I'm generally
very peaceful, yeah, I'm not an angry person, because I've heard my anger, my rage, because
I've heard it, I'm not an angry person, if I didn't hear it, I would be a pretty angry person,
if I hadn't heard it, if you don't speak it, you become it, if you don't speak it, you become it,
you don't have a choice, you can't say that neither territory nor be there,
you either speak it or you become it, or you become some incredible complication of it,
you become the anger, then you become the not wanting to be angry, then you shouldn't be angry,
you become that, and the whole thing builds up into this kind of thick wodge of stuff,
and you know it's kind of frozen, which is, you know, so it gets like that, you know, frozen,
something's not being said, something's not being said, come on, you know, what's not being said,
frozen isn't being said, okay let's say frozen, frozen, whereabouts is frozen, chest, neck, throat,
and so you're coming there, how is that?
Twisting, turning, you know, straining, struggling, clawing, good, anything more, you know,
you're just encouraging it, entry point, encouraging, so particularly if we, in that,
in that process, when you've got very dense material, you don't want to
lead in with words, you lead in with it, with a kind of a question, how, and would you like to,
it's an invitation, and it brings forth, generally it brings forth, these, the perceptions is what
it brings forth, compressed, struggle, feel like, you know, claws reaching out, or feel like something's
crushing me, that's the felt meaning, that's the felt sense, when you get one of those,
that's a gift, that's a gift from the territory, because it wants to find a way out, it wants to
express itself, you get the gift of that, crushed, crushing, how does that feel? Well, not good, okay,
and you know, so you begin to explore that, or touch into that, crushed,
heavy, flat, and anything in your body, weight, pressure, okay, is it possible to
really sense it through the whole form? So, and even if it's possible,
you know, the sense of relationship, which is, there you are, anything you need, or what's helpful,
or what you like to say, anything like that, anything that implies a spaciousness of relationship,
it doesn't mean one has a lot of space, it means one is being spacious, if you want space, it means
you're actually wanting to disconnect, to be spacious is to be in the presence of, with a
non-intrusive, non-aggressive, non-domineering attitude, it's open, and this is, this is really
courageous and beautiful, because it's so precarious, we just do not know what's going to happen, what
we're going to do, what we're going to feel, but one thing you know, if you don't do that,
you're going to suffer big time, this is something you do know, you know, you know through experience,
if you get into the clamping, and the clinging, and the blaming, and the criticising, and the
trying to make it work, and how you're going to suffer massively, so just, do you want any more
of that? Do you want any more of that? Have you had enough of that? Then stop, you stop that,
you know, against all reasons, stop that, there's a sense of, well, I don't know,
stay, pause, stay.
So mindfulness is, in this respect is, mindfulness is always holding the
not quite yet, not quite time to act yet, give me another millisecond, another one second,
not quite yet, and that restraining, there's the possibility for the dharma to move in,
rather than the self, and the dharma is the healer, and it brings in its natural potencies,
goodwill, kindness, patience, clarity, groundedness, and in whatever, however, their tone is,
and that's our song, that's the gift, and it's always, to me, it always comes from out of left
field, you could say, it's surprising, it's not me. This is how we cultivate this
proper attention, and using this exercises, how to think, how to bring up a thought,
how to stay with it, how to read a thought, how to listen to the movement of a thought,
how to listen to the, particularly the places where there's a volatile flush that comes in
with that, friendly, warm, excited, disappointed, urgent, volatile flushes, and stay,
not time to act right now, not quite yet. This allows things to arise and pass.
This is, say, one of the definitions of the stream entry, one who's allowed phenomena to
arise and pass. It seems so easy, but actually most people don't allow phenomena to arise,
so they can't pass. They allow the half arise, then they start fixing them,
proliferating them, changing them, worrying about them, wishing they had another one.
I'd like to have something else arise, rather than this embarrassing thing,
if only. So in staying with the allowing of the arising, and if you can embody it,
this definitely gives you a little more ballast, a little more grounding.
Things are of the nature to arise and pass. They do it by themselves. It's their nature.
We have to find the way to be with nature. This is big learning for humans,
because we always dominate, wherever we seem to always want to dominate is our first instinct,
such as this sense of respectfulness, of let nature be natural. This is dharma,
dharma is nature, the true nature, true human nature. And the curious thing is we have to
start to use these contrived processes to get back to being natural.
So it's time for some practice. So if anything is useful in that, that's to bear it in mind,
doing courage, just training in the simple, and the territory can get volatile, as you probably
know at any moment, a glance, a sound, something you forgot to do, it can suddenly trigger the whole
thing. So be prepared yourself. You can have any time, prepare yourself while you can to cultivate
clear, proper attention, careful thought, following the thought, following the meaning,
following the feeling curve around stuff is okay. I think this was the point, I think,
of mindfulness of breathing. Breathing was supposed to be okay.
Okay, nobody can make a mess out of this, can they?
I think they would have perhaps at that time just didn't really understand, just
how neurotic we could get. So okay, breathing isn't okay. Maybe walking could be okay.
Or just thinking, thinking things through. My name is, maybe that could be okay.
This is, my sense, mindfulness is this, not quite yet, let it speak.
And then we come to the silence. It's the appropriate place to include for today.
