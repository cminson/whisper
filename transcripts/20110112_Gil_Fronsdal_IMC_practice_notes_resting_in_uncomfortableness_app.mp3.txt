Resting in Uncomfortableness

One of the great ways to use mindfulness practice, and 
really almost necessary in order to be able to take  the 
practice and go far with it , is to use the mindfulness to 
turn towards that which is uncomfortable. Some  people 
have the instinct to turn away from what’s 
uncomfortable or  try to  fix it. Instead  turn towards what’s 
uncomfortable , and find how to  rest in the middle of it.  
 
The word rest is a great word , because it doesn’t mean  
fighting, fixing or judging  what’s uncomfortable . It also 
means not staying anxious about it, defended  against  it, 
upset by it, or any of the many  ways in which we often 
react naturally about being uncomfortable , emotionally 
or physically . There  is a great art, a great  practice , 
training to learn how to willingly turn and move towards 
what’s  uncomfortable and find a place of rest in the 
middle of it,  or around it or with it  in some way. For me, I 
like the idea of finding a place to rest right in the middle 
of it. Then  sit there , and try to find that place wh ere it is 
okay to be uncomfortable. There is a kind of  permission 
to be uncomfortable  and not be in conflict with the 
discomfort we are feeling. From  that place of rest or non-conflict , then make space to feel, sense, see, and 
experience what that discomfort is in a ver y simple way. 
To try to analyze, figure out, interpret or  find meaning in 
the discomfort is not the same thing as being at rest in 
it. To be at rest in it is like nothing needs to happen 
about it , except just to feel , to hold, and to sense it.  
 
So perhaps none of you are  feeling  any discomfort this 
morning  [laughter]. T hat would be wonderful. But , if in 
case there is something that you feel uncomfortable 
about during the  next hour and a half , you might 
experiment with what it is like to turn towards and in to it 
– not to engage  or believe  it more, make a story about it 
more , or be rea ctive to or act on it more. But turn 
towards it , see it , and see what it is like to find a place of 
rest or stillness in the midst of it, and j ust let it be. If a 
day of  resting in the middl e of it is a little bit strange  and 
not understandable,  then just let the discomfort be . See 
it, feel it, and let it be. That combination. So I hope that’s 
helpful and interesting. Thank you.
