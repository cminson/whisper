The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So a really warm welcome. It's nice to practice together while we were
sitting. You know sometimes we hear a rustle of somebody shifting their posture
and somehow it just made me happy. There's you know human bodies here,
individuals here together you know practicing it was. So thank you.
So tonight I want to talk a little bit about something that seems so obvious.
Like it seems like we shouldn't even have to talk about it.
And yet there's a way that there can be a depth about it and there can be some real
awakening or some new understanding when we really look at it. We kind of unpack it or
explore it in some kind of way.
And that is this idea that the actions we take whether they are of body, speech, or mind.
So whether they're thoughts. I'm putting thoughts in there with this category of actions.
Actions have consequences. There's a cause and effect. And this is not anything new to anybody in this room.
In fact I think there's even like a physics law about this right. For every action there's
an equal and opposite reaction right. It's so fundamental that even the physicists are
have talked about it.
And so we know this that if we are dishonest with a friend and our friend discovers this or
even if they don't discover it but it affects our relationships.
If we spend a lot of time being angry at the news
and our minds get filled with being angry thoughts and we tend to just have a lot of
tension and anger inside of us. And of course there's this teaching that that which one ponders
becomes the inclination of the mind right. So we're kind of like priming the mind to just
be more readily angry if we're just fueling it all the time.
So to be sure some things have little impact on our lives.
That we experience maybe there's not a big impact that we have to wait in line a little
bit longer at the grocery store for example. Some things have large impact if we find ourselves
behaving unethically this can unfold in a way that has large impact. If we do a lot of meditation
that can be a way that also there's a big impact. So some of the impact some of the consequences
are small it might even be dismissive and some are large. But there is nothing that doesn't
have any impact. And part of the Buddhist practice is to just thoroughly recognize this and to
thoroughly understand this. And of course things have consequences. And this simple idea
which now is so commonplace for all of us wasn't so obvious at the time of the Buddha.
In fact there's another teacher a non-Buddhist that gets described in a number of different
places in the suttas and a little excerpt of what this other teacher would say Makali Gosala.
He would say there is no cause or condition for the corruption of beings. There is no cause or
condition for the purification of beings. All beings all living creatures all sentient beings
that control power and energy instead they are molded by destiny by circumstance by nature.
So this idea that something out there was responsible for whatever happened to a person.
And so it didn't matter what a person did. There is something out there that wasn't ever
for this particular teacher wasn't clearly described what that was. But this idea then
that people doesn't matter what we do. Doesn't matter. No consequences.
We might say but the Buddha's teaching on the four nimble truths is the opposite. There are
consequences. There's a number of different ways in which we can approach the four nimble truths.
We can emphasize different parts and we can translate some of the words a little bit differently.
But one way to look at this is that there is dukkha right the first noble truth there is dukkha.
We can translate dukkha as just this dissatisfaction like just things are not quite right.
And maybe we can't even like necessarily put our finger on it. It just feels dissatisfying or just
not not not not perfect. All the way to dukkha being the suffering of tremendous physical pain
that humans can do experience tremendous emotional pain that humans can experience.
So this dukkha from just something not quite being right to great pain.
First noble truth there is dukkha and then the second noble truth there is a cause for dukkha.
Dukkha is a consequence of something else.
There's a reason that it's there. It doesn't mean that we know it. It doesn't mean that it's
obvious to us but it does mean that it's not like magic or you know sometimes or somehow it's
uh happening happening from some other reason that has nothing to do with humans or I guess
it might be right. I mean I'm weather and these types of things that happen.
But I'll unpack this a little bit more about what I mean by dukkha.
So second noble truth there is a cause. Third there is a cessation of dukkha.
And fourth there is a way leading to this cessation. So practicing this path requires
that we recognize that there are actions that bring us dukkha and there's actions that bring us
non dukkha I might say. Freedom, peace, ease. And so much about this practice is just recognizing
okay is this going towards dukkha or is it going towards freedom? And we could interpret
the four noble truths this way and without this understanding of course it's really difficult
to have our lives unfold in a particular way that everything has consequences and we can consider
whether those consequences are more dukkha or less dukkha. Maybe what I've been saying
is like okay okay Diana we know this. This isn't our first dharma talk we've heard about the
four noble truths we've heard about dukkha. But something that I appreciate so much about the
dharma is how it's there's this depth and this breadth. When we really explore we can find something
that meets us wherever we are. We hear about teachings, we read sutras, we practice again and
again and then sometimes our understanding start to shift. The way it touches us starts to shift
and we start to even though we might have seen it so many times we might see it in a new way
and understand something differently and that we didn't understand before.
And I'd like to suggest that our understanding of dukkha shifts as we practice. Probably many
of you have this experience. I know that I remember this so clearly that a dharma teacher,
I was having a practice discussion and a dharma teacher said something to me about suffering.
And I said I don't have any suffering. You know I had just quit my job at that time and I was
feeling you know pretty great like wow I had attributed like all my difficulties with you
know having this job. But not realizing that this as our meditation practice starts to grow and we
start to experience more and more calm as we start to experience more and more peace then our
definition of dukkha kind of shifts along with that and we start to notice oh yeah there are more
and more subtle experiences and expressions of dukkha.
So we can start to become that it starts to become that which is less calm that which is
less open that which is less quiet.
So dukkha can be understood as this tightening as this constriction which can be really subtle
and maybe shows up primarily in our meditation practice or maybe it shows up in really obvious
gross ways in our daily life as well. But we can explore this world of actions and consequences
by looking at dukkha. Because for some people they're suffering their difficulties their
why things aren't going the way that they wish is a little bit of a mystery to them.
Why is it my life the way that I thought it was going to be or why is I why is there this
suffering why is there this sense of dissatisfaction and often we look in the wrong places for the cause.
It's a habit that many of us have it's a human habit to blame somebody else did something
wrong this has to be fixed somebody better fix it this is not right.
With we might blame ourselves if I only I were a better meditator if only I were
a better this a better that it would than this suffering wouldn't be here.
Often people are looking outside themselves okay I have to fix this out there I have to
engineer manipulate can manufacture you know somehow create some different conditions
in order to see for the dukkha. Sometimes people just are complaining not even having
some clear idea of what is the source of dukkha. But we can bring attention bring care to this dukkha
without self pity without blame but to look at it and to see the action that is underlying
that is fueling that is the cause for this constriction that is dukkha.
Very often that action is attachment or clinging and so much about practice can be loosening the
constrictions can't be about loosening this the tightening that happens around that causes dukkha.
So this clinging this attachment can be really subtle and when we find ourselves experiencing
dukkha we can just ask okay what is where is there any sense of tightness any sense of holding on
any sense of clinging. It's likely that we will discover that this clinging this tightness this
holding on this contraction is related to having a sense of self self that we want to be a particular
way or we want to not be a particular way and there's a particularly strong sense of self when
there is blame. There's this often a sense of self righteousness that arises like don't they know
who I am what what are they thinking or when we make a mistake or something goes wrong we most
often are turning towards blame and there's this exaggerated inflexible sense of me or you
and a kind of he said she said I said kind of thing that happens often we're blaming ourselves
we're blaming others and then these negative self views or these negative views of others
they tend to like fuel themselves or fuel each other creating this vicious dukkha cycle.
So I would like to propose or suggest there's a way in which we can find our way out of this
that we can interrupt these dukkha cycles and one way is to re look at to reanalyze
an experience in which we're having dukkha and look at it again maybe it's on the
cushion or outside of the cushion is a way to understand what are the conditions that came
together that are supported this experience of difficulty this experience of dukkha
to what is there a way that we can look at that from a different angle with maybe a heart of
compassion and with in the service of compassion to recognize that there are so many different
conditions that come together so many like countless conditions that come together
and whenever is happening right something is the consequence of all kinds of different things
us being here together is consequence of this building being built and
there's things on the internet that's on the calendar and however transportation you use
to get here right it's countless things that come together so to illustrate this I'd like to
share a story this story is from Robert Bea and that gives an example of how one might do this
so imagine that you're or perhaps this actually happened you were with a friend and your friend
is telling you some difficulty she is going through and you're listening as attentively or
sympathetically as you can but at the same time you're also aware of some disquiet within yourself
and you're vaguely worried that maybe you should have a little more empathy or you should have
some more compassion for your friend some but they are telling you this story about difficulty
and somehow you feel unmoved not really touched by what this is saying and later when you reflect on
this it bothers you and you wonder is there something wrong with me why wasn't I able to
connect with my friend and maybe you have this idea well I've been doing all this practice
and am I just a cold-hearted person after all how can how come I couldn't connect with this person
that I care about but that way of considering that particular activity or that particular
experience is where you're focusing on yourself and holding only yourself responsible for how
things went fails to see it fails to take into account a whole range of other factors
that contributed that contributed to limiting the connection you felt with your friend for example
it could be something really basic maybe you had a headache and you weren't quite feeling
your the best version of yourself a little bit feeling a little bit off maybe you were tired
we shouldn't underestimate right how human beings are not the best versions of themselves when they
are tired and when we are often sometimes when we are putting pressure on ourselves to feel
something different than what we're actually feeling we have this idea I should really be
more sympathetic or empathetic or compassionate towards my friend and yet I'm not when we are
putting pressure on ourselves to feel something that we're not then often we feel disconnected
from ourselves and disconnected from other people around us so maybe even just having that idea I
should be different kind of created the conditions for things to unfold a little bit in a different
way so maybe that's one thing that was happening but maybe there's something a little bit more
complex maybe there was some slight tension between you and your friend that was left
unresolved the last time you mentioned something small that at the time seemed insignificant
and but now is affecting you maybe it's enough that it affects maybe your openness maybe you're
feeling a little bit more guarded or maybe there was something in the way that your friend herself
the way that she was telling the story like maybe she was telling the story that she was
exaggerating in a way that felt a little bit off like she herself was disconnected from the story
or maybe she felt like she was holding back or she was hamminated up being dismissive whatever
it was whatever it was there might be a way in which she was behaving
so it's not that we definitely would now like blame our friend oh I felt I couldn't feel connected
because she was behaving in some particular way because right there's all these conditions of
why she was being in this way the point here is that there are different types of conditions
that come together for every moment every one of our experiences and they all have an impact
on our experiences so sometimes when we blame ourselves or we blame others we're not taking
into into account these other conditions so one way we might do this to reconsider review
reanalyze an experience we had in which we feel like there's a lot of blame either for ourselves
or for others or that we feel constricted about or any time in which there is a lot of duke
for example is um and there are some tools that can be helpful it can be feel cumbersome also
so I offer these just so that they might be helpful I myself have I do this when I get stuck
when I feel like I'm blaming myself or blaming others about some difficulty
I sometimes use these different tools as a way to help kind of kind of help like flesh out
everything that happened so for example what are some of the present inner conditions that
happened at the time so what do I mean by that what was the mind state that you had what was the
what was the emotional state what were beliefs or perceptions that were really active at that time
and the example that I gave tiredness would be an example
what are at the present outer conditions for the story that I told it was the way in which
your friend was relaying the story in which she was telling it maybe it there was something that
wasn't quite right or didn't feel quite right so in the present moment what was happening in the
inside your inner experience and what was happening in the environment but then of course
what were some of the conditions in the past that related to this maybe there's habits of mind or
or some inner states that are affecting us and in the story I told that would be that maybe
there was something unresolved between you and your friend maybe there was some slight tension
maybe you felt just a little bit offended by something she said or you know in the time past
and so now you're showing up just a little bit differently
or maybe there's these past outer conditions these impressions or influences we have from our
friends for or from our history so we can look at these different categories as a way to help us
see oh there's so many different conditions that led to this consequence of not feeling connected
with my friend in this story so rather than there's a having to blame or rather than saying okay
I'm at fault or my friend is at fault or or something like this instead we could just soften
that whole idea of blame soften the idea of that there's a self at the center of everything
and recognize that there are so many different things that come together and came together for
that particular experience and that is now gone away those conditions are no longer there
it doesn't mean that there still isn't some maybe some harm or some feelings about it but
now there can be some moving forward often when there's we're stuck in a sense of blame there's
a real stuckness we can't find our way forward so this and I'm not saying that we don't accept
responsibilities for our actions either I'm just saying oh it's just conditions there is a no
responsibility this is so much about practice as recognizing yes there's these conditions that come
together and we have responsibilities to accept the consequences of our actions
and this is a big part about what it means to be a mature practitioner too right is to recognize
that some of the consequences of our actions are uncomfortable duke and then we practice with
patience we practice with forbearance we practice with equanimity we learn from these things so that
we can in the future perhaps not have as much difficulty but this idea of looking at actions
and consequences that they can and rather than there being a self which is often associated
with blame not always but often doesn't have to be at the center doesn't have to be like the
stuckness there instead just to see oh all these things came together I had a part there's these
other parts and those they've gone away now and there's these further consequences but
to feel the freedom that is available there when we don't have to make ourselves or somebody else
at the center and taking responsibility for everything
and so this part of practice is to recognize we take responsibility for our actions and
and we recognize that lots of conditions come together including clinging
and often the clinging is so a sense of self so if we can soften the sense of self if we
can soften the clinging it'll be less duke and often this clinging is taking the form of blame
not always not always but often so in that way we might take this idea of that actions have
consequences at hum drum every day thing that we know and just more thoroughly apply it to
everything everything in our life and to help us kind of find our way with more ease
and less duke less dissatisfaction less suffering
so thank you
