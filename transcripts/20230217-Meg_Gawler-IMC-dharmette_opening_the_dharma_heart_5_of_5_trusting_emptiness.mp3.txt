 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDarma.org. Greetings Dharma friends. I'm glad to be here with you. Some of you have been asking about when this series of guided meditations and talks will be up on the audioDarma. Many of you know this, but the beautiful entity that is IMC has a remarkable business model, which is one of generosity. There's not a single paid employee. Everything works because a dedicated army of volunteers offer their time freely. And in this case, the person responsible for putting these talks up on the audioDarma is away. So everything will be up at some point, but I can't exactly tell you when. Also, someone asked where I'm teaching from and I live in a very remote and beautiful spot in the south of France near a huge nature reserve. Beautiful stars, lots of biodiversity and lots of quiet. But if you're into entertaining and shopping, you wouldn't like it here at all. So today we come to the last talk in this series of wholesome qualities that we can cultivate to prepare the mind and the heart for awakening. On Monday, I talked about Pali as being a language that is highly polysemic and that's not a pun. Polysemic is a Greek origin and it means that quite often a single word will have a number of quite different meanings. So in the early text, the word for the quality we'll explore today is passana. And it's not related to the passana, which has two S's and one N. This word has one S and two N's. Gil translates passana as clear, happy and trusting. But literally, it means something like settling forward. So in Pali, the pre-verb pa means forward or onward or to the fore. And it brings the idea of this quality of mind as one that is onward leading. And then sad is the root of the word sana and it means sit or settle. So passana literally means settled, but as an adjective, it's translated as bright, clear, pure, transparent. And it can also mean being full of faith, having confidence and trusting. And in addition to that, it includes a sense of being pleased and happy. So I think that the root of the word has a lot to do with what it means for us as meditators of being settled as the big part of how this all comes about. In my professional life, I used to work as a limnologist, and that's somebody who studies the ecology of lakes and rivers and coastal areas. And I like to think of taking a sample of a column of lake water from near the bottom to near the surface, and then letting it sit long enough so that all the dregs and the particles can settle to the bottom. And what's left at the top is water that is transparent and clear. So if we sit long enough and let the mind settle down, we can enjoy a mind that is transparent and clear and able to let in the light of the dharma. So dharma practice is often thought of as a process of purification. And it does take a while, and it does require letting the magic happen, letting the transformation happen, and the opening up that makes that possible. So eventually, if we sit long enough and let the mind settle down, we do have moments when our preoccupations are no longer running the show. So instead of letting the mind keep stirring up the dregs of thoughts and preoccupations, we can perhaps dare to let things settle, if only for a short time. So don't be discouraged if you can't yet remain settled for a long time. You might think of yourself as a parent and your mind as a little toddler. And if you've had kids, you'll remember how wonderful it was when your little toddler first stood up and then finally took a couple of steps and of course plopped down right away. But those baby steps were just glorious and a cause of great happiness for you. So celebrate your baby steps of letting the mind settle down. And then trusting the emptiness of a mind with awareness that is wide open, receptive, soft, unobstructed by preoccupations, glad and confident. I think the idea of trust is key to being able to walk this path. I had the good fortune to receive lay ordination from my Zen teacher, Shunmyo Suzuki Roshi. And he gave me the Buddhist name, Tangsho Doushin, which means something like feel, illuminate, path of faith. So for the feel, illuminate part, I remember my first two years in the monastery where I cried silently in nearly every period of meditation and often throughout the day. And the tears just kept coming and this did feel like a process of purification. And I think perhaps with the first part of my name, feel, illuminate, Suzuki Roshi was encouraging me to trust the process of letting my feelings arise and eventually like the way. And then as for being a path of faith, well, I don't think this was my strong point. Of course, my faith and my teacher and my faith in the Buddhist teachings was rock solid. But faith, confidence in myself, was really sorely lacking. So for me, learning to trust has been a big part of learning to walk this path. But the Buddha never wanted his disciples to trust blindly. On the contrary, the Dharma does a splendid job of pointing the way. But even with that, each of us has to learn how to realize it for ourselves, because we're all different. We all have our own causes and conditions, our own knots to untie and unwind. We need to learn where we get stuck, where we cling, how we become reactive. So right now, where am I putting my trust? Am I trusting my fear? Am I trusting anger? Am I filling up the radiant emptiness of the present moment with needing to prove myself, with me, myself and mine wanting to be someone? Or might it be possible to trust this radiant emptiness that is available to each of us when we stop filling it up with our agendas and preoccupations? Do I trust noise, or can I trust silence? What kind of trust is needed so that I can let the dregs of selfing settle out, allowing for the clarity that is needed for insight? So the qualities that the Buddha sought to inspire in his followers, to prepare them for his deepest teachings, were being receptive, having a mind that's soft without the fetters of fixed views and conceit. Free of the preoccupations of the hindrances, glad and inspired to practice. And with today's quality, a mind that is settled, clear, bright and confident. And then when these qualities are in place and we have opened the Dharma heart, then we can finally understand the deepest teachings of the Buddha. So do you know what these deepest teachings are? They may sound rather pedestrian at first, not so mind-blowing. And in the discourse I'm referring to this week, Maja Midekaya 91, in the middle-length discourses, when the Brahman of Brahmayu had these wholesome qualities of mind and the Dharma eye arose in him, then the Buddha said, all that is subject to arising is subject to cessation. And with this, Brahmayu saw the Dharma and became enlightened. So that's all there is to it. To really know that all that is subject to arising is subject to cessation. But, you know, of course it's not enough to just know it with the mind. We have to know it with our whole being and be transformed by it. So my suggestion to you with the teachings of this week is that for the Dharma eye to open in you, you may need to do some preliminary work of opening the Dharma heart. We need to get to the bottom of our suffering and see the uselessness of clinging to anything. Bringing all of you, of who you are, to walking this path. And then letting go of trusting the small self of me, myself and mine, and opening up for and making space for trusting the Dharma to take you in the direction of freedom. And we can let the mind settle and get out of the way. The Dharma knows where to take us. And that's something we can trust. Thank you. And a small announcement is that next week you will be in good hands with my friend, Don Neal. Don and I were thesis buddies six years ago when we did our master's degree with Bill Fransdall as our major professor. So I'm sure you'll enjoy next week as well. Thank you for being here.
