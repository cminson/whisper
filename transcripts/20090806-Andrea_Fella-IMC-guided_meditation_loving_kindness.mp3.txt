Since the topic tonight is metta, I thought that I would do a guided metta meditation for the first part of this sitting. 
So allowing your body to relax and settle in to the present moment. 
Allow your attention to settle into the area around your heart. 
And just notice what you feel there. 
No need to look for anything in particular, just notice what the experience is in the area of the heart right now. 
And staying connected to the area of your heart. 
And a few moments reflecting on qualities that you like about yourself. 
If this is difficult for some of you, I'll give you at least one. 
You have come here this evening with the intention to hear the Dharma. 
This path has meaning to you and that is a beautiful quality. 
Staying connected still in the area of your heart. 
Spend another few moments recalling and reflecting on some kind things that you've done. 
This might be very simple things such as letting somebody go ahead of you in the grocery line or holding a door open for somebody at work. 
It might be a larger thing helping a friend move or waiting for a friend at the hospital. 
Just noticing how the area of your heart feels as you reflect on this. 
And still staying connected with the experience in the area of your heart. 
Connect with yourself somehow here and now. 
Either through the felt sense of yourself sitting here or perhaps through an image of yourself. 
Imagine yourself doing something that makes you happy. 
Taking a walk in nature or talking with friends. 
And holding this image of yourself or felt sense of yourself. 
We'll begin the metapractice, the formal metapractice, which consists of using phrases directed towards yourself to wish yourself well. 
Typically we use three or four phrases and repeat those phrases silently in our minds. 
So I will offer you some phrases and say them out loud for a while so you get the sense of this. 
Be happy. 
May I be healthy. 
May I be safe. 
May I live with ease. 
As you say each phrase silently to yourself in your mind. 
Stay connected with the experience in the area of your heart. 
Almost as if you were speaking or thinking the phrases through your heart. 
May I be happy. 
May I be healthy. 
May I be safe. 
May I live with ease. 
As you say each phrase in your mind. 
Understand the meaning of the phrase. 
And connect to your heart seeing if you can recognize the impact that having said that phrase has on your heart. 
Again no need to look for anything in particular. 
Just be open to what is the experience in your heart as you say these phrases. 
May I be happy. 
May I be healthy. 
May I be safe. 
May I live with ease. 
If your mind wanders just come back to the phrases. 
May I be happy. 
May I be healthy. 
May I be safe. 
May I live with ease. 
If you wish you can continue with this practice for the remainder of the sitting. 
Silently saying the phrases in your mind. 
And connecting to the experience in the area of your heart. 
Or if it's more comfortable for you. 
It's fine for you to return to the attention to breathing to the mindfulness practice. 
Thank you for watching.
