Dharmette: The Road Not Taken  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on January 13, 2010  
 
 
On Monday evening here I gave a talk on intention and 
how meaningful it is, how important it is to spend time 
reflecting on what your deepest intention is, and to 
somehow find the ability, or the courage, to live from 
one’s deepest intention – whether that’s in the big scale 
of our life or it’s in the moment, just this moment here.  
 
In the teachings of the Buddha, there ’s a very strong 
tendency to be dichotomous, to point out that there ’s 
always, in every moment, a choice between two 
different possibilities. There are many possibilities, but 
two general categories or directions to go. We can do 
something that ’s helpful or healthy, or something th at’s 
unhelpful or unhealthy. And to be able to make that 
distinction is very important in his teachings.  
 
If you don ’t have any sense of what ’s healthy, helpful, or 
health producing, you won ’t do it. And if you don ’t have 
some sense of what ’s unhealthy fo r you, then how 
would you know to avoid it? The words that he uses are 
‘skilful ’ and ‘unskilful, ’ kusala  and akusala. The idea of 
having some sense of intention that ’s informed by some 
understanding about what is skilful, unskilful, helpful, unhelpful, and  what is most beneficial for us, what is 
most meaningful for us, what ’s most significant – and 
how in each moment that question can be asked. Every 
moment, do we meet the situation in a way that ’s 
healthy or helpful for us and others? Do we meet it with 
our goodness, our clarity? Do we meet it with 
compassion and kindness? Or do we meet it with 
obscurity, with resistance? Do we meet it with aversion? 
Do we meet it with judgements in a way that ’s not 
helpful for anyone? How do we meet every situation?  
 
These  are all introductory statements for a poem I want 
to read to you – a very famous part of the American 
canon that I came across again recently. I had to 
memorize it in fifth grade, and I haven ’t thought about it 
since. I didn ’t think about it then, either.  But now I like it. 
For me it ’s very evocative. I ’m sure most of you will 
recognise it. Maybe some of you had to memorise it.  
 
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveller, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  
 
Then took the other, as just as fair  
And having perhaps the better claim,  
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
Though as for that the passing there  Had worn them really about the same,  
  
And both that morning equally lay  
In leaves no step had trodden black  
Oh, I kept the first for another day!  
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  
I doubted if I should ever come back.  
 
I shall be telling this with a sigh  
Somewhere ages and ages hence:  
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I - 
I took the one less travelled by,  
And that has made all the difference.  
 
And that has made all the difference. So coming from 
out of Buddhism, and reading this poem through that 
frame, the woods in Buddhism are sometimes a symbol 
for the  world of entanglement. How we get entangled in 
the world in all kinds of ways, in the jungle, in the binds. 
One of the words for attachment is a homonym – it’s the 
same pronunciation in Pali as the word for tree, and so 
it adds to this idea that the world  of attachment, the 
world of trees or forests are something you want to 
become free of.  
 
So we find ourselves in this world, this “yellow wood, ” 
it’s the fall, right, probably New England where Robert 
Frost was. So yellow is the sign of death and trees, th e 
leaves are dying. And so we come into this wood that ’s dying, or the time of our life we realize that things are 
coming to an end. It ’s very poignant to have an 
encounter with our mortality, and sense that things are 
coming to an end, that there are choi ces that are really 
important . And what we do? And so, “Two roads 
diverged in a yellow w ood.” There’s always a choice, in 
the woods. Which way do we go? Do we go further into 
it? Do we get more entangled? Do we find the way out 
of it? To be free of it?  
 
And here he says, “I’m sorry I could not travel both and 
be one traveller, long I stood and looking down one as 
far as I could to wh ere it bent in the undergrowth. ” So 
the one disappears into the undergrowth. The 
undergrowth in Buddhist symbolism  is even mor e 
entanglements than the trees and the forest. So to be 
lost in the undergrowth means it ’s so overgrown, you 
can’t even find a path any more. So here , one of them 
at least looks like it could disappears into the 
undergrowth. And as the poem goes along, tha t’s the 
one that ’s most taken. That ’s pretty evocative, huh? 
That’s the way people get lost in the undergrowth. 
“Then I took the other, ” it says – the one that doesn ’t go 
into the undergrowth.  
 
I looked up this poem in Wikipedia and printed it out. 
There was a literary analysis of the poem that people 
have come up with – theories, I guess. One of them was 
that Robert Frost wrote this because he went walking regularly, and his companion could never decide which 
path to take, so it was in response to  his friend that he 
wrote the poem. But another interpretation, a literary 
interpretation, is that it ’s a champion of American 
individualism that the individual counts, and you can 
make your own choice; it ’s up to you what path you 
take.  
 
But that works so mewhat well for Buddhism as well, 
because Buddhism also has a very strong individualistic 
streak because only you can walk the path. You can ’t 
ask someone else to walk it for you. You can walk with 
someone. People can accompany you on the path, but 
you sti ll have to walk the path yourself. And you have to 
make the choice for yourself.  “Then took the other, just 
as fair and having, perhaps, the better claim because  it 
was grassy and wanted wear. ” So again, not many 
people go down the second path, a lot of pe ople go 
down the path that goes to the undergrowth , but not so 
many people go to that other path.  
 
And that ’s often one of the reasons why some people 
find it hard to follow a path, any spiritual path  – but 
certainly  a path to liberation , because it often makes us 
so different from what ’s popularly or socially expected of 
us – what ’s normally seen as being the right thing to do 
and what our family wants.  
 
I met with someone recently, a young person, for whom it was so clear the kind of person he was – basically a 
kind of a monk. And he was struggling with that side of 
himself , and what he thought of was his parents ’ 
expectations of what he should do. And so, what does 
he follow? The path he was made for in a sense, or the 
path that his parents expect hi m to do?  “Oh, I kept the 
first for another day! ” I think it ’s very powerful, the next 
sentence. “Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I 
doubted if I should ever come back. ” So we make these 
choices, and one of the reasons it can be difficult to 
make choice s is that the choice will make a difference. 
And who knows what path opens up, or how things 
unfold from there? You might never come back to the 
same thing, the same possibilities, the same choices 
again.  
 
You never know if you made the right choice. 
Somet imes two choices, a variety of choices, come 
along, and you take one, and there ’s not a sample 
group to compare your choice with. It ’s unique to you. 
So who knows? You didn ’t take that job that you should 
have taken. “Yeah I should ’ve taken that job. ” But who 
knows if you ’d have taken that job? Maybe you ’d have 
been hit by a truck, standing in the wrong place at the 
wrong time. Who knows? Who knows anything?  
 
So our choices are consequential . Do we ever come 
back? And so some people get frozen at that junct ure. “I 
can’t make a choice. How do I know? I ’ll lose something. I don ’t want to lose something, but I can ’t go 
forward. ” So the poignancy of the choices we make  – in 
even the small things – the poignancy of meeting a 
friend, appreciating a friend, or not . What do we do?  “I 
shall be telling this with a sigh. ” I think it ’s very 
interesting that he ’s predicting the future here. “I shall 
be telling this with a sigh, Somewhere ages and ages 
hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I – I took the 
one less travel led by, And that has made all the 
difference. ” 
 
As some of you know, I ’m fond of the analogy of two 
parallel lines that go on forever and never touch and 
never depart, always the same distance. But if you 
nudge one of them ever so slightly to the side , then for a 
long time, you don ’t see them any different from the 
departing lines at all, but over enough time they get 
further and further away. And with enough time, there 
can be an immense distance between the two lines.  
 
A very small choice and intention an d change of course 
today might not seem to make a big difference 
tomorrow or next week, but over months and years, it 
can make a huge difference in your life. It makes all the 
difference. And Buddhism puts a tremendous emphasis 
that the choices you make, t hey make a difference . And 
that we can have a role in the choices we make. We 
have a role in setting the course and direction of where 
our life is going.   
It doesn ’t mean that you ’re in charge or in control of 
where it goes . You’re not in charge of where t he path 
opens up , or what comes to you , or what arises 
because of it. But no matter what arises, there ’s always 
a choice. How do I meet this? How am I present for 
this? If something terrible happens, how do I meet that? 
If something beautiful happens, how do I meet that? 
That’s really your choice.  
 
Someone in an interview brought up the concept today 
of nature and nurture. When the person said it,  I 
realiz ed that it works very well for the tension that exists 
in Buddhism between the path of cultivation and the 
path of letting go. Sometimes there ’s this nature, or this 
thing that can bubble up within us that was not our 
doing, and that ’s an important part of the path. But then 
there ’s also the important part of our doing, the efforts 
that we make. So both exi st together. Nature and 
nurture exist together.  
 
So our job, the degree to which we can have something 
to do, is to set the course and decide how we meet the 
moment. And then what arises because of that, that ’s 
maybe the nurture part? And hopefully, we get  nurtured 
by all this. I hope your path nurtures you, supports you 
and brings you a strong sense of well -being, a sense of 
being at home in your own heart.  
 May your heart be at home. So thank you.
