 Okay, so we are making our way through the Satipatthana Sutta and we're getting near the end to the climax. And we're in the fourth foundation of mindfulness, which is the foundations of mindfulness of the dhammas or dharmas. And usually translators will translate this as the mental quality or the mental content, content of mind, the dharmas in this context. It's not so clear what dharma means in this context, but it doesn't really matter so much. What matters is that, is the particular exercises that are given in this section of the text. And the text gives five different exercises for developing mindfulness or ways of establishing mindfulness by focusing on five different areas of our psychological life. And much more so than the earlier sections, which are much more matter of fact, kind of bear attention, just notice things how they are. Here, there's actually much more of a process orientation where the person understands not only things as they are in the moment, the larger process that they're part of, psychological process. In particular, those processes that either lead to greater suffering or keep us in the cycles of suffering, or those processes that lead us to liberation. And so there's five different areas that the text talks about here. The five hindrances, the five aggregates, which we talked about last week. Today, we'll talk about the six bases, the six senses. And then next time we'll talk about seven factors of awakening. And then the last section is the Four Noble Truths. And it's really an amazing collection in this category of dharmas of some of the central teachings that the Buddha taught through his life, central categories of ways in which the Buddha wanted to look at and understand the psychological life that is addressed through practice. And he gave teachings on each of these five in many different ways. And then here in this text, all five are brought together and held together as part of the process of developing mindfulness, as mindfulness leads towards liberation. And you can maybe understand that, that if you want liberation, if you want to be freed from the cycles of suffering, you need to understand something about how suffering comes into play and some of the psychological forces that are responsible for suffering. And you need to have some perception, understanding of those forces that come into play as we get more liberated, become free. So the seven factors of awakening have to do with those psychological processes that come into play as liberation happens. And the Four Noble Truths have to do with the insights that the person either sees or uses as part of the process, the path of liberation. Today's section is on a five basis, six basis, the Ayatanas. And they are, it's probably the part of the Satyabhata-nasutta that's least talked about of all the different sections of the text. Even the corpse meditations are talked about sometimes in talks. But the six basis hardly ever talked about. So in a few moments I'll read it, the little section. The six basis are, there's two categories of them. There's six internal basis and the six external basis. And the internal basis are the six senses. Because in Buddhism there's six senses. There's the normal five that we have. And then there's a sixth sense, which is that sense, sense door, that sense apparatus that perceives or understands what's going on in our life, like our thoughts. And we can see that we're having a thought, there's a sense perception going on or if we have a feeling, an emotion or an intention. In order to perceive that the existence of that, Buddhists will say there's this sense door, the sense that's aware of that. So there's six sense doors. So the door of the eye, the door of the ear, the door of the, or the base of the ear, of the eye, the base of the ear, the base of the tongue, the base of touch, the tactile thing, the base of smell, and then the base of the mind, mind organ, the mind sense. Those are the six internal basis. The six external basis are the objects of those senses. So if you're looking at something that any form that you see in the world, any color that you see in the world, shape you see in the world, is the external sense base that corresponds with the eye. And when an external form somehow comes in contact with the eye, then seeing happens. And so the sounds is the external sense base for hearing and same for smells and for tactile experiences as we get touched in some various ways, and the foods, tastes that come in, and then the thoughts, the feelings, the intentions we have that the mind door picks up. So there's a little bit of Buddhist psychology, kind of how the Buddhists kind of traditionally divide up the senses. Now, what is crucial now in this section here is they talk about paying attention to these six internal bases and six external bases, and paying attention to the knot that can arise in between them, or the yoke or the entanglement. It's usually translated as the fetter. So I might see something, the eye makes contact with an object out there, and then there's some entanglement that arises at that sense door. I want that, or I want to get rid of it or something. So some kind of grasping, some kind of clinging comes into place, and that has this very technical term called a knot, which probably in English, more understandable to call it an entanglement. We get entangled in that thing. The mind somehow gets entangled. So if you're sitting here, an example like of the bell, and you see this beautiful bell that we have, and you think, you know, I want that bell, and you start spending the next five minutes imagining how you might get that bell, you are now entangled in that sight object. So it can happen in any of the six doors, sense doors. And in order, you need to understand disentanglement, because the process, the path of practice is one that leads to the disentangling from all these knots, so that we can just see a bell, and there's no entanglement, where there's no stickiness to it. There's no complications that we have in relationship to the bell. The mind is free in relationship to the bell. See the bell, it's a nice bell. Maybe the thought arises, be nice to have it, but nothing happens. The mind does not entangle, not caught. There's no velcro in the mind around the bell. So that's the kind of the background for this particular section. And here is the paragraph. And this is the Anisirabekus translation. I usually been reading from Bhikkhu Bhoi's translation, but that particular text is in a box in the back somewhere, because they packed up the library for part of this, because they're going to put in the new floor in the library too. So I came down here thinking, I'll just get the book off the bookshelf, and it wasn't there. But this one I did find. So it's a little bit different words. Furthermore, the monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves with reference to the six internal and external sense media. And how does he or she remain focused on mental qualities in and of themselves with reference to the sixfold internal and external sense media? There is a case where he or she discerns the eye, discerns forms, sight objects, and discerns the fetter that arises dependent on them. He or she discerns how there is the arising of an unerisioned fetter, and he or she discerns how there is the abandoning of a fetter once it has arisen. And he or she discerns how there's no further appearance in the future of a fetter that has been abandoned. And the same formula is repeated for the remaining sense media, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. And then there's the refrain that appears at every of these sections. That in this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in and of themselves, or externally on mental qualities in and of themselves. And he or she remains independent, unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves. So it's pretty bare bones, the description, but it's a very fascinating practice that the text is encouraging us to do. And that is to stay attentive at the sense doors, to stay attentive at the primary place where we pick up our experience of the world. And by paying attention there, pay attention to how the mind gets entangled with the world, how it gets caught by it in various ways. Now it doesn't take a lot of analysis to realize that people don't spend a lot of time at the sense doors in a very kind of careful, direct way. We get lost from it very quickly. We spend a lot of time lost, often in a world of abstractions, thinking about the future, thinking about the past, planning, worrying, having conversations, having fantasies. And it might have been stimulated by some initial contact with the world. Driving down 101 and you see a billboard for some wonderful product. And maybe they have billboard for a PDA. Is that what they call them? And you miss your exit because you're fantasizing about how your life will be all better if you can organize it on your palm. And so there was an external contact with a sight object and then the mind got entangled with that and got lost, carried away into that. And people will spend many, many minutes, I mean innumerable number of minutes sometimes, lost in worlds of abstraction. And they're kind of aware of the world. I mean, they don't go bumping into walls and tripping into cars or something. They kind of know. But the primary place where people's awareness is residing is not in the world, but rather it's a little bit, caught up in the inner world of their thoughts and abstractions. And then we have, for example, in Western psychology now, the idea of projection, which the Buddhist equivalent would be this term Papansha. And if the idea of projection is right, I mean, I think some Jungian psychologists believe that that's all we ever do is go around and constantly projecting. We see everything through projections. I don't know if it's that much, but I hope not because the whole Buddhist endeavor would be kind of undercut then. But, you know, so to the degree in which we do kind of see people through the filter of our bias, through our images, through our memories, through all kinds of projections, we're not seeing people directly as they actually are. We're not seeing it at the primary kind of sense contact in a sense, but we're seeing them through the filter of our abstractions. So we're often kind of somewhat removed from our senses. Some people are much more removed than others. They're kind of lost from their senses entirely, not much in touch with their body or touch with what's going on. It's relatively common for people to give Dharma talks. I've heard a number of them emphasizing that everything that we know about the world begins at a sense contact. And everything else after that is something that's built and constructed on that. But everything, our experience of the world, is at the sense doors. There's an idea in Buddhism that the mind is solitary. Our minds are solitary, cave dwelling, solitary creatures. And the explanation for this why the mind is solitary is that minds cannot touch each other. The mind gets touched. We touch each other through the media. Tanjiav, Tanisrebiko calls it the sense media, through the media, through the medium of our senses. We say something and there's all this understanding what people are saying that arises and that touches us in some way. Or we touch each other and physically and that touches us in some deeper way. So there can be a very great intimacy that arises. But the minds don't touch each other ever. So the minds are solitary. But everything, our experience of the world happens through our senses. And so that's what's also considered most real, is what we experience directly through our six senses. The world of abstraction that we build based on the senses may or may not be real. It may be quite fantastical. Fatasmagoric is a wonderful word. The world that sometimes we live in. Where we imagine all kinds of things and what's out there. And so in relationship to the six senses, a very classic and central practice taught by the Buddha is a practice that's usually, a description that's usually described in English or translated into English is as the guarding the sense doors. And I don't like to translate it that way so much because the idea of guarding the sense doors seems to suggest to me a little bit and to others, the idea of kind of being uptight and kind of closed off and kind of like cautious, excessively cautious and kind of holding off, kind of distant removed, guarding the sense doors like as if sense experiences are bad or you're not supposed to have them or something. And so I don't know if that connotations arises for you when you hear about, you should guard your senses, guard the sense doors. But the sense of it I have is a little bit different. And so I translate a little bit differently and that is I translate, I translate it as safeguarding oneself at the sense doors. So safeguarding the quality of our hearts, qualities of our mind, the good quality of our mind, the good quality of our hearts. That so that when we're going around in the world and some stimulus comes that we don't get entangled in that stimulus and the mind doesn't get lost, contracted, uptight, afraid, ambitious, in all kinds of ways which the mind gets caught or entangled. We stay there at the sense doors attentive to what comes in to us. Take responsibility for how we react to that and then try to stay unentangled. Try to maintain a good quality of mind. So one of the ways of doing this is to, that I find very fascinating time, is after your meditation. You meditate in the morning and to some degree your mind might be calmer than usual, it might be more settled, it might be a little bit more higher quality of inner life than it had been if you'd just been running around doing all kinds of things. And so you want to safeguard that nice inner quality, that sense of well-being. And so one of the ways to do it is to stay attentive at the six sense doors to see what comes in to the system and then how you react to that. So you might finish your meditation, you had a lovely meditation in the morning and the first thing you notice after you open your eyes is you notice the clock and the time. Now that's an innocent enough thing, time is an abstraction that human beings have created to some degree and it's arbitrary a little bit how we say it is because we have daylight savings time and not and you know we see this time and but we see this time and then the mind thinks about all the things it has to do during the day and somehow the mind has been knotted up in seeing that. But if you hang out if you don't take responsibility, if you don't pay attention there at the moment then pretty soon you're entangled and lost in the entanglements. But there's an opportunity there as you come out of meditation you have this relative sense of well-being to notice that initial impulse to get entangled in that idea of time and then to back up a little bit. Start over again, just close your eyes or take a deep breath and realize what happened and see if you can just let go of that in order to maintain that good feeling, that good mental quality, that good sense of well-being that might have been there as part of meditation. You safeguard it as opposed to realizing oh time to get started on that big agenda. So we dash off the cushion, we run into the kitchen, we turn on the coffee, we turn on the radio, we turn on the television, we put the food in the toaster and while we're smearing you know butter on the bread we're pulling on our socks and trying to drink the coffee through some other orifice, I don't know how we do it all, and rushing you know along. That's you know one strategy but that doesn't seem, doesn't feel like it's going to maintain much good quality of our inner life right. So part of the opportunity, not exercise, of paying attention to how we get entangled as we leave meditation is that you can also look at the values, the beliefs and the that come into play that get you to think oh it's important now to run around like crazy doing all these things in order to get all these things accomplished. Who says that? There's no manual that goes along you know a human being says thou must do four things at once having breakfast so you can get on with your life and do 32 things in one day. There's no you. So what's the belief systems that come into play that is triggering you to get entangled? That can be a very fascinating study to make as you leave meditation. So safeguarding ourselves at the senses is a classic Buddhist practice. Now one of the senses of course is the mind and so we have to safeguard ourselves what we do with what arises in the mind. So we're sitting there minding our own business and our mind has a thought. Innocent thought about what? Has anybody had an innocent thought today? That you got entangled with? So you're sitting there and thinking about paying debts. Innocent enough thought you know debts I mean debt. Oh and then for the next 24 hours the mind is entangled with thoughts about debt and all the associated thoughts around debt and and you know how could I ever got myself in debt and why didn't my parents give me better financial education growing up and and they didn't have economics and I was in high school and that's you know my school system really sucked back then because they should have taught us about credit cards and all those things and I wasn't you know no one ever taught me about credit cards. And so the mind you know starts getting lost in this inner world that's constructing and making and inventing and reacting to and there can be a lot of contraction a lot of we get entangled to our entanglements. But initially there was just a little simple thought oh I'm in debt and maybe it's not so innocent but but so we have to pay attention there also to the thoughts that arise and not to be take our thinking as some for granted thinking that thinking that that we can think whatever we want. That there is a way which we react to the thoughts that arise. So I like to distinguish between um thought and thinking and the only one I know who says uses the word thought but it's my idea that the mind or the mind does thoughts and it just produces these thoughts and you can't be you can't control what thoughts your mind is going to produce next. But you do have some control over the train of thinking the chain of thoughts that the mind gets involved in and so you don't have to start making a chain of associations and you don't have to get caught up in in thinking. Sometimes you don't seem to have much choice but there's times it's very clear you have choice oh I don't need to think about that. Or now I think I need to start thinking about something else now. It becomes April 13th and it's useful sometimes to think I need to think about paying my taxes how am I going to do that where do I get those tax forms and where do I get my documents and all that. It's a little bit late to have done it probably but but you know it's possible to you know take responsibility a little bit for how we're thinking how we're reacting the intentions that arise you can't control necessarily attention the intention that arises but you can consider how you relate to that intention. So Tanisra Bhikkhu we translated this version here he has this wonderful analogy for the mind that the mind is like a board meeting and and there's all these directors of the board sitting around the table and and however you're the CEO of the board and you have no control over the other directors they do whatever they do I mean you can't control what they say or what they don't say they just say what they're going to do. However the CEO has a veto power and so nothing happens there's no act that's made without the CEO agreeing to go along with it because the CEO will say a veto power so you won't say anything you won't do anything unless you know the CEO has it buys in. So that I think there's a nice analogy how the mind is you know you can't control your mind 100% and all this stuff happens to the mind it's quite marvelous you know how the mind creates thoughts and ideas and images and the mind can be phenomenally creative event the mind has a mind of its own but you have some choice about what you do with what arises in the mind and if nothing else you have the veto power no I'm not going to say that no I'm not going to continue that train of train of thought no I'm not going to act on that and and I think it's very empowering very helpful to realize that these two things that that you're not in charge of what arises pops up in your mind you're in charge of what pops up in your heart necessarily but you have this power of veto you don't say oh no I'm not going to do that I know that I I felt uh starting feeling very comfortable at meetings I used to go to a lot like when I was at zen center and at spirit rock various places where there were a lot of contentious things being discussed and when I realized that we basically were operating under a consensus model and and if I said no I don't think I want to go along with that then everybody stopped the whole process kind of stopped or whatever and so I didn't have to rush in and say what I thought immediately I could just watch the conversation for a while and I didn't have to feel tight or upset about it or tense about what was going on and my opinion and when it was heard and I could just wait and when it's time since time was right when there's a pause in the conversation I say oh you know I don't think I agree with that anyway so I hope that analogy is helpful for you guys in your minds that you have the veto power so our whole experience of the world begins at the sense doors and pretty much everything else is an abstraction based on that and it might be a relevant or accurate abstraction of sorts but but it is an abstraction so what happens if we come down as our living much more at the primary level where life is initially initiated where life has begun at the experiences of the senses of the world now that comes very close to or maybe the same thing as a common instruction be in the present moment as you practice mindfulness be in the present be in the present notice what's going on the wind blowing against your cheek or the sounds of the car driving by or or you know whatever that whatever is going on the experience of your breathing as you breathe but to practice a kind of sensory awareness exercise I like to think of mindfulness as a sensory awareness exercise because such a huge part of mindfulness is to stay there at the level of the senses and experiences what's happening at the felt sense of our experience what's happening at the sense point of all our experiences so we have a strong emotion that arises a difficult emotion perhaps and then the task of mindfulness the primary one is to be with the felt sense of that difficult emotion a strong emotion what it's like sensually at the sense level as opposed to spending a lot of time analyzing or thinking about why it's there just kind of be there for how it is in this moment now at the sixth senses which includes also the mind which you know a lot of things could be happening there but but staying there as it's unfolding in the present moment in the present moment as experienced at these sixth sense doors and then becoming aware of the fetters of the knots of some yojana the the entanglements that arise and and then learning how to let go of those entanglements learning how to untangle yourself so that our experiences of the senses or experiences of the world and experiences of our inner life is one that is unentangled unencumbered uh unobstructed just kind of a clean clear relationship to how things are happening in the present moment the classic um definition one of the most classic definitions of what happens to a person when they get liberated in buddhism is a description of absence what what what is what a person is free from there's very little there's a little bit hints there here and there but there's very little description in the classic buddhist text of a kind of positive experience that the um there's very little description or definition of enlightenment in terms of what is present like you have some great experience or this we're experienced oneness with nature or or self you know no self or or um you know infinite consciousness so there's all you know all kinds of ways in which people define enlightenment and maybe they're all fine and wonderful but the buddhist tradition doesn't define hardly ever enlightenment from the point of view of what is present but rather does it from the point of view of what is absent and it does primarily then through the classically through the abs the ten knots the ten entanglements that a person has become free from and the same word some the ten fetters and if i go through the list maybe they don't make complete sense to you but just keep it keep it maybe there in the back of your mind the seed the first fetter the first way we can tangled unnecessarily with the world is by taking things personally have you heard that before it's called the personality view having the personality view kind of the view that you know that there is a kind of person here that you can define by your experiences in some way and the second is um the um the entanglement of doubt and um it said that until you really had some real taste of liberation it's a little hard to really know for sure what is and isn't the path of practice and so the mind will almost naturally have a little bit of doubt and um i said that that fetter of doubt will vanish at some point the third uh fetter is that fetter uh the entanglement of believing that uh rights and rituals in and of themselves or virtue in and of itself will lead a person to liberation and often people say it's like believing that simply chanting a mantra or going through certain kind of rituals or carrying crystals or something is going to kind of do what it takes to become enlightened there may be wonderful things to do but the tradition says that if you believe this is what's going to get you ultimately liberated that's an entanglement and that entanglement you become free of when you really understand the nature of the practice and what the practice what it takes to become free of the tangles the fourth fetter is the fetter of sensual desire and it doesn't take a lot of thinking to realize how much we you know we get human beings um occasionally at least get entangled to sensual desire all kinds the fifth the fifth is um the uh tangle of ill will of resentment of anger of bitterness of hate of aversion and that's a place people get entangled with their world with themselves so that fetter dissolves the sixth is uh fetter is the attachment or clinging actually the sixth and the seventh both of them are at um clings to uh particular deep states of meditation and i like to think of it as being clinging to spiritual experiences there's no spiritual experience which you're supposed to cling to in buddhism and in fact maybe one of the reasons why enlightenment is defined by the absence of something is that we don't confuse enlightenment by some spiritual experience some experience is going to be the thing so um that fetter of clinging to spiritual experiences after all these years of spiritual practice i finally got this great experience of oneness it's got it don't hold on to it don't cling to that and then um so then there's um the seventh one is the seventh way in which we get kind of entangled with the world is conceit all the ways in which we compare ourselves to others or to certain standards i'm better than and worse than all kinds of things conceit then ninth is um this is a very interesting one and uh is restlessness and i'm not sure exactly how that works myself it is considered to be a very high i understand restlessness as being full of suffering but how it actually talks about as an entanglement how restlessness kind of i think there's kind of can be a kind of very deep seated restlessness that keeps us always going and wanting and so you know it's the fuel for being entangled like a workaholic but you don't have but you know workaholic i mean our poor minds even if you're completely you know minds sometimes work over time even if we're not working and then um but you can see you know you sit down and meditate and you sit you're saying sometimes you can sit very quietly in meditation and you sit from retreat maybe for many days and you and there's still a kind of agitation deep down very deep layer of agitation that's keeping the mind going keeping the mind spinning out into thoughts and concerns even though there's a lot of relaxation a lot of ease that's happening that agitation is still operating and perhaps you know that's what keeps us inside agitation that keeps us entangled keeps us involved or caught by things and then the tenth entanglement is the entanglement of ignorance of of ignoring of not understanding specifically not understanding the four noble truths so if you don't understand the four noble truths then um it's really hard to understand where to find the path of practice the part of the function of the four noble truths is to help us find the path to liberation and so if you understand your experience through the four noble truths you find the path to untangling but if you don't understand if you ignore your experience if you ignore the four noble truths as an orientation for you understanding your experience then you'll stay entangled especially eight was conceit six and seven I lumped together six and seven I lumped together as attachment to spiritual experiences the two different categories of spiritual experiences I just lumped them together okay so the entanglements so stay close at hand with your sense experience and notice how you get entangled notice how you get caught and then see if you can uncaught yourself uncatch yourself loosen yourself and all that and um and in any case it's really healthy and really beautiful and wonderful to live in our senses and I recommend it to all of you and I hope that it helps you in the wonderful practice of safeguarding your sense your sense safeguarding your safeguarding yourself at the sense stores so we have about four minutes if anybody would like to ask any questions or make some comments about this this would be a good time yes you said that this these things aren't normally taught why is that um I think maybe it kind of uh maybe not so easy to talk about in a way that uh you know is compelling or you know or I don't know exactly I mean it just there's a list of six I mean you know that's kind of dry I don't have a good answer for you sorry yes you said that what is real is what you can perceive what is real is what you can't perceive so what our senses are but we can't sense ultraviolet we can't sense infrared we can't sense oh so what's empirically real so I mean I mean see the the uh first of all you know this ancient Buddhist tradition was 2500 years ago they were considering this and what they're concerned about is really understanding our own empirical experiences because that is where uh that's where that suffering and freedom of suffering will occur and so it doesn't really matter you know what is real beyond our sense experience is is kind of for the purposes of liberation is not that interesting so ultraviolet light is not so interesting for the purposes of of personal liberation of freeing yourself from these fetters these these tangles so so um so I probably spoke not so well then because I said what is real but what's real for the purposes what's what's real as empirical experiences that belong to the domain of our you know how we suffer and how we create our world it begins at the sense doors does that help at all yes spiritual experiences okay so that the um what what they're what these uh they refer to the eight eight jhanas eight absorptions that people do deep concentration work so um and there's two categories of these there's the first four which is the called the absorptions on form and so that's uh fetter number six and then this fetter number seven is the absorption in the formless realm the last of four jhanas okay so um so then the plan is for next week to talk about the seven factors of awakening and it turns out it's pretty much a coincidence but um in december we have a dharma practice day which is these days on friday we kind of look at some subject in buddhism and now the next one in december we're going to talk we're going to look at the seven factors of awakening so you could hear the lecture the talk next monday and then you can if you're interested to go further with it and you can come to that dharmapraktas day in december so um thank you
