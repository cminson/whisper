Those of you who have your camera on I have my trusted assistant here meditating with me
So Flora will be joining in our meditation instructions this morning
When I was doing yoga she got on my seat and has decided to stay so
Working with what at what is in our meditation instructions
We have been working with the four foundations of mindfulness and we've been focusing on the body
Today we'll be bringing in the second foundation of mindfulness and
That is mindfulness of what is called in Pali is Vedana v e d a n a and
The best translation for that in English is feeling tone. I
also like the term valence and
What that means is that in each moment there is a valence or a feeling tone that accompanies the experience
That as we're mindful we can be mindful if the feeling tone is pleasant or
Unpleasant or neither unpleasant or pleasant, which is neutral
And so as we practice we can bring this in
and
The instructions for working with Vedana are very simple not easy, but simple
And that is to notice when it's what is present
So in the moment noticing if it's pleasant
Noticing if it's unpleasant and noticing if it's neutral
and this has been a very rich place of practice for me number one because there's only three choices and
So it's very helpful to focus the mind and be like, oh
The mind is spinning off and be focusing on. Oh, what is the what is the Atmos? What is the reading?
What is the feeling tone? Is it pleasant?
It's unpleasant and then the accompanying body sensations that go along with it
So if it's pleasant, I might begin to feel my body moving towards or the
Wanting or if it's unpleasant. I might begin to feel the body kind of having that reaction of moving away
So to me this is a very powerful practice and I want to
Give a quote here
from Victor Frankel who was an Austrian neurologist
psychiatrist and also Holocaust Holocaust survivor and
What he says which I find very useful for our practice is between stimulus and response
Between stimulus and response there is a space
In that space is our power and our freedom to choose our response
in our response lies our growth and our happiness
So between stimulus and response there is a space
And in that space is our power and our freedom to choose our response
And our response lies our growth and our happiness
And I bring this in because I think that as we look at how our minds are moved by pleasant
or unpleasant, we are in that place of increasing our opportunities to choose.
So let's begin our meditation now. We'll begin by focusing on the body and then we'll be moving
into the feeling tone. So starting your practice in the way that you do, connecting with whatever is
your primary object, perhaps sounds, perhaps the body, or the breath, wherever you feel the breath
the most easily. Beginning again in each moment.
And if possible to offer an attitude of kindness towards your meditation, a sense of loving awareness,
connecting with the body as it is,
meeting yourself,
and during the meditation today, I'll be offering some specific instructions around feeling tone.
And at any point it feels more appropriate for you, you're welcome to return to whatever your primary object is.
You may notice with the sound that there is an accompanying valence, perhaps pleasant, maybe
unpleasant, or perhaps neutral. Just noticing as you bring your awareness to sounds, if you can attune to the sense of whether the sound
that's arising is pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
As you're paying attention to sounds as they arise and pass away, see if it's possible to let go of the idea or the
concept about what is making the sound and simply be with the direct experience of the sound being heard.
Perhaps noticing as we pay attention to sounds that we can invite a receptive quality of attention that we're not going out to meet the
sounds that our ears are receiving the sounds. And as this happens, perhaps you may notice that there's a space between the sounds.
As they arise and pass away, this is a useful place to explore the feeling tone. In that moment, you may be able to recognize a sense of
pleasant, or unpleasant, or neutral.
Noticing as the sound arises, what the feeling tone is, pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
Unpleasant, or neutral.
Unpleasant, or neutral.
Unpleasant, or neutral.
Unpleasant, or neutral.
Now inviting our awareness to settle in the body, that kind, loving awareness that we've been cultivating.
Connecting to the body as much as is possible.
Concentration is to notice if you can feel any experience of pleasantness in the body. Perhaps in the hands, they touch each other, or resting on your
legs, or belly, wherever they may be. Sensing wherever in the body, there might be a pleasant sensation.
Wherever that might be for you.
And letting go of that focus on the pleasant sensation in the body.
Broadening the awareness as much as possible to include the whole body.
And see if perhaps there may be a place in the body that has a feeling tone of unpleasant.
That as our mindfulness meets that part of the body, there's a sensation, an accompanying feeling tone of unpleasant.
That as our mindfulness meets that part of the body.
Let go of that sensation of unpleasant that you've connected with in your body.
Returning to a more spacious connection with your whole body.
And inviting into your awareness some place in the body that registers as neutral, either pleasant, nor unpleasant.
And not have noticed before this area in the body, maybe your elbows or your ankle, your ears.
Some place in the body that has a neutral feeling tone.
As we guide our meditation, directing our mindfulness to different areas of the body.
You may begin to notice your response if there's a reaction that arises in relationship.
If there's a reaction that arises in relationship to the feeling tone in the body.
Often times we may begin to notice that when something pleasant arises, there's a liking.
We might have a preference.
There might be a sense that we're doing something right.
There might be a holding on to the pleasant.
Notice if any of these arise for you.
And when an unpleasant sensation arises, we can notice the response, the attitude, the relationship.
See if there is resistance to the unpleasant, see if there might be fear arising or desire to reject the experience of what is happening.
Or perhaps the idea that we're doing something wrong.
In the arising of Vedana with each moment, we can begin to experience the field of changing sensations from pleasant, pleasant, unpleasant, unpleasant.
Neutral as not me, not mine, not myself.
And begin to see how the body might respond, how the mind might respond when a pleasant experience arises, when an unpleasant experience arises.
And then there's neutral.
Often times we overlook neutral.
We only experience it when we realize another sensation or feeling such as boredom or restlessness, disinterest.
And as we bring our awareness to the Vedana, the feeling tone, we can begin to notice their impermanent nature.
Their rising and passing away of each feeling tone.
Continue on like this, noticing the pleasant, unpleasant or neutral feeling tone that arises in each moment.
Or returning to the breath in the body or whatever your anchor may be.
