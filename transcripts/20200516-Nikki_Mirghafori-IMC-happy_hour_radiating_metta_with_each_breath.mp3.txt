Wonderful.
Happy Saturday morning or afternoon or evening, whatever your time zone
might be you're calling in from right now.
And I'd like to welcome you to Happy Hour.
So for our practice this morning, what I'd like to guide us in is a meta,
a loving kindness practice, a well-wishing for everyone, for all beings.
And something that's beautiful about practice of loving kindness, about
meta practice, this practice of cultivating, ruminating about friendliness,
really bringing about a sense of friendliness and goodwill, goodwill for the world.
It's a practice of gladdening of our own heart, making our own heart
and our own minds happy. And it's also a practice of creating
safety in our own space, in our own hearts, in our own minds.
Because especially nowadays when we turn each and every corner and seems like
there is bad news and challenges here, challenges there, a practice like this,
a practice of wishing, meta wishing, goodness for the world can actually bring
a sense of living in a friendly universe, which can be actually very,
very helpful for our own functioning, for our own well-being to feel that
we are living in a friendly universe versus an unfriendly universe.
So I like to offer this practice, and I've been doing it actually myself,
especially the past day, and realizing, ah, this just feels so good to be landing,
to be resting in this space of goodness. It feels like there is goodness all around.
There is sense of well-being all around, which is just from the sense of
the one that's created in my own mind. So without further ado, I'd like to start
guiding us in this meditation. So I invite you to make yourself comfortable
wherever you're sitting. If you need to move, this is a great time to make yourself comfortable.
And arriving, arriving in your own body.
Landing in this moment.
Ah, letting your body relax and soften.
Let it land, as if you're landing in a warm bath this morning.
The same sense of ease and welcoming, relaxation, being in a warm bath.
And if the invocation of the feeling,
the image of a warm bath does not work for you, maybe.
Invoke the sense of you're sitting or lying on the grass outside on a sunny day,
watching the sky on a weekend, just relaxing,
feeling safe,
feeling the sun on your face, the warmth.
Allowing yourself to feel your body.
Relaxing, softening, opening up,
offering up any tension your body might be holding.
And letting your breath move as it does in and out of the body on its own.
It's not so much that you are breathing, the breath is breathing itself.
Let it fill you up.
Let the breath visit every nook and cranny of the body,
filling up the areas that are tied to tense.
That they don't have any awareness in them.
To fill them up with the breath, with awareness, your whole body.
And with each in-breath, letting there be more filling out,
more filling up of your body.
Starting with your toes, the extremities.
Filling as if you are an inflatable doll.
Letting your toes be filled up, inflated with awareness with the breath.
Sensations of contact, warmth or coolness in your toes, your feet.
The sense of interest, curiosity.
What does it feel like if your toes, your feet feel more full?
Of awareness with sensations.
Moving up, filling your legs, lower legs and upper legs.
With lower awareness of the breath, awakens this part of your body to sensations.
And naturally, if there is any tension or holding, it melts away.
Moving up and filling the area of your sit bones, your bottom and the groin area.
With the breath, with awareness.
With sensations of contact, being grounded.
With the breath, awareness of the breath.
Moving up to your abdomen, your chest.
Letting your trunk be filled with sensations of breathing.
The curiosity, the interest, the joy.
How this stands of the movement in your belly and your cage.
Getting your shoulders, your neck relaxed, be filled with breath, awareness, your arms, your hands.
And your entire face.
Letting your forehead be soft, your eyes resting in their socket.
Then your jaw relaxed.
Maybe even letting your mouth fall open for a moment as you experiment what it feels for the jaw to be relaxed.
Not in its usual position.
Not touching from the inside your whole face with your breath, with the movement.
Filling out.
The wrinkles on your forehead, on your face get smoothed out as they get filled out with more breath sensation.
Naturally.
Now letting your whole body have the sense of being full, full of the breath, full of awareness.
With each in breath.
More aliveness, more wakefulness.
And with each out breath, landing more deeply.
Letting go of any tightness or holding.
Letting go of any tightness or holding.
And if there's any thoughts, emotions, mind states or feelings in the body arising.
Letting there be an expansiveness to the breath.
That includes them, this breath of awareness filling out your body.
That also touches, holds, soothes and calms.
Any agitation in the body or in the mind.
Letting go.
Spending a few more minutes tilling the soil of calm abiding, settling, settling.
Before we turn to the practice of metta.
Letting go.
Now as you continue to receive the breath.
The breath imbuing the body with awareness.
Consider the breath as a life giving breath.
The sense of goodness that the breath fills your body with.
The sense of goodness or perhaps goodwill of the universe.
Filling your lungs, filling your whole body.
Letting yourself feel nourished, supported, filled with the goodness that's offered to you freely.
And you don't even have to work for it.
Can there be a sense of delight in receiving this goodness, this gift of goodness?
As if the universe, the world is wishing you well.
Nurturing, nourishing this body.
And let there be a sense of appreciation, gladness.
Maybe a smile shows up, in fact, trying on a smile.
As you receive this gift of each and every breath.
And then in turn, turning this goodwill onto the world.
As if you were beaming your smile, as if you were lighting up the world with the gesture the offer of your friendliness.
The same way that as you would pass a passerby, you would offer a smile perhaps, or say hello, good morning.
Offering goodwill, friendliness to the world.
And as the world is offering goodwill to you, filling your whole body with air, with kindness, with goodness, of the breath.
Letting your whole body radiate that recycled goodness.
Goodness received, goodness radiated out.
Just a sense of friendliness.
Friendliness with the air around you.
Friendliness with the sounds around you.
Friendliness with all the beings.
In your home, in your neighborhood.
Feeling that the source of your friendliness is endless, every breath, filling your body, resonating.
Filling up your body.
Brings in goodness and friendliness.
And it's not so much work.
You're not pushing it out.
It's certainly being beamed out.
You're just the conduit for this friendliness, for the goodwill.
For the meta.
And as we come to an end of our practice together.
Letting the sense of meta filling your body.
Letting it sense, letting it fill all the beings with you.
Practicing together in this Zoom room on YouTube.
All practitioners everywhere.
All non-practitioners everywhere.
Non-discriminate.
And imagining perhaps that as this radiating of goodwill touches people it brings them happiness.
It brings them goodness.
Bringing a few people in mind, a few beings, a few animals, birds, fish.
A few animals.
May all beings everywhere.
May all beings including yourself be safe.
May all beings everywhere be happy.
May all beings everywhere be healthy.
May all beings everywhere have peace and ease, take care of themselves happily.
May all beings everywhere be happy.
So the practice of meta, especially in this way, this different way of getting into it with the breath.
With the breath, with our own bodies, can have the sense of feeling of radiating naturally from our breath.
And it can feel effortless if we allow this invitation of just being a conduit.
That breath is filling us with goodness, goodwill from the universe and it's just being radiated out.
So the sense of safety all around.
I'd like to invite you if you want to share a word in chat.
What is coming up for you in this moment, sharing a reflection?
I feel a lot more settled and calm and I just want to smile right now.
Actually a smile is coming up for me, I just want to smile.
You're welcome to share any reflections if you would.
Deep rest.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
Lovely.
Drake, tingly, Beverly, calmness.
A gathering of myself.
Shannon, thank you.
Nancy, allergies.
Is it possible to smile at the allergies?
I'm sorry.
Calming, let's do it.
Calming, thank you.
Nice.
As Nancy is sharing allergies, I also want to share that everything is welcome.
Whatever is arising and the practice of metta, a part of it is to meet with friendliness.
Whatever is arising to see if there can be a non-conflict.
Allergies are happening right now.
It's like this, hello allergies, hello old friend.
Because they're going to be here.
So if our relationship to them is non-conflictual, one of friendliness,
could it support our heart in less suffering?
A couple of offerings, reflections from YouTube, which is a little delayed.
Alignment, warmth and ease.
Thankful and peaceful.
Lovely.
Thank you all.
So thank you all for practicing this morning, not just for yourself, but for the whole world.
So this is the time that during happy hour, we transition to a few minutes of deep listening
and sharing with a small group of three people.
And it's a time to see this practice, how this practice can actually feel interactive,
how when we actually open our eyes and go about in the world,
how we can actually practice deeply with a few other people in the sandbox.
Can we hold them with care, with kindness the same way that we are radiating?
Can we radiate this sense of goodwill and kindness in a Zoom room and just radiate kindness
as if they can say no wrong and be held with a sense of kindness.
And see what that feels like just to be listened to without being interrupted.
So for people who are on YouTube, you're welcome to join us on Zoom right now if you want to.
The room is still open.
And basically the prompt is how are you right now?
There is no right or wrong.
How are you right now?
And the process, is it one of deep listening? Each person will have a couple of minutes.
I will broadcast the time in the meeting rooms.
And each person will have a couple of minutes just to speak, just to speak.
And others will be doing deep listening, not interrupting, not asking questions.
It's a practice of metta in community.
Can you radiate metta with goodwill?
Listen to someone with goodwill, maybe with a smile, try it out.
And also see what it feels like to be listened to in that way.
So I'm going to create the Zoom rooms and the breakout rooms here.
Here we go.
It would be lovely to hear any reflections that you may have if you like to share or any questions from either the first part
or the second part of the practice, the first part being the silent meditation
and the second part being the interactive practice in community with radiating metta.
And you're welcome to raise your hand and I will unmute you or you can unmute yourself now.
Or you can type it in chat.
So very grateful for this new paradigm of connecting with other folks.
Thank you. Thank you Paula. Thank you.
Lovely.
Do you want to say a word?
There we go. I just love being this new way of connecting with people.
It just thrills me.
I love it.
I do gills morning meditation every weekday and to see all the people checking in from all over the world,
I just love it.
So thank you. Thank you everyone. I appreciate it.
Thank you. Thank you for being here, being part of the community.
And like you, I also take delight in seeing all the places from which people come in and practice together.
It's a worldwide Sangha and also the interaction in these small groups.
It's just so beautiful from all over the place. It's hard for me.
It's great.
Thank you Paula.
Trudy please.
Connection is a natural thing.
It's the way things are.
We just didn't know or I didn't know.
And also I want to thank you for adding this Saturday.
It's a nice surprise and a nice treat.
So thank you.
Thank you. Thank you Trudy. Thank you for that.
It's sweet. I have to admit publicly I'm not a morning person.
So this is definitely a stretch for me.
And it's quite lovely.
It's easier for me to get up and listen to Gil than to be prepared to teach myself at 7am.
So yeah.
Great. Lovely. Any other last minute reflections or questions while we have just a minute left?
Yes please.
William.
Oops. Let's see. I just unmuted you. There you go.
Hi. Yeah. I wanted to share because it was a revelation for me.
In the middle of the meditation there were what I would used to label.
I still probably do label as noises in my area.
And then there's something probably you said and then my mind started deciding that there were sounds instead of noises.
And I just wanted to share that. It was very interesting.
All of a sudden it's like oh those are sounds. They're not noises.
Love it. Thank you so much for sharing that.
Yeah. Isn't it amazing how our perception really decides whether oh they're noises or they're awful.
I'm suffering. I don't like them or they're just sounds.
They're just sounds. And so it's really in here that the stimulus out there is the same exact sound.
The same exact wave form being produced.
Molecules moving in the air is the same thing but how it affects us.
It's really inside. Thank you so much for sharing how that shifted for you.
And meta is actually this is the way things can shift and who suffers less.
Great. Beautiful. Well it's eight o'clock and I wish you a wonderful morning day night whatever your time zone may be.
And thank you so much for joining us and dedicating the merit of our practice together to all things everywhere.
Thank you. Thanks everyone. Take good care. Be well.
Thank you. Bye bye. Bye.
