 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good evening and welcome everyone. Welcome and Happy New Year. I'm really grateful for each of you being here this evening. And my heart is full of appreciation and well wishes for whatever conditions you each may be facing. Wishing you safety and health in the grip of the storms that continue to pummel parts of the U.S. and the world this winter, as well as the many social and health conditions we all face worldwide. I want to extend appreciation to those who were here for my two sessions last week. I was struggling through a respiratory virus and I was very low energy. I had planned more content for those two sessions and to my surprise, when we sat down together, I found that the Dharma talk I planned to share just fell away. And what seemed relevant and all my energy could hold at the time was a period of guided meditation together, followed by your sharing in your breakout groups. So that experience relates to what I'll be sharing and inviting us into as a group this evening. Because in what happened last week, I noticed a significant shift in my inner voice compared to what would have happened in the past, had I offered a guided sitting but no talk. The heart-mind recognized with compassion that it was important to honor the state of my body, heart and mind in that moment, even while I wanted to be of service to everyone in this group. I was at peace with what unfolded. In the past, my inner dialogue might have included a lot of self-judgment for not giving a Dharma talk. I might have also let the thinking mind take off in some unwholesome directions, thinking people might not have liked the evening or that some may have left before the end out of disappointment, and on and on. But instead, as of those moments on the 28th and the 30th, all the practice I've done with metta and compassion, as well as the meditation sessions and daily life practice I've done, working with the hindrances of greed, aversion, regret, restlessness, doubt, all of those experiences have begun to shift in a more compassionate direction. I recognize that what had come to be in those evenings last week was what I was able to offer. There was also some ability to honor something else I've noticed in practicing over time. It's very important and supportive to come to group sittings and to take in Dharma talks. They foster ones unfolding in the practice, and as we work with them, they help us grow. But I've also come to realize that I could at times almost be greedy for Dharma talks, almost like a consumer eating one Dharma talk after another, and sometimes this was out of balance with the simple noticing of my own experience in silent sitting, sitting after sitting, day after day, month after month, year after year. I mentioned last week that the Buddha's reported instruction about the value of Dharma Friends, that Dharma Friendship is the whole of the practice. And I shared that I've learned a lot from sharing and discussing with Dharma Friends in groups like this. It's also immensely valuable in the path of practice, but also over time it becomes important to balance that with being in solitude with one's direct experience, being face to face with where we are still stuck or still suffering, and doing the work to find courage, to find confidence in the face of it, and to find persistence to keep being present with even the unpleasant. The practices we do during happy hour, especially purify and develop the heart, doing loving kindness and compassion practices, these can be our allies in finding persistence, courage, and confidence. They can help us recognize our inner voice and begin to shift the inner voice. The inner voice is a very important thing to hear and receive even while doing these practices. Instead of ignoring the inner voice, shoving it away, or saying the kindness and compassion phrases, almost like we're trying to block them out, it's useful to receive all of it. The inner voice and the kindness phrases and the compassion phrases. For some of us, the inner voice might be one of self-judgment or aversion towards the less than perfect practice we have, or life we have, or relationships we have. For others, the inner voice might be one of criticism or judgment of the difficult other people in our lives. Sometimes we might have both going or they might be alternating. Or the inner voice could be one of peace and calm and care for other people. Through loving kindness and compassion practices, the inner voice can over time become this compassion for ourselves and others. It can recognize that none of us is perfect. Everyone is doing the best they can. It could even feel some awe at the number and intensity of challenges we face as human beings. It can balance the healthy effort that we devote to turning the heart-mind towards freedom from suffering, towards freedom from greed, harming and cruelty. It balances those efforts with forgiveness for the ways in which we fall short. It can help create a balance such that we're not complacent, apathetic, or going way too easy on ourselves and others, but we're also not harsh taskmasters, always judging and striving and pushing ourselves and others without any empathy. So with that, let's settle into this evening's meditation. Allowing the body-heart-mind some time to find whatever level of ease and relaxation is possible in this moment. Softening the feet against the floor, the legs against the chair or cushion. Softening whatever can be softened in the belly, the chest, the lower back and upper back. Perhaps relaxing the hands and arms, letting the shoulders drop. Allowing whatever can be relaxed, even just a little, to relax. And if an area cannot be softened or is tense in staying that way, simply allowing that to be just as it is. Letting the neck and the jaw muscles soften. Softening around the eyes. Relaxing the forehead, the muscles at the crown of the head. Releasing the whole body, any part and whole that can be released. Perhaps bringing some ease to the mind. Allowing any preoccupations or thoughts to recede into the background. Or setting them aside for now. They'll be there if you want to pick them up later after this session. Recognizing what level of energy is available. Attuning to it. However it is right now, it might be high energy, a flow of healthy effort. It might be very low. Recovering, resting. Perhaps changing as the evening progresses. Allowing any inner voice that arises. Perhaps recognizing if the way you talk to yourself mentally is a frequent visitor or an occasional event. Even if it's totally absent, perhaps there's silence in the mind. Whatever is present, letting that fill the heart and mind. And perhaps extending some wishes or inclinations of mind, not demands, just simple wishes. May I receive any thinking with compassion? Receive whatever state of mind is present with compassion. May I be kind towards the inner voice or towards the inner silence, whichever is arising. May I simply be present with whatever is arising, noticing the tone of it. Noticing perhaps how it is felt in the body. May this mind be content and happy. May this heart be safe and free from harm. May this body be peaceful and healthy. And for whatever difficult conditions there are, may this suffering come to an end. May this mind be content and happy. May the inner voice be content. May this heart be safe and free from harm. May this body be peaceful and healthy. And for whatever difficult conditions there are, may this suffering come to an end. And continuing to extend these wishes to yourself, to your heart, mind and body, and even allowing whatever spontaneous, wholesome wishes you have to arise, allowing your own phrases to come to mind. And practice this way for some time. A little later we may bring another person or people into the meditation, but for now extending these kind and compassionate wishes to this heart, this body, this mind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. From the Madhuk Rusticwe bind. Thank you. Thank you. Got it? Thanks, Michael. attention drifts away, gently bringing it back to kind wishes for this body, this heart, and this mind.
