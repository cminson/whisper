 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good morning or good day. Welcome. And the Buddha said that, slightly slight paraphrase, that tranquility supports tranquility. And this can be understood that if you let yourself become aware of the tranquility that's here, the tranquility can grow. If you ignore whatever tranquility is here, it doesn't support the growth of more tranquility. And in this Satipatthana practice, the first exercise with breathing, the tranquility that is focused on is tranquility of the body. And so, some translations will say that the last exercise is breathing in when tranquilizes the bodily formations, tranquilizes the bodily constructs, the tension, the holdings, the part, the way the muscles are engaged very subtly, based on how the mind is. Breathing out when tranquilizes the bodily formations, the bodily activities. And so, there is this movement towards tranquility in this practice that begins when we start, just taking the posture. And seeing if you can find a posture that supports tranquility, some modicum, some minimum kind of feeling of being, the body is still, but not just still. Tranquility is a certain stillness that has a wholesome feeling to it. It feels refreshing or feels nice. And the deep tranquility of meditation practice is not a kind of calm that puts us to sleep. It's a kind of clarity, energized clarity, that's very peaceful. And as the practice deepens, awareness takes on qualities of tranquility itself. Awareness becomes peaceful. And the analogy I have for it is, being in some very beautiful, wonderful sacred space, it could be some great cathedral in the natural world of great big redwood trees or great mountains or looking out across the sea. It could be one of the large great cathedral where you go in and it has this, maybe the busy noisy streets are outside and you go inside and there's a quiet and a peace. That stillness. And in these spaces, awareness is there, present, without having to work for it, without having to search for it or direct it or do anything. It's just somehow the space, the situation, just allows for kind of a spacious, open wide awareness that somehow is attuned or becomes part of the peacefulness of the place, the quiet of the place. And attention is not directed. It isn't like awareness is being used or it's work. It's simply present. It's there. And there might be other places that in your life where just awareness is just there in a nice way. It could be that something as simple as waking up from a very refreshing nap and you just feel like, oh, you're just aware, you're not really focusing or trying to do anything with it. But you're just, you're clearly aware and it's kind of a clarity. Or maybe looking out across a great expanse of natural world, being on a cliff from the mountainside. And it just, the situation just calls on, awakens a kind of tranquil open awareness that's not searching for something, not trying to focus on something. It's just there. The awareness is present. So in this Satipatthana here in the first exercise, there is a gentle movement that takes time that involves establishing awareness, settling in on the breathing, letting the settling on the breathing settle the mind, settle the body until it becomes easier just to relax the body more and more and help the body become tranquil and appreciating the tranquility of the body. And when that's established, then awareness doesn't have to be directed so much anymore. It doesn't have to be work. It doesn't have to be like making effort to know what's happening or to feel what's happening. And it's not just feeling, it's not just knowing. It's this kind of broader, maybe it's the gestalt or the harmonious working of all our attentional capacities into a state that we might call being aware. And then having this awareness established or present and abiding in it. So I'm describing a process, and I'll say more later. So for today, let's focus a little bit more on this tranquility and see if tranquility awareness can take on some of the qualities of tranquility. So assuming a posture that will allow your body to be tranquil and still, but it should be a posture that also has some degree of alertness to it, a little bit, a teeny bit energized. So the energy, the alertness, maybe the uprightness can hold the tranquility, gently closing the eyes. And then noticing, is there any hints of tranquility for you now in your body, your mind, your heart? Maybe it's even in your little finger, your big toe or something, but anywhere at all. And then in a manner that has some degree of tranquility or calm in it, calmly take some larger breaths. And then as you exhale, calmly soften the body, calmly relax your body. And then to let your breathing return to normal, and calmly taking your time as you breathe normally, search through your body for places that you can relax, soften. And as you do so, see if that can be a settling into a degree of tranquility or peace. Letting your breathing return to normal. And seeing if there can be a little bit of sense of tranquility or calm in establishing your attention and experience of the body breathing. Breathing in and breathing out. Perhaps if it's present, if some tranquility is present for you, maybe that can be the atmosphere within which you're breathing. An atmosphere that includes awareness, tranquil awareness. Breathing in and breathing out. If your mind wanders off, relax something. Relax any holding or tension in the thinking, any or in the body related to thinking. And see if you can settle back in to a tranquil awareness. It's more like the atmosphere than it is doing, but within which breathing is the center. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. A tranquility that makes room for the kind of awareness that doesn't require effort. The kind of awareness that just is. Some people might call it just being conscious. Tranquil, conscious in a tranquil way. The effortless way of being conscious with breathing, breathing through that effortless awareness. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. The tranquility shared, some way that it's shared by awareness, by being aware, being conscious. And imagine that with whatever calm, tranquility, peacefulness you have, that you're sitting together with someone you trust, someone that you it's easy and peaceful to be with. And nothing's required, nothing needs to be said. But see what it's like. What would it be like to sit there, aware of them, present with them, through this tranquility, through this peacefulness? Perhaps appreciating them. Perhaps having goodwill, care for them. Nothing's required. The care, the goodwill, nothing needs to be done. Just let it be there in the peacefulness, in the care. And with that kind of goodwill, staying in that place of tranquility, expand your goodwill now out into the world. Tranquility wishing all beings well. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may my peacefulness create the conditions that support them in feeling those ways. May all beings be free.
