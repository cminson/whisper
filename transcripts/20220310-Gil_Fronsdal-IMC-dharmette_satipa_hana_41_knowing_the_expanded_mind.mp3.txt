The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So we're now continuing to talk about the third foundation of mindfulness.
But I would like to point out that in the second, third, and fourth,
each of them, as the description of the practice unfolds, there is a shift.
And I like to think of each of these three as being progressive,
or describing a little journey that a meditator takes.
And the second foundation, when begins by just becoming aware of the feeling tone of experience,
pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral,
as we settle in and become more familiar with it, more sensitive,
we're able then to distinguish between those things which are pleasant of the flesh
and those which are not of the flesh,
that which is in the part of the sensual world of mind and body,
and those which are more spiritual in nature.
And so we're making a shift, this journey from one into the other as we deepen the practice.
In the second foundation, and the third foundation, we begin by becoming aware of a mind
that's accompanied with greed, hate, and delusion.
And then there's a journey from that state of mind
into what can be called more meditative or spiritual states of mind.
And that's what the last four pairs of mind states are.
But this journey through from these mind states that are characterized by greed, hatred, and delusion
have an intermediate, kind of a stepping stone to it.
And that is the fourth one, fourth of the eight pairs.
The fourth one is that is a scattered mind or a contracted mind.
When the mind is not caught up in greed, hatred, and delusion anymore,
it's sometimes a little bit lost.
To have greed, hate, and delusion is always to have some focus of attention,
some concern, something that we want, something we don't want, something we're confused about.
And the degree to which we're focused on this object of thought, this object of concern,
it limits the mind.
The language of the Buddha is it's a limitation for awareness of the mind.
The mind becomes smaller, contracted.
Its scope becomes very narrow.
We can feel the mind gets kind of tight and narrow and just preoccupied with one thing.
And it can even feel pleasant.
There's a lot of good energy or strong energy, compelling energy, habit energy around desires
and around diversions and around delusion.
And the mind just kind of goes into it because it's like a black hole where a strong gravitational pull
pulls us into this.
And it can feel so natural, so normal that we don't realize how the impact it has on us
and how we don't realize so easily that there's another whole option.
When the mind is no longer focused on objects, these objects in this kind of narrow, constricted,
or forceful way, then the mind goes through a transition sometimes where it's a little bit confused.
It's not quite sure what to focus on or what to do.
It's kind of like if desires and aversions and delusions are kind of like caffeine.
It keeps us energized.
When we stop taking the caffeine, the mind goes through a period of adjustment.
And that period of adjustment is the mind doesn't have a particular object that it's particularly concerned with,
but the mind hasn't developed its capacity for settled, concentrated presence.
And so the mind then can get scattered, just jumps around kind of looking for something to be concerned with,
but not enough focus to really settle in anything.
The mind becomes scattered, or the mind just comes shrunken, it just sinks in on itself.
Sloth and torpor sets in, kind of giving up, or kind of like deflation that can happen.
And so without greed, hate, and delusion, sometimes it's deflation, sometimes it's scatterness of mind,
restlessness of the mind that can happen.
But we keep practicing.
It can feel like things are going backwards because our mind is all scattered, jumping around,
or more deflated and shrunken.
But it's actually a transition time sometimes.
We have to go through it, be patient with it, and just be willing to breathe with it and be aware of it.
And then at some point, some of the fruits of practice come into play.
In the first one, it says in this third foundation, one knows an expanded mind as an expanded mind,
and one knows a non-expanded mind as a non-expanded mind.
Mahacitta, it could also mean big mind, one knows a big mind.
So here, mind, in their earlier exercises, one knows a mind accompanied by desire
as a mind accompanied by desire, accompanied by aversion as accompanied by aversion,
that the mindfulness shows us or creates a wider context of the mind to be aware of desires and aversions.
So the desire and aversion doesn't kind of take over fully.
And so desire and aversion is just part of the mind.
It's big influence on every part.
In this transition after this contracted or restless mind,
there comes this time when the mind starts feeling expansive, open, wide, large,
because the mind and awareness become more and more closely linked, rather than overlap or coterminous.
And now we can almost talk as synonyms that awareness and mind become almost the same,
that awareness becomes broad and expansive, that can be included in everything.
And this idea of an inclusive awareness and open mind, an open set of perceptions
that everything that happens is allowed to appear in its own time in the field of perception,
in the world of what we perceive.
And there's not a for or against our experience.
There's not a preference for one thing over another.
The preference is not for the object of attention, not for the thing that we're aware of,
but the preference is to rest in this wider, calm awareness,
the awareness that can receive things in a relaxed way, can know things in a relaxed way, perceive.
And so in the language of the Buddha, when we're too concerned with some purpose,
then the mind is limited by that purpose.
If we're not constricted by a purpose, or if the purpose in a sense is to just relax and open up,
then the mind is not limited anymore.
It's not bounded, it's not contracted, it's not tight and narrow.
And it becomes broader and wider, kind of like the feeling maybe,
that if you're inside a small, teeny little cabin for a long time and all claustrophobic,
and you go out into the wide open fields, open space, maybe high in the mountains with a great vista,
there's something, an expansive feeling that arises.
Certainly the vista is expansive, but something like opens up in the mind, in the heart,
that makes it also kind of like a breath of fresh air, it's kind of expansiveness that it takes as well.
So you don't have to go out to a great vista point to see a great view, to feel the mind become expansive.
Even with the eyes closed, the mind becomes quite expansive, quite large,
because it's its nature to be that way.
It's how it is, awareness is, consciousness is, when it's not being channeled into particular direction,
it's not being held and contracted or being used to focus on a particular thought, a particular concern, a particular desire or aversion.
And so to be able to drop the limitations in the mind, the contractions of the mind,
and that's why a calm meditative state for many people, the mind begins to feel kind of expansive or large or peaceful or broad.
And so here we begin this journey now into more spiritual states or dharma states,
whereas greed, hate and delusion, those mind states, are not particularly dharmic, not dharmic at all.
The awareness that can include everything and be broad enough is dharmic.
And kind of paradoxically or harmonically, it can also include the presence of greed, hate and delusion.
Nothing's outside, but the difference is that the mind is not contracted or focused on greed, hate and delusion.
It just knows it's there, but in this wide field, it's just one thing about many.
We're not identified with it, we're not prioritizing it, we're not bothered by it, caught in its grip.
And this idea of the mind that's not caught by anything, doesn't stop for anything, doesn't get involved with anything, entangled with anything,
is the mind that's just able to allow things to arise and pass, to be there when they're there, but without being for or against.
And that begins a feeling of a mind that's whole, a holistic mind.
And this is one of the great delights and pleasures of meditation starting to feel more and more whole.
That we feel whole, our whole sense of beingness feels more holistic.
And we come into our wholeness rather than the contractedness or the narrowness of particular preoccupations and concerns.
And how to make that transition from desire and aversion to this expanded state, it really helps if we no longer are convinced,
or not us, but maybe our mind, convinced that what's important is to pursue desires,
what's important is to be involved in aversion, or even what's important is to kind of be constantly preoccupied with our delusions,
our thoughts, our confusions about things, all those who can feel how that limits us.
And to begin relaxing and softening and opening until we feel like everything is included.
All of who we are has a place, all of who we are has a respected place in awareness and consciousness.
This is a game changer for people who do meditation.
And over time it begins realizing we're actually much better off in this peaceful state than in the desire state,
in the wanting state or the aversive state.
And so if you have half an hour free in the evening and there's a common desire you get pulled into,
but instead of that you go and meditate or go for a walk and do something that allows you to kind of tap into this expanded state,
you might find that it's much more pleasant, much more satisfying in the long run.
So we'll continue tomorrow on this third foundation.
These Dharma states that opened up in the last four exercises.
And I want to make an announcement.
So IMC now has started a fundraising drive to support refugees who are fleeing Ukraine.
Now they're supposed to be close to two million or so.
And the organization that we're supporting has saved the children for a number of reasons.
One, there's a little bit of a personal connection to that.
They're one of the highest rated charities, I think in the world.
They've been around for a hundred years.
And they're involved in the ground and some of the refugee camps and some of the reception centers in the borders of Ukraine,
offering care for some of the most vulnerable people, the children and families.
And so if you'd like to donate to this fund, all the money you'll give to IMC for this purpose will go to the Save the Children.
And the way to do it is that on the What's New page, on the home page of IMC's website,
there's a section in the bottom right called What's New, and there there's a notice about fundraising for the Ukraine.
And the button there, the donate button there, is specific for IMC to know it's for the Ukraine.
So maybe tomorrow I'll post it here on the YouTube chat as well.
So we're doing this, raising money until through Monday.
We did this for Haiti after the earthquake last August, and we raised $30,000, which was quite impressive.
And maybe we can do something similar, maybe even more, to provide support for this tremendous need there in Eastern Europe.
So thank you all, and I look forward to our time to get tomorrow.
