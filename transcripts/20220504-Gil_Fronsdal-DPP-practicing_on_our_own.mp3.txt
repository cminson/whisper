So, hello everyone. Nice to see you all.
And a very nice feeling I had sitting here,
started from the beginning,
was influenced a little bit by the light in this room.
And that there were just a few of you
compared to what we used to do for Wednesday mornings.
And I liked both very much.
The two came together.
And there was no guided meditation.
I was very lucky.
And just sitting here peacefully.
And it evoked for me this idea that
when this Dharma practice,
the Dharma practice is meant to become something very personal,
at some point we practice on our own in our daily life.
And at some point we don't need to have people around us to practice.
There is some idea that spirituality is found when you are alone.
Or say differently,
that when you find you are living a Dharma life,
when no one is watching you,
when you are living an ethical life,
no one ever knows that you are being ethical.
When you are practicing,
and you are not practicing for anyone,
you are just okay, this is good.
I will practice because practice is good,
the Dharma is good,
and I want to be connected to it,
or settled in it or something.
Something like that.
Of course it is wonderful to practice together in the community.
It is wonderful to feel supported,
and feel the companionship.
There is also a collective path we are on.
But I think that at some point
the maturity of practice,
one of the ways to see it in people,
and know it in us ourselves,
is when we are going to do it, regardless.
I talked to someone yesterday who
seemed very dedicated to the practice,
and involved for a good number of years,
and I was trying to get a sense of the person's,
the actual practice was in the person's life.
So I said,
what would happen for you
if you came to IMC one day,
and I said, you know,
I made a big mistake.
This whole mindfulness thing
doesn't really work.
You should just drop it.
It is nothing.
It is not really important.
It doesn't really, you know,
it just doesn't, you know,
it was a big mistake to do all these teachings,
and I just revoke it all,
and you know, you should just stop.
What would you do then?
That was kind of what I asked this person.
And then the person just thought about a little bit and said,
well, I think I'll just keep practicing.
I've found so much value in this,
and it's so important for me
to have this practice of paying attention
and settling in and, you know,
that it's just valuable to do.
Well, the person didn't say this,
but I could imagine someone saying,
well, I'm sorry for you.
And the idea is that it's,
at some point, we know it for ourselves.
At some point, we have the confirmation,
we have the certainty that this supports me.
This is better than the alternative.
Of course I'll practice.
Maybe if I'm on my death bed
and I have to die alone,
if that's what's happening,
of course I'll practice.
I mean, that seems like,
what else could I do?
What else, you know,
I can't think of anything better to do.
And so the practice becomes one's own,
and the practice becomes
something we do in our privacy,
a privacy of our life regardless
of what other people do.
Anyway, so that may be very happy
sitting here with all of you,
with the few of you,
depending on how you look at it.
And I appreciated that you were here,
and you could be doing something else,
and all of you I've known before,
and I think it's in you.
You're here to practice,
and it's good to practice in community,
but I just felt the sincerity,
and there's a group of people
in this wonderful light,
this great space,
and if I declare it,
I'm in mistake.
Maybe your eyebrows go up,
or maybe your shoulders go,
oh well, that's just too bad
it didn't work for him.
So thank you for this very much.
So we have time for the walking
and the sitting,
and the practice discussion
that some of you signed up for,
and the plan is to do them here
in the gravel on this side
next to Hopkins,
but if anyone,
especially if you're this,
if anyone can't do that,
let me know.
Does that work for everyone?
And so let's meet there
in a way that parking lot can be
for walking meditation,
and then enjoy your time.
Thank you.
