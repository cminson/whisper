Dharmette : Physically Aware

For me, o ne of the great pl easures of my Buddhist 
practice  has been being more and more connected to 
my body  – making it a habit. More and more , the place 
where  I live is in the feeling and  the experience of being 
embodied , connected to the body. I used to be very 
much in my head, my thoughts , and ideas . And I 
certainly still am , a fair amount . But I’m never far away 
from the phy sical feeling of being embodied – being 
here, being connected. It’ s like where I live is in my 
body. From the body , there is a sense of presence, a 
radiance of awareness. How I’ m aw are is that I’m 
physically aware.  
 
I used to think mindf ulness was to be mentally aware – 
to know and be in the control tower . But the ability to 
know and to recognize what’s happening still operates . 
If I’m going to be present  with my breathing  – or 
someone tells me, “ Concentrate on your breathing ” – I 
do almost nothing with my head, my brain. I focus  on 
the breathi ng in my chest, or my torso . It’s more like a 
whole place here in my belly  and my chest becomes 
alive and filled w ith sensations . Sensing  the experience 
happens within the body itself. Then as I sense it more fully, there's knowing:  “This is an in-breath. This is an 
out-breath.”  The mental part of it is almost like a 
sideshow to  this sense of presence – this stability , 
composed of  the physical and em bodied experience of 
breathing – this radiance of awareness, established and  
settled, right here.  
 
Part of the v alue of mindfulness of the body and  being 
connected to the body is that it helps us to not be so l ost 
in our thoughts. It’s possible to spe nd decades lost in 
our thoughts – spinning ideas, reflecting , thinking , 
wondering , regretting. The intention is to cut through 
that – to find a simpler way of being, to not be so caught 
in these endless whirlpools. The Buddha used the word 
‘whirlpools ’ – whirlpools of thoughts and 
preoccupation s. There is no way out of the whirlpool 
itself. But you can step away from it and into the body . 
The body is the alternative.  
 
One way this works is that the body is always in the 
present moment , whereas t he mind might not be. The 
mind may be  in the past, thinking about som ething that 
happened before. Or  it’s thinking about the future . 
Maybe i t’s thinking about something in the present  
moment , but it’s not here;  it’s somewhere else . Or it’s 
thinking about fantasy,  which is neither past, present, or 
future – neither  here nor there . Who knows where 
fantasy is? The mind goes to these other places. You 
can say that the mind is always here;  it doesn't go anywhere . But the preoccupations of the mind are 
elsewhere. However,  the body is always here. It’ s 
alway s in the present moment. If you’ re connected to 
the body, you are connected to the present moment . 
 
A wonderful way this works is when my mind spins a lot. 
There are a lot of thoughts and concerns about 
something, and I can't  easily  just let go of my thoughts . 
One of the things I love doing then is to be mindful of 
the body  thinking. What are the physical sensations? 
What is the physical experience of the mind being so 
energized, spinning, caught , or contracted around 
certain kinds of thoughts? I'll explore the physicality of it, 
and I find this delightful. It's not always pleasant exactly  
– tension might be there – but I find it delightful to just 
explore , and to be with what’s going on  in this world of 
the present moment , feeling and sensing .  
 
Part of the delight is b ecause I see how valuable it is to 
not be lost in the wo rld of preoccu pation – to step out of 
it and experience things  from a different point of view. I 
like to think of this as experiencing from the point of 
view of the body. What is the impact on the body? How 
does the body experience this experience? How is the 
body with it? What can the body contribute to the 
experience , if the body brings its awareness to that 
experience? When the body brings its awareness to the 
experience, it’ s often – I don't wa nt to anthropomorphize 
too much – but it ’s almost as if the body brings compassion, openness, or acceptance to whatever is 
happening. My mind might not have much compassion 
or acceptance of the situation, but the body can hold 
everything. The body has space.  
 
Another thing I like about being connected with my 
body, especial ly in meditation, is that the more I’ m 
connected to my body, and the more I feel the 
physicality and the sensations of my body  as they flow 
and move  – the more space there is inside my body. 
And it turns out there is infinite space in there!  
 
Physically, really, there is no  space  in there , or very 
little. If you look at the inside of the human body, which I 
did last week when I went to the anatomy lab, it was 
packed. There was nothing extra in there. Every little 
nook and cranny has some organ or something tucked 
away. It is quite full in there. But with my eyes closed, 
when I’ m just feeling my body, I feel space. Maybe there 
are a lot of  nerves in some places. If t here are no 
nerves in my splee n, I may think it is just empty. And 
around the spaciousness in the body, there  are 
sensations that flow and move .  
 
This combination of peaceful open space in the body , 
the flow of sensations, and the settledness  of the whole 
experience – I just find it a delight. It’ s such a nice place  
to be, and to rest. It’ s like a refuge, a place of safety , a 
place of pleasure and  well-being.  It is a place of safety from being caught up in thoughts, or judgments, with the 
mind  jumping around from place to place. The mind 
might still jump aro und, but I’ m not so identified with the 
mind . I’m not so concerned with what goes on in the 
mind.  
 
When the practice is going well  and I’ m in my  body – 
practicing  and centered here – that’s the center of 
gravity.  The fullness of life is here in the body. I t seems 
that my thinking recedes into the background. Rather 
than my thinking disappearing , I just see that  it’s not 
very important anymore. That is very different than how 
it used to be for me many years ago when everything I 
thought was really important. Maybe none of you have 
succumbed to that temptation. But it used to be that 
everything I thought was  a big dram a: “This is so 
important! H ow could I be thinking about this?  I should 
be thinking about so mething different.  I should stop 
having those thoughts. ” It was a whole complicated 
world. You go into a maze, and you never find your way 
out. But as pra ctice has s ettled for me, and I’ m more in 
my body,  this poor little mind thinks, “It’s okay. ” It 
recedes into the background.  It’s less powerful , has less 
authority, and less impact on me. I t doesn’t run the 
show. I’ m not concerned about it so much. I have more 
freed om in relationship to it.  
 
Being in the body is one of the ways to shift the 
relationship we have with our whole world of  thinking. For some people, that is a radical shift. For some , the 
only world they know is the world of thoughts. I have 
found it to be phenomenally helpful t o keep coming 
back into the body, to feel and to be in the body .  
 
In fact, the Buddha himself made very powerful 
statements about how useful mindfulness of the  body is, 
for example , “There is no freedom, there is no nibbāna , 
there is no experience of the deathless, without an 
expe rience of the body.” We want t o be centered, 
resting, present for our experience in the body.  
 
I hope those words are useful for you. I share them 
because , somehow , I feel more connected with my body 
today, with the rain , the quiet, the si mplicity. It feels kind 
of cozy and  nice. So , I just wanted to share how I was 
feeling. Thank you.
