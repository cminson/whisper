The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Last time I talked about Silla or ethical conduct,
and the time before that about generosity or dana,
and these are the second and the first of the ten parames,
the ten perfections.
And today I'd like to talk about the third of the parames,
which is Nakama or renunciation.
And over the past weeks and months,
myself and the other teachers have basically been talking about the ten parames,
and we thought we finished the list basically.
So this one we still have on our list Nakama and then Meta, Love and Kindness,
and probably Vaan will talk about that next week.
So I will go over the list again and then I will also name who talked about it,
so you can find it back if you want.
So the first parame or perfection is generosity or dana in Pali.
The second is ethics or ethical behavior, Silla in Pali,
and so those two I've covered over the past weeks.
The third is renunciation, Nakama, and I'll cover that today.
Fourth is wisdom or panya in Pali,
and then Neil offered to talk about it a few weeks ago.
Then the fifth is energy or virya in Pali, and Liz Powell offered to talk about that some weeks ago.
The sixth is patience or kanti, and also Liz offered to talk about that earlier on.
The seventh is truthfulness or satcha, and Dawn offered to talk about that last week.
The eighth is determination, aditanna, and Shelly Gold offered to talk on that in August.
And the ninth, Love and Kindness, Meta, and as I said, Dawn might cover this next week.
And the tenth is equanimity, upeka, and Dawn offered to talk about that a few weeks ago,
which was the same that also covered wisdom.
So you don't have to remember all of these paramis of course,
but in this way it's kind of a refresher of the qualities that are on the list
and what we've already covered and who covered it.
So today, a deep dive into Nakama, and this Pali word is often translated with renunciation.
And I looked it up in the dictionary, and one of the dictionaries online says renunciation is an act or instance of relinquishing,
abandoning, repudiating, or sacrificing something.
So when we hear the word renunciation, you might think of it like that,
in terms of sacrificing something that we like, or having to let go of things that we might not really want to let go of,
or certain pleasant things, and that might be why this concept of renunciation is not very popular,
and we often don't really want to give up or sacrifice things.
But what might help to understand it a little better is that the literal translation in Pali,
of this Pali word is freedom from sense desire.
So I'll get back to that later on.
And there is an example in the sutras of a lay person who was also not so keen on this concept of renunciation,
and this was the householder Tapusa, and he spoke to the Buddha at some point, and he said to the Buddha,
we are householders who indulge in sensuality, delight in sensuality, enjoy sensuality, rejoice in sensuality.
For us, renunciation seems like a sheer drop-off.
So maybe for some of us, thinking about renunciation also seems like a sheer drop-off.
And interestingly and surprisingly enough, even the Buddha had trouble with renunciation before he attained enlightenment,
because he responded the following to this householder Tapusa.
The Buddha said, before my awakening, when I was still an unawakened bodhisattva,
I thought renunciation is good, seclusion is good, but my heart didn't leap up at renunciation,
didn't grow confidence, steadfast or firm, seeing it as peace.
What is the cause? What is the reason why my heart didn't leap up at renunciation?
Then the thought occurred to me, I haven't seen the drawback of sensual pleasures.
I haven't pursued that team. I haven't understood the reward of renunciation.
I haven't familiarized myself with it.
That's why my heart doesn't leap up at renunciation, doesn't grow confident, steadfast or firm, seeing it as peace.
So the Buddha mentions that the reason why his heart doesn't leap or didn't leap up at renunciation is threefold.
First is that at that time he did not see the drawback of sensual pleasures.
The second point was that he did not understand the reward of renunciation.
And lastly, he had not familiarized himself with it.
So we'll look at these three aspects today.
And I'll start with the third one, which was that the Buddha was not keen on renunciation because he had not familiarized himself with it.
And I guess what we are doing today is familiarizing ourselves more with this topic.
And also we'll try to give some practical tips on how to practice with renunciation in our lives, how to implement it in our lives.
And that's also a way to familiarize ourselves with it.
So now let's take a look at this first reason that the Buddha's heart didn't leap up, which was that he did not see the drawbacks of sensual pleasures.
So in order for us to start appreciating kamma or renunciation, we'll need to become more aware of those drawbacks.
So what are the drawbacks of sensual pleasures?
Well, it is important to make a distinction between sense, desire and sensual pleasure.
Because the drawback of sensual pleasure is actually that it is often preceded by sensual desire.
And this sensual or sense desire is what makes the experience not so beneficial for us.
So on the other hand, there is nothing wrong with enjoying sense pleasures.
So a difference between pleasure and desire. So enjoying sense pleasure is part of our human experience.
Even if we would try to never enjoy anything anymore, we would probably not really succeed since we will all at some point enjoy something pleasant, like a pleasant taste or a pleasant body sensation or pleasant sight or pleasant thought or whatever it is.
And maybe the sun hits our face and we enjoy the light and the warmth, or we eat something that just really tastes really good. You know, we can really help it to have this pleasant taste in our mouth.
We see these beautiful skies and the colors in the sky and dusk or dawn, etc.
Now each of us will encounter all these different types of pleasant and enjoyable impressions in our day to day experience.
So that clearly is not the problem.
So what is the culprit is that the desire for these enjoyable sense pleasure is what can cause suffering for us.
It's this grasping, this wanting, this craving.
It's even stated in the Four Noble Truths that the second truth tells us that the cause of suffering is craving.
And often this distinction is not made that clearly, but it is important to keep enjoying all the enjoyable things in life, else we might end up with a very bleak and uninspired life.
Not to indulge in it or to give into every moment of wanting and craving in order to enjoy essential pleasures, but just to enjoy it when it happens.
So when we talk about nekamma is renouncing something as renunciation, so letting go, then what we actually renounce or let go is this desire, this craving, this wanting of pleasant things, pleasant experiences.
So it's not the thing or the experience itself that we necessarily let go of. Sometimes that might also happen.
But the point is to let go of the desires.
So let's take a closer look at sense desire, craving, grasping, and this energy of wanting.
And we can take a look at how it works in the mind, how it might bring us suffering.
So to give an example, we might really enjoy watching the sunset.
And at times we might crave or desire to see the sunset, we might even get into our car and drive to a spot from where we can clearly see the sunset.
And like at the beach, if we live on a coast where the sun sets at the beach.
The reaction of driving to a special spot is then probably driven by craving and wanting.
And well, in comparison, if we would just be in our car or we would be out on a walk and we happen to see the sky lit up with beautiful colors at sunset, then this might, you know, generate some enjoyable feelings.
And all in beauty might just arise naturally. And that's different than when we go out and pursue it.
And in one instance we follow this impulse, impulse of craving and wanting and we actually step into our car and drive out to the sunset spot.
So it's not to say that we should never pursue any desire of any kind and we should never go to see the sunset or something like that.
Or to never make ourselves a tasty meal or to hug a loved one or smell a flower or whatever it is.
It is to say, though, that we can become aware of our motivation, like we can wear these movements of the heart and mind to want things to grasp that experience to crave for certain experiences.
And becoming more and more aware of this can help us to start seeing that there are some drawbacks to this craving and grasping.
And one of the drawbacks is that we often think that if we get what we want, if we get to that special spot and see the sunset that we will be happy, we will be fulfilled.
But these feelings of happiness and fulfillment don't really last very long often.
And maybe if we drive back from our sunset spot we still feel this glow of watching the sunset.
But probably by the next morning the feeling might be gone altogether.
Or we encounter the next unpleasant thing and the feeling might be wiped out.
So this is not to depress us.
It's more meant to encourage us to see the drawbacks of sense pleasures as the Buddha points out in that sutta, the drawback being that the sense pleasures don't last.
Another drawback is that often we don't even get what we want, like we drive out to our special spot to see the sunset and in the meanwhile some cloud cover might come in obstructing the whole sunset so we're just driving out for nothing.
Or we are craving for this really tasty meal, our favorite meal and then we burn part of our meal and it turns out not the way we had hoped.
So not getting what we want is painful, or at least at times we can feel the frustration or the aversion coming up.
And then somehow we think that getting what we want is going to be the solution.
But it actually never is, even if we get what we want then the next desire has already arisen well before we've fully been able to savor what we've just received.
So somehow we finally arrive at the sunset spot and we are enjoying the sunset and then there's this cold wind that picks up and we get cold and then we crave for our shawl that's in the car and then we get up to get the shawl and the next thing we know the sunset is over.
And then we crave to get back in our car to drive to a warm and cozy home.
This is endless cycle of craving the next thing and the next thing.
And the Buddha tried to teach us about this in the suttas.
But the tricky thing is that this pattern of wanting the next thing and the next thing is so ingrained in our being that it's almost kind of automatic for us.
There's a lot of mindfulness and patience to start to see through this delusional pattern to start seeing that indeed there are a lot of drawbacks to sense pleasures.
This lure of the sense pleasure is present in almost all moments of our lives, like the desire to check our phone for messages or scrolling through social media or desire for some nice food, treat thing or coffee or tea or the desire for nice weather or the desire to not do the dishes or not go to work etc etc.
And this is kind of a hard teaching to teach because it is something that we need to see for ourselves.
We all need to discover for ourselves that sense desire is actually a form of suffering.
It's not something that is kind of immediately kind of intuitive for us or immediately that we feel that because desire can be so pleasant it can feel so good.
And then it seems to such a good thing to pursue our sense pleasures.
And that's actually a tricky thing because it's so pleasant, it can even seem to feel pleasant to desires things that it can be really tricky, it can really trick us into believing that that it's really going to satisfy us.
And then we kind of overlook that this is an endless cycle that if we get this next thing that the next want, next craving is already going to be present.
And seeing that the desire is kind of like deceptive and unsatisfactory is needed in order to have some sort of motivation to let go, to renunciate.
And there was this Thai woman, a lay teacher, and she said, no matter how stubbornly desire wants anything, simply watch it, get acquainted with it and it won't stay.
Desire will disband.
As soon as it disbands, you realize exactly how deceptive it is.
You didn't know, as soon as desire urged you to do anything, you went along with it.
But once you're wise to your desires, they stop, they disband.
Even though you don't disband them, they disband on their own.
And as soon as you see they're disbanding, the path opens wide to be for you.
Everything opens wide in the heart.
An example from my own life is that I was a nun for a while, Buddhist nun, so I had to shave my head.
And at some point I disrobed and I decided to let my hair grow again.
And after about a year, I noticed that this tendency came up to over and over check if my hair looked good because I really like thick hair that's really stubborn and doesn't want to sit in a certain model.
So I noticed this desire to check my hair if it's still okay.
And I realized like, oh, there's a lot of suffering actually.
So I decided to just shave my head.
I was used to, you know, having a bald head anyways, so that I won't have to worry about my hair anymore.
And I was like, this is just simplifying my life.
So I renounced this desire to, yeah, to have my hair basically to look good with one feminine hair or something like that.
And this was an example where I could really kind of see the suffering and the desire for this, you know, wanting to look good and how kind of burdensome that was.
Another example that we all might be familiar with is that sometimes when we are meditating there is this desire to open our eyes.
Maybe we want to look at the clock or maybe we hear something we want to check it out or whatever it is.
And we could decide to not follow this desire and not open our eyes, but just sit with the desire and just feel it being curious like how does it feel to desire to want to open the eyes and feel it in body and minds.
It's either unpleasant or unpleasant to desire this.
And then, if we do that, what sometimes happens, and this is really nice if it happens, is that the desire dissolves without us having to give into it.
And that's a wonderful feeling if a desire dissolves like that, that gives really a sense of relaxation and ease, like some kind of this pulling force, this kind of wanting going forward kind of force, kind of relaxes.
And this is something that we can all try out during our meditation or even during our daily lives.
And then we can start with these small and insignificant desires, like this opening eyes during meditation or another example in daily life could be that we want to check our phone for the 10th time to see if there's a message or we want this extra cookie
or this desire to just tune out in front of the TV or whatever it is, could just try it out to not give into the desire or at least say like for 10 minutes you don't give into the desire and see what happens.
And I recommend not to start with the most challenging and big desires, because then we might be overwhelmed and it doesn't work as much as well.
And if you start with the small desires, then we can kind of build our way up to bigger desires.
And what is often the case also when we start with these smaller things in our meditation practice with all sorts of aspects that we can use in our meditation practice but also with observing desires.
And we start small, then we can kind of get into that this habit of stopping at desire and not giving into it, and then it can spill over to other areas of our lives.
So some of the drawbacks of sense and desire or sense pleasure is that that sense pleasure is basically coming forth out of sense desire.
And the sense desire itself is, is not such an wholesome movement of the heart.
It is so beneficial.
Yeah, it does not really contribute to our long term welfare and happiness to, to desire.
And this is because the sense pleasures will not last and
this best sense pleasure will give us give us the short bursts of pleasure. But ultimately, they're going to be impermanent and therefore unsatisfactory.
And as a side note, there are wholesome desires, by the way, the desire to awaken desire for wholesomeness, for example, those are wholesome desires desire to help others or have wholesome life for ourselves.
So,
get back on where was when we start to investigate these desires in our practice then the more unwholesome ones, then we might be able to see that this quality of the desire of wanting is actually, or has actually this, this unpleasant component.
It can actually feel unpleasant in heart and mind to want to grasp and to desire things.
And sometimes this is not as easily noticeable.
So you don't have to believe me on this one. And the invitation is to simply see for yourself.
Is this true, investigated in your own practice.
So when we see those drawbacks of sense pleasures of sense desires for ourselves.
What can happen is that the comma or renunciation, letting go will happen naturally, that it is not something that we need to work at, but just need to put in place the conditions for this in the comma for the renunciation to happen.
And what we let go of what we renunciate is this desire the grasping the wanting the attachment.
And so, the good news is that we don't necessarily have to let go of this thing or objects or a state of being or whatever it is that we desire.
Sometimes, if we do let go of our cravings and desires for, for these things or states of beings or whatever it is, then, then we also just, you know, don't go after them anymore.
So it can happen that we let go of the desire for ice cream and then we find ourselves not having ice cream anymore.
But let's say we let go of the desire to find peace in our meditation.
Still this piece might come up at some point even though we've let go of the desire. So it's not that we always have to renunciate thing or the state of being.
And sometimes when we let go of like eating chocolate cake or something and, and then so we're not as composed compulsively like kind of finding chocolate cake everywhere.
We still might sometimes eat a piece of chocolate cake, for example.
But then we're not as driven by this attachment to chocolate cake. It's just kind of another thing that we sometimes do.
So the Buddha also mentioned in the Sutta that I quoted at the beginning of the talk that the second reason why his heart didn't leap up when thinking about renunciation before he was awakened was that he did not understand the reward of renunciation.
So what is the reward of renunciation of letting go?
Ajahn Chah, a diverse master famously said, if you let go a little, you will have a little peace. If you let go a lot, you will have a lot of peace. If you let go completely, you will have complete peace.
So here we can see that the reward of renunciation is peace.
You might not be fully intuitive for everyone, but you might be able to imagine that if you are not as much pushed around by these cravings and attachments and desires, that you'll be more at peace and more content with things just as they are.
And things don't have to change or don't need to be different as much.
And there's just a simple contentment, some ease and peace with things just as they are.
So the reward of letting go of these desires is peace, ease, contentment, gives us some freedom.
In a way this constant bombardment of sense desires is holding us in its grip and letting the desires go gives us a sense of freedom.
And you can see that that's closely related to equanimity, which is the last of the 10 parames.
Equanimity is this balance, not being swayed by either desire or aversion.
And the quality of renunciation, letting go of these desires can be a real support for equanimity to arise.
And some examples of how this freedom and peace might manifest.
Well let's say that you really need coffee first thing in the morning and there's this desire to have coffee,
else you feel grumpy and not at ease for the rest of the day.
And how wonderful would it be to not be dependent on this coffee, that when you get up you don't have this intense desire to have coffee,
instead you feel a choice that you could have coffee, would be nice, but you could as well not have it and you'll be fine.
And just letting go of that desire might give a sense of freedom and peace inside of this pool of this wanting, this grasping, this needing.
And that applies to all sorts of things that we desire, other foods or beverages like chocolate or tea or dessert.
And we all have certain foods or beverages that we crave at times.
It also applies to experiences of states of mind, like peace or happiness.
But this very, like if we desire peace or happiness then this very craving for it can actually prevent peace or happiness from arising,
because craving is the opposite of that.
So if the world does not have to be the way that we crave for desire or want it to be, then we can feel more content with the way things just are the way it is.
So when this grasping let's go then our nervous system can relax a little bit, our hearts can open.
And it is something, this is something that we cannot force or make happen.
After a talk like this thoughts might arise like oh I should not have this desire or if only I could get rid of this attachment or as a good meditator I should be able to let go, etc.
But it's very understandable and so the mind does, and the antidote to it is to first simply be mindful of it,
and to recognize that the mind has come up with things that should be different, which is in itself probably a form of craving.
And then to see if we can just let this craving, this attitude of this should be different, just be there, just acknowledge it.
Take it personally. Same is what we can do with the cravings that arise.
That is the nature of the mind to come up with craving, with desire, with chutes and chutes.
And our job is to simply recognize and acknowledge and what leads to suffering and what leads you away from it.
Does this desire, does this attachment lead to suffering or away from suffering towards happiness?
So this way we can start to see the inner workings of the craving mind.
We can be curious about the craving mind, what is it like?
What does it feel, body and mind? And then the mind might start to be less and less interested in desiring these sense pleasures.
It starts to see the drawbacks, just as the Buddha told us.
It might start to experience some rewards of nakamma, the rewards of renunciation.
So and if the mind starts to let go of sense desire, then we are right in the direction of awakening, since the Buddha describes awakening as the end of craving.
And like I said at the beginning of the talk, a literal translation of nakamma is freedom from sense desire.
And this is a process, this process towards the freedom from sense desire is something that we can let unfold naturally.
No need to hurry it or get it right or, you know, strive for it. It is something that unfolds it in its own pace.
And listening to talk like this might help, having an intention to learn about craving and desire can be a really good start.
Just noticing every time we desire something and having the intention to learn from it when we notice it.
And at some point we might stop ourselves on our tracks when desire happens, like, oh, I'm going to pass here, and I might not give into desire at this time.
And at other times you might actually want to give into the desire and see what that's like, feel and body and mind what that's like, and learn from that.
And with the quote by Gil Frostall, the quote to release is to find freedom and to find freedom is to know a happiness that is not dependent on anything, especially not having our wishes fulfilled.
That's what I wanted to say for today. And there are some time for questions or sharing, sure you all have experienced with sense desire.
You can just unmute and say something if you feel like sharing.
I just really enjoyed hearing your talk. Thank you so much.
My question. I don't know. I guess it's partly desire. I feel like I'm really caught. I have a good friend who is addicted.
And, you know, yesterday I saw her went and went over to kind of help her with kind of some things on the computer, it went okay.
It's hard for me to be around her. I have a, there's this thing of disgust, this revolution, really. And then on the other side, there is this desire to fix it to, you know, the whole thing is, is just not right.
And I find myself a long way from equanimity. And I just want, you know, I, yeah, what do you say.
Well, that's a, yeah, in a hard situation. And your, your friends might actually need, you know, other types of help to let professional help right it's not that you can probably fix it for her.
So that's good to keep in mind that, you know, and that also to keep in mind that it's a natural response to, yeah, to feel this aversion towards it, and to want to fix it.
And my guess is also that in your wish to fix it might be also some compassion on friendliness.
So it might not all be like fixing it because you want to get rid of it. You know that that part might also be there.
But it's good to recognize both parts also the compassion and friendliness in yourself to want her to flourish and live a wholesome life.
In this sense in the, in the context of this talk, I would say like, you're the only thing that you have control over is your own state of mind, right, and you can really control her.
So, to look at your own desires and, and aversions towards her to see what the mind is doing when you're with her or when you think about her, like, feeling the repulsion and the aversion and feeling the one wanting to fix her, etc.
And, and like this awareness, like we have to often see it multiple times, maybe hundreds, hundreds of times, and these patterns before they start to let go, which is kind of what I'm trying to allude to with the, the talk to like, it's, it's a natural process.
What really helps is to have an intention to learn from it, to learn from these patterns to let the mind learn from it. So my teacher side rotation here.
He often says like, that there's this wisdom aspect in the mind, and the wisdom aspect can learn from it.
Basically, so it's not that we have to actively do something, but we can let the mind in the background kind of process all this data that we're observing in ourselves.
And then there might be at some point a release, letting go.
And another outside of this talk, but something that hopefully Don's going to talk about next week about meta is to offer meta for your friend to do real formal meta meditation or compassion meditation for her.
And for yourself, I would include yourself as well.
Your attitude towards her might, it might help to change that a little bit or to more actively work on it as well, because what I'm describing is, it's a bit more passive.
Well, my time compassion can can be a bit more of an active form to work with it.
So, I don't know if you're familiar with those practices.
Yeah.
So you can use those two.
Yeah, it's often said to be the antidote to anger and ill will and hostility and version to do meta and compassion practices.
Thank you.
Yeah, you're welcome.
Any other questions or comments or sharing.
Yeah.
I was often wondering what it takes to become a nun in this part of renunciation so if you can say some words about that.
You mean like, like the literal things you need to renounce or more like.
Yes, both. Yeah, I was always attracted by becoming a nun and I thought on the other side. Yeah, I won't be able to renounce to everything like the comfort of a good bed, you know, and so I guess, and also what it does it takes on the more
intellectual or emotional side.
Yeah, I guess both both side physical and emotional.
Yeah.
Well, about the bed.
So it was in a monastery where where they basically said like there of course there's these eight precepts that you follow and some nuns for a little 10 precepts. I was a 10 precept nun, which is basically the eight precepts plus one and then one of the precepts is gotten to so.
There's no higher luxurious seats or beds. And in that monastery it was interpreted as that it's not a more luxurious as is the standard in the society.
I had like a bed on legs with a mattress about this thick or so. And so it was, at least for me it was comfortable enough that I wasn't suffering every night by pain, because I was playing on something really hard.
So that was an easy one. And then you're renouncing eating after the midday meal. And I had done that before I got a nun for periods of time already so I kind of was used to that but when I did that for the first time was, it was kind of hard and kind of like you have to get used to it.
You need to get used to it and stuff. In my case, my body kind of adapts to that quite easily. And for some it's really hard. If you really have a lot of problems with it, you can always take your own allowed medicine.
So which could also mean eating a small snack or something if your body really can't handle it.
And then you have to precept around no entertainment basically and no beautification of the body.
I came to really, for me it was really interesting because it encouraged me to not have any entertainment and not beautify the body and that kind of helped me to settle into the practice more and more.
And also the not eating after the midday meal because then you're not spending your time watching shows or listening to music or you don't have to worry about what you look like.
You're always wearing the same clothes and your hair shaved and whatnot. So it was really a simplification for me. And I didn't know beforehand that I would actually like it to have this outer kind of structure that would tell me not to do certain things and that I would actually like that.
So it might surprise you if you would do it, that it might not be as hard as you think.
Yeah, otherwise, it is a real renunciation in letting go of the world and the world these stuff, having a job or a relationship or a place, you know, even like a secure or a permanent place to live or, you know, you're just kind of basically living off of other people's generosity, at least in Myanmar where I was.
So it is a real letting go of some sort of security as well, which, you know, can be can be hard.
And it needs a lot of trust.
Having some sort of like security nets helps in the sense of like, knowing I could always go back to my family or something like that was helpful for me. I wasn't really alone in the world in that sense.
I mean, we're come up for you.
No, it's because some teacher told me, you don't need to become a nun, you can live your life, you know, and practice as a nun in your daily life and go to work and practice.
It's a real meta compassion. But still, how, what do we have to renunciate if we choose this path. It's hard to, it's hard to tell.
Yeah, well, you're renunciating if you'd become a nun you're going to get your work and you're probably where you live and stuff like that. So, yeah, yeah. So that's a big step for a lot of people.
Yeah. And it's different because you're really focusing your
day to day, every moment of your day to the practice. And when
you work or go about your life, it's a little different,
because your attention is more diverged. But it's still
possible. I mean, it's still it's, it's a valid, it's a valid
way of practicing just in daily life as well. Yeah. I agree
with that teacher. Thank you so much. Thank you.
