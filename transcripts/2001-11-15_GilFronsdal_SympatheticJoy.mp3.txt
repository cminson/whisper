 I hope it was sweet for you or something. I kind of came prepared to give a talk about something, and I could. But as it happens sometimes after I sit, somehow it's not there anywhere. It's there, but it's kind of just floating away. Are there any concerns that you have about meditation or mindfulness or Buddhism that you would like to have addressed this evening? Would you want to say anything on jealousy and mudita? Jealousy and mudita. I don't have much interest in talking about jealousy, but mudita I love. Mudita is a wonderful emotion and reaction that we can have to the world around us. Mudita is a Pali word for, usually translated into English, as sympathetic joy, appreciative joy. And it belongs to a group of four different emotions or four different reactions or responses that we can have that are called the Brahma Viharas. And Brahma is the supreme deity of the Indian pantheon of ancient India. And Vihara means dwelling place. So some people have translated Brahma Viharas as the divine abodes. They are so wonderful, they're just divine. And they're also called sublime. They're also called the unlimited, the boundless abodes. And these are loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. And these four… See, the practice of mindfulness by itself is a rather wisdom neutral practice. And what I mean by that is that mindfulness is just a practice of seeing clearly what's going on. When you see clearly what's going on, then you might discover a wise response or a wise understanding of what you're looking at. But the mindfulness is just simply the act of seeing clearly. In a sense, mindfulness is no wiser than a window in your house that you've managed to clean really well. Imagine you have a window, you're living in a window, hasn't been cleaned in 35 years. And you wonder if it's dark outside or light outside, you don't really quite know what. And how marvelous it is to actually discover you can clean the window and actually starting to get it clean. And to see clearly for the first time, you say, wow, this is fantastic. And then you might decide that your neighbors are really nice people. And your son finally can see what they look like. But mindfulness is just like a window that we clarify and hold so we can really see things clearly. But it doesn't give us in and of itself any guidance about how to live our lives or what kind of choices to make on our lives. So Buddhists will look other places for that issue of what do we use to guide our lives? Are there places where we can reference points or understandings or virtues or ethical guidelines or whatever that we can use to help make decisions about how we can live our lives? Now, when I first came to Buddhism, I was not interested at all to have any be told by Buddhism how to live my life or how to understand my life or how to help me make my decisions. I was just interested in the meditation practice to help clean the window. But what happens is that if that's all your meditation practice is, which it doesn't have to be any more than that, what happens then is that the mindfulness may or may not show you or may or may not help you. So it's a way to step outside of the normal decisions or the normal values of the culture you've been growing up in or living in. And so it might actually, for some people actually, the mindfulness can help them actually become more efficient at certain maladaptive behavior that they've been living for a long time. Occasionally that happens. I'm kind of a little bit surprised sometimes, and maybe I shouldn't be, and maybe I shouldn't even mention this, maybe it's not fair. But I'm usually a little bit surprised when I hear that there are meditators at the Pentagon. It kind of surprises me when I hear that because somehow, in my naive mind, I think that maybe the two kind of activities are incompatible. So what Buddhism offers then is a series of different guidelines or frameworks or ways of understanding to help us in situations how to make a decision. What's the wise course of action to take in what you see and where you find yourself? And if you really take on the study of Buddhism deeply, which you don't have to do, but some people like to do it, the deep study of Buddhism is valuable not only because it's valuable in and of itself, but because for most of us it's a radically different system than the Western cultural system we find ourselves in. And it helps us kind of question some of the deepest assumptions we have about how we live our lives by offering sometimes alternative points of view. Have you ever thought of living this way? Have you ever thought of seeing situations in a little different way? So one of the less, one of the very important but less radical, perhaps, suggestions that Buddhism offers for how you can live your life, how you can guide your life and what kind of decisions you make are these four brahma viharas. If you come to a situation, how do you want to relate to the situation? Do you want to relate to it with jealousy? Do you want to relate to it with hate? Do you want to relate to it with shutting down and becoming numb? Do you want to relate to it through aversion, through greed or generosity? There are all these different ways you can choose to relate to what you find. And if you just kind of stumble into your life and clearly see what's there, it might not help you question the automatic reaction to how you want to respond and react. So the brahma viharas are guidelines that Buddhists use for their social relationships with other people and with themselves. So the first one called metta is loving kindness. The word metta is related to the word for friend. It's a friendly response or a kind response to a situation you find yourself in, to have a feeling to be disposed or be interested in having a friendly and kind relationship to the world around you, to your neighbors and even to yourself. And Buddhists will spend time often cultivating this attitude and this feeling and this intention to go into situations with the intention to be friendly. So you don't just simply go to the safe way and stand in line to get your cereal, but you also go in there thinking, well, this is an opportunity to be friendly with someone. And maybe I'll be friendly with the person in front of me in the line. We have to stand there for a few minutes. And maybe they don't want to be friendly with you, but at least you're kindly disposed. You don't have to talk to them. Or you come to the clerk, you know, check out clerk. And so you're interested, you know, you're much more interested in a kind, friendly relationship to your clerk than you are getting your cereal. Where's your priorities after all? And so Buddhists then will cultivate this ability to be friendly. And it's not considered easy to do that in all kinds of, you know, as in many circumstances, but it's something we can, we don't believe the chance or just how we're naturally disposed. But you can cultivate and develop the intention and the possibility of meeting different situations in a friendly way. Cultivating loving kindness. The second one is compassion. Compassion can also be cultivated. Compassion also is a way of responding to a situation. If someone's suffering, then the appropriate response is one of compassion. If you're incapable of compassion when someone else is suffering, Buddhists then will take the mirror of mindfulness and bring it back to themselves and say, wait a minute. This person's suffering. I'm not feeling any compassion for that person. That seems a little bit odd since in Buddhism we talk a lot about compassion and the importance of it. Let me not criticize myself or beat myself up for it, but let me use this mindfulness to study what's going on with me. The fact that I not don't have compassion here. And there's a range of things you might discover. You might discover horrified anxiety. You know, gee, you know, get me away from this. This is just too awful. If I open up to this, then, you know, I don't know if I can handle that level of suffering or I don't know if I can take responsibility for, you know, I don't know what I'm going to, you know, I don't know where my responsibility is going to kick in if I really take on this person or really feel what this person's feeling. Or perhaps this horrified anxiety because it reminds you of something about yourself that you have the more to look at. Or there's pity. Pity is not the same thing as compassion. If you really pay attention, pity is having this attitude that you're better than the other person, kind of aloof. And you're looking down, I feel so sorry for you. I wish it could be better. And to be the recipient of that, this feels very condescending. Or maybe you feel numb. And so then the mindfulness is to explore the numbness. And why do you feel numb? But then to cultivate compassion, what does it take to develop compassion? What's the understanding that brings compassion? The third one, which Elizabeth brought up, is medita. And medita is sympathetic joy, appreciative joy. And that's to have the ability to have a appreciation in the joy of others, to share in the joy of others. And it's often related to, in reverse fashion, with jealousy. Because if someone else has something really wonderful happen to them, and you're comparing yourself to that person, measuring yourself to that person, using that person as some way of looking at yourself, your own wounds and desires or whatever, they can easily give birth to jealousy. So, you know, this is what comes to mind, talking about this. When I was in Burma meditating, I had this long retreat in Burma. There were a number of Westerners practicing there. We were practicing for long times. I was there for eight months, eight-month retreat. Other people were there for longer. Very serious, very intense meditation practice. And we hardly ever talked to each other, the Westerners did. But one day, somehow, I had an occasion to talk to a Westerner. And he kind of looked at me with this. He'd been meditating for a long time by that time, four or five months. Just, you look at me and he said, did you hear? Did you hear that so and so had reached the first stage of enlightenment? I knew her back in Berkeley. No way she couldn't have done that. No way, I knew her. And his jealousy, he got the upper hand of it. And partly, he got the upper hand because he was trying so hard to have some deep realization in his own practice. And here is something, someone who he compared himself to. It was some Burmese who come to the monastery and got noticed. And he would have just, you know, wouldn't have been no deal for him. But the fact that he knew back from Berkeley, you know, they could all go back home to Berkeley and, you know, she got it but you didn't? I don't know what this, you know, he was concerned about his friends. So he was really jealous because I think in part he'd used that person's experience of realization to have a reflection on who he was. A statement of comparison, or that person attained something that I didn't get. And so jealousy or anger or aversion arose. Or sometimes someone else gets something really wonderful happen in their life and reminds you of the fact that you feel deprived in your life and nothing happens to you. So you feel jealous of that person. Or you see that the person gets lots of adulation. And it would be nice to get to adulated sometimes, wouldn't it? And you haven't been adulated for a few weeks now and you kind of miss it and so are a few years or whatever. So there's kind of jealousy. Jealousy is kind of like wanting what that person has, I suppose. And having some feeling of aversion or anger or animosity to the person for having it. Isn't that a definition of jealousy? Does someone have a better one? I just made it up. Oh, what's the difference? So? I don't want the other person to have it. So envy is you want what the other person wants, has. And Lewis is suggesting that maybe jealousy, let me say it this way, so the subcategory of that or a different version of that is that envy you want what the other person has. And then there's another feeling where you want them to stop having to take it away from them. So if you're envious with someone who has a lot of money, you can just go out and win the lottery and then nothing's care of that. But if you are jealous of the person, then there's certainly more animosity built into it, I would think. And that you want to get back at the person or take it away from the person out of spite. You don't necessarily want it for yourself, but you want to destroy it for the person. Is that right? I just want it. You just want it for yourself. You're jealous, you want... So... You also maybe don't see the blessings you do have, you don't see what you do have. So many things... Yes? Well, I think you can be happy for the person and still be envious, but when you're jealous, you're not happy. So when you're envious, you can be happy. You can be happy for the other person and still be envious of what they have, but when you're jealous, you're not happy for the other person. No? Could be, yeah, yeah. All these things are possible, whether we use the definitions, you know, what jealousy technically is may be less important to all the options of how humans feel. But, like, so if your partner, you know, has gone off with someone else for a while, and you feel jealous, is that right? Would you say... I'd say... Yeah, you want what they have. Yes? I think jealousy implies an inadequacy within yourself. Inadequacy? And inadequacy. Inadequacy. Even jealous. Sometimes you feel hurt when you feel jealous, don't you? But maybe that's not exactly jealousy, maybe they go together. Maybe it's separate from jealousy. Can you feel jealousy without being hurt? When you think so. What? I don't think you can. But you can be... There's always in the background. But you can feel envy without being hurt, is that right? Yeah. Because jealousy is very personal, where envy could be, you know, I can be envious of the, you know, the king of Saudi Arabia for his wealth. But I don't take it personally. Yeah, envy is more of a personal... Yes? I think the way I use it, I think of envy is more toward material things. And jealousy may be more toward emotional things, like jealous of attention or jealous of love, where envy seems more like the envious of his money or the car or whatever. I think that's the way I use it. So like my three-year-old son, I guess you would say maybe he's jealous of my attention to my mother, to much my wife. And so he kind of gets in there. Sometimes he literally goes between us and produces a wife. So mudita is understood to be kind of, I don't know if it's the opposite of jealousy, but it's often kind of paired in this funny way. And mudita is to feel joy and the joy of others. I don't think that necessarily means you're supposed to make out of your way to feel joy in your partner's affair. But I suppose you could. But it's a beautiful thing to feel joy and the joy of others. And it's not always so easy for people. Some people find it easier to feel compassion for someone's suffering. They just feel delight and joy in the fact that someone else has succeeded in something in their life and to share in that joy. And the fourth of these responses or emotions is equanimity. And equanimity is probably the least understood because equanimity lends itself to the idea that you're supposed to be even. It's kind of like an absence of effect, of emotion. That you're an equanimous, it means you're just kind of like no reaction, nothing phases you, nothing bothers you, you're just really cool. Whereas equanimity in the Buddhist tradition is a deeply heartfelt, almost like a heartfelt emotion. It comes with a really kind of powerful strength, a powerful presence within you. It's kind of like you're so... You just feel so solid and so big and so whole and healthy and everything that someone comes and tells you that they don't like gray sweaters. It doesn't matter. Someone tells you they love gray sweaters on men. It just hardly affects you, right? But if you don't have that kind of equanimity, if you feel really insecure and inadequate and you're just really afraid of what people think of you and you feel like everybody's ready to reject you at a moment... ...you already have rejected you. And then someone comes along and says, you know, gray sweaters, not so nice. And it just feels devastating to think so personally. There's no equanimity, right? So it's more like... It's not like some eviness of mind by just being plain. It's kind of like a real strength, a real power of energy, of heartfulness that is so much stronger than overrides any tendency. You're not going to tend to see anything in that way. Equanimity also arises in relation to other people, what goes on with other people's lives, through the understanding that other people are responsible for their own decisions. Or more, in Buddhist language it said that everyone is the inheritors of their own karma. So even though you can feel compassion and want them to be free of their suffering, if you feel responsible for their suffering, then there's very little chance for equanimity. But to feel like you're not responsible for their suffering, by understanding they've inherited the results of their own karma, in traditional Buddhist language helps you have the kind of healthy distance from them where you don't feel responsible and get sucked in in an unhealthy way. It doesn't mean you stay aloof and distant from the person, it just means that you're more balanced about taking care of them. All four of these can be done as meditation practices. We train ourselves, we develop these intentions in our meditation practice so that we don't leave them to chance. It would be nice if once in a while these things arose. And there are people in Buddhist who actually spend months and years cultivating these things, they become real powerful strengths within them. In our particular meditation tradition, the Vipassana tradition, the one that gets the most attention is loving kindness. And some people say that loving kindness is the foundation for the other three. If you develop that, the other three will kind of follow. Loving kindness is, if a person is neither suffering nor having some great success or happiness in their life, then loving kindness is just a feeling of tender friendliness, of kindness to that person. If you're friendly to someone and they're suffering, then you're liable to feel compassion for them. If you have a friendly attitude towards someone and they're happy, you're liable to feel joy in their happiness. These things, these four Brahma Viharas are very helpful and very important as attitudes towards ourselves. Because many people can somehow see the value of this towards other people, and many of us can have these attitudes towards other people, but there are many people who have none of it towards themselves. And I think probably one of the biggest deficits in America besides the sleek deficit is the self-compassion deficit. I don't think that people have enough self-compassion for themselves. And then with that goes friendliness towards themselves, kind of loving kindness towards themselves, and sympathetic joy. So I know people who have a hard time appreciating their own happiness and success. So I'm raising this three-year-old, and sometimes we have this bed night ritual of listing all the people that love him. So I have this idea that maybe it's nice for him to fall asleep with all these people circled around by all the people who love him by naming them all. Mommy loves you, daddy loves you, and just go through the aunt so-and-so and uncle so-and-so, and on and on and on it goes. And then I'm trying to do some very little, or gently, to loving kindness practice by saying after doing that we go, you know, mommy loves you, may mommy be happy. Uncle Itai loves you, may uncle Itai be happy. And he seems to like that a lot doing this. But then sometimes I'll ask him, you know, who loves you? And there's a certain way of asking it where he knows what the right answer is. He knows that what I'm trying to get at is, his name is Torin. And he says, Torin loves Torin. May Torin be happy. And the idea being that self-love is a very important quality to have. And that's allowable, and it has a place in his life, and, you know, it's completely approved over, accepted, or celebrated, the fact that he would have that. And my hope is that it doesn't make him the world's biggest egotist. But rather that, I don't know what kind of effect this is going to have on a three-year-old growing up. But the teaching in Buddhism, at least, is that self-love is an indispensable foundation for being able to love other people. To have loving kindness towards oneself is necessary in order to develop loving kindness towards other people around. So traditionally in Buddhism, loving kindness is cultivated first towards oneself. And then with that foundation, then we extend it to other people. And though occasionally we meet people, I meet people for whom the ability to self-love is so impossible because of the amount of self-hate or whatever, that they need to start with someone else first. And after they get the hang of it with other people, then they turn around and do it towards themselves. Now these four brahma viharas are nowadays, at least here in the West, considered Buddhist practices, Buddhist virtues and guidance for how to live a life. Scholars who study the Buddhist tradition claim that these are meditation practices and attitudes that existed in India before the time of the Buddha. They were just spiritual traditions of ancient India. These brahma viharas were already present. And the Buddha, many of the things the Buddha adopted into his so-called religion were things he just chose from the milieu of his religious times. And many of us have lost, especially here in the West, we don't realize anymore how much what we call Buddhism now was not originally part of Buddhism at all. And the fact that brahma viharas were not originally part of Buddhism but predated Buddhism makes me think that I like it very much because then they become more universal. And we don't have to think of them as just being Buddhist things, but rather I like to think of them as just being natural capacities we all have and we can all develop them. When I first started doing mindfulness meditation, vipassana, I had done Zen practice for many years. And I was first introduced to vipassana in Thailand and Burma at the vipassana centers where they never did any loving kindness practice. I was never taught it when I was there. And the fact that my teacher in Burma, he made a point of not teaching these things because he really wanted me to stay with the vipassana, just follow that as far as it would go. And what I found while I was doing this vipassana practice that it tenderizes the heart or removes some of the barriers towards our capacity for love and joy. And I found myself at times dissolving in phenomenal pools and oceans of love and loving kindness. Whatever arose in my experience, whatever occurred at all in my experience, I would just meet it with this kind of tremendous feeling of love, you know, and we would just dissolve into this puddle of whatever. It was really, it was a period of phase of my practice. Not that you have to have that phase. It's not like it's necessary or anything, but... Can we sign up for it? And then, now don't get jealous now either. This is a time for sympathetic joy. And then I came back to America and continued my vipassana practice here. And the retreat center where I practiced, they started teaching. But halfway through the retreat, they started teaching loving kindness meditation. And having been this, you know, sterns end student, you know, it was kind of a sadic approach to religious life. The... I thought it was really kind of saccharine-like, this, you know, emphasize on loving kindness and may you be happy, may you be safe and healthy. And I also felt it was artificial. The idea that you would kind of suddenly feel friendly or feel loving kindness, you know. I just kind of took it that that only happened by accident. It just happened spontaneously given circumstances. It wasn't something you cultivated. So when my teacher started doing these meditations of loving kindness, I just tuned them out. You know, it wasn't for me. I was a Zen student, thank you. And then I started... the same thing started happening on the retreat here in America. I started having a strong... kind of so much spontaneously through the meditation. These strong experiences of loving kindness would arise by itself. Because I think it often happens as a result of vipassana practice. And then when the teachers came to do loving kindness practice, I already had it. And I knew exactly what they were talking about. And then it just became... just augmented what I was already feeling, my attitude already had. And then I got really into it. And now I don't think of the loving kindness practice as something artificial. But I see it rather as kind of an awakening of something which is often... with a potential which is within me, within my heart. That is really beautiful and something I delight in. And I'm very happy to do loving kindness practice now. So does that approximately answer your question? It's in the ballpark. You want to ask more specifically? Your concern? I mean I've just been thinking a lot about medita and also I guess you also mentioned about just having the wish of being aware of our own... our own goodness or blessings and the wish that we would not be separated from them. I've just been thinking about it and I hadn't heard that many talks on medita specifically at Kriśāra. It reminds me of a friend of mine who went to India. He was a long time vipassana practitioner, very serious, very much involved. Very mature in his spiritual life. He went to India and he visited an Indian guru. And he asked the guru something like... How he could find grace. Where was grace to be found? And the guru laughed and laughed and laughed and he said it. He said something like, you're neck deep in grace and you're asking where it is. And it was very important for this, my friend. And the fact that he lived in America where he was very relatively comfortable and in years of spiritual practice and certain level of maturity in his practice. The fact that he didn't go with other spiritual friends to India and visit this famous guru. And he had all these wonderful fortuitous circumstances that allowed him to do all these things. And the teacher said, you're neck deep in grace. The fact that you're here and you don't even see it. Many of us don't see the benefits and the grace of our lives. There's so much of it. There's so much that supports our lives and makes it possible that it's really remarkable that we don't just... You know, celebrate more often. But most of us don't really focus that much on what is going right in our life. Because often we take it, unless it's suddenly gone right, because we take it for granted. Like we deserve it or supposed to be this way. And maybe we grew up this way. We grew up and we were supposed to have supermarkets filled with abundant vegetables. No one thinks about this as being one of the most remarkable achievements of humankind. The fact that we can have fresh vegetables all year round by just going into Safeway. I mean... And when's the last time you went to Safeway and kind of celebrated this variety of choice and how easy it was? Wow, how could I have been so lucky to be born here at this time and this place and have so much? Rather you kind of grumble because they don't have the right brand of... They have graham crackers but they don't have cinnamon graham crackers. They don't have low fat cinnamon graham crackers. I'm going to talk to the supervising manager of this. How could it be this way? And you leave in a huff, you know. Because we often focus on the cutting edge of our desires and cutting edge of what the problem is and the cutting edge of our definition of self and what we think we need. And it doesn't take much suffering to begin appreciating what now we take for granted. I think most of us live in states of grace. And the amazing thing is we don't know it. Is that the same as gratefulness? Grace? It could be. Grace is a Christian term, I guess. Grace means... I guess it means feeling of tremendous blessing. A lot of luck or benefit or wealth. Tremendous welfare. Tremendous good blessings. Tremendous auspiciousness. Tremendous support and health. A lot of help that our life is being given. A lot of beauty that's coming into our lives. That's the same as being thankful or being grateful. I would hope that they're almost the same. I hope that... Grace is connected to the word Latin word, I believe, Latin word for free. But gracias, I mean Italian is thank you. Maybe it's also related to thanks. To say grace, it means express your thankfulness. But going to talk about being in a state of grace seems more like being in the recipient of some blessing. The grace of our whole experience. The recipient of some other support. Kind of a lack of fear. A lack of fear. A sense of ease, like graceful. Yes. Well, I just often thought that our environment in general, just America, has been based so much on comparisons or competition. I think that very early on that it's just you get the feeling it's not okay to be where you are, that you're comfortable. Achieving something else in order to feel grace to be in that state. The focus, it doesn't feel comfortable to just be where you are. The customers are so empty as to those people who made it. It's driving. So loving kindness, sympathetic joy, compassion. Compassion is very important. In Mahayana Buddhism, compassion is the most important social emotion. Whereas in Theravada Buddhism, loving kindness is considered the most important. I'm not going to, you know, use to say who's right, which is most important, but compassion is very, very important. So there are times when we can celebrate the sympathetic joy, the feeling of the grace and benefits of our lives, and there are times when a feeling of empathy and concern for the welfare and suffering of others is really what's called for in a different situation. As we become freer, as the mindfulness practice becomes stronger, then hopefully the person becomes more flexible so they can respond appropriately in these different categories, different ways, depending on what the circumstances are. Yes? Are these basically skills or would you attach other ideas and concepts to that? They could be seen as skills. I like to think of them as intentions, because if they're intentions, they don't have to be feelings. Because you can have the intention to be kind towards someone, but you might not feel kindly towards them. But it's your intentions, your wish that you could have that. And so when we do loving kindness practice, we're trying to water the seed of that intention. We're not necessarily trying to make ourselves feel loving or kind. That might come as a byproduct. And in the long term, the benefits come from watering the seed of intention, not from cultivating the feeling. But if I have the intention to meet who would want to be, have loving kindness, have an empty compassion, but I don't do that all the time, every day. What's the most effective way? Well, loving kindness practice is the practice of cultivating that intention. So every day, if a person does loving kindness practice every day, every day will cultivate that intention. And often the acts of loving kindness and feelings of loving kindness come in the wake of the intention. But the intention is most important, because if the intention is strong, then you might find yourself in a situation where you feel really angry with someone. And then that little intention says, oh, you know, I really would like that person to be well and happy, even though the person's a jerk. And so somehow, oh, and then you're kind of surprised by yourself, oh, I seem to have this new wiggling little attitude in there. I never used to have around these kinds of people. And then you have to choose which one that you want to follow through on. I read, maybe I didn't read it here. I read it maybe on Monday night, one night. The story of, it's been going around ever since September 11th. So maybe you've heard it about, I've heard it in two different versions. One was a Native American grandfather, and one was an Indian Indian grandfather, talking to his grandson. And he says something like, you know, inside of me there are two wolves. One wolf is the wolf of anger and hate and vengeance. And the other wolf is the wolf of kindness, compassion, generosity. And they're in a great struggle inside of me for supremacy. And the grandson says, which one is going to win? And the grandfather says, whichever one I feed. So to have accessible intention close at hand allows a person to feed it in a helpful way. If it hasn't been cultivated, it's not accessible close at hand. It's difficult to feed it and develop it. So the skill, you ask if it's a skill, the skill, the intention is not a skill. The skill is learning how, in a healthy way, to strengthen that intention. The skill is how to recognize that intention when we need it, and how to then proceed from there. Yes? Meditation is, meditation is one kind of the approach in a different way, or like, to bring passion. Yeah, the different phrases. But you're focusing on the breath, so what does it mean? Oh, you don't actually focus on your breath when you do loving kindness practice. Let's do it. I'll guide you through loving kindness, short loving kindness meditation. So take a few deep breaths, long, slow, deep breaths. And as you exhale, relax your body, your mind, your thoughts. And then take a couple of more long, slow, deep breaths. But now breathe into the area of your heart center, center of your chest. And fill it up. And then let your breath return to normal. And take a few moments to feel the area around your heart. There's no right or wrong sensations there. But just feel that area. Become familiar with it. And have or imagine that your breath comes in and out through that area. And then take a few moments to think kind thoughts towards yourself. Just in whatever way you want. Just kind of think kindly towards yourself. As if you're your own friend. And see if you can find within yourself the wish for your own happiness. You don't have to be happy right now. But the idea within you that it would be a good idea if you could be happy. That happiness is nice. There's a wish for happiness to be part of your life, a greater part of your life. Maybe you can remember sometimes in the life that you were happy. And think, oh yeah, it would be nice to be happy now. So the very simple wish for your own happiness without expectation that you can succeed at it. Without demand that it should be so. Kind of an open ended wish. And now taking this wish or this intention for your own well-being and happiness. I'm going to say certain phrases of loving kindness out loud. And then you can silently repeat them to yourselves, a whisper in your mind. And each time you say them, you use these phrases and kind of sink into the intention. That it be water to nourish this wish or this intention within you. If you feel no intention for your own happiness, then be open to the possibility that it might arise. So these are the phrases. May I be happy. May I be filled with joy. May I be at ease. May I be peaceful. May I be peaceful. Perhaps feeling tenderness within yourself or a gentleness or kindness. Perhaps not. But allowing for this intention for your happiness to grow. May I be happy. May I be filled with joy. May I be at ease. May I be peaceful. May I be peaceful. Some people do loving kindness practice and completely forget about their breathing, paying attention to it. And some people find it's nice to coordinate the phrases with their breathing. Some people like to say, may I be on the in-breath and then happy on the out-breath. And in doing loving kindness meditation and using these phrases, it can be very helpful to have a steadiness about it. To have a steady ongoing quality of being connected to this possibility, this wish of happiness through these phrases. May I be happy. May I be filled with joy. May I be at ease. May I be at ease. May I be peaceful. The loving kindness practice can have a tenderizing effect on our hearts. The armor of the heart dissolves a little bit. And sometimes the opposite of loving kindness has a chance to surface if it's buried there. Some people will do this practice and feel sadness or anger or rage, grief. It's fine for that to happen. It just means the heart is opening up. And you can either continue with loving kindness practice or stop it for a while and do basic mindfulness towards what you're feeling. And then the practice is also done towards other people. And usually after doing it to yourself, you choose someone who cares about you. Traditionally it's said to be a benefactor. Someone's been a benefactor in your life. Helped you as a teacher, for example, or a parent or a friend. I like to think of it as someone who cares about you. Maybe in your mind's eye you can remember or imagine that person happy. Maybe a time when they were happy. A smile on their face. And then you connect to the wish within yourself that that person could be happy, continue to be happy, grow in happiness. And then without the simple wish, you repeat the following phrases. May you be happy. May you be filled with joy. May you be at ease. May you be at peace. May you be at peace. May you be at peace. And then the loving kindness meditation can develop by expanding loving kindness, the wish for happiness out to different categories of people and other people. Until finally the loving kindness practice is done. For all beings everywhere. May all beings be happy. May all beings be filled with joy. May all beings be at ease. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings everywhere be happy.
