 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and happy to be here with you, happy to welcome you. And there's something that begins to happen, maybe for many of us, if we pay attention, if we allow it to be the case. Something begins to happen as soon as we put ourselves into our meditation posture. Especially if we've been doing it for a long time, it's a familiar posture. And the associations are there, the orientation, the body, mind, hearts, inclination to become meditative, can kind of kick in. And one of the consequences of sitting down to meditate, or one of the aspects of it, is that it is a stopping. If you're sitting in meditation, seated meditation, you've stopped activity, other activities moving about. In your mind, hopefully you've stopped searching the web, or with your eyes, your ears, trying to figure something out, trying to search and study. Perhaps it's a stopping of the rumination, fantasy, spinning out. There's a kind of a stopping that goes on here. And it's a stopping that is not meant to be breaking, bracing. It's a stopping that's meant to help us become clear, to see more clearly, to recognize. It's like making it to a promontory, a vista point. And once we kind of come up to that vista point, we can see the land around us. We see it more clearly. And so this stopping in meditation, and we stop, you know, if it's whatever is easy to stop, we stop. And except for mindfulness, we stop moving as much as we can, stop a lot of discursive thinking, having conversations and talking about things to ourselves. We might stop tensing. Sometimes we don't even know how much we're tensing until we stop and sit down and begin feeling the body. And the body itself will kind of begin releasing the tension, which is kind of a stopping of it. And this stopping is meant to kind of clear the clouds, the fog, help us to see clearly. So it's not stopping for its own sake, but stopping so we can see. So here we are. Some people call it a sacred pause, a sacred stopping. In Chinese Buddhism, the Chinese pictogram character for samadhi or samatha is the Chinese character for stop. So somehow the samadhi is a kind of a deep stopping as opposed to a deep attainment. Just pause, sacred pause. So assuming a meditation posture that supports you to let the body be still. And gently, as the body is still, can you let there be an inner stilling of the body by relaxing? Maybe relaxing from the core outwards. Maybe relaxing from the edges into the core. If you're able to feel some place deep inside that's still peaceful, has some quality of not moving in agitation, soft stillness within as you exhale, relax everything around it and settle into that inner stillness. Gently letting the mind become still, quieting and stopping discursive thoughts. You might still have other kinds of thoughts, simple thoughts of meditation, but the large conversations in the mind. Let them become quiet. If they are the fog, let that fog clear. The sound of awareness has come up, clearing the fog. And with whatever stillness, stopping you can easily do, may that allow you to have a bit more clarity of mind, clarity of awareness, as you accompany your breathing. Thank you. There is a kind of stopping that is resignation, giving up and shutting down. And there's the kind of stopping that is opening up to gaze upon the view, to gaze upon what is here without interfering. Just clarity, letting things come in as clear as they can into view, into perception. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If you find yourself thinking a lot, consider stopping. Consider becoming stiller and in the stilling of the mind, becoming clear. And then let that clearing accompany your breathing or let your breathing accompany the clearness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What can you stop. And in stopping. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And as we come to the end of this sitting for a few moments here assume that your heart your heart's wish is to be able to smile and it's on the verge of smiling. If only something else would stop. What needs to stop to make room for the heart to smile. What fear what desires disappointments would need to pause. So you can gaze upon the world with a smiling heart. Not because you're making it smile because it's what this what the heart wants to do. It's asking to be able to smile to be uncovered from the coverings of fear and desires to spear disappointment grief fantasy. Reamination to allow there to be a pause to all those things. So there can be an uncovering of the smiling heart. And from that heart to gaze upon the world kindly a kind smile that wishes well for everyone. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. Thank you.
