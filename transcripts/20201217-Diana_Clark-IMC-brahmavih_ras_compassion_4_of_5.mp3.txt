The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
A really warm welcome again.
And some of you who don't know, I'm Diana Clark.
I'm sitting in for Gil this morning while he's having cataract surgery.
I know he's planning to be here tomorrow.
We'll see what actually happens.
So maybe we can all send some good wishes to Gil this morning.
So I wanted to talk a little bit about cultivating compassion.
As I said at the very beginning of the guided meditation,
it feels like such a remarkable thing that we don't have to be satisfied
with our factory setting, so to speak, with the way that our heart opens
or has room for or meets difficulties.
But instead we can cultivate, we can practice, we can develop compassion.
It's a remarkable thing.
I think sometimes we underestimate the transformation that is possible
with some practice.
And certainly the Buddha recognized this with mindfulness practice,
with all these practices, right, with concentration practices,
the eight-fold path, and certainly with the Brahma-Vihara practices.
They do make a difference, and they can be transformational
in the same way that all other things that we learn can have an influence on us.
And that is drop by drop into the water,
drop by drop into the jug is how the water drug is filled or something like that.
So each moment in which we spend time cultivating has an effect,
even though we might not see it at that time and certainly during meditation,
just because we're creating the conditions in which compassion
or indeed loving kindness, any Brahma-Vihara might arise,
doesn't mean that it is going to arise.
We're just putting the conditions in place.
So often the impact or the effects of a Brahma-Vihara practice
isn't felt or seen on the cushion, like during the meditation,
but it shows up in our daily life as a way that slowly our default reaction
to difficulties or different situations that we find ourselves in
just starts to be one more and more of warmth and care.
So I just want to offer this that even though the meditation practice is certainly contrived,
but it's a purposeful way in which we can develop loving kindness and compassion,
any of the Brahma-Viharas,
and even though it might feel like, well, nothing's really happening during this meditation period,
don't think that this isn't having an effect,
that it isn't creating the conditions for changes.
Certainly that's been the case for me.
I'll just share that since doing some regular Brahma-Vihara practice,
loving kindness and compassion, equanimity and sympathetic joy,
I've noticed that I'm more often saying warm hearted or funny things to myself
when I notice that I'm making mistakes or where I forget something.
Whereas before there used to be like a tone of little disappointment or even some meanness,
now there's some tenderness in this little inner voice when it speaks to myself.
Oh, Toyota, it's okay, it's quite something.
So Gil earlier this week talked about the compassion yesterday,
specifically he spoke about it having different elements.
It is a contact with suffering, caring about the suffering
and being motivated to do something about the suffering.
So these different elements all come together
and different strengths, different, of course at different times there's different emphases.
I appreciate something very much that Jill Shepard, a really great Dharma teacher has said,
that compassion is the love-child of Mehta and Duka.
That is compassion is what arises, what is born out of when this warm heartedness
meets difficulties or someone else having difficulties or ourselves having difficulties.
So I like this idea of Karuna, compassion, being the love-child of Mehta and Duka.
So I wanted to read just a short little excerpt from the sutras that talks about
expressing compassion in one way that the Buddha described it showing up in the world.
This is an excerpt and the Buddha says,
there are some who have given up and then there's this long list of things that aren't so helpful.
So this long list includes covetousness, ill will, irritability, hostility,
offensiveness, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit,
unhelpful desires and wrong view. It's a really long list.
So there are some who have given these up and the Buddha continues
and when they have given these up they are practicing the way that is proper
for someone who is a practitioner, who is a follower of his.
And then he goes on and he says,
and when they see themselves cleansed or abandoned these unskillful qualities, these unwholesome qualities, gladness springs up.
There's a certain amount of gladness like, oh, I don't have all those qualities anymore.
And then when gladness arises, then joy arises.
And then when joy arises, tranquility arises. And then when tranquility arises, happiness arises.
And then when happiness arises, concentration arises.
And then with concentration and that the person does loving kindness practice
and they meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth direction.
We might say this to the east, to the south, to the west, to the north.
And in the same way above, below, across, everywhere and all around,
they spread a heart full of love to the whole world, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
I'll just say briefly, some of you may recognize that little sequence of getting rid of things that are unwholesome or unhelpful.
And then it goes into gladness, joy, tranquility, happiness and concentration.
You might recognize this as what Gil was calling Dharma Samadhi or Samadhi Dharma, Dharma Samadhi, I think.
And he did a number of 7 a.m. talks on this.
So kind of like connecting that this Brahmavahara practice.
But then this teaching goes on from the Buddha.
So after having some concentration and then spreading loving kindness
and then the teaching goes on to say they meditate spreading a heart full of compassion in one direction,
the second direction, third direction, the fourth direction.
And in the exact same way that it said about loving kindness, then it goes to compassion.
So we can maybe like translate this Sutta, kind of like operationalize it, if you will.
We can think about it as first to let go of what gets in the way of compassion.
As part of the way to cultivate is to as best we can.
So some ways that things that might get in the way of cultivating and practicing with compassion is having fear
that we might be too overwhelmed when we meet the suffering.
Remember that compassion is when loving kindness, this warmth meets difficulties.
And then there's this compassion, this tenderness that just naturally arises.
But it's of course we might have some hesitation, we might have some reluctance initially
to kind of like really meet the suffering.
After all, we're hardwired to avoid it to meet difficulties.
So it's natural and sometimes it's appropriate.
Maybe it's not time for us to touch into the suffering of a lovable being or of our own
or maybe we just don't quite have the steadiness to meet the suffering of others.
So part of the way we can practice with this is to cultivate some mindfulness and some clear seeing
so that we can first recognize whether our hesitation is just a knee-jerk reaction towards fear
and or to recognize it's just a natural hesitation
as well as some mindfulness, some stability of mind and being present for what's happening
can help us to become familiar with our own suffering.
Because often what happens when we meet the suffering of others is the unfinished business
of our own hearts, to use an expression that Jack Cornfield uses,
the unfinished business of our hearts gets activated when we meet the suffering of others.
So maybe it's worthwhile to spend some time working with our own suffering to increase our capacity
as well as to gain some familiarity.
When is our little bit of hesitation of meeting the suffering?
When is it just a natural reaction or when is it some real wisdom saying,
now's not the time?
So we can spend some time with mindfulness practice and maybe getting some stability of mind
like we did in the guided meditation and like in the sutra, if we use this word,
concentration, samadhi can also be translated as collectedness or some non-distraction
or sense of wholeness or integrity.
In some ways it might be like putting in place a keel in the sailboat
that is that big long piece that's at the bottom of the sailboat
that helps prevent it from getting tipped over when it hits maybe the winds of some suffering.
That's one way to how we can begin our practice and to work with some of the difficulties we might have.
And then we might warm the heart, maybe we might imagine having some kindling
and lighting the kindling.
Maybe even sometimes it's paper things that can catch a flame quickly and easily.
So we do some love and kindness practice again starting where it's easy
and allowing the heart to feel warm and maybe the coziness of sitting in front of some crackling flames
in a nice way, in a really nice way.
And then we can imagine some difficulties that the loveable being is having.
And then allowing the warmth that is already there to be transformed into some tenderness and some care
and some able to connect with the suffering, to care about it
and to have a willingness to do something about the suffering
and recognizing that at the moment we're sitting in meditation
doesn't mean we're going to get up from our meditation and go fix things
but to recognize that sincere wish for the suffering to end.
And we can do this as I said in the guided meditation
just using our imagination and tuning into the connection
that we are having with a loveable being and a loveable being that's having difficulties
and just radiate compassion.
That's what's in the suit does.
And then a later adaptation is to include the phrases
which is very common today and I often am using phrases.
Sometimes I'm just doing radiating.
Maybe it's a complain and experiment with different ways.
And phrases that might be helpful to use is
may you be free from suffering.
May you know peace.
And you might have your own versions of that.
So some way in which we can practice compassion, cultivate it, develop it
by purposefully bringing it into our meditation practice
which will help us meet it or bring compassion when we meet difficulties in the world
either in ourselves or others.
So I'm wishing you freedom from suffering, freedom from difficulties.
But if you find that they do arise, may you have some warmth and tenderness
and care for yourself, compassion for yourself.
And may our care, connection, compassion for ourselves and for others
may that benefit all beings, all beings everywhere.
Thank you.
