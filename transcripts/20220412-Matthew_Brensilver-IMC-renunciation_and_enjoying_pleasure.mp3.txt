The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So quote, so far as we are mere bundles of habit, we are imitators and copyers of
our past selves. It follows first of all that the teacher's prime concern should
be to ingrain into the pupil that assortment of habits that shall be most
useful to them throughout life. Education is for behavior and habits are the
stuff of which behavior consists. The great thing in all education is to make
our nervous system our ally instead of our enemy. It's William James. So yesterday
we explored helplessness and power. Opening, opening the heart to helplessness
illuminates our power. And today another pair, renunciation and passion. So the
fantasy of something for nothing runs deep in my mind. Like sometimes I'll
notice I'll just randomly look down at the sidewalk to see if someone dropped
money there. You know, like the thrill of something for nothing runs deep. But
mindfulness is not something for nothing. It is a path of relinquishment and we
don't exactly get to have the Dharma and have our life. We don't exactly get to
have the Dharma and our life. But I want my life. I want my dreams and my stories
and my pleasures and my routines my habits. And I want the Dharma. But I don't
know. I don't think we can have it all. That might be kind of American fantasy of
Buddhism. Zajin Amaro on renunciation. The fact that the Buddha was a monk gets
lost. Of course, people are free to practice as they want. Nonetheless, many
Western Dharma centers seem to marginalize what to the rest of the
Buddhist world is central and historically vital to the whole process of
Dharma practice and enlightenment. It's like opening up the chest,
detaching all the veins and arteries, carefully removing the heart and
maintaining the body on a life support system. One can't help wonder, is this
thing really alive? Is this going to carry on? Obviously, my perspective is
slanted. I'm a card carrying monk. But in wedging Dharma teachings into a
comfortable life, one may be missing something that's crucial to the Dharma.
I would suggest that people look closely at that. Is the Dharma something that I
tack onto my life? Or is it something that I offer myself up to? I've always
loved that phrase. It's the Dharma something we tack on or offer ourselves
up to. We fear impoverishment in letting go. But as we let go, as we let go, the
hole in the center of our being gets smaller. The hole in the center of our
being gets smaller. We need less to fill it up. In other words, as we relinquish,
as we let go, this actually frees us up. And we know that we can let go. We know
we can let go. And so we're not afraid, we're less afraid of not having what we
like. I think the Pasana practitioners are perhaps a little too
vigilant about pleasure. At the slightest sign of pleasure, we say to
ourselves, oh my goodness, don't get attached, don't get attached. And so
there's a certain kind of almost defensiveness against pleasure in our
practice and our lives. As we train, we know we can let go and we're less
afraid about holding on. We know we can just let go again. An attachment in the
end is not a sin. It's just dukkha. I remember a friend, a kind of wild,
brilliant Dharma friend, emphasis on wild, saying that the meditative
path is parasympathetically biased, biased towards the tranquilizing side. But
this path is enlivened and brightens us rather than flattens us. And all this
letting go, this renunciation frees us up to enjoy pleasure and goodness more
completely. It frees us up to enjoy pleasure more completely. And so
sometimes we make the distinction between craving and desire, tanha, chanda. And
tanha, that craving, is that kind of bottomless thirst, the fever dream of
longing that's never actually satisfied. And so sometimes I say like craving is
our frenemy. Yeah, as the kids say. Craving is our frenemy. But what distinguishes
desire from craving is that desire can actually be satisfied. In desire, in
longing, we're actually not asking too much of pleasure. We're asking just
right. Now, this path is a path of dismantling craving. But as we do that, as
we work to dismantle tanha, sometimes chanda gets squashed too. And as we, as we
let go, some of the drivenness, the desperation around pleasure is gone. And so
we can actually enjoy, we can actually enjoy. Now I talk about equanimity with
unpleasantness a lot. Yeah, it is a, this is a path of purification and it
reveres the wholesome unpleasant. The wholesome unpleasant has a kind of
reverential place on this path. But what does equanimity with pleasure look like?
We're being asked to have equanimity with that too. And I would say equanimity
with pleasure looks like a very uncomplicated, intense delight and
satisfaction. It looks like enjoyment without compulsivity. And do we still
prefer pleasure over pain, of course, but our heart is more flexible, less
dependent, less reliant on budgeting pleasure in the usual ways we do. And
even, even egoic pleasure. Yeah, we're not defended against that either. We
feel that that feels better than insults. Yeah. Or, yeah, we, we're not
defended against it, nor are we entangled in it. You know, a big part of
Dharma is about de-shaming, suffering, pain. We were so moralistic any time we
feel, feel pain or kind of run into the first noble truth. We were moralistic
about it. We make it mean something about our being. And so a lot of Dharma
practice is about de-shaming pain, but it's also about de-shaming pleasure.
And that's a tender zone for exploration, because we are exposed in our
desire, we are exposed in our pleasure, in our dependence and our need and our
longing, we're less self-contained and more, there's a vulnerability in that
too, we're doing this consciously. And we start to, to free ourselves up, to
loosen up, we become alive in our pleasure, we ask our pleasure only to
do what it can do and not more. And so this gesture of relinquishment, of
renunciation, of simplicity actually frees us up in some deep ways to, to
enjoy, to enjoy deeply. And when pleasure comes, pleasure comes, it is
satiating, it supports us, it provides a kind of, yeah, sort of resource from
which we can draw when our next task is to have equanimity with the inevitable
difficulties of a human life. So relinquishment frees us up to enjoy, offer
this for your consideration and pick up what's useful, leave the rest behind.
