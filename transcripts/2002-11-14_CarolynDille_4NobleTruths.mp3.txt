 So the Buddha, as you may know, Buddha means awakened one. The Buddha didn't take any other title than being awake. That's what he characterized himself as, and that's what others of his time, the historical Buddha, characterized him as too. So I think that's a very interesting use of, I think that's a very interesting term, to call someone or oneself. So what it brings up for me is, well, what did the Buddha awake from, and what did he awake to? And in a phrase I like from a Buddhist practitioner and contemporary scholar and historian is that he awoke from the sleep of existential delusion, which kind of encapsulates a lot, but what does that mean? Well, he left behind this record in the Four Noble Truths that in a way explains what that means. They're called noble in a sense because they refer to the Dharma or the Dharma. The truth is a translation of that term, Dharma or Dharma. Or reality, the kind of ultimate reality, that the ground reality that holds all of this that goes on, that holds our lives, really. So I'd like to try to go through these. This will just be hitting the highlights because, of course, there's 2,500 years behind these Four Noble Truths of human interaction with them, and they're very deep and profound. And one thing that makes them deep and profound, in my view, is that they are so concise, that they're encapsulated in this really condensed form. But, of course, one can say a lot. There's a lot to say about them. In fact, another thing that my personal take that makes them noble is that they merit. They merit attention in our lives. A lifetime's we can spend our lives looking at these, living the rest of our lives too. We don't have to devote exclusively just to the Noble Truths, but they can become a peace with our lives in whatever we do. So, I think it's worth remembering that what the Buddha awoke to was a present moment reality experience of what these truths are. This was one of his real claims that set him apart from other seekers and philosophers of his time, of which there were many. And some of these truths, as you'll recognize, they're not exclusive to the Buddha or to Buddhism, that humankind has been engaged with these questions about what it is to be alive and how to live our lives, ever since we have historical records in every culture. But the Buddha did have some particular takes on it that were quite distinguished. And one of them was that he awoke and saw that each human being had the capacity to awake to these truths in the present moment, in present moment experience. That's why we spend so much time meditating in the present moment and being with our breath or whatever our present moment experience is. Another word, I think, that helps me frame these truths, these ways of understanding our human nature, is to call them the Four Noble Practices, in a way, because they contain within them an invitation to really take them into our lives and embody them and live them. They're not some sort of metaphysical or... Actually, I think I've got it. Thanks, Jim. Something kind of like physics, you know, that we can understand and get, or maybe physics isn't a good example. We don't spend too much of our time with physics, but they're more like practices and skills. They offer that. They have that invitation. So the first truth is that the human condition is composed of... There's a lot of it is stress and suffering and anguish. That's just part of our lives. That's the way things are set up from birth through our lives to death. But that... And along with that is that we're not able to control these kind of aspects. And another part of that first truth is that we can add more anguish and stress and suffering on top of what's just there and part of human nature. That's really the first noble truth is what we add to it. And that's a term that you might hear that a lot in if you start to look into this. In Pali, it's called dukkha, which is often translated as suffering. So we bring an extra dimension, is the first noble truth of this, of anguish or stress, to what already exists that we can't control in our lives. And that was kind of well known in philosophical systems during the Buddhist time. So then there's... Through that first truth, the Buddha saw quite clearly, it seems to me, that knowing this, that we bring something to it, is we needed an action plan. We needed some way to get, you know, to see how we can hold that suffering, how we can be with that, how we might even shift our understanding of it or widen our understanding of it. So if he's famous for this phrase, he said, I teach one thing and one thing only, suffering and the end of suffering. And the four noble truths kind of point to the practices that show us what our suffering is on deep levels and also how we might end it. And the second truth is the one that says there are causes for the suffering that underlie this kind of suffering that we bring to our life experiences as human beings. And craving or clinging is kind of the base cause. But that has many different manifestations, but the most important and frequently encapsulated in the Buddhist texts are greed, hatred and delusion. Craving and clinging in this second noble truth is understood not only to be craving in the sense of addiction of holding something to you, but also also rejecting things, pushing things away. That's also a form of clinging in the second noble truth. And the origin, well, where does this craving come from? The origin of this craving is rooted in our ignorance of our impermanent self nature. And so these are two other key kind of insights that the Buddha himself brought to things that people were discussing in Hindu philosophy and other philosophies as well. Our impermanent nature, and these are called anicha or impermanence and anata. The fact that we don't have an abiding self that is like a super self like in Hindu philosophy of the Atman, but that everything is a process in a way, we could use that terminology in today's language, that it's all flowing and going on. And of course we have a self and an individuality and a personality. But there's nothing, that's a process that exists within certain boundaries of time and under certain conditions. But that is constantly changing. It comes into being, it changes constantly throughout its process, and then it goes out of material physical being anyway. So the Buddha wasn't a metaphysician. He didn't, he said, this is what I've seen, that there is no permanent self or soul that we can identify with. So in the third noble truth, he brings the good news, which is that the suffering and anguish, this craving, clinging, these delusions can exist, that we have choices that we can make in our lives as human beings. We can let them go. We can let our craving go and we can dispel our ignorance. And this is another real implicit call to action. The call to action, it kind of ups the ante here. The stakes get, you know, higher and maybe more interesting. Oh, okay, well, I know suffering and I can even kind of, I could entertain that, theoretically at least, that the cause of suffering is my craving and clinging. But, well, where does that leave me? But the possibility of letting it go makes it interesting for us. So the fourth noble truth is also called the eightfold middle path, because the fourth noble truth has eight parts to it, or the middle way. And this is kind of the real, the kind of the nitty gritty of practice descriptions of how we might go about seeing what causes us suffering, and all other beings, not just individually, but all other human beings. And what we might, how we can actually go about kind of dismantling the suffering, deconditioning ourselves from these conditioned ways we have of being in the world. So the specific steps, the, the, the, the, they're presented in, in a certain order and that it varies a little bit tradition to tradition. But I like to look at them, and this is an ancient metaphor too, as a, as kind of a wheel, and that works really well for me with the hub. So it's not like you follow the list and go, you do the first noble truth and the second noble truth, and then, you know, although you can do it that way, but really, you can enter at any place, at any time, wherever you are in your present moment experience, and any one of these can be a path, an avenue into seeing deeply into what your own experience is in that moment, and how, and how you can make choices about acting skillfully and wisely or not. So if they're, the eight parts would be around the hub of the perimeter of the wheel, and they all lead back into the hub, the center, and that's where they all connect with one another. So you can even jump around from the first one in this tradition is clear seeing and comprehension or right view. And the last one is right concentration. But you can connect those two up without going through the intermediaries necessarily. In fact, that happens. So the first one, clear seeing and clear comprehension also translated as right view or right understanding. So it's, it's about seeing our choices, clearly seeing what choices we have in the moment in our lives. And it's also on, on another level, knowing for ourselves directly and experientially what reality is, what the deepest realities are. The second, the second noble truth, or part of the eightfold path in the fourth noble truth is clear purpose or, or right resolve or right intention. And that's about a conscious intention to live with awareness to, to be awake to our lives, to bring a kind of an awakeness and alertness to our lives. And also on another level, it's an alignment with the deep truth of things as we have known and experienced them for ourselves. I keep coming back to that because for me that's very fundamental to, to the Buddhist path. In, in many times throughout Buddhist discourses, the Buddha said things like, know this for yourself. In his last talk before he died, gathered all his, all the people who, who were interested in him and coming to his teachings around him and, and he knew he was dying and so did they and they were all distraught. And some of them asked the question, well, what are we going to do when you're not here? You know, we need some guidance. And he said, you have all the guidance you need within this body. Be an island unto yourself using these metaphors that were common at the time. The, the world of delusion is called samsara in conditioning is and delusion is called samsara in Sanskrit. And, and that's the way the world was understood. That, that there, that mostly we live on this level where we seem surrounded by suffering with from within from without because we just haven't tapped in yet to that more fundamental ground. So be an island unto yourself. He also used the metaphor of being a lamp, a light unto yourself. Each of us can do that according to what the Buddha offered to us. So within our own experience. And then the, the third noble truth is clear speech or right speech. And this is, this is one that's as Westerners we find this one sometimes one of the most tricky because we're just used to talking and not thinking. We're not thinking too much about our speech. We know, we know something is a general kind of morality or, or, or is, is abstention from lying, for example. But, but there's also the positive side of that is speaking what we know to be true. In other words, getting in touch with, with ourselves at that moment and speaking just what we know to be true and being silent if we don't really know it to be true. And it doesn't mean like not like always making unkind remarks or, or, or being sort of insensitive to others. It's not that kind of brusque truth like, oh, you have to tell the truth always. It's, it's, in fact, the Buddhist path is, is very situational, one could say, or I'll go ahead and say it using those to be present for what the situation is now and to see what's required. So with the, but it's interesting that, that the Buddha put a lot of emphasis on this right speech. Telling the truth and abstaining from slander and abusing others and gossip, just sort of mean hearted stuff, in other words. I want to back up a little bit and, and say that historically before the, the eightfold path there's the Dhammapada, which is a short collection of verses of very, very succinct teachings of the Buddha or sayings of the Buddha that came about, even before the Noble Eightfold Path, according to the scholars that I've heard and studied. And, and this points to some, a cluster of these, these parts of the Eightfold Path that we're talking about now, such as clear speech and right speech. He says in that, in the Dhammapada, to do no evil, to cultivate good, to purify one's heart and mind, this is the teaching and understanding of the awakened ones. So about how we can be in the world, to refrain from doing evil. Of course, that, that implies that, that we can recognize what doing evil or unskillful or harmful things are. And to know what cultivating good is, and to know how to purify one's heart and mind. Purification, the Buddhists generally mean allowing ourselves to see, to let go of the conditioning that makes us see things in terms of dualities and opposites and seeing the, our true nature, which is, which is pure. Which is unstained, according to ancient kind of metaphors. For me, this kind of purification is discovering who we are most completely. We each have our own story and personality and individual body and that's, that's a great gift of meditation, which is another one of the parts of the Eightfold Path. Which we're going to move on to. The fourth, the fourth part of the path is wise action or right action. So once again recognizing what that is. It's also recognizing the interrelatedness of, of beings. And then when we do that, we can live according to a natural law that is compassion. And the way that manifests itself is in, we, we naturally don't want to kill or take life and we don't want to steal. We don't want to engage in sexual misconduct. And we want to keep the, we want to keep the clarity of our minds and the purity of our minds. And so we don't intoxicate ourselves. Then there's wise livelihood and right livelihood or right livelihood. And that's choosing our work in this world the best we can with the intention to be of benefit to ourselves and others. And it's dealing honorably with other beings when we work together with them. And I personally think this one's not so easy in the complicated world we live in because we don't see all the ramifications of what we do. But we do the best we can. All of these truths are still rooted in what we can bring to them and how we can make them our practices is to really pay attention to our intention. If we're doing the best we can, that's, that's good. They're not, they're not absolutes and they're not sort of enshrined out there that we, that we aspire to, but we never really think we will attain. In fact, one of my teachers says they're all impossible. There's no way that you can not really kill anything. Being alive means being, you know, going through that cycle of birth and death. That's what, that's what it's part of. So it's not an idealistic and metaphysical kind of practice we're talking about here. It's just bringing our best intentions to being awake and present for our experience. And then that lets us see how to engage in wise action and right livelihood. Then there's wise use of energy or wise effort or right effort. And that's a kind of a perseverance, keeping coming back to cultivating skillful states and letting go of, of unskillful or harmful ways of being or states of mind. That kind of perseverance that we bring to just being with our breath again and again can be with everything again and again, even when it's difficult. So Buddhism is called the middle way in this particularly this section. The Buddha came to this after trying a lot of really extreme practices that were going on when he was alive. And said this, this is not the way and including practices of extremist cedacism where he almost starved himself to death and and practices of extreme, extreme kind of exploration of very high meditative states, where he got quite blissful and kind of blissed out kind of states. And he, he realized that he came to the understanding that those were not the deepest truth. I said, well, I'm going to try again. And, and that's when he, when the Four Noble Truths kind of crystallized and came to him. And the last one with this eightfold path came as the middle way. So being right where we are in our present mind body, being with that, rather than seeing these as something out there. Then the Seventh Noble Truth is clear attention or right mindfulness. Now mindfulness is a very popular term in this tradition of Vipassana and insight. And it's about our awareness and our attention and bringing that to our whole being, our mind and our body as best we can in every moment, all of our senses, whatever sense stores coming up for us, what we hear, what we smell, what we taste, what goes on in our minds. And it's also holding right, this right mindfulness and clear attention is also holding what comes to us in a non-judgmental way so that we're not identified with it or clinging to it, in other words. And then the last part of this Noble Eightfold Path is clear concentration or right concentration. And that's also what we do when we just keep coming back to our breath or whatever our meditation is at any given time. So we focus our awareness, we collect our mind and unify our mind. Because the Buddha also recognized that the mind was the key factor here. The mind is kind of the way in to all of it. That's where the Dhammapada starts out. Our life is shaped by our mind. So clear concentration and right concentration, we unify our minds, we bring our minds back to the ground of unity and stillness. And we discern things as they are at the deepest levels then, or we have that possibility. So I want to end by saying how I think this is such, it's a really practical path. And it's, we begin to know ourselves through cultivating this path through meditation. And we know our own stress and our clinging. And we also know what's under it or above it or around it. We also get in sense, which is why I think we're all here. Because we know there's something there. We know it's not just all, in the words of one poet, there's more to life than money, fame and bites of roasted meat. We kind of know that that's true. And we want to find out how we can really express that and live that and be that. So these practices are real great hopes to us, I think. We meet our unhappiness, our anger, our dissatisfaction with clear comprehension, with right understanding. We don't cling to them. We know we don't have to hold on to them, to identify them. We forget our biases, our conditioning towards our own sorrow or anger, even our own joy. We know, oh, this is here. It's interesting, just like our breath, which refreshes us and sustains us. Oh, what's this? This is kind of interesting. What is this thing called breath? You know, we can even be aware of our most, our biggest screw ups, our most horrible things, the horrible things that others have done to us, that we've done to others. The way it is in the world is just awful sometimes. And yet we can, by following these practices, come to an understanding of how to be with that. And hold that with a peaceful heart, as one of my teachers says. You know, it's a little bit like a magic trick sometime. It's like you're watching the show and where did all the rabbits come from? I don't know, but they're there. They're all there. They're all part of it. And we can see that and when we, when we practice right mindfulness, right concentration, we can really see deeply for ourselves where things appear, how they appear. And we can follow this middle way just as we are where we are. We can start at any time, any moment is an access point. Any moment.
