Dharmette: Confidence like a Snake  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

An image that I’m quite fond of is that of a snake that 
grows bigger , and as it grows bigger , at some point the 
snake sheds its old skin and grows  a new one. 
Sometimes that’s how we grow : in the challenges we 
have, things we need to outgrow, things we need to 
face and let go of perhaps , and the way we let go. The 
way we become free of some  things i s by just growing 
bigger, and then  it just slough s off. That’s nice because 
then we don’t have to be so actively involved with trying 
to let go.  
 
Sometimes, people are overly concerned with their 
problems. Certainly there can be problems , but some of 
the p roblems we have probably deserve less attention 
than they are given , and some of the problems we have 
deserve more attention than they’re given. Knowing 
which direction you should go is part of the wisdom of it 
all. There are problems that we should acknow ledge 
and recognize , but it’s not so important for us to 
personally be involved in directly fix ing them . 
Sometimes, it’s better just to keep growing, developing 
and hold ing the course , and  develop oneself to become 
bigger . And then these things will just s lough off  on their own. 
 
One of the important factors that can help us to grow 
bigger, so things can just  kind of fall of f, is confidence  – 
to go through our life and our practice with confidence. 
Confidence is one of the great things that kee ps us on 
course, keep s us going , and keeps us taking the next 
step and the next breath. In terms of meditation 
practice, it gets us back on the cushion to practice, gets 
us to be mindful in our daily life – with the confidence to 
show up in an honest way, the confidenc e to show up in 
an open way, the confidence to be engaged on a path 
of practice , and to keep walking the path.  
 
That confidence in supporting us to keep walking the 
path helps us to grow . And as we grow and develop, 
then some of the problems we have will stop being 
problems – not because our problems are fixed , but 
because they ’ve fallen aside. It depends what kind of 
problems we are talking about. Maybe you have some 
of your own you can think about . But if you get a flat tire, 
no amount of mindfulnes s is going to help. If I’m 
confident in my practice , and follow the eight -fold path , 
the tire will take care of itself. That’s just magical 
thinking , right? So some things you do have to take care 
of. 
 
But if you are really anxious about something, 
constan tly anxious a bout anything at all , then sometimes it is useful to address anxiety directly , and 
sometimes it’s best to ignore it  – to let it be there, and to 
try not to let it get in the way . But you keep doing the 
practice , and as you grow in the practice , then you 
might find that the anxiety can either fall away , or 
become less and less of a big deal because it’s not so 
interesting for you anymore. You become bigger than it . 
 
As some of you know, an analogy I like is that of a fly 
landing on ant. It is a big deal for the ant , but if the same 
fly lands on the back of an elephant, it’s not a big deal 
for the elephant. So would you rather be an ant or an 
elephant? Would you rather be psychologically  big? 
While some of the things are still there, you’ re so much 
bigger , and it’s not really so much of a big deal. You 
might still have some anxiety , but there’s so much 
space to hold things, s o much bigness to support you 
that the anxiety i s not going to get i n the way . You’re still  
able to go through your life. B ut if you’re an ant, then 
anxiety is a big deal , and it’s very hard to keep going.  
 
The word ‘confidence’ in Pali is saddhā , which is 
sometimes also translated as ‘faith’, or ‘trust’ or 
‘conviction. ’ Different people have different associations 
or resonances with these different words (faith, trust 
confidence or conviction ), but I like the word 
‘confidence ’ a lot because it points to a personal quality  
– how we are . It’s how we relate to what we are doing. If 
we can have confidence in the value of showing up, of being present , of being honest , then we can grow bigger 
pretty fast. It doesn’t have to be a twenty -year project . 
Sometimes it can be in a single day that y ou can feel 
stronger, clearer , and calmer.  You can feel yourself 
becoming more able to be honest and expressive of 
yourself. You can be more willing to show u p. Here I 
am.  
 
With confidence in the path and practice, we will grow . 
And as we grow, things wil l change . Some  things fall 
away, and some things become less and less 
significant. When they become les s significant, they are 
no longer obstacles for us . They are just there o n the 
side, like a pesky fly, but they’re  not going to stop us 
from doing what we need to do.  
 
So you might want to spend some time considering the 
role that confidence has for you in your life , and how 
you can tap into the confidence that you have. 
Sometimes, people focus on how they don’t have  
confidence , on their lack of confidence . But I would 
suggest that you have confidence. It may be small . It 
might not be something  that you pay much attention to. 
You might have blinders on so you don’t identify with 
having it . But certainly you have some confidence .  
 
See if you can find out what you have confidence in , 
and then use that as a foundation to grow and develop 
and keep going.  Use the confidence you have as food , as a support and encouragement to keep going , 
because it’s in the going, in the pr acticing and in the 
doing that you will become stronger and bigger  – step 
by step.  
 
Those are my thoughts . Does anyone have any 
questions,  comments about the talk , or testimonials of 
being a really big snake ? 
 
Practioner #1 : I recently came back from a retreat -like 
vacation in a cottage on a river. On the last day we went 
river rafting. I hadn’t done that in a while , and I was in 
my own boat , which I’ve never done before on a river. I 
was very scared at first. I had done rafting a while back 
but there we ren’t any extreme rapids. The first one was 
hard, really hard , and I almost panicked and said , “I 
can’t do this. ” Then the most amazing shift happened. I 
just changed my posture a little bit ; the boat co -
operated ; and the next three hours were like a minut e. 
In no time with just a beautiful transparency – what they 
call a jade river – and I was just part of it. It was 
transformative . And so your Dharmette is very  fitting. 
The confidence became incredibly embracing and 
guided me along.  
GF: And some of the old skin of fear fell away.  
Practioner #1:  Yeah, completely. And my navigation 
became spot on.  
GF: Lovely, thank you.  
 Practioner #2:  Thank you, I like this word ‘confidence. ’ 
Sometimes I feel like it’s not natural for me to feel 
confident , and so I’d like to know if it comes with a ‘how 
to’, aside from shifting your posture?  
GF: Yes, sitting up straight er can help . A few things I 
would say is , as I said earlier , that you might not think of 
yourself in terms of confidence , but you certainly  have 
some confidence in some things. You probably have 
confidence when you wake up in the morning that you 
know how to make yourself breakfast . But you don’t 
think of confidence as part of  that because it’ s so 
simple. Like “Boy, am I  so confident because I’m going 
to make breakfast, ” right? But there is a kind of inherent 
confidence in doing something as simple as that. So I’d 
encourage you to look at the places where  you are 
already confident in your ability to do things , and 
appreciate that. You might  discover that you have more 
confidence  than you currently realize , and that will feed 
you.  
The other thing is that confidence grows by doing. You 
don’t become more confident by just sitting around 
hoping that it will fall from the sky . It comes from action , 
so you might look for simple actions where you don’t 
feel like you have much confidence . Choose a situation 
that i s not really a big deal, nothing really challenging – 
just something a tiny bit challenging , and take small 
steps to l earn to have confidence in that activity , and 
then the next activity , and then the next activity.  
Using the example of going down a river where you have no confidence that you know how to  handle a boat 
on a river, first go out on a completely serene flat l ake 
with no current. “Oh I can do that .” And then find the 
slowest, widest piece of a shallow river you could ever 
find, so that if you fall over, you only fall into four inches 
of water. “Oh I can do that, I’m confident I can do four 
inches of water .” And then go where it’s five inches and 
a bit faster.  “Oh I can do that .” The principle being : 
slowly , to do small things that are doable , and feel the 
confidence that comes with that . And over time , you can 
get to the things that are really challenging.  
Practioner #2:  Thank you  
GF: Great . 
 
Thank you all.
