The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So there are, sometimes when mindfulness is taught, the way it's presented is that
we're being mindful of something, mindfulness of breathing, mindfulness
of listening sounds, mindfulness of thinking, mindfulness of emotions,
mindfulness of the body. And that's all wonderful. It's a very, very profound way
of practicing. But an important part of mindfulness is also mindfulness of
mindfulness, aware of your awareness. And it's kind of like asking the
question of, how am I aware right now? How am I being mindful right now? So to
explain a little bit how this, why this is useful, maybe during these rains we've
had lately, I don't know if you've seen this, but I've been, I've been by rivers
and creeks that have normally had clear water. But because of the rain and
the water washing off the muddy hillsides, it's bringing mud into the creek and
the creeks are full of mud. And so that's all muddy. So water, you know, will
take in all kinds of things that are poured into it. So if you pour red dye
into water, the water turns red. If it's green dye, it becomes green. If it's mud,
it's muddy, all kinds of things like that. So recently I saw a river that was
white. It was the parts of it because there's all these white minerals there
being, salts that were being leached off into the, into the water. And so it was
white for a while. So our awareness also can absorb all kinds of things. And so
awareness is often not just kind of clear water, but it comes along with how
things are. And so if you ask the question, how am I aware? How am I
attending to things? How am I tuning in? How am I paying attention? How am I being
mindful? You might look back and say, oh, I'm, I'm being mindful, aware through the
lens or through the color of fear. And I'm just always, I'm so worried about
everything. And I'm just kind of paying attention to everything. I'm kind of like
on alert for something or paying attention through desire. There's a
wish for something, trying to get something. We're paying attention through
the lens of, of, I have to do this right. There's a me and, you know, there must be
a right way. And I used to have this, that lens I used to have when I was a new
practitioner was, yes, I'm practicing, but, and being aware, but I'm doing it
wrong. No matter what I did, it was always wrong. You know, so that was, that was the
way the color, the water was being colored. There can be a version. Like, you
know, there can be selectivity. Like, where is the good things? Where, how do I
avoid problems? You know, and kind of like, there can be confusion. There can be
hesitation. There can be resistance. There could be over eagerness. There could be
delight at being aware. There can be all kinds of things that come along with it.
So the question, how are you being aware? What is awareness like? What is it like
to be aware right now? Can we start revealing this extra stuff that comes
along with being aware? And a useful reference point for this exercise is
that maybe awareness is like clear water. When there's nothing coming along with
it, there's a clarity to it, or a simplicity to it, or, you know, and so
anyway, so that, that you might want to try this morning as you do your practice
the way you know how to do it, but then periodically you might ask yourself, what
is it like to be aware? What's it like to be mindful right now and see what gets
revealed? And whatever gets revealed, don't be troubled by it. Don't be bothered.
Don't come to grand conclusions about the nature of the universe, because you
happen to be afraid, or happen to be angry, or happy to be confused. Just don't.
So this is how the universe is right now. There is confusion in the universe. It
just happens to be in this field of awareness, but don't take it too
personally. Just see it as just, oh, this is interesting to see. So I hope you
enjoy it. Thank you.
