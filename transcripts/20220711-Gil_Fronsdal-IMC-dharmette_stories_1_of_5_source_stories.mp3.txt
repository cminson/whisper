The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Welcome to this Monday morning Dharma talk, beginning of the week, and as usual
there'll be a five-part series. And today I'm inspired to have the week be about
story. And to have a five-part talk, using the word story as a kind of a
each letter to stand for some aspect of story. So today it'll be source, source
story. And then trapping stories, stories that trap us, opening stories, the stories
that release us from the trap. And then it's releasing the stories. And then there
is, for why, I'd like to use the word yes. And what that means, we'll have to wait
until Friday to understand the yes in relationship to this theme of stories.
And the Buddhism, this Insight Vipassana tradition, historically has put a lot of
emphasis on the fourth theme of the week. Releasing stories, letting go of stories,
learning how not to live in stories as we meditate, not to live in the storytelling
mind, discursive mind that's talking to itself and thinking, and learning to
release. And that's certainly a very important part of this path of mindfulness
practice and something that we learn. But sometimes it gets overdone in such a
way that we overlook really understanding deeply the nature of how
stories work in our lives and their centrality and their importance. That not
a few people have pointed out that stories are really crucial to human
society and human beings. It's how we understand ourselves, how we form
identities. The stories we tell our children are not just stories, they're
often passing values and understanding of self and understanding of the
cultural self, how we fit into society and how we are. And the stories are what
conveys all kinds of cultural values and identities of how we fit into this world.
And religions have been pointed out that as much as we might focus on
religions as being a set of doctrines, that for most people what is most
animating and engaging with people around religion is a stories of a
religion that somehow we identify with the stories. There's a narrative there
in which maybe people feel they can participate in or they enter into or
inspires them for how they live their lives. Because life is a narrative.
Life in a sense could be something we explain through a story of what
happened. If a friend asks you, how did it go today, then you tell them the story
of parts of the day and they have a better sense of how you are perhaps.
It's much clearer. So stories are quite important and some of the
stories that we carry inside of ourselves that influence us are somewhat
subconscious. We don't always know, think of it in terms of a story. And so I call
this a source story. And maybe it's a bit dramatic to use this as an example,
but it speaks I think to how central stories can be or events, narratives
that really shape a person is that for many years I've been going to San
Quentin State Prison and haven't done it now in the last few years because of
the pandemic. But I'll visit a particular program, a year-long kind of
mindfulness-based program, anti-violence program that helping certain
prisoners deal with their violent past, deal with their own past and their
difficulties and really confront themselves in a very deep way. And the
group of prisoners about 30 who do the program every year really become each
other's challengers and each other's best friends, supporting each other to
really take a deep look at their lives, at the origins, the source of the
violent life that they lived. And most of the men in the group of 30 have killed
someone, so it's pretty bad what they've done. But what's remarkable is to be
there and discover that each of them had a source story, an original event that
happened that became the primary pain that they carried with them that became
was the pain from which they acted violently in the world. Unresolved,
festering pain from some event in their life. A story often having to do with a
parent, often having for these men having to do with a father who was violent
at home, who was violent to them, violent to their mother, or a father who was
killed. And then just, you know, the trauma that a young child that they went
through, it was so difficult. No one then supported them, no one helped them. They
were left with their pain and started acting out. And to get away from the
pain, to somehow try to feel better in this very dysfunctional way. And without
these prisoners taking a deep look at the source story, the source event, and
really coming to terms with it, the transformation out of their violent life
can't really happen. And it's remarkable to go there and watch, to see them
grapple and struggle with this and come out to the other end. And some of these
men that I've met, you know, they become deeply transformed and changed. It's
inspiring to see. So each of us probably have some source story, maybe a
series of stories that have created an attitude, an orientation, a belief about
this world that we live in. And those stories, it's kind of a story that
led, that conditioned us and we carry that with us. So the source story is
something like, when we see the world and go outside, we might see
everyone is dangerous. There's danger everywhere. And no matter who we meet, the
first instinct is to be afraid of them, to be mistrustful of them. Certainly it's
wise to have some mistrust of some people and be afraid of some people. But
to have that as the policy, the de facto orientation, probably was something
that happened in our youth, that some event that conditioned us, that led us
to believe that something maybe dangerous happened to us. Other people
might have a story of hope that they've somehow taken in, a story that's been
told over and over again. And they have an idea that there's a hope of getting
somewhere, of attaining something. Sometimes the hope is unrealistic, the
hope of becoming rich, the hope of becoming famous, the hope of becoming a
movie star. So what's the story we've been told? So what's the source
story of your life? What kind of orientation story, attitude, policy do
you carry with you about other people, about yourself? Are those stories
happy stories? Are they debilitating stories? People who investigate the
narratives that people live their lives by sometimes have divided narratives
into three types. The narrative that there's some kind of normal life to come
back to that's been disrupted. And the story is how do we get back to what we
had? The other story is that the world is dangerous and chaotic and it's not
going to get any better. And it's just going to get worse. And so we have to do
the best we can to protect ourselves and to keep the world at bay or keep
others at bay. And that's all about our own protection. A third story is that of
the quest that, yes, the world is maybe dangerous, it's chaotic, things change all
the time, and there's no normal to go back to. But there is a possibility of
engaging in a journey to freedom, to peace, to transformation, to wisdom, to
make the best out of the situation and be personally transformed to become a
better person. That's independent of the situation that we're in. And so the
quest is the one that I think is most empowering and the most realistic. The
idea of returning to some pristine state is never going to happen when life is
always changing. The idea that it's all going to downhill from here, that it's a
world is chaotic in a terrible place, we just have to do our best to protect
ourselves or be afraid or be angry or that everything is also not necessary.
So it's very debilitating. The idea that I'm chaotic, that I'm a mess, that I'm
somehow incapable or a terrible person, that's a story that has no hope and no
possibility in it. And then there's the quest, and that we don't get bogged
down by the stories, but there's a story beyond stories, a story out of the
debilitating stories. It's a story to discover how to be free. So the source
story, these brief words that I've said today, I don't know if they speak
well enough for your particular situation, but you might spend some time
thinking about what is the source story, what's the stories, what
events, narratives, situations in your life, either a particular one or some
kind of pervasive, kind of ongoing way of how you were raised, something. What
kind of world view does that have provided you? What kind of philosophy, what
kind of story about what this life is about have you learned? And is there
something that is deeper than maybe you're fully conscious of? And it might
not be a big story, it might just be an attitude or a belief, an approach to how
we are emotionally as we go through the world. But to see the source, source
story, and maybe there's a source story that that is the the origin for so much
of how you live your life, understand yourself, who you are. And so story. I'm
doing this theme partly, I think, inspired by a continuation over the last
little while talking about emotions and anger and grief. And it's maybe a
continuation of this emotion theme because the chronic emotions of our
life most likely are connected to some story. What is that story? And how do you
tell that story? And is it the right story? Does a story change over time? What's
the source story for the story you tell of your life? So thank you. And tomorrow
we'll do trapping stories, how some stories trap us in their in their grip
in their in their web. So thank you.
