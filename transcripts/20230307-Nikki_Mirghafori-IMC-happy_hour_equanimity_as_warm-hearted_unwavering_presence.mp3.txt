 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. Great. Awesome. So hello, hello and welcome everyone to Happy Hour. Lovely to be with you, to hear you, to see you, saying hello. It's very sweet. I always have a mixed feeling about the hellos not getting recorded on the audio drama recording because they're so warm, they're so sweet. They're just set the stage and yet we go into the meditation. So whoever is listening to the guided meditation now, please know that there are lots of warm hellos from different places in the world and receive that as a part of being part of this community, part of this community that comes together and practices together and supports each other with their presence and goodwill. So with that, let's start meditating together. And the theme I will share with you through the guidance little by little, slowly, slowly. So let's learn to let's arrive, arrive in this body in this moment. With an exhale letting go. Let's try three deep diaphragmatic breaths together. We'll breathe in into the lower belly, hold for a few seconds and let go with the sound to really arrive. Let's start. Breathing in, hold. And without. Feeling the spaciousness. Next breath, breathe in. Hold. And let go with a sigh. Feeling your body. One more. All thing. You can do more if you want in your own time, really settle, or you can turn to the natural breath, which is what we use as our anchor, the natural breath, however it is short, long, deep, shallow. Whatever it is, we don't change it. We receive it as the anchor, calming, soothing, settling. Relaxing and receiving, relaxing and receiving. Breathe, the sensations of the breath. Just this breath, in breath, out breath. I invite you to explore something. If you like, you can imagine yourself maybe being on top of a hill, sitting on top of a mountain. Beautiful scenery. And all the preoccupations, thoughts, plans, memories, this, that, they're all down below or far away. They're receded into the background. Here you are. Ah, the sense of perspective, ease, peace, taking refuge. To calm, center yourself so that you can engage with more wisdom instead of being contracted and entangled. The air is fine. Maybe there's some birds that's pleasant to have this moment of refuge. In breath, out breath. I think the body relax, especially the forehead, your jaw, neck and shoulder. Your abdomen. Your whole body, let it offer its weight to the earth. Restaging each breath with patience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And continuing with this theme of sitting on a mountain, a mountain top, having a sense of perspective wherever you are. Having a sense of perspective could also be a beach, wherever you like to imagine you have a sense of perspective. Space all around. Space all around. You can see the horizon far away. Ah, not crowded by demands, by thoughts, memories, this, that, entanglements, but space. There's so much space. The valley below, you're on a mountain, the village sleeps peacefully. The village has a lot of ongoing hustle, hustle and bustle. You have time. You've taken refuge. You're building moments of refuge, intending to support yourself with confidence. You're building moments of refuge, intending to support yourself with calm, stability, spaciousness, equanimity. Thank you. Equanimity, equipoise, and evenness of heart. It's not cool, not aloof, but present, fully present without toppling over into or away from. There is a power of strength and equanimity, amazing stability, warm hearted stability. For the period of this practice, let us work with intention, the power of intention. To feel it into your, feel the power of intention in your sit bones, your lower belly, intending towards spaciousness, equanimity with each breath. Your deepest wisdom. You know what equanimity is, what it feels like. your heart knows, your body knows. And if in this moment it's not as accessible as usual, conjure up your inner, your inner Buddha, your inner, equanimous, wise being, your inner Buddha nature. Let it show you the way. Relax, rest, open your heart. Let yourself be surprised. All spacious with each breath. So much space around you. Strength of stability within you. Warm hearted presence. Warm hearted unmoving. Non-reactive. Not afraid. Let the equanimity breathe, breathe in and breathe out with every breath. Let the equanimity breathe, breathe in and breathe out with every breath. Let the equanimity breathe, breathe in and breathe out with every breath. Let the equanimity breathe, breathe in and breathe out with every breath. And teach you with each breath. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Let the body be soft, relaxed, receptive to each breath. Fully present. Warm-hearted, spacious, unwavering. Let us imagine what you have but what we need to do to match it to live with that with having space away with a sense of perspective, the mountaintop. We can relate more wisely, more compassionately with the comings and goings of our lives. The entanglements, the demands, expectations, the full catastrophe with an open heart, open arms. Such an amazing life full of 10,000 joys, 10,000 sorrows, as is everyone else's arising, passing. So many gifts and blessings and challenges to stretches. Having perspective with equanimity doesn't mean we push them away. It means we're more prepared to be with them, with all of it. Whenever you feel already imagining yourself walking down the hill, back into the village, but with a new perspective, with warm heartedness, with appreciation, not entangled, engaged, but not entangled with space in your heart and your mind. If you need to stay more on top of the mountain, with the breath, that's okay too. See what your heart needs. If it helps to bring an equanimity phrase, may I accept their rising and passing, the comings and goings, the kindness and wisdom. May I engage with all comings and goings, the kindness and the wisdom of your heart. May I engage with all comings and goings, the kindness and the wisdom of your heart. May I engage with all comings and goings, the kindness and the wisdom of your heart. May I engage with all comings and goings, the kindness and the wisdom of your heart. May I engage with all comings and goings, the kindness and the wisdom of your heart. May I engage with all comings and goings, the kindness and the wisdom of your heart. May I engage with all comings and goings, the wisdom of your heart. May I engage with all comings and goings, the kindness and the wisdom of your heart.

May I engage with all comings and goings, the wisdom of your heart. May I engage with all comings and goings, the wisdom of your heart. May I engage with all comings and goings, the wisdom of your heart. May I engage with all comings and goings, the west coast coast coast coast coast coast the east coastuttia you you Yeah, I know may I appreciate that Call is my true nature It's calm and spacious in here You It's caring Me I know that it's always available You And it can be access to it can be cultivated with each breath like this one You As we turn to bring this practice to a close Appreciating accepting acknowledging My own practice the goodness of my own practice whatever is showed up or did not show up No attachment to results no expectation I've planted seeds I've planted wholesome seeds Yes, yeah Celebrate the goodness Celebrate the cultivation and trust it And offering this goodness this co-created goodness In this time for the benefit of all beings sharing it with all beings may my life may my practice Be of benefit to all beings in ways I cannot imagine It all beings everywhere Be well it all beings be free including this being who is myself It's for your practice everyone So we practiced we explored equanimity practice of In poly equanimity, which is the fourth brahma vihara the fourth heavily abode First being metta loving kindness second one being karuna compassion third one Mudita vicarious joy joy for joy of others and the fourth one is equanimity It's related to all of the other brahma viharas it it supports them. It's the basis of them. It's the the foundation and The invitation tonight was to relate to it from this this image of sitting on the mountain There is space all around so so there is a sense of perspective so that we can then be with what is in our life With a sense of spaciousness with calm with with care Equanimity is is kind is it has warm heartedness in it. It has care this caring presence Without entanglement it doesn't fall into and it doesn't push things away like oh, I don't want to deal with this It's present. It's just present in the middle of everything So we played around with that image a bit to get a little bit of presence we have a little bit of space and then walking down back to the village and and Be in our lives and but relate from that space So so I'd like to invite us now to transition into the sense of equanimity holding the sense of presence the sense of stable presence for ourselves and in relationship to others because it is a skill to of course, it's it's a cultivation to feel it for our In in our own heart in our own bodies And then the rubber meets the road when we start to interact with others Of course our families and colleagues and friends. It's a higher bar, but you get the chance to explore Now in small groups for those who are on zoom To explore in small groups to show up with the sense of equanimity to interact with other human beings which are stand-ins for for all of humanity which are stand-ins and and the Question that the the inquiry for us to explore together is is in our bodies, so Is the physical explosion? So when you have a sense of equanimity, how does it feel in your body? How does your body feel? And we'll we'll go around each person will say one one nugget Then the next person the next person will come back to you and it'll be a spiral It comes to you and you can also say I don't know Um, I don't quite know right now. I'm still exploring it. That's perfectly fine You can say pass in that way and then later say oh actually maybe I feel a sense of uprightness Or maybe I feel like my arms are wide open Want to embrace the whole world with a sense of equanimity and my hands aren't a fist anymore Anyway, they're there. You know, my fingers are open or whatever Whatever physicality you associate with equanimity. I think this can be such a powerful exploration um and inspiring to to yourself and and to each other supporting each other in this very interesting exploration So i'm going to create the zoom the breakout rooms There'll be roughly of size three and I invite you to be kind to yourself kind to each other of course And not asking questions not directing It's just offering what what you have and if somebody says something and it's you're confused It doesn't matter. Don't don't explore don't interrogate. Just let each person have their own experience Um in this way being supportive. Okay All right, the rooms are created Yes, oops All the numbers keep changing. Here we go. Okay, the rooms are created Uh, let's go alphabetical order just for the fun of it first name. Okay Take care. Be kind and the rooms are open now Okay, welcome back everyone um so We have a few minutes for reflections comments questions discoveries aha moments confusions How was how is it either the meditation or the um? uh Exploration of the physicality of equanimity what it feels like what did you discover? And especially if you haven't spoken recently with happy hour, we'd love to hear from you Um, if you have spoken pull back if you haven't pulled forward for the benefit of yourself and others Or any aha moments questions Now please now from japan Uh, i'd love to share something that fred inspired which um, which is an idea from a permaculture uh Thought leader called masanobu fukouka And he believes that the act of farming Um is not to produce vegetables or or to grow anything. It's really about the cultivation of human beings so This idea of approaching any practice with without the end in mind, but rather uh falling in love with the practice Beautiful beautiful, that's lovely. Thanks so much for sharing that No varying that into the big circle beautiful. Love it. Yes falling in love with the practice. Exactly Yeah any practice Hmm agriculture horticulture meditation practice beautiful growing food nancy, please Thank you nikki, um i'm just off retreat so i'm um, very tender hearted and um This was such a perfect evening for me for beginning of the evening and um So it was a perfect subject and a perfect sit and a perfect little group to be in So just bows to everybody Ah, thank you nancy. Thank you for bringing this this beautiful calm and sense of appreciation Fresh from sitting in retreat So lovely to be sharing that Uh to be bringing that to happy hour and sharing that both in your small group and big group. It's just yeah. Yay Feeling recall and and and appreciating it. Thanks nancy. Um um Claire I see your hand. I I also see a question from Gitta. Let me get to this one first. Um, Nikki we shared about consolidating equanimity with feeling safe. Do you have thoughts on this? Yes, I have thoughts on everything um um No um Let's see so I would not consolidate um equanimity with feeling safe. They're they're uniquely different they're related Like a Venn diagram. There is a relationship, but I would definitely not consolidate them together. So So here's how and it's an important distinction. So I do want to take time to to tease this apart. Um, so equanimity and the practice of equanimity um Has an uprightness has a strength to it and has a sense of equipoise basically the the classical definition of equanimity is is um Is equipoise with everything that arises and passes away? Okay So it's this feeling I mean it has to do with the vedana the feeling tone actually with with that Teaching of pleasant unpleasant and neutral. So the idea is that the mind and heart is so still so calm That it doesn't fall into What's pleasant? It doesn't want more of it. It doesn't fall into greed. I want it. I wanted more of oh I want more more more more and it doesn't push away. What's unpleasant. Oh make that go away I don't want it like ah, so it's not aversive and it's not graspy. That is Is an important element of equanimity? Okay And safety doesn't quite approach that safety has different qualities to it Which are beautiful and important for us to give it to ourselves and give it to others But it's not equanimity. So I would not consolidate them So I can say more but maybe i'll just leave it at that. Hopefully that's clear enough Claire your hand I don't know if this will be helpful to anybody but I mentioned in my group that within the last 10 years or so and of course in my spiritual actually longer spiritual journey I've adopted two practices that I didn't do as a young person that have led me to real True state I believe true states of equanimity one is cycling on a bike Because all you think about is the relationship of your body to The motion that's all you have no other there's nothing going on in your head at all And the other is dancing tango And again, it's all about being with your body Beautiful. So I I'm loving this Claire both of these practices that you talked about I love the practices you mentioned and And I would I would add some nuance to what you said because they're beautiful embodiment practices They're beautiful embodiment practices for the mind to be really present Right here not to think not to be entangled and that calm that sense of presence can be a a Ground for a kinema need to grow in but I wouldn't say that these are a kinema practices So it's very important to make a distinction Okay I was trying to figure out Yeah, these are great embodiment practices, but not a kinema practices be but they create the ground for equanimity But they're not a kinema practices, right? Thanks, Claire. The other thing I just wanted to add for Our benefit or our friend from japan whose name I didn't hear. Uh is there's a wonderful book called chop wood carry water Uh, I don't know if you've ever read it That's related to this Yeah chop wood carry water. Yeah. Yeah, I love that saying it's the zen saying what do you do before enlightenment chop wood carry water? What do you do after enlightenment? Chop wood carry water. So I love that. Thanks, Claire. Thanks for bringing that in and christine you get the last word Great thank you nikki. This is I got a lot out of the practice I uh, just first of all I want to say thank you This has been in my groups. It was uh a lot about equanimity and Just right now. It's like this for me, you know, and we're going through the last six weeks i've had to wear a um A brace on my leg.
