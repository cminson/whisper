 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So a few words about the practice. I've been considering lately the ancient Buddhist word that we translate often to English as breathing. And it seems like it might not exactly correspond to what we in the modern world think about, the physiological process of bringing in air and exhaling air. There's some idea that exists that in ancient India, the experience of breathing was much more holistic, as if the movement of the inner winds, they had this idea of winds, the inner winds, that was much broader in the body than just the air going in and out. And so that experience of breathing was to experience this wider flow, wider realm of sensations that come into play as the lungs expand and contract, as the diaphragm pushes down and lifts, as the belly goes in and out, and all these things that go on. So it's something much more holistic that includes much more of who we are. Some people in the West call this full body breathing, just kind of feeling the wider realm of what's going on. And this ties to, connects to, I think, to this ancient custom, to also use the same word, breathing, to also refer to, to have confidence, to have comfort or assurance, and to have courage. And so to have comfort, you know, to breathe easily, people might say, oh, that could breathe easily finally. And they might mean that physically, that they could breathe more easily, but to kind of refer to how now the whole situation changed, and they have a breath of fresh air, or they feel kind of something relaxed and opened. And so then same with the ancient texts, when it also can mean confidence and courage and comfort, it also points to something that's broader than just the experience of air going in and out. So broader kind of, I don't know how you feel those things, but I think of them as something that we've kind of more broadly, kind of maybe not so specifically, can feel in our body. And so to open to the experience of breathing in and out, it's possible to do that in a way that we're opening up to a broader field of sensations of bodily experiences that change in a rhythmic way as we breathe in and breathe out. And this also can be applied to walking meditation, that it's not just the physical movements and sensations of the feet and touching the ground, but maybe there are also, there's a way of walking that has a sense of ease in it, and there's an assurance in it, a sense of kind of more of a, kind of a little bit more of the global experience of walking, rather than only kind of focusing immediately down to the specifics of, you know, particular sensations. In such a way that you get pulled into the world, you get kind of centered or into the world of the experience of walking as if there's a broader field that we are entering into of the body that has room for these wonderful emotions of comfort, assurance, courage, confidence, maybe contentment, different things that maybe we can connect to if we kind of open the field a little bit more than just the physical experiences of breathing or the physical experiences of walking. So maybe that makes, it's a little bit enough sense you can experiment with that, and if it doesn't make sense, you can be more than welcome to empty your mind of what I said. Thank you.
