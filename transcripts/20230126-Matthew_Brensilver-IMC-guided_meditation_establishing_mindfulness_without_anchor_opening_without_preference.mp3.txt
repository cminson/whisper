 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay. Welcome, folks. Yeah, good to see names streaming over there. Okay. So we'll do what we do. So please settle into a posture that balances relaxation, alertness. Okay. Sometimes we try to establish mindfulness through attention to an object, a breath or sound or something. Sometimes it can be useful even before identifying an object to establish mindfulness first. What does that mean for you? What needs to unwind in you to establish mindfulness? What do you need to make peace with to establish mindfulness? What images or words inspire your heart, support the establishment of mindfulness? What ruminations do you have to have one more time before you sense their dead-end nature? What inspires your impulse to know, to understand, to be awake? What do you need to know to be awake? What do you need to know to be awake? What do you need to know to be awake? And then as we establish some sense of presence, maybe the attention naturally can embrace the object. It doesn't feel like squeezing the mind into some narrow slot. It doesn't feel like putting toothpaste back in the tube, just natural perhaps to sense the sensations of your breathing. It's natural to notice the beginning ending of the inhale, the beginning ending of the exhale. And the release at the bottom of the exhale. Kind of suspension in time. Open, receptive. Open, receptive. Open, receptive. Open, receptive. Open, receptive. Open, receptive. Open, receptive. Open, receptive. There's the way we direct our attention, but then there's so much happening in the meditating mind. Ideas and frameworks in the background. Sometimes we need gentleness, gentle. The, in this forgiveness that is mindfulness. Forgiving some sorrow, forgiving ourselves. And sometimes we need firmness. A reminder, this thing I keep trying to do that I've tried to do forever doesn't work. So we surrender into the breath. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe it feels natural to stay with the breathing or with some very defined object of attention. Maybe it feels skillful to open up to the entirety of the field of your experience. Everything belonging, but nothing ownable. Maybe we... I'll hallucinate the sense of the self in order to govern a Nietzsche uncertainty. But it feels so good to let go. It feels so good to stop trying to make what is uncertain, certain, and ungovernable in my control. To appreciate the centerlessness of all phenomena, including what gets called me, my life. My. My. My. My. My. My. My. My. My. My. My. you you you you you you you you
