 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Welcome, and a warm welcome to all of you and to being here together for our meditation. The general idea of mindfulness meditation is the underlying kind of practice or direction or attitude is that of being simple. Being simple with the instructions, being simple with the practice moment by moment. And the simplest way of describing that is just to know what's happening as it's happening. But the Buddhist path has two primary components of using our mental attention, our minds, and practice. One is to relax or as it gets more deeper in practice to let go, to let go and then to know. But because it's difficult to just sit down and let go, the first is to be here. Be here, really be here in the simplicity of this moment. Relax, let go, and know. So, and then you do it again. Here, relax, and know, know what's happening very simply. Know it without any reactivity, without any interpretations, without any story. Just know the simplicity of this moment. To relax is to relax in the simplest way that's available. To not have ambitions, not strain to relax. To relax what we can. To let go, to let go of what's appropriate. The meaning of letting go in the teachings of the Buddha is, the primary orientation around it, is to not let go of things, but to let go of our clinging to things, our grasping to things, ideas, identities, desires. And here, just here, nowhere else. So maybe that can be the rhythm or the practice, if you'd like, for this meditation. And you can say to yourself this sequence, here, here to what's this here, what's here for you. In the simplest possible way of recognizing that. Just here. Letting go, relaxing, maybe relaxing first, later letting go. Maybe letting go first, then relaxing. And then recognizing what's here. Recognizing that we're in our bodies. Here in our bodies, recognizing the breathing in the body. Here with the breathing, relaxing with the breathing, recognizing there's inhales and exhales. Here with the inhales and exhales, recognizing some of the sensations that come in with the inhales, some of the sensations that come with the exhale. Letting go of stories around breathing, what's supposed to happen around breathing. And then recognize, just recognize what's here. Maybe recognizing the breathing more fully or recognizing the pleasure of having let go of stories and expectations, agendas. And then here. And whatever's here, it's easy and obvious that's here and now in the simplicity of this moment. And as we go through these cycles of here, relax, know, perhaps it's a movement of becoming simpler and simpler with what's here. Less story, less future, less past, less interpretations, less reactivity. A contentment to just be here with this experience. So taking a posture that you think is suitable for you to be both alert and maintaining some physical presence, alertness, stability. To let go deeply while the body is aligned, if you're sitting upright, aligned in an upright posture, it doesn't collapse. And then to let your gaze be relaxed, maybe gazing down at about 45 degrees, relaxing around the eyes, not looking at anything in particular. Soft gaze. And then gently closing your eyes. Taking a few long, slow, deep breaths to become established here, just here. And then to let your breathing return to normal. And I'll go through this three-part sequence for a little bit and you can follow along. So very simply, recognize what's here, experientially in the present moment for you. It's more like just be here with it. Here you are. And then as you exhale, perhaps you can relax. Let go. And then know what's here. Very simple. Maybe one word recognition. And then again, here, maybe given what you have known, be here with this. Be here with your experience. As you exhale, relax, let go. And then know, recognize what is here. Recognize what is obvious. It's simple and obvious to know. Here in your experience. Not elsewhere. Not other places and times. Not about anything different than what's experienced here. And then here, be here with whatever's close in. Whatever the experience is that's centered here. Relax. Let go of any holding, tightening. And having let go and relaxed, know something about this present experience that stands out. No need to search. Just what comes. And then here. Relax. And know. And as you do this relaxing and knowing, perhaps you're settling in more and more into your experience here in your body. You're breathing. Here. Relax. And know. Whatever rhythm you want. Whatever pace. And as you get settled, if you want to drop one of the three and then two of the three, then all three, drop them in order. Drop here. Drop relaxing. And only if you're very, very still, relax knowing. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Remembering to be here in your experience. Remembering to let go or relax, even if it's micro-relaxations. And to know, to recognize what is obvious in this immediacy of direct experience. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. And as we come to the end of this sitting, perhaps to consider that doing this practice of here, relax, recognize how that benefits the people we interact with through the day. How is it to be really here with someone? How is it to be at ease while we're with them? And what is it to really know what's happening with the person, with yourself, between the two of you? What benefits comes? How are these relationships enhanced and developed this way? The practice we do on the cushion can serve us so well in our world, in our being with others and relating to others. And to offer the benefits of this practice to be shared with others. And to feel how the practice benefits us in social situations can deepen how we practice when we're sitting alone. May we share this practice with the world in how we are present, how we are at ease, and how we see clearly. May we bring the benefits of this practice into the world to contribute to the welfare and happiness of all beings. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. Thank you.
