Path

One of the useful states of mind is a mind that is 
concentrated, composed, settle d. A fair amount of 
meditation, in some way or other, involves concentrating 
your mind. “Concentrating  the mind ” means, first and 
foremost, not letting the monkey -mind  have the upper -
hand  – not having the mind wander everywhere 
possible , except here and now, c aught up in its 
thoughts . For many people, t he practice of 
concentration is often a big challenge. Some people 
have a hard time doing it because the mind is so 
strong ly interested in other things. And some people  get 
tight because of the way they concentra te. They get 
stressed.  
 
So it’s useful to consider that concentration goes 
together with other factors . One of the primary 
supporting factors is that  concentration goes hand -in-
hand with being relaxed . I like to think of it as a soft 
mind . The art here is to also maintain a mind that is  
diligen t enough to  stay present – to stay interested in 
the breathing , or in the lovingkindness meditation , or in walking when  you walk , or in whatever the focus is of 
the moment . The art is to be  diligent , vigilant , 
committed , or devoted to staying present just for that, 
but doing so with a mind that’s soft and  relaxed.  
 
A soft, relaxed mind by itself might lead you to drift off in 
thought. A concentrated mind, by itse lf, the way many 
people do it, can often help make the mind tense. So 
the idea is to do both at the same time . For people who 
are used to getting concentrated, keeping the mind soft 
may seem harder  than just  to practice concentration . 
For people who love a soft mind, it feels like work to be 
concentrated, and people don’t want to work. But to 
hold the two together takes a certain kind of alert 
attentio n. If you have enough attention to watch 
yourself , then the concentration can stay soft  – soft in 
the mind, in the body, and in the heart . And  so you 
aren’t tensing up around the eyes, or the mouth, or the 
hands. The whole body can stay soft. And more 
importantly, the mind stays soft.  
 
It takes a while to get the hang of how to stay present . 
But the very practice of trying to do this, discovering 
how to do it, keeps you in the present moment . And it’s 
worthwhile in its own right. But don’t be so concerned 
about doing it successfully . For any meditation practice, 
focusing on doing it successfully limits how much you 
benefit from the practice. So you don’t want to be too 
successful, because mindfulness meditation is one of those very unusual tasks where you want to do the best 
you can , but yo u don’t want to be too successful too 
quickly , because a lot of learning is happen ing.  
 
In meditation, o ne of the things to learn is to how to stay 
present  – to not drift off or be lackadaisical  or 
complacent  – and also  to keep a soft, relaxed mind, 
together with the  diligence to stay there . Just stay with 
that, so there’s some clarity that can develop with 
what’s happening.  
 
This morning, you might try to see what it’s like for you, 
to bring these two together, and how they work 
together . When you’re with your breathing,  or with your 
walking, try to stay present  and concentrated with 
what’s happening, and also try to stay soft . And see it’s 
like to b ring those two together .
