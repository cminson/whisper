 Yeah, here at Santa Cruz, Kim's calling of a Dharma ring. It's a following on us. And those who are online, over Zoom, where you are, even if you're not getting the real ring, the Dharma rings on you anyways. And so today, I'll offer some reflections around mindfulness of thinking, building up what we've been offering in terms of a practice, the breath, body, yesterday, mindfulness of emotions. And today, I'll say a few words about mindfulness of thinking. I think all of us at this point probably will know, boy, this is a huge world. How can we sit and don't realize how much we think? And so this is a big part of being human. And thinking is a very potent process within us. And yet we can work with it through becoming aware of our thinking world. And often, when we speak about thinking, we would immediately associate with thoughts and the content of our thinking process. But the thinking is a much broader, multidimensional process that happens within us. And the content of our thinking is one aspect of it. But there are other aspects related to the thinking process. And you may already notice that thinking is, our thoughts are very related to our emotional world. And maybe our emotions can lead to thinking, or thinking can lead to certain kind of emotions arising. And thinking may also be related to our embodied experience. Maybe we have a pain, and then we have thoughts evoked from the pain in the body or discomfort in the body. And so there is a multidimensional aspect of the thinking process. When we speak about mindfulness of thinking, we are noticing the broader spectrum of this process, and not just the content of the thoughts themselves. And so it's helpful when we notice that the thinking is happening. We can begin to open to its relationship with our other dimensions of our being. And so differentiating the content versus the process, or kind of the containers that holds the thoughts, is a skillful way to begin to bring ourselves back into the present moment. And noticing the texture, the tone of our thoughts, which is a skillful practice, it brings us to the present moment. And noticing the relationship of the thinking with our somatic experience, our embodied experience, again, began to bring us from the tendency of getting caught up in our thoughts and back into the present experience that's embodied. Sometimes it's also helpful, instead of getting really excited about the thoughts themselves, we can use a form of a labeling to just more gently, in the elemental level, label what is happening in the content. Maybe they can be categorical, like planning, if you're thinking tomorrow, next week, planning, planning, or thinking about the past, maybe just the categorical label of memory, memory, or fantasy, or sometimes you may not even come up with an immediate word for it. And that's okay. It's valid. So some of this is a training for ourselves to begin to have vocabulary to describe what's happening. But it's not always needed. And then trusting the felt sense that is happening here and now. And some people may think in words, some people may think with images. And so there are thoughts that look like images. I certainly have that tendency of thinking through images. And whatever it may be, allow yourself to open to the different aspects of this thinking process. The images, for me, often evoke a sense of somatic sensations in the body. And you can allow that to bring you to the felt sense in the body, and rather than lingering in the images themselves. And so with that, we'll begin a guided meditation. And today, I'll use an image and maybe a kind of thinking to lead us into this meditation. And so if you need to adjust your posture in any way, feel free to do so. And then once you settle in into your space, you can gently close your eyes or cast your eyelids down softly. We're entering this meditation as if we're entering into an ancient temple, quiet ancient temple, maybe with a sense of irreverence, curiosity, entering into the temple of this body, arriving at the gate of the temple. Maybe take a few moments to check in.
