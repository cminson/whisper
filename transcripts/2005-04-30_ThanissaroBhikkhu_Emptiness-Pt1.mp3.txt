My teacher always said not to talk to anyone who hasn't meditated.
So shall we start with some meditation?
Close your eyes, place your hands on your lap,
and think thoughts of good will.
Good will is a wish for happiness.
And you start with good will for yourself.
Tell yourself, may I find true happiness.
And remind yourself that that's not a selfish thought,
because true happiness is something that comes from within,
comes from developing your own inner resources.
So it doesn't take anything away from anyone else.
In fact, the more you develop your inner resources,
the more you have no knowing for yourself, but also to share with others.
So the next step is to spread thoughts of good will to other people.
Start first with people who are close to your heart,
your family, your very close friends.
May they find true happiness too.
And then spread those thoughts out in ever-widening circles.
People you know and like.
People you don't know so well.
People you're more neutral about.
And people you don't like.
People will be a much better place if everyone could find true happiness within.
Spread thoughts of good will to people you don't even know.
And not just people, living beings of all kinds.
East, West, North, South, above and below.
Out to infinity.
All beings find true happiness.
Now bring your attention back to the present.
These inner resources you have to develop.
What have you got right here right now?
You've got the body sitting here breathing,
and you've got the mind thinking and aware.
So bring all these things together.
Think about the breath.
And then be alert to the breath as it comes in, as it goes out.
Notice when it's coming in.
Be aware of what's coming out.
Notice when it's comfortable or not.
If it's not comfortable, you can change.
You can make it longer or shorter, deeper or more shallow,
heavier or lighter, faster or slower.
There are lots of different ways that you can vary the rhythm
and the texture of the breath.
So experiment for a while to see what feels right for the body right now.
If you're feeling tired, you may want to breathe in a way
that gives you more energy.
Long in, short out.
If you're feeling tense, you may want to breathe in a way
that's more relaxing, that would be short in and long out.
Just get in touch with what kind of breath energy
the body seems to need right now and provide it.
Just get in touch with what kind of breath energy
the body needs right now.
When the breath starts feeling comfortable,
the next step is to be aware of the breath.
Be aware of the whole body as you breathe in and as you breathe out.
A good way to work up to that is to take the body section by section.
And a good place to start is down around the navel, the lower abdomen.
Locate that part of the body in your awareness.
Where is it right now?
And watch it for a while as you breathe in and as you breathe out.
And try to view the sensations you have in that part of the body
as aspects of breath energy.
In other words, you don't have to think of them as solid.
You don't have to think of them as muscles or bone or whatever down there.
Just a type of breath energy.
And if you sense any tension or tightness or blockage in that energy,
allow it to dissolve away.
Breathe in without tension building up and you breathe out, not holding onto any tension.
Breathe in without tension building up and you breathe out.
And move your attention up to the solar plexus and follow the same three steps there.
In other words, one, locate that part of the body in your awareness.
Two, watch it for a while as you breathe in and breathe out.
Viewing it simply as a type of breath energy.
Dropping all thoughts of whether there's a solid stomach there or not.
Or liquid or whatever.
It's just breath.
Because that is your primary sensation, the body is breath.
And then three, if there's any sense of tension or tightness in that breath energy,
it's just breath.
And then three, watch it for a while as you breathe out.
Then move your tension up to the middle of the chest and follow the same three steps there.
And then three, watch it for a while as you breathe out.
And then three, watch it for a while as you breathe out.
And bring your attention up to the base of the throat.
And then three, watch it for a while as you breathe out.
And then up to the middle of the head.
Think of the breath energy not only coming in and out the nose, but also in and out the eyes, the ears, in from the back of the neck, down from the top of the head.
Very gently working any bands or patterns of tension in the face, the neck, the jaws.
And bring your attention and dissolving it away.
And then three, watch it for a while as you breathe out.
Now if you had more time and were meditating on your own, you could continue the survey down the back.
Out the legs, to the feet, and the toes.
Then starting again at the back of the neck, going down the shoulders, the arms, out to the hands, and the fingers.
But for right now, just take any one of those spots we've just focused on.
The lower abdomen, solar plexus, middle of the chest, base of the throat, middle of the head.
Whichever of those spots you found most congenial, return your attention to that spot.
And then think of your awareness aiding out from that spot to fill the whole body.
You're aware of the whole body all the way as you breathe in and all the way as you breathe out.
Be careful not to let your awareness shrink.
It has a tendency to shrink. It's like a balloon with a little hole in it.
It'll gradually deflate.
So each time you breathe in, think whole body, all the way as you breathe in and as you breathe out.
All body is, all the way out.
There's nowhere else you have to go, nothing else you have to do right now.
Just maintain this whole large but centered awareness.
If the sound is a disturbance, think of it going right through you.
You're like a big window screen. The sound can go through the spaces between the screen but it doesn't have to affect the screen.
You're like a big window screen.
You're like a big window screen.
You're like a big window screen.
You're like a big window screen.
You're like a big window screen.
You're like a big window screen.
You're like a big window screen.
You're like a big window screen.
You're like a big window screen.
You're like a big window screen.
Now before you leave meditation, think thoughts of goodwill once more.
Whatever sense of peace or calm you've felt for the past session.
Think of your goodwill spreading out from that peace.
To share it with other people, either specific people you know are suffering right now.
All living beings.
As the tithes say, all of our companions in birth, aging, illness and death.
We all find peace in our lives.
And before you leave meditation, remind yourself that there's a skill to leaving.
My tithes used to say that when people meditate, they tend to be like a person climbing a ladder.
To the second story of a building, you climb the ladder wrong, by wrong, by wrong, finally get in the window.
But then when it comes time to leave, you don't go down the ladder, you jump out the window.
Then you land splat.
That's not in how to leave meditation.
Remind yourself, even when you open your eyes, the breath is still there, this inner awareness of the body that we've been working on is still there.
You don't allow it to be pushed out of the way.
You can listen, you can talk, you can move around, but still maintain this inner awareness.
In other words, don't leave the second story of the building. Stay right there.
Look out the windows.
That's how you leave meditation.
Thank you for watching.
