Dharmette : Gladness Born of 
Confidence  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Meg

Last week Gil talked about restraint, and in particular 
the freedom that can be found when we practice 
restraint. He mentioned the precepts. If you’re 
inclined to kill a living being, then you’re better off 
practicing restraint, right? Restraint from takin g what 
isn’t given. Refraining from sexual misconduct. 
Refraining from lying or from harmful or hurtful 
speech. And refraining from intoxicating the mind. 
What he emphasized about restraint was the 
freedom that it gives us – the freedom to be an 
active pla yer in our own destiny, by choosing an 
ethical life of non -harming.  
 
What I’d like to emphasize today is the gladness that 
can be found in refraining  from doing harm. We find 
cobwebs and a spider indoors, and we very carefully 
catch the spider and take he r outside and let her go, 
and there’s naturally a feeling of gladness when we 
do this.  
 This summer we had critters eating our tomatoes in 
the garden, so we got a Have -a-heart trap, and set 
it. I think it was mostly squirrels . We didn’t catch any 
squirrel s, but did catch a rat. There was peanut 
butter and lettuce inside the trap. So the next 
morning we come out, and there was the rat, 
obviously scared to be cooped up, so we put a towel 
over the trap so the darkness would help her relax a 
little bit, and th en we drove far away to some 
uninhabited place, and opened the trap : and the joy 
that I felt when she ran out ! She ran up the road 
trying to get away from us as fast as she could , and 
then she took a sharp left into the vegetation to start 
a new life. I wa s feeling joyful for the whole rest of 
the day, appreciating her freedom.  
 
So, the gladness, the delight in living ethically, in 
avoiding harm. But living ethically also means 
becoming more and more attuned to our tendency to 
be reactive. It’s easy to get  triggered. Triggering 
happens in very gross ways sometimes, but also in 
very subtle ways. The only hope we have of not 
responding with reactivity is to be able to be mindful. 
The more we can cultivate our mindfulness 
throughout the day – not only when we’ re 
meditating, but in as many moments as possible – 
that’s what gives  us the opportunity for when an unskillful mind state arises, to be able to make a 
choice about how we respond to it.  
 
If someone says something hurtful to me, and I’m 
not paying attention, maybe my first response will be 
to feel hurt, or to withdraw or – I probably wouldn’t 
say something nasty back – but to take it on maybe. 
But if I’m mindful when a person says something  
hurtful, then I think, “Ah, this does feel hurtful.” And 
then I think, “That person must have been struggling 
with something to have said something so unkind.” 
And then I have a feeling of compassion for the 
person. And I can also see it through the lens of not -
self. This is what they’re saying, but this is not me; 
this is not mine; this is not myself. I don’t have to 
pick it up. I don’t have to bite the hook.  
 
So every time we’re faced with a trigger from the 
outside, or perhaps from the inside, some kin d of 
unwholesome mind state that arises, there’s a fork in 
the road for us. And if we don’t have mindfulness at 
that moment, chances are we are going to go down 
the road of reactivity and perpetuating the wheel of 
saṃsara and suffering. But if we do have a  moment 
of awareness, then we can decide, “Ok. What’s the 
skillful way to respond to this?” And that’s what puts 
us on the path to freedom. There is a lot of gladness that can be found when we’re on that path to 
freedom.  
 
We had a weird thing happen this w eekend. My 
husband and I were out working in the back yard. 
And normally we don’t lock the front door when 
we’re home. Well,  unbeknownst to us, this young 
drug addict walked into our house . We came in and 
found her wearing my clothes, my jewelry, his pants . 
She even took off the belt that was on his pants, and 
went into his drawer and found another belt that she 
liked better. She had moved things around. I have 
an overnight bag that I use when I come down here 
from Grass Valley, and she had put some fancy 
shoes and a fancy purse into my overnight bag. I 
guess she thought I needed that. It was just really 
bizarre. If I was the kind of person who was likely to 
become afraid, I might have reacted unkindly to her. 
Or if it had been one of my gun -owning neighbors , 
she might have gotten shot. But I was really glad to 
see that my response was one of being more 
concerned with her well -being than worrying about 
the fact that she was playing dress -up with my 
clothes and was about to walk off with them. I was 
glad that the natural response was one of 
compassion, and I didn’t feel defensive. Anyway, the 
story has ended well. She’s now in a mental 
hospital. Apparently she had a drug -induced psychosis and had no idea what she was doing. I 
had a real feeling of gladness abou t what  arose in 
both my husband and myself in response to that 
intrusion.  
 
Gil sometimes tells the story of the prison project in 
San Quentin, and inmates have come here and 
given talks. One of the inmates said that what he 
had learned from this project i s that “Hurt people 
hurt.” And it’s  true that many people who come to 
this practice have experienced a lot of hurt. And this 
practice is a n opportunity to stop propagating that 
hurt. Another inmate from a rival group in the prison 
said, “Yes. And healed pe ople heal.”  
 
It’s really by healing ourselves, by healing our own 
hurt, from all that baggage that we carry with us, that 
opens the door for us to start to be a healing force in 
our families, and in our communities, and in our 
society.  
 
We talked this mor ning about the gladness that’s 
born of confidence , and especially confidence in this 
path of practice. We know that it’s helping us to let 
go of greed, hate, and delusion. We know that it’s a 
practice that little by little – if we look back a couple 
years ago, we can see, “Yes, I’m not as reactive as I 
used to be.” Maybe I’m a little bit kinder. And with this we see, “Yes, this path is valuable for me.” And 
out of that arises gladness because we know that 
this path of the Dharma is a refuge for us, and a 
security we have.  
 
Maybe we’re having a really difficult time, and 
gladness is not the first thing that’s going to come up 
because there are a lot of negative emotions. At 
least we can be glad to know we have a path of 
practice to help us deal with it.  
 
What I wanted to communicate today is that in the 
conditions that the Buddha laid out as the path to 
awakening, gladness is one of those conditions : 
gladness that is born of confidence in the path. As 
such, it is transformative. It’s one of those conditions 
that we cultivate that actually changes us and helps 
us along the path the freedom. It arises naturally out 
of faith or confidence, and it naturally gives rise to 
joy. What I’d like to close with is sharing with you 
how important it is for us to notice the  confidence 
that we might find in the path, and the gladness that 
can arise from that. It is going to change us if we 
notice it.  
 
It would be a shame to be real serious about our 
practice, and be hard on ourselves, and we’ve got to 
do better, never good enough. No! If you’ve been practicing for a long time, you may have a 
tremendous, rock -solid confidence in the path, and 
it’s easy t o feel glad about that. If you’ve not been 
practicing for a long time, you might have a little tiny 
seed of confidence. And that little seed can give you 
a little seed of gladness.  
 
Say ‘Yes’ to your gladness. Let it nourish you.
