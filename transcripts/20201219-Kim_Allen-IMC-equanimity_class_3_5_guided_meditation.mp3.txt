The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

And with that, we'll do another meditation together.
So if you need to change position, feel free to do that.
But I'm actually going to ask that you don't quite close your eyes yet.
So let me introduce a bit by saying that in this meditation, we're going to be expanding and kind of evening out where we place our attention.
Normally we have habitual ways of placing our attention where we would normally pay more attention to some things than others purely out of habit.
And it's possible through the practice of equanimity to even out where we pay attention, kind of relax that bias in what we choose to pay attention to, and balance out that imbalance.
So for this meditation, we will actually begin now with our eyes open.
We just have a soft gaze around what's around you. Of course, there's the computer screen, but maybe you can just like make your lens a little bigger you can see maybe the wall behind it, some furniture, something else that's nearby.
So just be aware without really focusing on any one thing that there are objects around you, and they're connected by the space between them.
So allow your attention to take in the objects and the space.
So objects and space are together.
And you can open your eyes with that sense.
And now you can gently close the eyes.
Settle into an internal sense.
And you can open to the sounds in your environment so there's my voice but there may be other sounds.
There may be other sounds to all be there.
And be aware also that there is silence that's between the sounds, maybe behind the sounds.
And the sounds come and go we don't really have any control over that.
There's the sound, and there's the silence. We give equal attention to those.
And as we're sitting here we're sitting with our body against the chair or cushion.
And within the body there's the sensation of the breath coming and going.
There's this feeling of aliveness that Diana talked about.
Constant movements in the body of energies of air.
So we feel all these different sensations of the body coming and going.
We may be aware that there is some stillness also in our body.
It's from the reference point of the stillness that we can feel the motion.
So becoming aware also of the stillness that's behind or between all the different movements of this alive body.
And we give our attention both to the movements and to the stillness.
And we rest.
Now we'll begin opening our attention toward more aspects of experience.
There's no need to try to hold on to everything trying to pay attention to more and more things.
Just as I name them will turn toward each one, but without pushing any of the prior ones away.
So we already have the sense of the sounds and the silence and the movement and the stillness.
We can open to include any emotions that may be present in our experience.
We feel a sense of sadness or joy or impatience or peace.
We just include that.
We may notice that these also occur in a kind of space, space of the mind.
But we can feel the energy rising, pulsing, cresting and falling away in the space of the mind, these emotions.
And we rest.
We can open further to include thoughts.
We feel these also as things that arise in the mind, moving and shifting, maybe like clouds in the sky.
Feeling the flow of thoughts coming, going.
And we rest.
We may notice that we also have certain intentions in the mind.
An intention to be present, an intention to rest.
An intention to listen.
We just include these two in the space of the mind.
And we rest.
A sense that you are open to anything entering the mind.
All of experience is available here in the space of the mind.
Anything can come or go.
Anything can be seen from this place of rest.
Anything can come or go.
Now we can turn to include even that space of the mind.
Let that very space be infused with sensitivity.
As if the space itself were like a liquid with taste buds or nerve endings, touching all of the experience in it.
Let the space be like an open heart, feeling all of experience.
The heart is directly touched by all of these myriad things, body, sound, feelings, thoughts.
And we rest.
And if you find that the mind has picked something up, it's narrowed down into one kind of experience out of habit.
Notice, just reopen, briefly touch into body, sounds, emotions, attention, thoughts, re-gathering.
And I'm resting again in sensitive openness to the flow of experience.

And as we continue to be with this sensitivity to all of experience, it can be helpful from time to time to drop in a question, not to answer.
As it comes from it.
Rest in that shift.
And the question is, what experiences this?
We'll shift from that, just rest in that shift.
This is the equanimity of everything.
Allow yourself to become everything.

And as we gently move toward the close of this meditation, you may wish to take a little bit deeper breath next time, or the next.
Allowing that sense of the air coming in to fill the body.
And again, feeling the particular shape of this body right now.
Feeling the place that you're sitting.
Tuning into the particular sounds in your environment.
Maybe slightly moving your toes or your hands to feel the physicality of this particular body.
Maybe gently allowing the corners of the mouth to turn up into a slight smile.
Feeling the gentle presence of this particular life.
And when you're ready, you can gently open the eyes, still in a meditative state, taking in the particular objects in your surroundings.
This space around you.
And feeling any sense of ease or peace with the very normal ordinariness of this being and these things.
Thank you.
