The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
One of my Burmese teachers often says, we are nature, and by that he means we are unfolding,
conditions, processes, integral part of this larger nature. We are distinct from it, but we
are not separate exactly. Whether it's being surrounded by house plants, or a beloved pet,
or just walking under the open sky on a path, nature is never far. This is also a certain kind of
practice teaching, because just as we are collectively better off if we connect with,
collaborate with the nature around us to cultivate it, it's also really beneficial to
collaborate to partner with the practice with ourselves in cultivating that. Not demanding
anything certain happened, not pushing, but exploring, meeting with loving interest, collaborating.
There are supports for this as we walk the path. It can be really helpful to consider this body
in whatever shape it's in, to be a lifelong companion with us every moment we came or sleeping,
even if it takes some pains, its imperfections, part of the vibrancy of life itself. Another
companion is to greet each moment of awareness, mindfulness, with the loving interest of an
old friend who's paid a surprise visit. Oh, hello. Welcome. We don't greet an old friend with
where have you been? What took you so long? Oh, welcome. Hi. Greeting with a little spark,
perhaps, of discovery or joy in each moment. With care, with kindness, with love. Just like
someone seen and new. Each moment of awareness is also different. It's also changing. So,
companion with practice in this unfolding nature that we are. Sometimes the companion
that life brings aren't as welcome, whether it's the sadnesses or griefs or the aches
and pains and illness processes of the body. To greet those two with respect, intimacy
with yourself, this deepens the practice, deepens, broadens. It can be helpful then also to tap
into this notion that while everything is happening to this person and this seat in
this moment. In a way, like nature, it's not personal. Moving through like weather patterns.
Shifting us, shifting us like the landscape. No matter what's arising in this season,
just preparing for the next season. Can we greet each moment anew without requiring
anything. Projecting into the future. Instead, oh, hello, this moment. Eventually then, the
embodied sense of presence, practice, also is a constant companion, coming and going,
constantly, constant, deepening intimacy with each moment in all things. So we are nature.
Perhaps meeting each moment of this nature with kindness and care today as you go about
your day. Greeting each moment of awareness like a friend. Thank you.
