 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome. Thank you for being here. This is class three in our abbreviated intro to mindfulness meditation series. The first week we talked about mindfulness of breath and body. Normally we would spend a whole week on each of these, and you'd have a whole week to practice with just one, and then the next, and then the next. And when we talk about mindfulness of breath, which is usually where instructions start, we start with the breath because it's sort of one of the easiest parts of our direct present moment experience to pay attention to. It's changing. It's something you can feel in many different parts of your body. And it's often what is developed for people into what we call often the word, often that's used as an anchor, a tether, an anchor, our main kind of object to hold us, help us stay present in the moment. So kind of like a boat, when you come into the harbor, you drop a line with an anchor to help the boat from drifting out or into the shore. In the same way the ocean carries the boat, our thoughts and our emotions will carry our awareness. You know, consume us, and we get lost, literally lost at sea, the sea of the mind or the sea of the emotions. So it's helpful because in this practice what we're trying to do is to be kind of here in this present time experience, and the best way to do that, to help us is to stay connected to your actual present moment experience. So breathing is one of those present moment experiences that can help us stay, stay grounded, stay connected to the present. So breathing is, also I like to kind of, I have a lot of reverence for the experience of breathing. It's the first thing we do when we're born, and it's the last thing when we die, as we exhale. It's pretty profound, right? And sometimes I like to think about it as, there's a way you can cultivate a relationship with your breath that is like a companion. And so it's the longest companion in a way you can have in your life. It's, you know, mindfulness of your breathing. So the body, similarly, some people will use sensations in their body or sound as an anchor to help them stay connected to the present moment. The body carries a lot of history, a lot of wisdom in it, memories. And actually, you know, there's a lot of science that shows that the brain is connected to the gut and the heart. There's a lot of communication between the brain and these organs. And that it's actually a source of information for us. Celine Sebastian says, sensations are the language of the body. And listening, feeling is the way we listen, the way the body feels heard. So to receive that experience, the felt experience of the body is the way the body feels heard. So it's very helpful to cultivate mindfulness of the body. Very, very supportive. I really can't imagine a practice without it. And last week we talked about mindfulness of emotions. And the word motion is in the word emotion. Emotions are meant to move through us. And when they get stuck and trapped is when we tend to run into trouble with them. And when we over-trigger them, we get in trouble with them. So I talked about a quote from Jill Bult Taylor. And when she did her research and study, the lifespan of an emotion is 90 seconds. So from a physiological perspective, an emotion lasts 90 seconds. And if it keeps going, it's because we're re-triggering it. So it's the activity in the mind and our relationship to the emotion, our reactivity to the emotion, our agreement with the emotion that keeps it going, keeps it going. So we talked about practicing, trying to just kind of open up and allow a feeling to move through you. To sort of witness the lifespan of the emotion without perpetuating it or suffocating it. Now we don't want to do that when we're getting overwhelmed with the emotions. It's panic or intense fear. Sometimes we actually need to do something to distract our mind, to get ourselves focused on something else. The Buddha talked about some extreme measures one might use to help oneself stop with thinking and getting caught. And that included biting your tongue. So we have to be skillful and wise in determining when we can be with an emotion and let it move through us. And when we need to help ourselves find a useful relationship and way of relating to help us through so we don't get into the cycle, perpetual cycle. And that brings us to what we'll talk about tonight, which is thinking. But before we do, I want to invite reflections from your practice this week, questions, anything that's coming up for you tonight that you want to share before we start exploring thinking. And then the microphone's right there. Anybody dare to pick it up? There's one right there too. Oh, I told. Yeah, we're recording. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's also fear. Like the same bike I took away from last week was the 90 second rule about emotions. And I was on a zoom yesterday morning and I was rushing to get onto the zoom. I was making a smoothie and I took the lid off the smoothie because it wasn't pushing down right. And I pushed it with the plunger and the whole plastic plunger eight got eight into the smoothie. And so like my like it wasn't anger. I was more angry, annoyed at myself. And then I had to sit on the zoom and try and be interested. And then I was talking myself down as like, I think I can salvage some of the smoothie, but I could feel my heart race racing and everything. And then in the end I just said I need to step away and turned off the screen and tended my smoothie. Caught what I could. And which was how if I put it through the save, I come up with a solution. But it was just turning off the screen and just like, right, I need to tend to this because I need to eat and I'm hungry. And I'm just going to spiral if I don't switch myself off and walk away. So I thought that was pretty good of me. Beautiful. Beautiful. Thank you for sharing that. I guess throughout the week, one thing that really have helped me is to really believe that emotions go through a very short period of time. I mean, that, you know, that's why it's called the emotion. And so because I'm so aware of that now, I have had several situations where before paying attention to that particular thing, I would have probably very likely get engaged into some type of argument or being sarcastic or do something because usually that's how you react. But now that I know that it's just an emotion that can very easily pass rather than me provoking a reaction, it's really helps. I mean, so. And then the other thing that have really helped me is also to realize that I actually enjoy doing the meditation, but it will only work when I want to do it. So I cannot really schedule it. So like, for example, I have tried a week now since I've been attending these classes to try to do it when I wake up or before, you know, mid day or one or two, some specific time. It doesn't work for me. Somehow, throughout the day, I feel like, oh, this is the perfect time for me to do it. And that seems to be something that when I do that, I'm actually unsuccessful in achieving some of the benefits of meditation. So those are the two things that I'm getting out of, you know, I guess all this practicing and learning what works and what doesn't work for me. Great, great. Sounds. Yeah, sounds good. You know, I think that finding finding our own rhythm with meditation is really important. And as you grow your practice, you know, you're likely to find more and more times that it works, meaning, you know, what, what does it mean to work to that's the other part. Right. So the idea is to come into direct connection with the present moment. And the more we do that, I think there's something inside of us that wants to do it more. Yeah. Use your mic. That's okay. I'm not really forcing myself into meditation, but rather is something that I actually enjoy. So beautiful. Thank you. Any experiences this last week or reflections questions you want to share? Probably the first two weeks, I noticed myself looking forward and wanting to do the meditation at home. And then this last week has been a little bit stressful. I've been trying to get reference and references for jobs and stuff like that. So trying to corral people. So I don't want to go into the meditation stressed out, but I know it would probably help. So I feel like I'm kind of in an in between point where I know and I feel that it's helpful. But at the same time, I'm when it gets a little harder to do, I almost don't want to taint it with having to do it and versus like doing it out of more sort of voluntary, even though I know it would be beneficial. I feel sometimes that is the attitude that we take. I'm going to meditate and it just like this is not working. So, okay, I'm just going to sit down here and just feel my body, feel my breath. I'm just going to close my eyes for a few minutes. Sometimes the meditation can take just one minute. It's a moment of connection like you were saying. And maybe not taking it too seriously. Like, okay, I'm just going to sit here and breathe a little bit and reconnect and pause and calm my nervous system and see what happens. I think. I think why are we meditating like we want to. I mean, we may have many reasons like you want to feel more grounded, more center, like more at ease, being able to respond right in that react all those things. So if we're trying to get to meditation with that opposite attitude, it doesn't make much sense. So what is it that I want to achieve with like calm, grabness, whatever. So, okay, so I'm going to invite myself to do that and see where it takes me because sometimes we tend to be very okay. It's meditation time. You need to sit down. And I don't for personally that doesn't help me at all. And sometimes it's okay. I'm just going to sit and close my eyes for a moment and usually helps a little bit. And sometimes I can only sit for two minutes and okay, that's it. I'll try later. I'm appreciating all of your engagement very much. Hi, welcome. Welcome back. We're just checking in about the last three classes and answering some questions before we start talking about mindfulness of thinking. Is there anything that you want to share or ask before? Can you see this microphone? We're being recorded for people in the future. Well, there is only. I have to remove this. No, no, just hold it close. Okay. Recently, well, I guess more than recently, I've been thinking about peace as mathematics. In mathematics, we talk about differentiation and integration. So one theory I have developed is if this is like a small differential element of the cosmos of the universe and there is peace. Let's say DX for this element and then if we do the integral DX, DY, DT, including the time dimension, that becomes like the cosmos. So that so we have peace everywhere. So that is so what we do in a differential element in a small environment, it gets multiplied or integrated into the universe. That's essentially something I've been reflecting on or even presenting here or otherwise. Any comments you have or any? Yeah, well, that all of the scientists here. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm a scientist and like the way you're putting then, I mean, the beauty of math, bringing that into this practice is quite nice to listen to you. Thank you so much for that. Yeah, I always for many for a few years, I doubted that, oh, but I'm a scientist. I could never be a teacher like, but I just love this practice so much. I think I learned quite a bit there, like a lot of the expectations that we have about ourselves. And it doesn't matter where you come from. This practice is for everybody. I mean, if if you're willing to get a try. Thank you for sharing that. And as a non scientist, you know, I think the power of this practice is to understand how what we do on our own cushion impacts everybody we come in contact with. And it reverberates to the whole the whole the whole of it all. So thank you for bringing mathematical proof to my experience. Yeah. I think. Oops, let's use that. It's a question of a little. This is meant to be like I've tried to simplify it so much that, you know, it is understandable by anyone. It is not necessarily meant for someone who knows calculus or mathematics. So it is meant to be more simplified. And I wanted to add that. Thank you. Just checking the time. I would like to invite us first to just maybe close our eyes for a moment or like it's not a long meditation, just kind of like centering and grounding a little bit and finding a comfortable posture. Feeling your body on the chair, maybe a little some shoulder rolls or head movement, just really be comfortable. And feeling your breathing, feeling your body. And I invite you to see what's happening in your mind. Well, what are the thoughts, the thinking, what are the images in your mind, the sounds in your mind, the echoes of the day, just notice what's going on. Is the mind rehearsing or telling stories, thinking back to that discussion in the morning and finding the right words that you should have said. Or thinking what you're going to have when you get home or what you're going to do tomorrow. Perhaps the sounds my voice the words kind of evoke more thoughts or thinking. Just notice that. Notice the intensity, the volume. Is it loud, is it soft, is it colorful, is it black and white. Taking a deep breath and opening the eyes. When we decide to pay attention, what's going on in the mind, it can be quite surprising to see how many things happen in the mind. Even when I'm speaking here, I'm thinking about something else. Did I lower the volume of my phone? Did I turn it off? Did I lock the door when I left home? Even when you're listening to me, a word I say is going to evoke something. I don't know the exact numbers, but they say that even in a conversation when you're listening to something in TV or something, you pay attention maybe to 50% of the things at best. Our mind goes, oh, this is so interesting and just goes away. When we start meditating, when we see it to meditate, it's not unusual that we get that rush of thoughts. We see the day coming through our head or something that bothers us, it becomes so clear. It happens to me that I forget more often that I care about that, that that's normal. I often get a little discouraged like home. Here I go again. It's like, okay, so feeling the body, the breathing, but that rush of thinking, it depends how your thoughts, how the way you think, images, sounds, even the taste in your mouth can be evoking so many things, the sounds of the train, there's always something. That's normal. That's what the mind does. The thing is we are sometimes a little conflicted about it because I think by now you may know that we're not trying to have a blank mind, stop thinking. What we're trying to do in meditation is to be aware of what's happening. Sometimes when the thinking becomes so obvious, we don't like it. Sometimes there's something that we get our mind off, something very nice that happens and you just keep going back. These thoughts are like Velcro, I think. Sometimes you want to know again, you want to feel that again. That's totally normal. What we're trying to do with mindfulness of thinking is not to be carried away by it. Just go sit down and just be miles away. When we sit down to meditate, we want to be present, but we want to notice our thinking. Sometimes, as I was saying, I'm talking, you're listening, and there's many things happening in their mind. When we don't recognize our thinking in a way, the thoughts are called the dictators of the mind. We end up doing what our thoughts are telling us, but if we become aware of how we're thinking or what we're thinking, we start having a little bit of choice in there. With mindfulness of thinking, we could try. I'm a scientist, so I like the steps. I hope that works for you. The first thing that you do is you become aware that you're thinking. You're breathing, you're centered, you're connected to your body, you're paying attention to your breathing, and you know that you're thinking. We don't get involved with the content too much. Like, okay, here I go. I'm thinking again, but I'm here. I'm breathing. I'm breathing here. It's just a very light touch. I know I'm thinking. When we feel more stable, we could start paying more attention at the content of the thinking, because it really matters, especially recognizing what we think one thing over and over again. What do you say? That's bothering me so much. Why am I coming back to that over and over again? We get a little more in depth with the thinking, but still we try not to get carried away by the thoughts. Tanya was mentioning the anchor, and that image works great for me. I'm a very visual person. For me, what I imagine is a helium balloon that is attached with a string to the table, to a rock on the floor, and it's a windy day. Have you seen those plastic things? The wind is blowing and the thing is moving, but it remains in place. For me, mindfulness of thinking is a little bit like that. I'm still here, but I know I'm thinking, and that is so interesting. But okay, I come back. I think it's a little bit like that. And with feelings, with emotions, we know what thought we want to maybe investigate a little bit, but come back here, and what thought we really need to... Okay, I'm not going to think about you. Well, I don't know what the equivalent to biting your tongue would be for a thought, but I don't care, like breathing, breathing, or counting maybe, or something that will keep you here. But yeah, being aware that I'm thinking, not necessarily paying attention to the content. That's kind of the first level. And then maybe I can pay a little bit of attention. Well, I'm really remembering a lot here, like, oh, interesting. Or I'm planning, planning what I'm going to do next week, and I'm making my list of thanksgiving, things like that. That's what happens in meditation. And something else that is important to notice is the attitude that we have. Is it bothering me? Is it bothering me this amount of thinking, oh, all that train of thought, sometimes as I was telling you, I sit down to meditate again. Like, wow, that's... what is my attitude there? Maybe I can bring a little bit more kindness to the way, paying attention to my thinking. So this is normal. That's what the mind does. So I can... okay, it's okay. Let's maybe imagine that you're sitting meditating and, for example, somebody else is talking, but you're still there. You can listen that they're talking, but you don't pay... you're not paying attention to the conversation that they're having. You just hear, listen. A little bit with the thoughts could be that. Or things happening in the street, happens that you have a view to the window and you're meditating and you can see how the light intensity changes, but you're meditating, you're here. That could be something like that. Another thing that... so I know I'm thinking, I know the kind of thoughts I'm thinking. I know my attitude towards that and I can soften that. It's nice. It helps me to be present. The more bothered I am with my thoughts, the easiest I go down the rabbit hole. The kinder I am to myself, I say, yeah, this is normal. The easiest it becomes to be mindful of my thinking. I think we also tend to over-identify with our thoughts. And what are the thoughts at the end of the day? So it's the activity of the neural pathways in our brain, electric activity, chemical reactions, with neural receptors, all the complexity of the anatomy of the brain. We receive so much information, like terabytes of information all the time. And our brain is, oh, connecting this with this, remembering all that other thing, making all this connection. Oh, I need to protect myself. I need to look for things that I like, that are good for me. All that is happening all the time. So we really cannot control our thinking. Sometimes we're going to have thoughts that are like, wow, that's kind of amazing. So all that to say that I'm not my thinking. I'm not my thoughts. The same way that I'm not my emotions. I'm not sad. I'm feeling sadness. Just the thought is not reality. I think a good example about it is, suppose you're meeting new people, and somebody that you see that something about that person, their appearance, it reminds you of somebody with whom you have a complicated relationship, or is wearing something that you just don't like at all, or their accent, how loud they speak, and there's something that you don't like about that person. So that's the thought. You're kind of calibrating that person. And then it happens that later you start talking to that person, and you have a lot in common, and you can connect, and you have such a fun conversation. So yeah, that first thought about that person wasn't accurate. It's not that person in reality. It was just what you were thinking. So when we recognize that, we have that possibility. Do I believe my thoughts? Or maybe there's something else in there. So I hope that that makes some sense. So what I'm going to invite you to do, I want to make sure we could turn time. Yes, perfect. I'm going to do a short meditation, and I'm going to invite you up with the thinking. So let's do that. So, okay. So find a comfortable posture, and adjust your posture the best you can, like really to soften and relax the body. Let's take a couple of deep breaths. Inhaling by the nose, bringing the air to the belly, and exhaling by the mouth. And finding your normal breathing. Notice your feet on the floor, and back with the chair. Let's go to the head, bringing the attention to the head, and making any adjustments so it doesn't stress your shoulders or your neck. And softening the eyebrow, the lips, the jaw. Bringing the attention to the shoulders, and allow them to get away from the ears. Noticing the weight of the arms, and softening your hands. And bringing the attention to the chest. Noticing the expansion with the in-breath, and the softening with the out-breath. Notice the abdomen, and see if you can soften, release any holding there. Noticing the weight of the torso, the hips, the pressure against the chair. Notice if there's any contraction on the legs, as the legs were ready to start walking to go. There's no place to go, nothing to fix, nothing to change right now. Notice the contact of the feet with the floor, and becoming aware of the body, the whole body, the breathing. Noticing the life in your body. Perhaps bring the attention to the sensations of breathing. Or maybe to the sensations in the hands, or the feet. Just choose your anchor, what works today, now. And rest your awareness there. And while you're connected to your anchor, the breathing, the body, notice your thinking. Is there any images or sounds, concepts, stories? No. Notice if they're changing, appearing, disappearing. Notice if they're changing, appearing, disappearing. Maybe you got hooked into a thought, an idea. Just notice it. Just notice how it feels to be distracted, how the thought expresses in the body. Notice how it feels to be distracted. When do you notice the thoughts when they're just starting to form? In the middle of them? And what's the attitude? One thing, aversion, is it pleasant, unpleasant or unknown? And coming back to your breathing or your anchor. Stay there for a few moments, acknowledging the thinking, and yet resting the awareness on the breathing and your anchor. Stay there. So I wonder, how was that? Did you see your thinking? Anything surprising? Thank you for getting me going. So I have a question about a statement that you made going into that meditation. And you said that, I am not my thoughts. So when people do speakable acts, are they waived because they are not their thoughts? And how do they act on their thoughts if they are not their thoughts? How do they act on their thoughts if they're not their thoughts? Okay, I think, speaking of a normal person, not pathological conditions or anything like that, when we act on impulse without thinking almost, I think probably what has happened there is you've been feeling something in your mind. Maybe a resentment or, I don't know, somebody you don't like, and you just start creating all these stories about what's happening. You just start creating, and probably you don't even know that you're doing that. I mean, you know, but you don't know. That kind of ruminating about the same thing over and over again. So from somebody looking from the outside, I'm just thinking of an example. From the outside, nothing else is happening. And then a word they say, and this person just reacts, but there was so much already in their mind. There was this fiction of reality that it just needed a word maybe, I don't know, that just triggers something, and then you have this super reaction, overreaction. We can build our own internal reality just based on the narrative, the stories that we tell ourselves. Like somebody is late, oh, they don't respect me, here we go again. How can this person live that? And, oh, it happens that, I don't know, there was so much traffic that they couldn't get on time. But we tell ourselves so many things. And I don't think it's as simple as just thinking, that emotions, and just we just don't see it. I don't know if that helps. There's something else. Can I take a stab at responding to the statement about you're not your thoughts? Have you ever witnessed your mind having a thought that you gasp that you had? You're like, I can't believe I just thought that. Have you ever had that happen? No? Okay. Actually, there's a mechanism in our brain that just sort of might be akin to a thought making machine, just puffing out. I've had thoughts, but don't act on them. So how do people act on them? But you asked, you said, were you asking about, I am not my thoughts? Yeah, so I am not my thoughts. So I watch all my thoughts. So if I go out and murder someone, and I'm not my thoughts, but some things happen for me to go out and murder someone, am I my thoughts because I'm thinking I want to go out and murder someone, and then I go and murder someone? So I am my thoughts because I acted on my thoughts. No, we're not our thoughts. Our thoughts come and go. They change all the time. So you might have a very strong thought that you, unfortunately, I don't even want to think about that particular thought personally. But it's not a permanent state. Who you are is not a thought. A thought comes and goes and changes. And so do we. There's no permanent thinking, one person thinking, one way of thinking. Our thinking changes. Our identity changes. Who we are in a certain circumstance changes. And we can all be anything. We could all become that. We all have the potential to become that. What we don't want to be, we see. It depends on the conditions and the awareness that's present at the moment of those conditions. This is the part of the practice, is how to be wise, to be aware of and choose which thoughts, which feelings, which impulses we follow, and which ones we let move through. That reminds me of this story about the, I mean, I have heard that it's been related to Native American culture and several, but basically we have two wolves inside ourselves. And an aggressive, violent, despiteful animal and then a kind, loving, caring wolf. So they're always in battle. So which one is going to win? And the grand myself is the one that you feed. So we're capable of horrible things and we're capable of wonderful things. Good. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Did you have something you wanted to share about your mindfulness of thinking? I think this week has been more stressful for me. So I think that's probably why I've been avoiding doing some exercises at home. But getting back to today and doing it in person kind of reminded me of how beneficial or helpful it's been. So it's been nice to sort of become familiar with not having to avoid something. Or I think if I have a perfect day, then it sets me up to be primed for a nice meditation day or something like that. But I think going to like thoughts or things like that, being able to have influence or momentum and pushing or steering at certain direction we want to go. It's just nice to exercise that and do. Yeah. And I think like what Tanya was saying about emotion, it's the same about thought. Sometimes they're too much or this is so repetitive that is overwhelming. So go for a walk. Go for a run. I don't know. Just switch ideas. Read something inspiring. I think the more we practice, we start noticing like this is too much. I need to do the wise thing to do is something else. Other times we can see it and interesting and watch it. But yeah, there's always the middle way. It's not that you have to do this or such. There's no such a thing. And I think it's normal to have good days or bad days or good meditation days and not so good meditation days. Exactly. Yes. Yeah. Thank you. Any other comments before I. Yeah. Hello. I made a fantastic list of things I need to do when I get home and was very aware of myself making a list at one point and decided just to be kind to myself and realize I've done enough for today. It's a nice. One of the things I wanted to quote is a quotation from a book called The Dance of Shiva written by Sri Lanka. Not her Anand Kumar Swami. There are 14 essays which cover all philosophies and practices and in particular on Buddhism. He talks about the thought that even the heart of having violence is equivalent to committing violence. So being in command of our thoughts, if I can say that, is important. So and that I think that goes well with the having a good day or a bad day. So if we are able to have only positive thoughts or whatever, you know, whether, you know, devoid of, you know, what anything which is not positive, then we will have a good day or good time all the time. I guess that's so I mean, and, you know, there are these three degrees we talk about, you know, the para and if you did Gita Bhagavad Gita, the para, Vacha and Karm, which is essentially there are three steps. So it begins with the thought. It translates to a word and then the action. Or if we just remove the intermediate step, you know, from the thought to the action. So I would just state that if we are able to train our mind to think positive, to have positive thoughts, then we are able to be in a positive state of mind or like, you know, I don't know if that is kind of what everybody is. Yeah, I think controlling our thoughts is very complicated. It's very difficult to I don't know the connections of brain that sometimes is that very bizarre. And I didn't see that coming. But I think with the practice is this idea that I'm not my thoughts and thoughts are just thoughts. So you can see and go. I mean, if you if you wait long enough, something else is going to come through your mind. So it's like, it's during inclination, the direction, your intention, all that stuff. But we're going to have weird thoughts. And you just see them. I think with the practices, even if we have a bad day, we can be okay. If we have a fantastic day, we okay. We can remain center doesn't mean that we're not enjoying or we're going to have pain in our lives. I mean, life is going to come no matter what. Bad disease, issues, trouble, everything is going to come. But can we stay center? Can? Yeah, this is part of life. Can we just remain like the these similar that life is like the ocean and ocean with a huge storm. And what the practice bring us is the calm that can exist at the bottom of the water and the water could be a huge storm and underneath is calm. There's possible to be well. We're not trying to. We cannot control that. But we can find that place where we can be okay. It's yeah. And you know, there's different philosophies. And so we're teaching one here. Yeah, we're teaching that Tara Vada, the pass enough philosophy approach, which is, you know, different than maybe what you're talking about. There's components of of the Tara Vada practice where we cultivate and support well being the Brahma Vahara's these heavenly mind states. But but part of part of the practice is learning how to to be with to recognize and see thoughts, not identify with them and to be wise with them to have wisdom, present with the observing of a thought, the engagement with a thought. So. Hold it closer and make sure it's on you. You were saying that and also what you mentioned that we're not our thoughts, right? Right. I mean, I'm 100% in agreement with that because my understanding is that we end up being our own actions. So I can have a lot of thoughts. But me is the actions that I take with whatever I do is basically that's who I am. And I think thoughts are just always around me and somehow I cannot really control them because I will be repressing them. I just have to leave, you know, accepting them and accepting them the good and the bad and focusing more on how are they going to impact my daily activities, my actions. So is that more connected with acceptance? Yeah. So let me move into this next little education part and then another little we'll see where we get. But so one one way to think about this, too, is so we're really right here. We're practicing becoming aware and what's most important is the awareness, being aware of the thinking. Right. We can be aware and have a thought happening. We don't have to become the thought, the content of the thought. We can rest in the knowing. Right. So there's one nice way to describe this is to imagine sitting on a little island and you're sitting there on the shore and it's like awareness is here, observing. And we witness a thought and the thought is like a ship and it's coming by and the ships to represent different kinds of thoughts are different kinds of ships, for example, a warship. Right. We have a lot of anger happening in our mind. Or then there's the party boat and we're having all kinds of pleasure fantasies and and then there's the poor me raft that's barely making it. Oh, right. So there's this way of learning to stay on the shore to witness the kinds of thoughts that are coming and to see the impact of those thoughts. So, you know, more important than the sometimes I think the total content is to see the wreckage or the impact or the tone, the emotional energetics, energetics of different kinds of thinking. And as we sit there and we watch this and we see how we get caught on the warship and we end up two weeks down the, you know, peninsula and we have to tread back up and sit back down again. You know, after we do this enough times, we start to go, oh, I'm not getting back on that boat. We it takes time. We're going to get caught. But the more we sit back and watch and observe, we grow wisdom and the wisdom becomes natural, like going to touch a hot stove. We once we learn it's hot, our hand pulls back. We don't want to touch the heat in the same way we grow a wisdom that is that just knowing that just deep that goes, oh, that thought, oh, that's painful. I don't want to engage with that thought. So this mindfulness of thinking is the beginning of creating the capacity to sit back and observe and grow our wisdom. Yeah. But the final purpose then has to be we do the meditation for a reason, a fundamental reason at the end. Freedom. And I assume for me the freedom of an action then. So in other words, if I'm contemplating all these things happening in front of me. The Buddha says a thought is an action. So freedom from even that thought. I'm just looking at the distance, all these different things happening in front of me and I'm just contemplating them. And I cannot just be contemplating my entire life. I need to at some point. No, no, no, absolutely. So then we make a decision, I guess, based on where I'm going to be going with it's like you go to the gym to build your muscles. Right. But then you use your muscles in life. We sit in our cushion to build the wisdom. We build the capacity to witness, to observe. Then we have that strength, that capacity to observe and be aware in our life. To make choices, to be free from the compulsions and reactivity, to be able to be wise and free from greed, hatred, you know, with delusion, to have clarity and freedom around that and how we are with others. A non-harming presence to ourselves, to others. Absolutely, absolutely. 100%. Absolutely, absolutely. Beautiful. Just, this is so great. Your engagement is just awesome. So, how are you right now? Just check in. Notice right now. How are you feeling in your bodies? Yeah, yeah. I just feel like I need to tell the group that I'm not thinking about turning into a murderer. And what it was when I was driving over, I don't know if you heard about the four young boys who got murdered at the University of Virginia. That story was just on as I pulled up and as I what compels somebody to go and commit such a senseless, violent act. And so when you were talking about, I am not my thoughts, now I'm clearer about that because I'm seeing my thoughts, but I don't have to act on those. And sometimes when we are on autopilot and somebody might say something to us and we have that visceral reaction, it's like, you get defensive over something. But now if you kind of calm, slow down, you can actually rewind, like you can play that in your head and then it's like, oh, that's because when I was five, I was like, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, or yeah, or just, oh, yeah, yeah. Ouch. I don't want to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Beautiful. I'm glad that happened for you in this process. That's great. Let me just see. Look at my notes here. So this idea of the showboats or the different kinds of boats is one way to help you in meditation, start to shift toward noticing the general form, type of thinking rather than just getting immersed in the details of the thinking. Right. So being able to just have a brief label or a note like, oh, angry thoughts, you know, worship, oh, poor me thought, you know, just like that's sort of the depth that we need to go is pretty light in terms of generally when we're meditating, unless something's really repetitive, then we need to spend a little more time with it. Right. So this idea just gives you an idea of how to practice mindfulness of thinking. Sandra also was talking earlier about noticing we think differently. We don't all actually think the same way. Some of us are very visual thinkers. We have vivid imagery and colors. Other people, it's more like shadows or impressions of images. Other people, it's like they see letters and words in their mind. They're like reading a screen. They're thinking is like that. Other times it's it's a dialogue, an inner dialogue, a very clear voice. How do you think? Do you know? I'm still learning and it changes. So this is another way to become curious and interested in thinking in the process of thinking. It's nature. We think that's part of the organ of the mind is to think. And can we we get so merged with it gets so caught in the story of it. We don't step back to see it in these ways. Right. It's like mini movies and we're the star of the movie. We don't even know it's a movie. You know, we're we're in it. So these these are tools to help us have a little space and a little more awareness around the experience of thinking. There are things that fuel our thoughts. And this is important part to pay attention to as well. Emotions obviously can really fuel thinking and vice versa. There's a real strong relationship between an emotion and thinking. So learning and being curious about and like, oh, if you're finding yourself having certain kinds of thoughts, maybe check in and say, you know, what's the emotional issue? What's the tone? Emotional feeling going on here? And then see if you can practice a simple mindfulness of emotion, feeling it as a sensation in the body and not connected to the thinking. Also, I am identification. This is me. The more we identify with our thoughts, the more we're going to fuel them. Power boosts them, right? Supercharge them. And focusing on the content and the story is also another way to really get lost and fuel them, to fuel the process of thinking when we get very caught in that storyline. You know, yeah, and then this happened and then that happened. And if I just done this or they looked at that way and then there was, wow, like, you know, this is when we get into the minutia of it instead of go, oh, remembering, for example, remembering. Can you feel the difference? Okay. And then, you know, clinging. So what are we clinging to? Right? Like, for example, if I really don't want someone to get hired to do a particular job at my work, I can really cling to what I don't want to have happen and just get really caught up in it. And a lot of suffering, the more I'm clinging to that, the more I can't sleep, the more I distress, the more upset I am about what's happening. Right? Because I want control over what I can't have control over. I might be able to have a vote, but I certainly don't get choice. Right? Greed. Right? Wanting something. Like, that's another form of clinging. That feeling of wanting pleasure or wanting this or that will fuel our thinking and hatred. So these strong kind of energetic, emotional kind of qualities, paying attention to them and noticing if they're present. It's easy. It's actually possible to if we're feeling a lot of greed or hatred instead of staying focused on the story, the object of greed or hatred, we can actually just go, what does it feel like to be hateful? What does it feel like to have greed? And that can help us go, oh, ah, and then that natural wisdom of I don't want to suffer can arise. Right? And that helps us to, to let go to get disenchanted. So when you're meditating, you are going to think it's natural thinking happens. Sometimes we have periods in our meditation where our mind isn't that busy thinking or thinking is so subtle, it feels like we're not thinking. But being aware of thinking and creating wise relationship to it is very freeing, very helpful. Yeah. So think emphasizing this idea that we're not trying to stop or control our thinking as much as we are focusing on how we're aware of our thinking and relating to it. Yeah. So we're, you know, we have 10 minutes left, just not a lot of time to do. I know, right. Just wanted to, it sounds easy. No, I said, Oh yeah, I just need to pay attention. I just need to be aware. Sounds. Oh, it's a simple idea. Gosh, it's so difficult. It's so it takes time. It really requires a lot of kindness and, and care for ourselves like to sit down and that was a horrible meditate. I didn't meditate at all. I was just lost. Who knows? Yeah, that happens. That totally happens. So just patience and a lot of care and kindness to ourselves. Yeah. And there's, you know, it's, it may be some at some point, I, you know, it's very, there's this balance between sitting when it feels right and not sitting when it's not a good time. Right. Because, you know, if you're, if your mind is filled with hatred and you know you sit going to sit down, you're just going to be practicing hatred. Right. That's not so helpful. On the other hand, there's those times where maybe it's like kind of, you're okay enough and it's, it might help you grow some muscles to sit down and meditate, even though it doesn't feel like the perfect meditation time. Actually, you're, you've got, if you've got enough of it, enough capacity for a short period of time to try and sit and be with and not become the thinking and the energy, you, you're growing something incredibly powerful in yourself. Incredibly powerful. I found that at some point I made the commitment to sitting for five minutes every day. You know, when I started to get very serious about my practice, I made at least five minutes, just five minutes, I'm going to at least sit down for five minutes. And it, there was something profound that started to shift when I was able to sit down and stay there for five minutes, even when I was miserable. All I could do was cry or just get lost in thought after thought. But I did, I sat there for the full five minutes and there's something that starts to grow in us that is very, very useful and powerful. By doing that, by doing that, when, you know, when that that time is right for us. I love what you said, to be with, not to be calm. That really resonates with me. Any final reflections or questions before we move to the dedication of merit? I like the thought of sitting down and doing the meditation for five minutes because for every day I thought I had to do 20 minutes. And if I had a bad day, I thought, oh, I can't do 20 minutes today, so I'll just skip. I think five minutes would have been helpful and being able to sit and feel or think but not become. It was pretty helpful because I thought, well, I did 20 minutes well last night, so I have to do it today or it doesn't count or something like that. But I think also thinking we will have good days and bad days and, you know, forming or reinforcing that practice of consistency is nice through to get in the bad. I was in retreat last week, a short retreat. The first full day I was miserable. Like, oh, my God, like I said, because I had to say I'm at the retreat center. I'm going to say that. But it was it was a very difficult day. And I went to bed and slept when I was so tired of being miserable that I just slept quite well. And when I woke up, I said, OK, here I go again. And I just sat on the bed and it's like, what's going on? Like, I have I have so much rejection of what I was feeling, what I was thinking. It wasn't just that it was my attitude on the whole day. And the moment I decided to see it like, yeah, I'm sad. I'm having all these thoughts. I know. OK, this is this is what's happening when I just I'm going to let you be. The moment I changed that, that they went much, much better. It was a full day in retreat and miserable day. But, yeah, I just I need to sit down and something shifts. Sometimes a little one retreat is different. But sometimes it's just just sit there the five minutes and something starts shifting. I yeah. What you say is true. I promise you that will happen. I just wanted to offer to that in the times when you're really energetically upset or agitated that in the practice, we don't always sit. We can walk. And I think one of the most fruitful meditations that I've taken have been those very energetic, very angry meditations that I've done walking meditation and being able to work off that energy and still be very mindful of what's happening both in your mind and your body. Really helps discharge that into something so much more manageable. Thank you. Did you want to say something? Pretty much what you were saying is that I think that if you were able to process these very intense, you know, really terrible emotions, sometimes that can be a very rich opportunity to find the source of many things happening inside you rather than. You know, because I think like midterm emotions probably are not really that difficult to meditate. But when you really reached a point where, you know, I mean, like sometimes I hit the button and let's just blow up the world. I mean, sometimes you might have one of those. If you're able to process and just pay attention and see them coming and why. It can be a pretty interesting trip again, a very interesting experience also. Absolutely. So, yeah. So I think that, you know, what you were saying, you were saying that 100% in agreement with everything that. So, you know, this is the final week of our three week series. And I have a, you know, Sandra will give you some suggestions. So maybe we should do that first. And then I'd like to do a dedication of merit ritual. That's OK. To kind of bring this time to a closure. And so do you want to. So I think. Sure. Yeah. Even though you don't feel like meditating, sometimes it really helps to put it like in the calendar. And if you say, let's say you are in the 20 minutes, but it's the bad day. Do it for five. Don't just start building that that muscle. If it works for you in the morning, do it in the morning. If you have the time at noon, do it at whatever time. In my case, when I started doing it, it was in the evenings. Odd enough, I was tired and that. But it was what really allowed me to. I don't know. It's like there's nothing else I can do. I'll just sit and meditate. There was no other thing that I could do. So for me, was that worked. So, yeah, make it maybe a habit. And even during the day, those small moments, for example, just it takes 15 seconds to connect to your body. Three inbreds, three cycles of bread being completely there. It starts building that. So it's bringing that that habit when you're in a light red in the street, just I mean, don't close your eyes or anything, but take a deep breath, connect. Where am I? Where is my body? How am I feeling? How is my body feeling? How is my heart feeling? What's happening in my mind? And when you go into automatic pilot, obviously you won't notice while you're in it. But when you realize that your day is like, wow, what happened? Get curious. It's like imagine you're walking for the first time in an unknown place. You are looking very carefully. What's these that store that like bring that type of curiosity to your experience? Yeah. What else, Dania? Well, in the handout, there's some homework instruct, you know, so there's a handout on the stage there if you want to grab one. But there's some suggestions for what you can do next to keep growing this practice and kind of develop, like reflect on your beliefs about your thoughts. Right. Take a two hour period where you track the kinds of thoughts you're having. Right. And then take two hours during the week to track your intentions. So these are there's some more suggestions in here about how to continue to grow your practice around mindfulness of thinking. So that was actually one of my next following questions. So if I'm interested in continuing learning from your center, what would be the next, I guess, class step or what do you think it's next in order to continue developing more clear understanding? Yeah. Well, one thing is I will be teaching with Don Neal a five week, a full five week introduction series starting January and the first Thursday in January. So I would definitely invite all of you to come back and, you know, do the series again. You can't do it too many times. Next month in December, we're going to be teaching for Noble Truths, which is a lot about suffering and how to relate to suffering wisely. It's a huge part of the Buddhist teachings. And so if you want to learn about that, you can come same time next month. We won't be meeting next week, but we'll be back the week after because next Thursday is Thanksgiving. You can also like, you know, online, there's something called Happy Hour. So this is a Brahma Vahara in terms of working on creating good mind states, loving kindness practice every night from six to seven on Zoom is as a happy hour. And that's something to explore the, you know, if you feel up for it, Monday nights, there's a I think it's a forty five minute meditation. It's a long meditation and it's silent and not guided. So, you know, that might be a bit of a leap. Right. Sunday mornings, it's a little shorter. It's like a more of a half an hour sit. And so Sunday mornings you could come. But again, it's not guided meditation. You could try the mornings with Gil. Those are fantastic. And he's doing at seven a.m. on YouTube every morning. He does a half an hour guided meditation followed by a fifteen minute Darmette. So it's forty five minutes of meditation and wisdom by our leader Gil Bronstall. So that's on YouTube every morning. If you go to our website, you can find the YouTube channel link from there. So what's next? I hope I see you in two weeks. You know, and you can try out these other things and pace yourself according to what feels comfortable for you. And, yeah, don't you know, if you can stretch and try going, but if it doesn't work, don't give up. Come back. Come back here. You know, just like. Yeah. And there's audio Dharma. There is plenty of guided meditations and Dharma talks. And there's a lot of resources. So if you go to our website, InsightMeditationCenter.org, you find links to the calendar and the audio Dharma with all the recordings. So I bring registration, sometimes only. Well, yes, Sunday does Sunday Sunday. Yeah, Sunday does. Yeah. Yeah. But if you don't know that he's going to turn you away. Unless there's too many people here already. Yeah. Yeah. And that that can happen. Nancy manages. Did you get turned away or did they let you come in? Great. Great. Okay. So it's eight oh six. I have a dedication of merit practice. I really would like to share with you. You've done it before, which is, you know, the way that we do this practice is for the benefit of all beings without exception. That is the way we're taught to practice. So we are learning for the benefit of all ourselves included and without exception for all. It's a big thing to say all beings without exception. So what I want to invite you to do is think about a group, a person, a cause. That you are no is suffering and could benefit from our benefit, the benefit of our practice. And if you'd like to name that, maybe somebody, Nancy, you could pick up the microphone and start if you'd like to help us help our minds connect with this idea of all beings. I would like to dedicate my practice this evening to the prisoners who produce art for in our show every year. Go ahead and just pass it and you can just name or not if you don't want to. When you talk about benefit for all I am I am the name that comes to mind is Ashoka, who was a disciple of Buddha. And he had once said survey manusha Praja mama that translates to that all people are his people and it is his duty to ensure that they're all well cared for. Beautiful. Thank you. Tonight's practice. I'd like to dedicate to the Iranian protesters. They're being persecuted. Can you take it over there? Thank you. I guess two reasons for me to dedicate tonight. The practice of tonight is sincerely to everyone here for the two of you for a fantastic class. And thank you also for your assistance and everybody else here. And at a more personal level, you probably know that there was an officer involved shooting a couple days ago. So the five officers involved, I work with all of them and they were part of my unit when I was working. And I know that they're going through a difficult time. So I also hope that they're finding some peace and tranquility because they were basically doing their job. Yeah. Thank you. Mine's a simple one to my dog, Dakota. So far, I'm less stressed out and more centered. I can go on longer walks. Do you want to name anyone? I dedicate this to Miles and everybody else who are in desperate need of resources, love and support. There's so many. There's so much suffering. And I think I'm going to go in a very personal level here. I want to dedicate the practice today to my dad. So may we all hold all beings, all beings named and remembered and forgotten and unseen. May all beings benefit from our time and practice together. Thank you. Thank you guys so much. Happy Thanksgiving if you celebrate or have.
