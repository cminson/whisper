 In a few minutes I'll begin chanting the refuges. But to say a few words first, the word for refuge is sara-nam. And maybe because we're the first phase of Buddhism coming to the West, the word refuge doesn't convey all the richness of the word sara-nam. To go for refuge means partly you're going for protection. But one of the meanings of sara-nam is to have an understanding, to know something for yourself, to know suffering, and to know the absence of it, the freedom from it, to have some experience of letting go of compulsion and hatred and greed and clinging, to let go are lessened up enough to know if this is possible. And more than that it's possible that this is worthwhile, this is valuable, invaluable, this is a way of being that has a possibility of being who we are at the center of our life. If we know something, sara-nam also means an orientation, a direction that we move, values that we build our life on, priorities for, how we spend the day. Sara-nam also has qualities of devotion, something we offer our heart to or something that's heartfelt, some place that we place our heart, we place our heart in what we know and what this represents, this orientation, this way of living, all of which is a refuge, a support, an island from the tempests of this world.

May you sleep with the refuges to protect you. May you wake up in the morning supported and guided and inspired by what you know is a refuge. May your practice be a refuge for yourself and may you be a refuge for others. May we all be refuges for each other.
