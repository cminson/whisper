So we come to the fourth talk on the series labeled Consciousness, and the premise here is that what we call consciousness, or what I'm calling consciousness, we don't actually know what it is for sure, but what I call consciousness is the synchronized working together of all the different active capacities, faculties we have for attention, for perception, and they can come together also with our attitudes and our motivations and many of the cognitive functions of the mind as well. 
And it all comes together to create, and the mind creates an image or a sense of the whole that is greater than the part. 
So whole, which is partly a painting that the mind paints of what this thing is, that the whole, the unified whole, the thing that consciousness can see. 
And there's a wonderful coincidence that in Pali that the word for mind, which might easily be translated as consciousness at times, is a homonym, same pronunciation as the word for a painting. 
And so the mind, maybe consciousness, is this kind of construct that the painting the mind makes of itself that somehow brings together all the different parts into an image or a sense of something. 
And so these different capacities we have for perception, for attention, are key to these component parts, to this painting that's created, the sense that's created. 
And one of them today is, they're talking about is the ability to see, to see clearly what's happening. 
And the Buddha uses this language of seeing as a metaphor for the inner way of perceiving, the inner way of kind of sensing, knowing, that is somehow in the mind rather than in the sensations. 
So that's the kind of knowing quality of the mind that knows I'm sensing warmth, cold coolness, a sound, a taste, a smell, a tactile sensation in the body. 
But it's not so much the cognitive in the sense of recognizing what it is. 
It's not the recognition factor of the mind. 
But it's more like just the level of the mind that can just kind of do the equivalent of hearing or seeing in that hearing and seeing are different than listening and looking, in that hearing and seeing are receptive, are not directive necessarily, they're not active, engaging of those sensors, but those sensors are on and sensations, sounds or sight objects arrive and come and they are seen, they are heard, but they're not looked at, they're not listened to in an active way. 
And in both these metaphors of the hearing and seeing, I think Bill's on the idea that what is seen and what is heard is actually usually at some distance from the ears and the eyes. 
Distance could be just a few centimeters away, but still there's a gap, there's a distance. 
The medium through which the information is going through the ear and the space creates a little bit difference that's different than feeling sensations in the body, physical sensations, like we feel pain or pleasure, that there's an intimacy there to ourselves in a certain kind of way. 
And so that intimacy sometimes because of being pain or pleasure, it becomes something that we are prone to get actively involved in or concerned with or identify even with. 
But the things we see in the distance, see a tree, we don't usually identify it as being me, who I am, the tree. 
It's all about me, the tree. 
And if we hear traffic outdoors, we're not again defining ourselves by the traffic. 
We might find it uncomfortable and have a reaction to it, but the hearing itself does not react. 
That's deeper in the minds that it begins reacting and making meaning and values and preferences in there. 
But before these other layers of the mind get involved that have to do with judgments and evaluation and reactivity and preferences and emotions, there is initially this very simple and I would suggest relatively innocent act of just hearing the sounds, seeing the sights. 
And so this is translated now for the Buddha or adapted to the Buddha to talk about an inner eye and an inner way of seeing. 
And here also the idea is to do it in this receptive, non-active way. 
And so the Buddha never tells us in these instructions to do seeing with the mind's eye, the inner seeing, to do the perceiving, but rather to abide in it. 
And he uses this word abiding a lot when he's talking about deeper meditation, that when we get settled in practice in meditation and able to kind of course in the present moment, then it's more like settling back and abiding, dwelling in something, in a state, in a way of being, in a way of perceiving than it is actively trying to do something and make something happen. 
And it's a remarkable shift when that can happen. 
Some people find that they can tap into that early in their practice. 
Some people, it takes a long time. 
Some people can do it early and then they can't do it for a while because they're going through layers of leading to do some real inner work to sort through and settle down so they can settle back. 
For the Buddha, it's the latter. 
We do all the work of practice and a purification practice, a cultivation practice, a settling practice, understanding practices. 
And then with enough practice, at some point, we can just settle back and observe what's happening. 
And this is an abide in the observing, abide in this inner seeing, where everything's allowed to be itself. 
It's very respectful of everything. 
It can almost be reverential that everything's allowed to be kind of its own pristine thing, every sensation, every sound, every sight, everything that's known in this seeing can be seen with reverence or with care or with simplicity, radical simplicity, just allowing it to be itself. 
That becomes the foundation for the kind of insights that Buddha emphasizes the most. 
The insights that are part of the insight meditation path are insights that don't come from actively looking for them, but rather when we settle back and can observe and see in this kind of way that I'm talking about today. 
Now, as we see this way, the seeing is somehow free of what is seen in the sense that in the seeing, we're not entangled, we're not caught up, we're not reacting. 
And so what's being seen is clearly left alone. 
Just like seeing with the physical eye or hearing with the physical ear, we're not actively involved with looking at the tree and interfering with the tree as we're gazing upon it. 
We're not interfering with the sound of the car outside. 
It just does its thing independent of us. 
And so all things are allowed to be this way and being seen in such a way that then insights begin arising. 
And that's maybe for another time. 
But the sense that what I emphasized today is this way in which the seeing, there's a freedom in the seeing and independence in the freeing. 
There's kind of a spaciousness and allowance of things as they are in this kind of inner seeing that goes on. 
And so in that seeing is one of our attentional faculties, when seeing has this quality of freedom in it, it can give, when we construct this idea of consciousness, consciousness then begins feeling like something that's a place of freedom, a place of allowance, a space of openness, a space of receptivity. 
But in particular there can be a feeling that in consciousness itself is something we can, a place we can rest in the kind of freedom the consciousness almost can feel very broad. 
The spatial, the way that the body, the inner mind or constructs a spatial sense of awareness where it constructs spatial space, spatial ideas of location. 
And when that spatial location gets relaxed and soft, that also starts having a broad, almost boundless quality to it. 
And so the construction of consciousness can now start feeling not only as free and peaceful and broad, but it also feel untouched by the things of the world. 
But also it can feel like it's boundless and open and expensive. 
Is consciousness actually boundless? Is it actually, you know, anything at all? More than, you know, it's hard to say and there's strong opinions about this. 
But the view that I'm presenting here, that it's, yes, it's boundless in the sense that the construction, the image of it, the sense of it that the mind creates has no boundaries. 
But it's kind of a wonderful composite image, gestalt image or idea of all these wondrous faculties that we have that come back, come together and work in some kind of harmony together to give us a sense. 
And then we try to make sense of it. 
We try to understand it. 
We try to have an image of what it's operating. 
And then the mind creates that image of it all. 
So, and then we can abide in it. 
We can rest in it. 
We can allow it. 
And it can be very freeing and very supportive to have a sense of consciousness like this. 
So, I hope that this is useful for you and gives you something to reflect on and explore on your own. 
And I would encourage you for these next 24 hours to use hearing and seeing, the physical ones, and also the mind's eye, ability to see and hear and perceive, to experiment with gazing on things or hearing things in a very receptive, open, allowing way to feel the refreshment that can come, the eyes and the ears get refreshed and cooled and calmed and peaceful when they're able to just see rather than look, rather than searching, rather than straining or staring. 
And the same thing can happen to hearing when we hear rather than strain to listen or something. 
So, thank you all very much. 
And I am looking forward to coming back tomorrow morning.
