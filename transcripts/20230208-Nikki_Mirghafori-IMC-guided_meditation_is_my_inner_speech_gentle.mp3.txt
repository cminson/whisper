 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Greetings. Greetings, friends. Greetings from Mountain View, California, in Cidetoloni Land, where I am joining you in this moment in time, whether it's morning or whatever time it is in your time zone. Wonderful to be joining you and practicing together today. So we've been exploring why speech this week and we'll continue. Let's practice together. I'll give us some invitations for exploring our inner speech. And yeah, I'm excited about sharing more about this topic, this very important topic during the Dharma. So let's begin. Let's begin to sit together. Choosing a posture, an intentional posture, that is supportive for you in this moment in time. If you are sitting, you could be lying down or standing as well, but if you're sitting, allow your back to have an upright sense, a sense of integrity. As if you're sitting tall like a mountain. The integrity of your body, mirroring your inner integrity, your inner intentions for integrity. Let there be a brightness, a form that feels wholesome in your posture, but not effortful, not effortful. You might be able to imagine an invisible thread connected to the top of your head, pulling your head gently up, supporting you up invisibly. Find straightening vertebrae by vertebrae. And yet the rest of your body, the soft tissue, the muscles can relax, can relax, give their weight to the earth. Bring down, down the center of gravity that's on your body. Bringing down, down the center of gravity that's often in our head, somewhere around our head with thoughts. Bring the center of gravity of your being down through redirecting your attention down, down, down, down your face, down your neck, down your chest and your heart center, proverbial heart center. Center of the chest, place of wholeheartedness, emotions. And then continuing to move your awareness center of gravity of your being that's down through your diaphragm, your abdomen, your lower abdomen. Your lower abdomen, your sit bones. You're going to let the center of gravity be in the lower abdomen, sit bones. Maybe touching into the lower, the upper legs, lower legs and feet as well. But receiving, receiving the breath and the lower abdomen as if the body itself is an organ of perception, perceiving, receiving the breath. Knowing the breath, knowing sensations, not from the control tower of the head. You're going to let the center of gravity be in the lower abdomen. Letting the body, the heart be soft, relaxed. A bright hand, relaxed in this moment in time. If any thoughts arise, any inner speech, gently, kindly know, it's important to know. Oh, what is the tone? What is the quality of the center speech of this thought? We started with inquiry. Is it true? Is it factual? Is it even true? Is it self judgment? You're a terrible meditator or some such opinion. Is it even true? Is it even factual? The sense of humor challenging the fact of this opinion. The thought is about others. Is it divisive? Is it harmonious? Now today, especially noticing, is it gentle or is it harsh, this inner speech tone? Especially when it's directed towards ourselves. Oh, sweetheart, no need for any harsh tone. No need. Kindness, kindness. And after knowing, after the knowing the landscape of the mind, releasing, releasing. And letting the breath in the lower part of the body, the sensations of the breath. Exhale, center stage, center stage, center stage in our awareness. That's all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Is the way you're receiving the breath, you're listening to the breath, the sensations of the breath. Does it have gentleness or harshness in your listening? In your receiving of the sensations. What's the posture of the mind of the heart? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our bodies are attuning work. Paying attention by knowing what's happening in the body. We know what's present in the mind, the quality, the quality of our intention, speech, inner speech. And by calming the body with kindness, we can realign and soothe the mind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And as we bring this set to a close together, appreciating if there was just say one moment one moment of awareness and aligning with our values. Yay. Celebrating. But you've showed up. You've done your best. Letting go of outcome, non-attachment. How things should be or should have been, but appreciating yourself. Or your engagement. Recognizing the goodness for showing up. Being part of the Sangha. And together with generosity, offering our goodness, offering our best to all beings everywhere, to the world, our good intentions, our, our integrity, our kindness. May all beings everywhere, especially those who are suffering. With natural disasters right now, parts of the world, our siblings. May they have ease. May they be free from suffering. May all beings everywhere be free from suffering. May all beings everywhere be safe, happy, healthy, have ease. May all beings everywhere be free, including ourselves. You
