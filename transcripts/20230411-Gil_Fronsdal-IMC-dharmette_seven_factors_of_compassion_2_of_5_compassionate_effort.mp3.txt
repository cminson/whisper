The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So the topic of this week is the seven factors of compassion
and how these seven factors follow in the wake of compassion
that we live in a compassionate way.
And we find that in the wake of that, together with that, there comes a form of awareness, mindfulness.
There comes a quality of investigation that we do kind of distinguish.
And for compassion, we distinguish between suffering and the absence of suffering
in all the different ways that we call distress or feeling emotionally challenged
or things are difficult, that compassion is based on the recognition of suffering.
Whether it's mild or big, it's a recognition.
And that recognition involves a distinction between the suffering
and the possibility of the absence of suffering.
And so with compassionate care, there becomes a sense of awareness or attention to what's happening.
Because compassion has an object or has a way of living or a way of attending to the world.
And part of that attending is to make the nature of compassion a distinction between suffering and the absence of it.
And this is the fundamental distinction that Buddhism is about.
It lives and grows and develops and flowers out of making this distinction.
Because with this distinction, it's possible to move towards greater and greater freedom,
greater absence of suffering, freedom from suffering.
And so there is a deeper and more sensitive attention to suffering when we do this practice.
And some of the coarser suffering might go away,
but it becomes a more acute sensitivity to smaller and smaller or deeper and deeper ways.
And that's not a mistake.
That's the way of doing house cleaning, to kind of clean the house and clean things up in a sense.
With that distinction, and so all the Buddhism can be seen as arising out of the impetus to compassion.
It's so central to the whole enterprise of Buddhism, the whole religion of Buddhism.
And sometimes that compassion takes the form of kindness and friendliness.
Or they're kind of part of a mixture of care.
And so sometimes it's not exactly compassion that's in the forefront,
but kindness, friendliness, a sense of care for people, for ourselves.
As this unfolds, then we see the distinction between suffering and the absence of it.
Then comes effort, comes the desire to do something, to make a change.
So from this guided meditation we did, the change there that was emphasized was that becoming calmly aware.
So we can suffer, and we can just kind of suffer unapologetically,
just be living in the suffering, really kind of captivated by our suffering, fully inhabiting it.
Or we could, in a sense, step away from it and be aware of it calmly.
It involves a little bit of disidentification with the suffering, like it's my suffering and I'm suffering,
but to step away and say, oh, there's suffering here.
And to calmly be aware.
And then that calm awareness, to see it more clearly.
And one of the things we see, we see that they're suffering,
and there's something which is not suffering so much, the calm awareness.
That's an important distinction.
And with that distinction, we then were able to choose more often that which is not suffering, the calm awareness.
It's not getting rid of the suffering, it's not, it's still there.
It's not fixing it, it's not condemning it, it's not ignoring it.
But it was meeting it from a place where we're not identified with it, or we're not kind of glued to it.
And this is a powerful thing of compassion, this ability to see clearly and calmly.
If the compassion is not calm, it might not really be compassion.
It might be distress that we're feeling.
So the importance of finding that calm place is not easy to do, but it's worthwhile to do, and it's possible to do.
And maybe for some of us, the easiest place might be in the mindfulness itself, in the awareness itself.
So the mindfulness factor of compassion.
With the mindfulness factor of compassion, we see these distinctions better between suffering and the absence of it.
We see kind of a distinction there, just with that, as we start seeing this distinction and the possibility of being without suffering,
then comes the effort, the effort factor of compassion.
The engagement, the activity of moving towards or coming close to or giving ourselves over to that place where there is less suffering.
To do that, which decreases the suffering.
And if we kind of build on what's happening already, the place of less suffering is not getting rid of the suffering,
but is a heightened capacity for attention.
Awareness can kind of blossom, become stronger while the suffering is there.
And maybe the suffering doesn't get any better, but mindfulness, awareness gets stronger, which creates a very different context.
As awareness gets stronger, then maybe we can identify or live more in the awareness than we live in the suffering.
So it's a very significant thing to say, that the suffering doesn't have to go away.
It's being replaced in a sense, or the ecology of the mind-heart is being changed,
but we're bringing in something that's stronger or larger or more significant to be next to it, or be part of it, or be around it.
And that's the capacity to be aware, to wake up to the middle of it.
And to be able to shift the paradigm from needing to get rid of suffering to becoming bigger than the suffering,
or become resting in a place where it's peaceful to look on the suffering.
That's a radical thing to do.
That's living the investigation factor, the distinction factor of compassion.
And then the natural effort to engage, to activity, to keep practicing, to do something about it.
So yesterday I used the example of a little girl who's got hurt on the playground with a scraped knee,
and there's compassion in the adult who's going to care for her.
And of course the adult puts effort into care for the child.
It brings the mandate, brings the water to clean the wound, and does it very carefully,
and the engagement is one of care and love, but it is engagement, it is effort being put in.
But that effort doesn't feel like work.
The compassion is a motivating force for a relaxed, easy, maybe in a certain kind of way, a non-self-centered effort.
And effort does here to make things better.
And part of the difficulty people have with the concept of effort is some people make effort
which has suffering embedded in it.
They're straining, they're pushing, they're expecting, they're anxious, they're disappointed, they're hesitant,
they feel hopeless in the effort.
So then we come back to this whole compassion.
Well, there's the suffering.
Be mindful, suffering is in the effort itself.
And part of the reason to make effort is to discover how the effort is off.
And then to see that distinction, and then in the seeing of it begin kind of finding a way, engaging in a process,
engaging the effort to find effort that is calm, find effort that is engaged, but not agitated.
Find effort which is engaged in doing what needs to be done, but has no strain in it.
That's caring, that's loving, that's present.
So the suggestion is that this is natural in the wake of compassion, in the wake of caring,
feeling a sense of care for something, in the wake of kindness, feeling kindness for something,
in the wake of love, feeling love for something, that there is starting to make distinctions,
the investigation factor, and from that comes a certain kind of effort.
So the big efforts would be to go out and save the world, to go out and really try to help someone who's suffering.
That's a beautiful thing to do, an important thing to do,
but maybe as a way of kind of really discovering the compassion-informed effort
that includes compassion for oneself, compassion for the very effort we make,
maybe today we should not be in a hurry to be compassionate for the world,
but have the compassion really be towards yourself, to these factors, not even to yourself,
but to the particular ways in which your mind, heart, are operating in the way that you're aware.
Are you aware in a way that's stressful, or demanding, or expectant, or can you be aware in a calm way?
Are you making distinctions? Are you seeing the challenges you have?
But building on that challenges, are you judging yourself and being upset with things?
Or can you find a way to see that making simple distinctions between suffering and the absence of it really is a path to freedom?
And then as you engage in this practice, and practice with all this, the effort part,
have compassion or care for that, can you recognize there where there's strain and suffering?
To do this, very personal work sets the stage for bringing a healthy form of compassion into the world and for others.
So we're laying down the foundation here.
So, thank you.
And I'll be here for the week at the IRC, so I'm happy to be here.
As I said yesterday, I think I look forward to the chance to show you the meditation hall on maybe the last day here.
We can zoom out a little bit and scan it for you to see what's here.
So, thank you.
