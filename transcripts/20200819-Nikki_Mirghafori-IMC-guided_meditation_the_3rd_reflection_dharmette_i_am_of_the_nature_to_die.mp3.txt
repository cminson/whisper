The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Greetings, Sangha. I hope you are safe and well wherever in the world you are.
Wonderful to join you and to be joined by so many of you in this moment
to practice together. So we're going to continue our exploration
of the five reflections, five recollections that the Buddha suggested
that all practitioners, whether lay or monastics, practice every day.
And what we have been doing this week is to explore each of the reflections
one by one each day. So today is the third day.
And it's time for the third reflection, which has to do with our own mortality.
Just like everyone, I am subject to death. I have not gone beyond death.
So contemplating or making peace or accepting or facing,
being mindful of our own mortality as many benefits can align us with our own values,
realizing how short this precious life is, some vegas, spiritual urgency can arise,
and many other benefits. I'll talk about them in the Dharma afterwards.
So for the guided meditation this morning, what we will do similar to the previous couple of days,
we will start by settling into the body, mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of the breath,
to invite the mind to settle a little bit.
And then we are going to drop in the reflections, and we will drop in all three reflections.
We will drop in the first one, the second one, and then spend more time with the third one,
which is the focus of our practice, our exploration today together.
And again, just to repeat, to remind us the way we will drop in these reflections is not so much to
think about them as we drop them in, but as if we were dropping a pebble into a body of water,
letting it reverberate, when the waters have become calm and receptive
to really feeling the reverberations, to be more sensitive to the reverberations.
So I would like to invite you to get into your meditation posture.
If you need to set up straight a little more to have a sense of integrity, of sitting up,
more upright, more awake and more alert, or perhaps you need to lie down.
This is what the body is asking you right now to do, or to soften and relax.
Whatever is appropriate for you, check into the body and see what the body needs in this moment.
Ah, arriving, arriving in this moment.
Arriving, arriving in this body, in this moment in time.
Landing, landing in the body.
Landing in the sensations of this body, this body.
Alive and breathing.
And breathing, breathing, allowing the breath to move through the body, softening, relaxing.
As if the breath were moving in every part of the body.
Awakening and livening, bringing more energy, vitality, aliveness.
And also softening and relaxing.
Feeling the breath invited, the in-breath and the out-breath and the abdomen.
And livening, bringing more energy, more awakeness, more alertness.
And also softening and relaxing.
As the abdomen receives the breath, each breath, feeling more settled, more present.
Receiving the breath in the chest.
Allowing more awareness to be receiving the breath in the chest, the sensations.
Perhaps there is more aliveness energy and also more relaxation than ease.
They are not opposites.
Energy and aliveness and relaxation, softness can happily coexist.
Inviting, inviting the breath to be received in your neck and shoulders.
More ease and softness.
The breath received, felt, opened up to in your face, softening your jaw.
Relaxing the forehead.
Feeling more present.
In your face, in your hand, softer, the eyes, relaxing, resting in their socket.
Feeling the ease with which the breath is received, moves.
Inviting your arms, your hands to soften.
And also feel energized, alert and awake, as if the breath was moving through them, opening them up.
Every cell to aliveness, to sensation.
As if you are a pop-up doll that was deflated, becoming more full with the breath.
In your hands, your arms, all the cells getting nourished, the sense of presence, alertness, awareness.
Breathed into, awareness breathed into every cell of your body.
Moving back down, feeling the chest, the backside, the upper back, the lower back, the abdomen.
And your sit bones touching the cushion, the chair, filled with the breath, with awareness, more enlivened.
Maybe even feeling the tingling, as well as the sense of letting go, relaxing, being soft.
Moving down, letting the upper legs receive the breath, the knees, the lower legs and the feet connected to the earth.
Feeling the sensations, the legs and the feet.
More alert, more awake, more alive, as they're touched by awareness.
Receiving life-giving breath.
Allowing the whole body to receive the breath.
It's not so much that you are breathing, no need to make it effortful into a project, just letting the body breathe as it knows how to do.
And all they're doing that you do is just to be aware, just to receive, have a receptive attitude.
We'll spend a few minutes in silence, with mindfulness immersed in the body, every part of the body and the breath.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I would like to invite us now to drop in the first reflection into the body, not to think about it.
But as I say it out loud, let us drop it in like a pebble, feel the reverberations and just sit with what arises, or if nothing.
First reflection, just like everyone, just like everyone. I am subject to aging. I have not gone beyond it.
Just like everyone, I am of the nature to age. I have not gone beyond aging.
And now the second contemplation, let's drop that in. Just like everyone, I am subject to sickness.
I have not gone beyond sickness. I am of the nature to sicken. It is inevitable.
Now the third contemplation, which we are introducing today in our community practice, just like everyone, I am of the nature to die.
I am subject to death. I have not gone beyond death. It is inevitable.
Letting yourself be rooted, stable in the body with the breath.
And if ruminations arise, bowing to them, offering them up, letting them go for this reflection, maybe just dropping in the reflection one more time.
It's just sitting with it, or sitting with silence. Just like everyone, I am, I am of the nature to die.
I have not gone beyond death. It is inevitable.
Letting yourself be rooted, stable in the body with the breath.
Letting yourself be rooted, stable in the body with the breath.
Letting yourself be rooted, stable in the body with the breath.
Letting yourself be rooted.
Letting yourself be rooted.
I am of the nature to die.
It is inevitable.
And for the last moments of this practice period together in silence, I would like to invite us to hold ourselves with care and kindness.
For whatever arose or did not arise during this practice period without judgment.
Whether there were a lot of emotions, or a lot of thinking, or if you fell asleep, it's all okay.
You've aligned your intentions with your actions, showing up doing your best.
Now without attachment to outcome, which is born of many causes and conditions, offering yourself appreciation, friendliness and kindness.
Appreciating your own goodness, your intentions.
And collectively let us offer, share whatever goodness is generated from our reflecting together on our impermanence, on our human condition.
May it support us in our awakening, and may it support all beings in their awakening, freedom, happiness and ease.
Thank you.
Thank you for listening again to everyone, wherever you are in the world right now, listening or perhaps listening after this recording.
So today we turn our attention to the third contemplation about our mortality.
And in particular, I think it might be a little more challenging perhaps than the other two, and the first two, about old age and sickness, because in many ways we experience aging, we feel our body change and shift whatever age we're at.
We are more in tune in touch with the shifting nature of our bodies and sickness.
Of course we all experience sickness, childhood, adulthood, cold.
So we have a visceral feeling we're in touch with the experience of sickness.
Death, however, we don't have a firsthand experience with this body dying until it happens, and then we're not here to contemplate, so it's more of a stretch.
We may have experience with other people dying, loved ones, people we care about, or if we're in professions who we are in touch with, with death.
However, to contemplate our own, for our own ego to contemplate its own demise is really challenging, and their psychological resistance actually to doing it.
And one way this is beautifully captured in a story in the Hindu epic Mahabharata, where the wise person, Yudhisthira, is asked,
what is the most amazing thing in all life? And the wise person answers that a human seeing others die all around him never thinks he will die.
It's pretty amazing.
In many ways, we know we're going to die. Yes, we know, of course, we're going to die, but knowing, knowing that we're going to die.
And this observation that Yudhisthira made is actually very crucial, this observation.
It's an amazing observation because humans, we are intelligent, irrational creatures, and yet we live our lives as if we're going to live forever.
Maybe again, we know we're going to die, but we live as if we're going to never die.
Oh, it's going to happen. It's going to happen way, way, way sometime in the future. Oh, not now.
And again, excuse me, really sitting with this practice right now, the time of the pandemic.
It's, it's more profound. It's these reflections are more profound and especially now to share with you in Northern California. And I see many people also commenting on on YouTube.
They're a war. They're a wildfires where I'm sitting. I'm smelling smoke right now as I was guiding the meditation. There was a fire truck. There are ambulances driving outside. We never know. We never know.
We never know.
So with this contemplation, they're making peace, observing, contemplating, knowing, facing our own mortality has many benefits.
And as some of you already know, this topic Mara Nasati, mindfulness of death is one of my favorite topics to teach about and I've taught the retreats, seven day retreats, daylongs, various lectures.
So if any of you are more interested on audio Dharma, there's a lot more resources available and also on my website and on mindfulness of death.
So just to say a couple of things to support our practice with this reflection today, which I like to invite you to really take with you close all day today.
One of the benefits is that making face and our mortality, as I mentioned earlier referred to, it brings up what's called Samvega, which is spiritual urgency.
So the sense of life is short. How do I want to spend my life?
As the Buddha says, the days and nights are relentlessly passing. How well am I spending my time? The days and nights are relentlessly passing. How well am I spending my time?
And research suggests that even though we may have certain goals and values the way we want to live our lives, but we actually end up spending a lot of time, excuse me, a lot of time doing things.
For example, watching television or surfing the web or things that are not exactly aligned, not proportional.
We spend an ordinate amount of time on things that are not aligned with our values. Spending some time to relax, of course, it all makes sense.
And this problem is called a misalignment problem, that the way we live our lives tends to be misaligned with our values.
The way we show up, maybe an important value for us is generosity of heart, letting go. Maybe an important value is kindness to others.
And maybe that's not how we show up, but if we realize our time is short and we really don't know when we're going to die, that yes, we are going to die.
Of course, I'm of the nature to die and don't know when it's going to happen. We have no idea. We might have images assuming we'll be whatever in our hundred, twenty years old on our deathbeds.
But who knows? Who knows? Who knows really? Really, deeply, deeply, who knows? Living this with a don't know mind.
To support us, to waking up, to support us, to live more fully, more presently, this precious, precious human life, so this reflection can really awaken us into our preciousness.
The preciousness of our lives right here, right now, and also to make peace with what is going to happen.
So when we are on our deathbeds or in an accident, there is not a sense of horror. We can actually be calm and approach this experience with awe, with mystery.
We have no idea. There might be something. There might be nothing. It might be beautiful. It may not be. We just don't know.
But if your mind is calm and free, expecting the inevitable, it's a gift. It's the ultimate gift that you're giving yourself and your loved ones also because you allow them not to have to take care of you and your fear and your terror.
And similarly, if you've made peace, if you face your own mortality, then you can really support your loved ones in their passing because they don't have to take care of you.
They don't have to emotionally support you and be worried about you. They can have a sense of peace. You offer them a sense of peace to be in their own process of transitioning.
Whatever it might be. Don't know mind. Really holding it with a don't know mind. No expectations.
So this reflection, this third reflection is we can spend days, weeks, months, years with just this reflection as a practice towards waking up.
Mara Nasati, there are many specific practices for mindfulness of death towards waking up.
So for today, with this topic, my invitation is that we embrace it.
We embrace this reflection as an enlivening as one that actually supports us in our waking up, waking up during life and also waking up during the moment of death to be prepared for it, to let go gracefully into death and perhaps into deathless.
There are teachings about waking up to the deathless, to nibbana, that's another word for it, another translation. Deathless is another translation of waking up nibbana awakening in the moment of death.
So this is a very rich contemplation and the invitation today is to keep this reflection close with you.
Both feel your sense of aliveness, vitality and I am of the nature to die, to sense that you are going to die, you've not gone beyond it and when and how it happens.
You have no idea, but one thing is for certain, we're all going to die and it's just part of life.
It's part of the grace, the mystery, the impermanence of being human, coming, offering our gifts to the world, offering our gifts of awakening to this being that we're the steward of and then passing on.
So keep this reflection alive with you, feeling your aliveness and also the mortality as Carlos Castaneda says, keep death on your shoulder as a wise advisor.
And today maybe you will choose to have a memento mori, actually, you can simply take a post-it and write, you're going to die or I am of the nature to die, I have not gone beyond it.
It's inevitable. Whatever words work for you and put the post-it somewhere and you can see your fridge, your monitor, your bathroom mirror really bring this reflection in with you.
It is so important this reflection. It's been a major part of my practice, Buddhist practice, mindfulness of death and I bring it into my reflection into my life every day and I feel most alive, most aligned with my values when I'm aware of my own mortality.
That time is short and I have no idea when I'm going to pass. So this is a challenging, juicy, wonderful practice and I'm so grateful that you're joining all of us today, the whole Sangha in taking this practice with you.
So it's 745 and I have one question for those who are still here, I'll ask again tomorrow. There is an option to have a group conversation on Zoom on Friday after the last, after the fifth contemplation for us to discuss these contemplations together in community and meet.
And I would be happy to host that if there is interest. So if you may be interested in discussing these contemplations and delving in them a little more with others, please indicate that in the YouTube chat, say I'm interested so that I just get a sense of how much interest there might be to host one or not.
May you be well, may you be safe and may you have freedom and be awake.
