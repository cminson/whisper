The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
I'm going to turn on the recording. Here we go.
And as always, I'd like to acknowledge Neil for posting information about the Happy Hour Google Groups in chat.
If you're new to Happy Hour, it's a web, it's a web, it's a mailing list that we have and information about Happy Hour resources, references are shared there.
And you can also connect to, to each other. So.
So, let's begin. Hi. Hi, formally. Hi. Welcome. Hello. Hello, everyone.
It's good to be with you in, in, if not space, but at least time to see you and to feel your presence.
So for today's practice, what I'd like to invite us to engage with today is the practice of forgiveness.
Practice of forgiveness. I've mentioned it before here. We've practiced with it before, but there's a particular type of forgiveness I'd like to invite us to engage with today practice with.
And, and often the practice of forgiveness is the different aspects dimensions to it. One is forgiving ourselves.
The other aspect, the other dimension is forgiving others.
The third is forgive asking forgiveness from others.
And the fourth one, which is a very interesting and perhaps in a way symbolic or maybe I would say it's a wisdom practice.
Is offering forgiveness to causes and conditions to circumstances for the way they are for are not being able to meet the suffering of the world, forgiving the world, forgiving just the sense of general forgiveness.
It's, it's quite a deep and beautiful, beautiful practice.
Let me read the phrase actually we're going to focus on this one and this actually this way of putting it is due to Larry Yang to give him credit.
So the phrase is, in any way that I have been unable to be with and respond skillfully to the pain and suffering of our world, my own pain, and that of others.
May I come to accept suffering, confusion, pain, ignorance to be part of the journey, my own journey and the journey of others.
I offer forgiveness for the way that things are and have been as much as possible in this moment.
It's quite a radical way to do forgiveness practice.
It's not, it's, you know, it's beautiful, of course, to, to ask for forgiveness saying any way that I've harmed you knowingly, unknowingly by thought actions words, I asked for your forgiveness.
This is a phrase when we ask for forgiveness or offering forgiveness to ourselves or offering it to others.
In this fourth way, which is such a radical way of offering forgiveness to the causes and conditions in the world, that this is the way things are.
This is the way things arise to my pain, my suffering, and the pain and suffering of others to offer forgiveness, acceptance, release judgment for the cause and conditions as they are.
Especially as these days, there is global turmoil and there is global pain. So many of our siblings in this world are living now in a war zone.
Of course, there are many wars at any time going on and people living under oppression, and especially now, especially now in the world stage.
So can we, can we bring, can we relate? I mean, practice of compassion is one way to relate to what is happening. And we've done that the past few days, past few times in happier and this radical, radical practice of forgiveness is another way.
This radical forgiveness might be completely new to you. You might have practiced in this way. All good. Let's explore together. Let's see what arises.
Forgiving the cause and conditions responsible that have come to co-create the conditions of the world for our own suffering, our inability to engage, and other people's suffering.
So it's a radical practice of, of forgiveness. There is both the wisdom practice, coming together with compassion practice, the marriage of both.
So, so without further ado, I'd like to invite us to engage with this practice together. As always, we start, we start by landing, by arriving in our bodies, this moment in time to let go of the words and just to arrive.
Here, here.
Connecting with the breath, connecting with the body, releasing preoccupations and tanglements.
Just taking refuge with the breath, the body, inviting the mind, the heart to settle.
Thank you.
Letting go, letting go of thoughts, of plans past, future present, relaxing, releasing into the body.
Arriving, arriving more fully.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Releasing, releasing, thoughts, plans, preoccupations.
Not with the push, but offering up, offering up, relinquishing, relinquishing.
With heart, with love, with dedication to this moment of cultivation.
Thank you, dear thoughts. I'll come back to you later. Please come visit another time.
Right now I'll give you up for the benefit of this cultivation.
Returning, returning, spaciously, kindly, relaxedly to the breath, the body.
Feeling, feeling the heart center. Connected, connecting.
Connected.
Can this moment of solitude, of silence be nourishing to this heart, this mind, this body?
To resource oneself, this being who is me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And as we rest, as we rest with the breath and the body, opening up, can we open up our hearts?
Sphere of awareness with kindness.
As if aware with compassionate awareness, this wide, wide field, field of experience, awareness,
that can hold our own challenge, our own suffering, and those of the world.
Not full on, not directed, but diffused, just diffused. Awareness diffused with kindness, with compassion.
As if our awareness is water.
And there is a dropper, dropper, few drops of compassion diluted in this awareness.
Holding everything, holding everything.
Holding our bodies, thoughts, internally, externally, whatever is arising.
Moistening, moistening the heart, moistening the heart with compassion.
And now if you wish, dropping in, not forcing, but dropping in this phrase of radical forgiveness,
read it and first let it wash over you. See what resonates.
In any way that I have been unable to be with and to respond skillfully to the pain and suffering of our world, my own pain and that of others.
May I come to accept suffering, confusion, ignorance to be part of the journey, to be part of the journey.
My own journey and the journey of others.
I offer forgiveness for the way that things are and have been as much as is possible in this moment.
I offer forgiveness for the way that things are and have been as much as is possible in this moment.
I offer forgiveness for the way that things are and have been offering as much as is possible, not forcing.
Thank you.
In any way that I have been unable to be with and to respond skillfully to the pain and suffering of our world, my own pain and that of others.
May I come to accept it to be part of the journey, my own journey and the journey of others.
I offer forgiveness for the way that things are and have been as much as is possible in this moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Or have the illusion of it, sometimes offering forgiveness of everything that has led to this, as much as possible.
You
You
Know that it takes courage and strength to forgive
It's not out of weakness that we forgive we engage with forgiveness
It's from a place of strength
Courage, letting go, wisdom and compassion that we engage with forgiveness
You
You
You
And if they're challenging states in the mind right now
And the body pain boredom
Distraction, can you offer forgiveness to the causes and conditions for that?
You
You
And if there are an army of self judgment such meant says self judgmental thoughts arising
Can you offer forgiveness to that?
You
You
Even though I may wish for things to be different says how they are right now
They offer forgiveness to how things are as much as possible in this moment
You
Notice if there's a sense of release freedom letting go not hanging on
That feels a lighter more ease arises
You
You
You
You
You
As we bring this practice period to a close notice
Notice if there has been any moment of release of letting go
Of holding on resentment or a sense of strength, wisdom
Feeling empowered
And letting go
And offering together we offer all these moments of release goodness
Personal and transcendent freedom collectively for the benefit of all beings everywhere including ourselves
May all beings be free
May all beings including ourselves be free
Thank you for your practice friends
So
So much can come up in this practice. It's a bit of a perhaps complicated practice
I see Richard's hand shut up. What's up Richard?
How you're done
Um, I don't see how you can blame nature and since you can't blame nature
I don't seems irrational to forgive nature
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, it's it's not so much nature in this way
It's yeah, this feels like a paradoxical practice in a way
It's let me put it this way many times
When we are in a state of ignorance, we're angry at the causes and conditions in the world like
Oh, we take them personally, right? We take causes and conditions
Personally, so it's not nature. I would shift your the word with causes and conditions
We take it personally and we're angry
And this way of relating to this practice opens up the the possibility of wisdom actually seeing
The codependent arising of the causes and conditions and not take it personally
It's really a way to enter into that practice through
The forgiveness practice. There's so many ways to practice for to enter into this wisdom
Of seeing causes and conditions as impersonal. They just are
And this is one way it might work for you. It may not work for you
It may not work for you, but it's a way to enter into this practice in this way
Thanks, Richard
And let's see a request to paste Larry's phrase on the chat. Let's see sometimes
Chat has a limited size. I'm going to try that and if it doesn't come through here we go. Let's try
Oh, I think it all came through. Look at that
And then Bill says I'm aware that resentment is unhealthy
But part of me still wants to cling to it to not forgive. It's difficult to let go. Yeah. Yes
I so appreciate
belly sharing that and and the
Authenticity and vulnerability and saying that because that
is part of
The process of letting go it's part of the process of forgiveness. It doesn't happen overnight
Often first we realize like okay. I'm not ready to let go. I'm I want to hang on to this even though
I know it hurts me. I don't I'm not quite ready. It's okay. The fact that you're observing
and realizing that
See it clearly have kindness towards yourself that part of you that is very hurt
Or upset and can you have kind can you have kindness? Can you have?
Kindness towards that part that is held that is hurting. It's like you're
Um
It's it's likened
to
The story of in asia in order to catch a monkey it is said that that
Catchers poachers take an empty coconut. They put a hole in it and they put something
yummy inside and
And as the the poor animal reaches inside and grabs something yummy
The fist you know can't set itself free anymore. That's that's the trap
if
If the animal lets go opens its hand then it can open the hand and be set free
But the fist the fist so get to see
Get to see that the fist is keeping you
You trapped and just have kindness have kindness towards not being able to let go
Slowly slowly slowly
Let's see
Hilda says I noticed that when I focused on forgiving gratitude followed soon after
Gratitude for the learning opportunity through difficulty. How beautiful. Thank you for sharing that hilda so connected
Yeah, these these practices so connected
Uh private question
Okay, thank you. Can you point to more teachings about how not to take things personally? Oh
That is a bigger container
That's basically pointing to the teachings so many teachings, but but that's really um
the teachings on
Impersonality or not self or anata. It's impersonal things are so impersonal and the way to see
Impersonality, there's so many different ways, but one way
As I was talking about it this morning at 7 a.m
I'm subbing for gill this week is through the practice of seeing impermanence
Through seeing arising and passing away. They all things are impermanent internally externally and that's one way
through seeing
Impersonality and not taking things personally and there are many many other teachings. So that's what I point you to it's
It's a whole canon of teachings on that, but that's a little pointer here
Yeah, and uh one more reflection I share before we turn
Richard on youtube says thank you for sharing
The light of this practice. It was very healing to me as I sat in the space
And stillness at the end of the day. I found I had been avoiding pain both
my own
my own and
Of the world and yet in this forgiveness able to hold it hold in kindness all of it the fullness
Of being beautiful. Thank you for that reflection beautiful at the end of the day sitting in this stillness
Turning towards the pain and seeing that it's possible to hold it
In the fullness of being and kindness beautiful
So
So
Holding it all with kindness
holding
our pain those of others
And um and before we turn to small groups
uh Kristen
messaged me personally that
Her grandma's secret
Passed away last weekend so so holding holding with meta and compassion all
beings ourselves and others
Are suffering their suffering
People who are near dear to us people who we don't know in war zones
And sending compassion and meta to all beings
In their suffering including
uh
Kristen her family and her grandma
Who's passed away so
So with that let us turn to each other
to small groups a small sangha to hold each other with
With care with compassion
And i'd like to um
Invite us today to start with 15 seconds of silent
uh silent compassion for ourselves for each other
and then
You can share as much as you wish
As little as you wish maybe holding witness is what's
Appropriate for you and please take care of yourself take care of others
In the small groups it's a very tender space
What is shared is always private is always confidential
It's actually double confidentiality not only do you not speak out or blurt out what someone has shared
uh even
Speaking back in the group saying oh you said blah blah blah like no no no no just be with your own experience
Speak from your own experience. Please not about other people's experience
And if if you notice if there's any
Feeling of lack of safety and that's happening. Please kindly remind each other that yeah this please stay with let's let's stay with our own experience
Take care of yourself
Take care of each other stay with your own experience
Confidentiality is important. In fact double confidentiality not only do you not say it to even to them
In the group, but of course outside you never speak share anything that you spoke with you
the
Things that people spoke to you and you don't even bring it out outside with them. Oh you said that thing that day
No, it's just speak from your own experience
I feel the need to remind all of us of these ways of taking care of ourselves
Each other as community agreements as we enter the tender space
Of the small groups. Okay
So please take care of yourselves
Take care of each other
and enjoy
Okay, everybody's back welcome back everyone and we have a couple of minutes for any reflections
You'll like to share what came up in the groups any insights that came up
um
Yeah, you can raise your hand please
And I would love to hear from you, especially if you haven't shared in a while would love to hear from you or if
If you know you can also type in chat, of course as always either privately or to everyone
What came up? What did you notice?
For the benefit of yourself and others any insights aha moments
moments
Melissa
Hello, thank you to the sangha and to you niki for tonight. I just wanted to share that in my experience of
forgiving the causes and conditions I felt that
perhaps I'm worthy of forgiveness too
and the sort of universal nature of that
forgiveness and compassion
Kind of let me in the gate
So thank you very much
Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful insight, Melissa
Thank you
So happy and honored that this practice opened up
Something for you and that you also offered your insight for the benefit of others
Made be made support them. Thank you. It's so beautiful
Thank you, Melissa
Sheila, please
Good evening as I shared with
In my group, I took the eight precepts today as I usually do on the
new moon
and
I was wound up killing a net
and it really kind of bothered me and has bothered me all day long and
I think
This particular meditation really helped settle me down
about that experience
So thank you
Thank you, Sheila. I am so touched. I am moved
Just the tender, the tender beauty and sensitivity of your Sheila, of your ethics
of taking the eight precepts of our today on the new moon and just
It's beautiful to be
to be bothered
Right? There's a beauty to that and as of course there is
There is the what's called hiri and what tapah. There's this beauty of oh gosh, I don't want to harm
I don't want to harm and yet it can go too far to become self-harmed and that's what I'm hearing you so I both honor the beauty of that intention
And all you also see and appreciate you're naming. Oh, yeah. Well, actually it was a little self-painful and
Ah, it's it's wonderful to afford forgiveness to myself too as well as all beings and the cause and conditions to that led to this accidental harm
So, thank you. That was so beautiful. Thank you, Sheila. And last word we gave to Catherine. I realized I actually don't fully know how forgiveness feels or function
Functions in me so grateful to have that shown to me. I feel they're really beautiful
You don't fully know how forgiveness feels or function functions in me so grateful to have that shown to me
I feel there will be healing and that exploration. Oh, that is beautiful. Thank you Catherine such a beautiful insight and and and
Way forward onward leading all our practices as we support each other
It's onward leading. So thank you all. Thank you so much for your practice
And showing up supporting yourself each other all beings may all beings be well may all beings be free including ourselves
Thank you
Stop there
