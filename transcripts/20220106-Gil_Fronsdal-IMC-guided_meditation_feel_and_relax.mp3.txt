The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So warm greetings for all of you.
And happy to share this time together and meditate together.
And let's explore the Dharma. For me, when I teach, it's always in exploration.
And perhaps for you also, as you hear teachings that you make at your own exploration of discovery.
And one of the opportunities, especially when the teachings about meditation is while they're being taught,
is to see it as an exploration of your present moment experience.
A discovery of now, here, this.
So maybe a little bit simplistically, there are two great movements in Buddhist practice, especially in relationship to meditation.
And that is, there is the movement of cultivation, developing ourselves.
And then there's a movement of letting go.
And sometimes one is emphasized more than the other.
And one way to think of them is that they are practiced together in balance.
That they're not so far from each other. They work together.
Maybe in the way the front and the back side of the hand work together.
And at the beginning of doing Satipatana mindfulness practice,
it's the practice of establishing awareness with the breathing.
And this is part of the cultivation part to establish.
And it's creating a foundation, a basis, like the cornerstones that you're going to use to build a building.
So the idea of establishing awareness here,
so awareness can be used to bring careful attention to particular areas of our life.
And it's not like a one-time thing, like you sit down and establish it.
And rather it's re-established over and over again.
And kind of commonly in English, we might talk about the mind wandering off and then bringing it back while we're meditating.
And I don't know if that's the best kind of instructions or metaphor for meditation. It might be fine.
But I prefer the idea that awareness becomes lost or caught up in thoughts.
And then it's re-established. We root it back here.
So it's rooted so that it has a basis.
It's connected, reconnected to here, established.
And the first instructions is establishing mindfulness, establishing awareness.
And then mindfully breathing in and mindfully breathing out.
And I like the word awareness as an alternative to mindfulness.
So with awareness, breathing in, with awareness, breathing out.
Establishing awareness and breathing in, breathing out.
And then as we breathe in and breathing out, sometimes I like to think of the inhale as being the place we establish awareness.
Where we cultivate attention, where we develop some concentration with the breathing.
And the exhale is where we let go.
So the inhale is for cultivation and the exhale is for letting go.
And by letting go, you know, every exhale, we don't have to be at war with our thinking mind.
But it's because every few seconds we would have an opportunity to let go of it.
And return to feeling and sensing ourselves aware of the body.
So assuming a meditation posture.
And giving some care that it's an intentional posture, there's some intentionality.
So in a sense, through the posture, there is a kind of an awareness, an attentiveness to the body.
And whatever way is easy for you, makes sense for you.
Establish awareness here in this body.
And then taking a few long, slow, deep breaths.
Connecting to the body as you inhale.
And relaxing the body as you exhale.
Breathing in deep.
So there's kind of a global awareness of the body expanding as you breathe in.
And this global awareness of the body relaxing as you exhale.
And then letting the breathing return to normal.
And as you inhale, connect to the parts of the body that I'll direct you to.
And in the exhale, relax that part of your body.
So in the inhale to feel your face.
In the exhale to relax your face.
Eyes, cheeks, nose, the mouth.
As you inhale, feeling your shoulders.
On the exhale, relaxing the shoulders.
On the inhale, feeling, sensing, experiencing your belly, permissively allowing it to be as it is.
And on the exhale, relaxing the belly.
Maybe allowing the belly to stay relaxed as you inhale.
Or you can feel your body, the more access you have to the body's ability to relax.
Or the beginning of meditation for you to help it relax.
And now find a place in your body where it's easiest or most compelling to establish awareness with breathing.
With how the body experiences breathing.
To be at the movements of the belly, the movements of your chest, the sensations of air going in and out through your nostrils.
The tip of the nose or top of the lip.
And then as you inhale, feel that better, sense, and each time as if it's for the first time.
Let yourself experience the inhale in the body.
And on the exhale, let go of your thoughts.
On the exhale, relax gently.
And all be gentle.
Not being ambitious.
But being protected a little bit for letting go.
On the exhale, however much you can relax and let go.
So there's a rhythm, feeling the body breathing as you inhale.
And as you exhale, letting go, relaxing.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.

And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.

And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And as you exhale, let go.
And then as we come to the end of the sitting,
maybe consider what is the foundation for you that supports kindness.
What within you is a place that's a basis, an origin or a support,
for your ability to be friendly, kind, caring.
Is there some physical location in your body that you associate with such a foundation or support?
And if there is or you think there is, breathe with that place.
Perhaps as you exhale, relax into that basis, that place in your body.
And as you inhale, imagine that as the chest expands,
that your kindness spreads out beyond you into the world.
Your goodwill.
And as you expand your goodwill out into the world,
maybe to give voice to the generosity of heart.
Giving voice, maybe repeating these words.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.
And may this meditation community of ours know that together
we go into the world with goodwill.
May all beings spread goodwill throughout this globe.
