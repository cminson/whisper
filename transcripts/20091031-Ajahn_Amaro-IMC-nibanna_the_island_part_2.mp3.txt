So welcome to Saturday afternoon. 
And it was just a question that was being asked about the copies of this book. 
We brought down 60 copies, assuming that would be about the number of people here today. 
But if you wish to get a copy, if you didn't get one today, and you would like to have a copy of your own, either come to Berkeley next Tuesday, because I come down first Tuesday of every month and give a talk in Berkeley. 
So if you dust across the bay, across the Great Water, then the Berkeley Buddhist Monastery on Tuesday will bring more copies down then. 
Or you can brave the drive all the way up to a Biogiri Monastery, up in Mendocino County. 
You're welcome to come up and visit there. 
Or if you can't manage either of that, then we can mail you one. 
But just write to the monastery and ask for a copy and then we'll send you one. 
Yes. 
And you can access it online. 
There's a free download, there's a PDF of it online. 
It's also very accessible there, and that's much easier to copy passages from the online version. 
Okay, so maybe if we begin the afternoon sitting quietly together for a few minutes. 
So I'll begin the afternoon covering a little bit more of the terrain of the transcendent. 
And we'll begin with the chapter called Attending to the Deathless. 
So that's chapter seven, which begins on page 123. 
So the word deathless in the Pali is amata. 
Mata or mara is death. 
And the A at the beginning is a negative. 
So my name is the same. 
My name also means deathless, amara. 
Amara is death, amara not death. 
Whereas when I was just given the name of my ordination, one of the time monks who was there said, oh, good name, very auspicious, non-dead. 
So if I look a little zombified, you know, because I'm the venerable non-dead. 
So this will start with the first quotation for this chapter. 
So this is quotation 7. 
1. 
And this comes from the Anguta Ranikaya, the book of discourses connected by numbers. 
This is from the book of the threes. 
Then venerable Anuruddha went to where venerable Sariputa was staying and on arrival greeted him courteously. 
After an exchange of friendly greetings, he sat down to one side. 
As he was sitting there, he said to venerable Sariputa, by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human, I see the thousandfold cosmos. 
My energy is aroused and unsluggish. 
My mindfulness is established and unshaken. 
My body is calm and unaroused. 
My mind is concentrated into singleness. 
And yet my mind is not released from the outflows through lack of clinging. 
Sariputa, who was an Arahant and fully enlightened, was the Buddha's chief disciple. 
Anuruddha was a relative of the Buddha and one of his close students. 
But this is prior to Anuruddha's enlightenment. 
So then Sariputa replies to him, My friend, when the thought occurs to you by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human, I see the thousandfold cosmos. 
That is related to your conceit. 
When the thought occurs to you, my energy is aroused and unsluggish. 
My mindfulness is established and unshaken. 
My body is calm and unperturbed. 
My mind is concentrated into singleness. 
That is related to your restlessness. 
When the thought occurs to you and yet my mind is not released from the outflows through lack of clinging, that is related to your anxiety. 
It would be well if, abandoning these three qualities, not attending to these three qualities, you directed your mind to the deathless element. 
So after that, Ven. 
Anuruddha, abandoning those three qualities, not attending to those three qualities, directed his mind to the deathless element, dwelling alone, secluded, heathful, ardent and resolute. 
He in no long time reached and remained in the supreme goal of the holy life to which people rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing and realizing it for himself in the here and now. 
He knew. 
Birth is ended, the holy life lived, the task done. 
There is no more coming into any state of being and thus the venerable Anuruddha became another one of the Ahans. 
So this is one of the very sweet little exchange, Brotherly Encounter, where Anuruddha who is very accomplished in psychic powers and such like goes along to Sariputta and then talking about these qualities that you think he'd get a word of praise for, like, oh, well done, yeah, nice job, brother. 
But Sariputta being the uncompromising and helpful, friendly influence, he's pointing out a particular trait. 
And so what he's pointing to, there's different ways you can interpret it, but how I read it, he's pointing to the fact that Anuruddha, even though these are extremely wholesome states that he's experiencing, things that are very, very positive and significant, he's pointing out how these are all conditioned qualities. 
What you're trying to do is you're just trying to, through focusing on these and trying to get all these qualities improved, or by measuring your success through these exalted qualities, you're missing the point. 
And so it's like there's a famous Zen story that comes to mind where there's a monk in a Zen monastery who's being extremely, like Anuruddha, extremely impressive and committed in his meditation, he's always sitting up late into the night and in his meditation he's always sitting straight as a poker, absolutely resolute, incredibly helpful, hard worker, doing all the right things. 
And then one day he's out working in the garden and he sees the Abbot, the Zen master, sitting down at the end of the pathway on a bench and he's not quite sure what he's doing and as he sort of mindfully sweeps the rest of the path and gets up closer and closer, he sees that the master is sitting there polishing something and then he gets up closer and closer and he sees he's polishing a brick and then he's supposed to be working, sweeping the path mindfully, but after a while he sees the Abbot sitting there working away on this brick and he thinks, what is he doing? And finally he can't resist asking the question and finally brings his hands together and says, Venerable Sir, Ajahn, Roshi, what is it that you're doing? I've been sweeping the garden for ages and you've been sitting there on this bench. 
It looks like you're polishing something. 
What is it that you're trying to do? He says, yes, I'm polishing something. 
I'm polishing this brick. 
And he says, oh, well, what have you got in mind? What are you going to use it for? It's an odd thing to do to polish a brick. 
He said, oh, well, I'm polishing it so it'll turn into a diamond. 
Far be it from me to disagree with you, Venerable Sir, but no matter how much you polish the brick, it's not going to turn into a diamond. 
And then, of course, as they always do in these stories, the teacher looks at him and says, exactly. 
And then gets up and walks off, leaving the aspiring student with the shiny brick. 
And so the moral of the tale being that if we are simply trying to create, to arrive at the unconditioned through polishing the conditioned, it ain't going to happen. 
You just get a polished brick. 
A very nicely polished brick, but it's not the unconditioned. 
So what Sariputa's doing is saying, no, no, you're trying very hard, but you're pointing your attention in the wrong direction. 
So just relax a bit and back off and then see instead if you can just direct your mind away from these conditioned aspects and see if you can recognize the unconditioned, the deathless. 
So that's why he says it'll be good. 
And also, there's these pointed deflations. 
You know, just like in this politely putting down all these highly exalted qualities. 
This is related to your restlessness, your conceit, and your anxiety, which are obstructions to the final levels of enlightenment, like they're some of the qualities that obstruct Arahantship. 
And so that it's interesting in this, he says, not attending to these three qualities, if you directed your mind to the deathless element. 
So it's not a complicated process that he's describing. 
It's just don't pay attention to these, just advert your attention to a different area. 
And so in many ways, this is very comparable to a lot of these kind of practices that you find, say, in the Zogchen tradition or in Advaita Vedanta, where there's not a lot of doing involved. 
It's just a very particular kind of not doing or undoing. 
That's the main thing, a sense of just shifting the perspective, which obviously takes a lot of effort. 
But there's not a lot of stuff that we're doing. 
And so I studied a bit with Soukni Rinpoche. 
And his phrase he'd like to use was undistracted nonmeditation. 
Undistracted nonmeditation. 
Because meditation can be so much of a thing, can't it? I'm doing my practice. 
I'm going to sit. 
Going to spirit rock to sit. 
Are we going to have an IMC, trying to find a new place to have a retreat center so that people can have their own place to sit? This is all very good in having a day like today. 
We create an event, we all come together and we do our thing. 
But it's a thing. 
No matter how good the thing is, as long as we're trying to find liberation or perfection or fulfillment through the rearrangement of things and the perfection of things, the heart will always stay bound to the conditioned realm. 
And so what this is pointing to is it's not a matter of devaluing the conditioned or getting rid of it, it's just changing the perspective on it. 
And of course it's simple in some respects but a heck of a job to do. 
But the. 
. 
. 
Again, quoting Soukni Rinpoche, he was staying at a. 
. 
. 
when he was teaching at spirit rock, he was staying at somebody's house in Marin, this very plush residence. 
And he's a pretty observant person and he saw there were some valuable items around the place and it was very posh and exquisite, valuable furnishings. 
And so he said to his host though, you've got some pretty nice things here. 
Do you spend a lot of effort collecting things? He says, well, not really, it's kind of a hobby, but you know, I'm not really attached to any of it. 
And Soukni Rinpoche, he picked up the coffee pot and there's this like $36,000 silk carpet and he says, not attached? How would you feel if I turned the coffee pot over onto the carpet? That's how I heard the story. 
But I can believe it. 
Because he's pretty cheeky in his way of teaching, but he calls this California Dharma, it's his term for it, which is, you know, both it's kind of joking, but also in his, again, quoting him, also not joking. 
Those of you who studied with him, he'd say, only joking, only joking, or not joking. 
And so California Dharma is having the idea of transcendence, or loving the idea of ultimate reality and non-dualism, but actually some deeply embedded, very deeply embedded personal preferences that are at play. 
And so that it's a job to really cultivate that quality of non-bias in relationship to the conditioned world. 
But it is doable. 
And so that when we were talking about the practice, and so much of it can be to do with using the methodologies, using the methods of meditation, using the structures of spiritual practice and training, but not getting where to do those, or the sense of attachment, even to your traditional, your center, or your practice, your meditation. 
You're not, you know, you're using those elements and those tools, but without turning it into a thing that I'm doing, or my program, my practice, my space. 
Yeah, it's kind of interesting. 
My space is very popular amongst a certain sector. 
So that the way that we turn the processes of our experience into things is a large part of what obscures our capacity to see the truth, to see dharma, to be liberated. 
And that that unconscious kind of attachment, concretizing is so insidious. 
And so this kind of a practice where you're saying, attending to the deathless, it's just recognizing, oh, look, this is just another thing. 
This is just a beautiful thing, this is a precious thing, or it's my thing, yeah? Okay, technically it's yours, but it is just a thing. 
And then when we look closely, we recognize that a thing is actually more accurately represented as being an event. 
There aren't really any things, like solid, permanent objects, but they're coming together of an event. 
And some languages that famously don't have nouns, like I understand the Hopi and Navajo language don't have nouns as such, but they just use verbs and adverbs. 
So this isn't a bell, this is a belling. 
You can probably have the varieties of the way as they're saying this or that, like thising and thating. 
The world is not turned into distinct, concrete, separate objects through the way they're spoken about, but more with seeing patterns of events changing. 
So that this change of vision, the shift of vision that's being described here, is in a sense letting go of the thing-ness of the way we create the world and establishing more of an open quality of awareness. 
Actually, I was having a conversation during the lunch break about that very way, because the awareness, the nest on the end of it makes it a thing, even emptiness. 
Again, these subjects are all talked about in this book. 
Awareness, emptiness can sound like a thing, sunyata, or sunyata in the Sanskrit. 
It can sound like this sort of mysterious ethereal substance. 
But in truth, it's more helpful to talk about knowing in terms of being a verb, it's like an activity rather than a thing or even a subtle thing. 
So that this is a subtle area of practice. 
And again, this is one of the reasons why the Buddha thought, there's no point even trying to explain this. 
This is way too obstruous. 
But it's so helpful just to be aware of what the mind is doing and also how it doesn't actually take a huge amount to change the perspective, but if we don't make the effort to do it, it doesn't happen on its own. 
So that in the next passage, and when he's talking about jhana, he applies the same kind of perspective, which is, so this is on page 126, and he's talking about establishing this kind of insight in relationship to deep states of concentration. 
So this is passage 7. 
3. 
Here, Abhiku enters upon and remains in the first jhana, experiencing refreshment and pleasure born of withdrawal, accompanied by applied and sustained thought. 
He regards whatever phenomena there are that are connected with the body, feeling, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness as impermanent, unsatisfactory, a disease, a cancer, a barb, painful, an affliction, alien, a disintegrating, void, as not self. 
He turns his mind away from those states and, having done so, inclines his mind towards the property of deafness, recognizing this is peaceful, this is exquisite, the stilling of all mental processes, the relinquishment of all the paraphernalia of becoming, the ending of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbana. 
Standing there, he reaches the ending of the mental outflows, or, if not, then through that very dharma delight, and from the total ending of the first five of the fetters, he is due to be reborn in the pure abodes, there to attain final nibbana, never again to return from that world. 
And so the same wording is repeated with reference to the other three rupa jhanas, so second jhana, third jhana, fourth jhana. 
So with each of them, so the mind is in these deep states of concentration, and there's this reflection, this is conditioned and thus gross, this is a kind of a course formation. 
And if you go back to page 75, there's a quote there that relates to this, which is again, this is from the Majjhima Nikaya, this is quote number 4. 
7, whether based on perceptions of form, or of the formness of the limited, or of the immeasurable, some assert the base of nothingness, immeasurable and imperturbable to be the self. 
However, all that is conditioned and thus gross, but there is the cessation of formations. 
Having known there is this, and seeing the escape from it all, that a target has gone beyond it. 
So that sense of paying attention to each of the jhanas even, recognizing this is a condition of mind, this is a formation, this is something that's gross, this is not the unconditioned. 
And so recognizing that any kind of identification with that, or attachment to it, is going to lead to dukkha. 
Then there's that letting go. 
So it turns his mind away from those states, having done so, inclines his mind towards the property of deathlessness. 
So even in those deep states of jhana, first, second, third, fourth jhana, there's still that recognition, oh, this is just a conditioned state. 
And even though it's blissful and beautiful and delightful, if there's the mindfulness to turn away from that and let go, then you can use the energy and clarity of those states then to awaken to that, the unconditioned, the amatadamma, the unconditioned element. 
So any particular questions on that? Yeah, at the back there, with the blue shirt. 
The Buddha had temptations by Mara, and it's just before his enlightenment. 
So my question to you is, how should we, I mean, obviously we want to think more about the positive, where our mind is supposed to be. 
But can you mention how we're supposed to, should we just think, well, just touch on Mara and then leave it alone, or what should we do? I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. 
I mean, Mara is a mythological figure. 
Mara means death, so it's pretty much of a clue as to what Mara is representing. 
So it's Mara's like the embodiment of all that which contributes to delusion and bondage to that which causes alienation and dukkha. 
And so Mara can appear in many different forms. 
So there's Machu Mara who's the killer. 
Machu means to kill. 
There's Kilesa Mara, the Mara of defilements, of corruption and deceit. 
There's Khanda Mara, that's the identification with the five Khandas, the body and the mental faculties. 
There's Abhisankara Mara, there's only five of them, don't worry. 
Abhisankara Mara is the Mara of thinking, the habit of believing our thoughts. 
And then the last one, the most refined one, is called Devaputamara. 
And Devaputamara is very much like the Lucifer figure of the Bible. 
Lucifer was the brightest of the archangels till he got a conceit problem and was cast down from the high heavens and plunged into the pit. 
Lucifer means from the Latin looks, like the bright one, the radiant one. 
So similarly Mara, just like Lucifer is the brightest of the archangels, Devaputamara is the king of the highest of the sensual heavens. 
So in Buddhist cosmology you have seven sensual heavens, from the earth spirits, the guardian deities, the heaven of the 33 gods, the Yama Devas, the heaven of the contented, the heaven of those who delight in creating, the heaven of those who delight in the creations of others. 
The seven heavens. 
Devaputamara is the king, he's the boss of that top heaven. 
Do you have a particular book or writing somewhere where we could just look at that? There are a number of things, the best book actually is in German, it's never been translated into English, by Windisch. 
But Stephen Batchelor took a lot of material that Windisch covers in his book. 
Windisch's book is called Das Buddha und Mara. 
So that's pretty easy to remember the title of. 
But Stephen Batchelor's book is called Living with the Devil. 
But anyway, they're all representing in mythological form different aspects of our own delusions. 
So Mara can come under the. 
. 
. 
So Devaputamara, like this radiant, brilliant, intelligent, impressive, ever so appealing, beautiful being, will be that kind of delusion whereby if the mind's in a deep state of concentration and is in a blissful state of happiness, it's the mind that says, oh, this is great. 
I really, really like this. 
This is great. 
That's the entry point of Mara, is that which is relishing even beautiful and wholesome things. 
Could you maybe say something about. 
. 
. 
There is this polishing of wholesome states that we focus on to set up the conditions for making that leap or whatever, however you want to describe it into nirvana. 
So could you talk about that? Well, this is 99. 
9% of our lives. 
But it's a strange mixture, you know? And again, quoting Ajahn Chah, he was very good at these nifty one-liners. 
And when Ajahn Samedi was asked for the most memorable thing that our teacher had ever said to him, practicing the monastic discipline is all about hanging on. 
Practicing the dharma is all about letting go. 
When you figure out how those two work together, you'll be fine. 
So it's mysterious, because Ajahn Chah was an extremely kind of proper monk. 
He was famously strict with the monastic discipline and required a very, very high standard and encouraged a really high standard of conduct and commitment and dedication from all of his students. 
But he was also totally unattached to it. 
And so to the rational mind, it's like, well, either it matters or it doesn't. 
Like the question about loving our dear ones or weeping when they die. 
How can he do that? He's sitting up there on the dharma seat saying a great length, how our conduct and our mindful attention to detail of training is important and keeping the precepts is the most important thing. 
And then moments later, he'll say, there are no people here. 
There's no monks in this hall. 
There are no nuns. 
There aren't any women or men here. 
Are there? Really? I mean, there aren't actually any women or men here. 
It just appears this way. 
This is just the appearance of things. 
This is just the way that it looks to our conditioned senses. 
That's all. 
These are just conventions. 
We say man, we say woman, we say nun, we say monk, we say old person, young person. 
These are just creations. 
These are just things that we determine into existence. 
We say they are this and we all agree to call it that, so we call it. 
So it's that. 
But there's nothing really here, is there? And so, on the one hand, it's like, yes, you should train yourself and cultivate wholesomeness and do everything that you can to develop to create blessings and good karma and really put your heart and your back into it. 
But yet, on the other hand, there's absolutely no thing here whatsoever. 
I mean, really, there isn't anything. 
And the two are not. 
. 
. 
and there's absolutely no contradiction between the two. 
And so, it takes someone who really embodies that to really carry it across. 
But that's how it works, because if you cling to the idea, well, nothing matters. 
We're all Buddhists. 
We're all totally enlightened from the beginning. 
Therefore, I'm going to go back to bed. 
Well, like, let's go to the beach or hit the bottle. 
And so, that's clinging to the idea of transcendence. 
You're taking the idea of the ultimate and clinging to that. 
On the other hand, it's like, no, no, no, the most important thing is not that ultimate principle, but it's how we act. 
We've got to do this and we shouldn't do that and this is right and that's wrong and we've got to create all the good karma possible. 
But then that's clinging to the world of form. 
So, in a way, the essence of the middle way is holding both of those realities in place so that you wholeheartedly commit yourself to cultivating wholesome qualities and goodness. 
But yet, at the same time, you're keeping that all within the context of there's absolutely nothing and nobody here. 
So the good qualities are letting themselves to that. 
Absolutely, yeah. 
Of that letting go, whereas going the opposite direction is actually going away from that, is actually a lot of clinging and the behavior itself is going toward that ultimate letting go. 
Well, let's say the way I like to talk about it is that it's just like quoting Hamlet. 
I mean, it's a big day for quotations with Hamlet. 
It says, there is nothing good or evil of itself but our thinking makes it so. 
So that, yes, there is nothing. 
. 
. 
Actually, there's a haiku, I remember, from Japan, which is there is nothing that is truly good or evil on its own, but people tend to weep when certain things are done. 
People tend to weep when certain things are done. 
So the whole concept of goodness and badness, kusala and akusala, wholesomeness and unwholesomeness, in Buddhist philosophy, is to do with when things are wholesome, that means they're in accord with dharma, in accord with reality. 
So what that does is that when we act in a wholesome way that leaves the heart free from remorse, it gives rise to feelings of clarity, of happiness, of peacefulness. 
So it supports the basis for concentration, which supports the basis for insight and liberation. 
When we act in. 
. 
. 
and so it's not that goodness is intrinsically good, it's just it sets up the conditions for that awakening to that reality, that badness is not intrinsically bad, it's just when we act in a way that's selfish or destructive or cruel or indulgent, then we create regret in ourselves, we create confusion, we create fear, we create alienation, so that we're. 
. 
. 
so that we're making the. 
. 
. 
setting up the conditions whereby it's going to be much harder for that basic truth to be realized. 
It's like the. 
. 
. 
before you get into your car and drive, it's sort of the contrast between getting out the squeegee and cleaning the windscreen so that you can see well, or getting out, you know, get some handfuls of clay from the garden and smearing it all over the windscreen. 
This'll be exciting. 
Anyone ready for a ride? You know, I think, all right, let's go. 
Okay, blindfolds on. 
Okay, let's rip, you know. 
It'll be exciting. 
And, you know, maybe it's. 
. 
. 
and there is an attraction towards that kind of excitement. 
I remember a phrase that came to mind a couple of days ago, which was when someone was talking about their. 
. 
. 
she realized her basic fear of normality. 
I said, why would I want to be healed and normal when I could be a brilliant wounded fragment? And she was taking it that she could see for herself though. 
I want to be this desperate, shocked, ragged, tormented, special thing. 
Far better than just me driving. 
You know, seeing clearly how boring. 
So, as I was saying earlier today, there is an attraction towards that kind of charge, and it's not belittling or negating that, but it's, in a way, the Buddha says, yeah, there is that, but we can do better than that. 
And not just as a weak compromise, but there's a deeper reality, a deeper kind of satisfaction that we can tap into if we let ourselves. 
So, there's also a lovely little passage in the iti-vutaka, the sayings of the Buddha where he says, and it seems to come on the tail of a conversation of someone talking about the development of wisdom saying, well, really, wisdom is the most important thing, and we don't have to bother with that kind of good karma stuff. 
Pah! You know, I spit on your good karma. 
But, yeah, if you're really wise, you don't need any of that stuff. 
And the Buddha says that there seems to have been the kind of thing that has gone before, because the Buddha says, monks, don't belittle good karma, don't belittle the quality of pujna, of merit, because merit is, pujna is a synonym for happiness. 
It's not a small thing. 
On one level, it's not absolutely important, but it's like, yeah, you don't really need to clean your kitchen. 
In an absolute sense. 
I have no psychic powers to see your sink, so don't worry. 
But, yeah, you don't really need to clean your kitchen, you know, it does make a difference if you sort of get the majority of the stuff off the surface, and the sink is kind of tidied up before you start cooking, you know. 
There's a chemistry there. 
You talk about that when the heart achieved nirvana, there's feeling of joy and peaceful as well. 
So, does that need to be let go, or it cannot be let go itself? If there's any clinging, then let go. 
But it's, that can be experienced without any kind of clinging whatsoever. 
You can experience total happiness and joy without there being any attachment to it. 
And there won't be any, as long as there's a feeling of ownership, or this is mine, I'm experiencing this, this is who and what I am, this belongs to me, then that will create dukkha. 
There's a, I'm not sure if we have it in this, I think we do, but let's check, in the Majimanikaya in the Sutta called the Panchataya Sutta, not the Punctured Taya Sutta, but the, let's see, I think it's 5'10". 
The Punctured Taya Sutta, and the Buddha talks about the, here we are. 
This is page 90. 
Here because, some Samana or Brahmin, with the relinquishing of views about the past and the future through complete lack of resolve upon the fetters, essential pleasure, and with the surmounting of the rapture of seclusion, unworldly pleasure and neutral feeling, they regard themselves thus, I am at peace, I have attained Nibbana, I am without clinging. 
That a target of bhikkhus understands this thus, this good Samana or Brahmin with the relinquishing of views about the past and future and so on, they regard themselves thus, I am at peace, I have attained Nibbana, I am without clinging. 
Certainly this venerable one asserts the way directed to Nibbana, yet this good Samana or Brahmin still clings, clinging either to a view about the past, or to a view about the future, or to a fetter of sensual pleasure, or to the rapture of seclusion, or to unworldly pleasure, or to neutral feeling. 
And when this venerable one regards themselves thus, I am at peace, I have attained Nibbana, I am without clinging, that too is declared to be clinging on the part of this good Samana or Brahmin. 
All that is conditioned and thus gross, but there is the cessation of formations. 
I understood there is this, seeing the escape from that, the Tathagata has gone beyond that. 
So that the very phraseology, the way the mind puts it, I am at peace, I have attained Nibbana, I am without clinging. 
That demonstrates the clinging that is still there. 
So the degree to which there is, I am this, I have this, I am the owner, I am the doer, I am the experiencer, the degree to which that I am is solidified, is exactly proportional to the amount of dukkha, of discontent and alienation that is experienced. 
So the more that there is the experience of Nibbana, but no identification with it, then the more fully it is, completely it is realized. 
There is another passage, again let me see if I can find it, where it is on page 95. 
This is part of quote number 5. 
15. 
So this is at the end of a very, very long sutra, the first sutra of the Majimini Kaya. 
I will just read the last paragraph at the top of page 95. 
He directly knows, starts off with the four elements and goes through all these different realms and then from the all as the all, he directly knows Nibbana as Nibbana. 
He does not conceive himself as Nibbana. 
He does not conceive himself in Nibbana. 
He does not conceive himself apart from or coming from Nibbana. 
He does not conceive Nibbana to be mine, nor does he delight in Nibbana. 
And that word delight is to relish or to kind of, wow, yes. 
He does not delight in Nibbana. 
Why is that? Because he has understood that delight is the root of suffering and that with being as conditioner is birth and for whatever has come to be, there is aging and death. 
Therefore because through the complete destruction, fading away, cessation, giving up and relinquishing of cravings, the Tathagata has awakened to supreme, full enlightenment, I say. 
So that word delight there is, I think it's Nandiyar, is the word there. 
So that has a quality of like slightly glassy eye like, wow, kind of relishing and sort of being carried away by something. 
So that's why in that, even that sense of experiencing the pleasure of Nibbana wouldn't have that kind of slightly glassy or carried away quality to it. 
It's completely, as a total mindfulness, but it's also a mindfulness which is not caught up with any kind of delusion or it's not carried away. 
It's not like the sort of being entranced or intoxicated with bliss. 
It's like being totally unintoxicated with bliss. 
That make sense? Okay, so moving right along, we'll now go to the quality of unsupported and unsupportive consciousness and that's Chapter 8. 
So this is using a different angle of approach. 
This is page 132. 
So this is using a different kind of imagery. 
This is the imagery of the mind not being able to land anywhere or not landing on anything. 
So the Buddha used this kind of phraseology of unsupported consciousness so that consciousness that does not land on anything or does not settle or is not established any place or also in a similar way is like the consciousness which nothing can land upon. 
And so he uses those two different modes in different places. 
And so that's why hence the chapter is called unsupported and unsupportive consciousness. 
So the first one is a longsuita from the Dighanikaya, the long discourse, discourse number 11. 
This was translated by Maurice Walsh. 
And in this story the Buddha is giving a long shaggy dog story where what happens is that a monk is meditating and he has the idea, where is it? I wonder where earth, water, fire and wind cease without remainder. 
For where is it that the things of the world come to an end? Where is it that the four elements, the four great elements, where is it that they come to an end and cease without remainder? Like asking where is the end of the world or what's the end of the universe? And so being an adept meditator then this monk absorbs in his mind and goes up and talks to the first devas that he comes across up in the lower heavenly realms and then the first devas meet him and he asks them this question, where is it that earth, water, fire and wind cease without remainder? And then that's the retinue of the four great kings and then they say, well we don't know but if you better ask the four great kings themselves, they understand this kind of stuff, they're really smart, they know these things, you better ask them. 
So he goes up to the four great kings and says, could you tell me where it is that the four great elements cease without remainder? We don't know, that's tough, we don't know that sort of thing. 
We're not really philosophers but the Tava Tingsa devas, they're pretty smart. 
Saka, the king of the Tava Tingsa heaven, he's excluded on this kind of stuff, you better ask him, he's a disciple of the Buddha so he should know. 
So it goes on up to the Tava Tingsa heaven, where is it that the four great elements cease without remainder? Ooh, don't know about that, but you better ask up in the Yama devas and then all the way out to the celestial chain of command, up into the Brahma heaven so it approaches the devas of Brahma's retinue. 
And he asks the devas of Brahma's retinue and they can't produce an answer but they assure him that the great Brahma himself, should he deign to manifest, is certain to provide him with a resolution he seeks. 
Sure enough, before too long he appears, the great Brahma, and at this point we are treated to a taste of the rai-wit of the Buddha. 
So this is quote number 8. 
2. 
And that monk went up to him and said, Friend, where do the four great elements, earth, water, fire, and air, cease without remainder? To which the great Brahma replied, Monk, I am Brahma. 
Great Brahma, the conqueror, the unconquered, the all-seeing, all-powerful, the lord, the maker and creator, the ruler, the appointer, the orderer, the father of all that have been and shall be. 
And then the monk said, well, friend, I didn't ask you if you're Brahma, great Brahma, et cetera, et cetera. 
I asked you where the four great elements cease without remainder? And the second time the great Brahma replied as before. 
The third time the monk said, friend, I did not ask you that. 
I asked you where the four great elements cease without remainder. 
Then K. 
Vanda, the great Brahma, took that monk by the arm, led him aside and said, Monk, these devas believe there is nothing that Brahma does not see. 
There is nothing he does not know. 
There is nothing he is unaware of. 
That is why I did not speak in front of them. 
But, Monk, I don't know where the four great elements cease without remainder. 
Therefore, Monk, you have acted wrongly. 
You have acted incorrectly by going beyond the blessed lord and going in search of an answer to the question elsewhere. 
Now, Monk, you just go to the blessed lord and put this question to him and whatever answer he gives you, accept it. 
So he then goes back and goes to see the Buddha and asks him the same question. 
And the Buddha says to him, well, you know, you are asking the question in the wrong way and instead this is how the question should have been put. 
Where do earth, water, fire and air no footing find? Where are long and short, small and great, fair and foul, where are name and form wholly destroyed? And the answer is where consciousness is sinless, boundless, all luminous. 
That's where earth, water, fire and air find no footing. 
There both long and short, small and great, fair and foul, there name and form, Nama and Rupa, are wholly destroyed. 
With the cessation of consciousness, this is all destroyed. 
Thus the lord spoke on the householder K. 
Vanda, delighted, rejoiced at his words. 
And the alternative translation of the final verses from Bikunyan and Nanda is, where do earth, water, fire and wind long and short, fine and coarse, pleasant and unpleasant, no footing find? Where is it that name and form are held in check with no trace left? And the answer, consciousness which is non-manifestative, endless, lustrous on all sides, here it is that earth, water, fire and wind, no footing find, here again are long and short, subtle and gross, pleasant and unpleasant, name and form, cut off without exceptions. 
When consciousness comes to cease, these are held in check herein. 
So, that's a very significant and often quoted teaching. 
And that phrase, the key phrase of that, described in that kind of consciousness, is vinyanang, which is consciousness, anidasanang. 
Anidasana means invisible or formless, non-manifesting, non-manifestative. 
Anantang, boundless, limitless, infinite. 
And sabato pabang, sabato means all or everywhere, paba is light, so all luminous or radiant in all directions. 
It can also mean accessible from all sides. 
And so, that is describing, in a way, the enlightened mind. 
It's like a pocket description of that mind. 
And this is one of the very rare places that vinyana is used to describe a transcendent quality of mind. 
Usually, it's referring to more conditioned aspects of cognition. 
But in this respect, vinyana is a transcendent quality. 
So, this is the unsupportive consciousness where things can't land, where earth, water, fire and wind can find no footing. 
So, when the mind rests in that consciousness, which is, say, sinless or non-manifestative, it is formless, it's limitless, it's radiant. 
And also, as I said, it can also mean accessible from all sides. 
So, that was very striking in terms of comparing with the teachings of Dzogchen that they have this standard description of the nature of mind in its pure state of Rigpa. 
And Rigpa is actually a translation of Tibetan word for Vija, the IJJA in Pali. 
Avija is ignorance, Vija is knowing or awareness. 
So, Rigpa is Vija and Marigpa is Avija. 
So, Marigpa, like, not Rigpa, but the ununified state of mind is, it literally means Avija. 
So, it's the same word as the Pali for ignorance. 
In the 12th chapter of the book, I bring all these together, and so I follow up on this same sutra, it's called Chapter 12, it's called Knowing, Emptiness and the Radiant Mind. 
And the, let's see if I can find it. 
Of course, it's escaping me. 
Also, grateful to Ruby Grad for this wonderful index that she did for us. 
Yeah, 137, great. 
So, in listening, this is on page 137. 
In listening to Zogchen teachings, it's clear that the aim of the practice is to establish the mind in innate, self-arising Rigpa, quote, unquote. 
This latter word for which the Sanskrit is Vija, and the Pali is Vija, transcendent knowing, is variously translated as non-dual awareness, innate wisdom, pure presence, primordial being, etc. 
Again and again, its principal qualities are enumerated, empty of essence, cognizant in nature, unconfined in capacity. 
That's one of Sokni's translators would put it that way. 
And then the other of his translators would say, emptiness, knowing, and lucidity, or clarity. 
Again, the translations into English vary, but on consideration and resemblance to the adjective describing the mind, where long and short, etc. 
, confine no footing, is very striking. 
To spell it out, vinyanam, cognizant in nature, anidasanam equals empty, anantam, unconfined in capacity, sabatole pabang, lucid in quality. 
And as I diplomatically say, whether or not this is a valid alignment of principles, is for the individual to discover. 
I'm very proud of my own footwork there, I must say. 
However, as both of these teachings ostensibly point to the nature of the heart liberated from ignorance, it is illuminating that these two traditions, now so widely separated geographically, should hold such similar teachings as key distillations of their wisdom. 
So that's on page 137 there. 
So this, in a way of checking, if you like, to see whether the mind is really free of clinging and that establishment of the quality of nirvana or peacefulness, then there are going to be, these qualities are all going to be there to some degree, the quality of spaciousness, the quality of brightness or alertness, or even an inner quality of inner radiance, and also a quality of, they say, formlessness, like there's not a particular shape or characteristic, the mind is not fixing on a particular object, so it's more that there's an openness, and even though objects can appear, obviously just the mind being in a state of clarity or not clean, doesn't mean to say suddenly the eyes stop seeing and the ears stop hearing, but there's a lack of fixation, so that quality of formlessness, as it says, non-manifestative, it's like there's a, it's hard to put your finger on, of course, but it's pointing to that, in a way, the transparency of experience. 
So sometimes, I think Stephen Bachelors also fond of that use of the word transparency as a translation for shunyata or emptiness, that things are transparent, and that's a good way of representing it, that there's a form, but there's no solidity there, like a pattern made in light, you can just put your hand right through it, so it's referring. 
So if you're wanting to, with your meditation, or just to, in a way, check your own sort of inside or attitude or whatever way you want to figure it, just seeing if these qualities are present, is there a quality of knowing, is there a quality of spaciousness, is there a brightness, is there an alertness, are those present? And then with that, and in that also seeing that when the mind really rests in that quality, when that's really the abiding quality of the heart and mind, then to see that, the non-landing quality, where is it that earth, water, fire and wind, things that we feel and see and smell and taste and touch, they can't get a grip. 
It's like the Teflon, it's like the non-stick mind, that things can arrive, but they don't stick, the mind doesn't get caught up in it, they don't carry the attention away, but there are things that arise, they're known and they slide off, they fade without remainder. 
So this is, I find it a helpful way of checking to see, in a sense the more that the mind has a sense of confinement or the more that the mind is hanging on to different sounds or feelings or thoughts, perceptions, the more stickiness is apparent, then it's reckoning, oh look, there's some clinging going on here, the mind is drifting into ignorance, there's not true Vija, there's not a true clear unbiased knowing, the mind is drifting into a Vija to some degree, that makes sense? So then the other key teaching for the unsupported consciousness is chapter 8 and 8. 
21, so 8. 
21. 
And so this is talking about unsupportive, sorry, unsupported consciousness, so when consciousness can't land anywhere, what is intended, c'et eti, what is acted upon and what lies latent, that is a support for the establishment of consciousness, there being a support there is a landing of consciousness, when that consciousness lands and grows there is a production of renewed becoming in the future, when there is a production of renewed becoming in the future, birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, such is the origin of this entire mass of dukkha. 
So when there is a production of renewed becoming in the future, there is future birth, aging and death and so on. 
If nothing is intended, if nothing is acted upon, but something lies latent, this is a support for the establishment of consciousness, etc. 
When nothing is intended, acted upon or lies latent, there is no support for the establishment of consciousness, there being no support, there is no landing of consciousness, when that consciousness does not land and grow, there is no production of renewed becoming in the future, when there is no production of renewed becoming in the future, there is no future birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, such is the cessation of this entire mass of dukkha. 
Then going on to reading number 8, 24 on the next page, page 149. 
There are these four nutriments for the establishing of beings who have taken birth or for the support of those in search of a place to be born. 
Which four? Physical food, gross or refined, contact is the second, consciousness the third, and intention is the fourth. 
These are the four nutriments for the establishing of beings who have taken birth or for the support of those in search of a place to be born. 
Where there is passion, delight and craving for the nutriment of physical food, consciousness lands there and grows. 
Where consciousness lands and grows, mentality-materiality alights. 
That's Nama Rupa. 
Where mentality-materiality alights, there is the growth of volitional formations. 
Where there is the growth of volitional formations, there is the production of renewed becoming in the future. 
Where there is the production of renewed becoming in the future, there is birth, aging and death, together I tell you with sorrow, affliction and despair. 
Just as when there is dye, lack, yellow, opiment, indigo or crimson, a dire or painter would paint the picture of a woman or a man completing all its parts on a well-polished panel or wall, or on a piece of cloth. 
In the same way when there is passion, delight and craving for the nutriment of physical food, consciousness lands there and grows. 
Together I tell you with sorrow, affliction and despair. 
Similarly with the other three kinds of nutriment. 
When there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food, when there is no delight, no craving, then consciousness does not land there or grow. 
Mentality-materiality does not alight, there is no growth of volitional formations, there is no production of renewed becoming in the future. 
Where there is no production of renewed becoming in the future, there is no birth, aging and death, that I tell you is quite free from sorrow, affliction or despair. 
Just as if there were a roofed house or a roofed hall having windows on the north, the south or the east, when the sun rises and a shaft of light has entered by way of the window, where does it land? On the western wall, venerable sir. 
And if there is no western wall, on the ground venerable sir. 
And if there is no ground, on the water venerable sir. 
And if there is no water, it does not land venerable sir. 
In the same way when there is no passion for physical nutriment, contact, consciousness or intention, consciousness does not land or grow. 
That I tell you is quite free from sorrow, affliction or despair. 
So that has a little bit of a different tone to it. 
And I know in these, this kind of language, saying no passion, that is in sort of life affirming Bay Area culture, heretical statement, or something deeply unattractive. 
But it's good to take these words and to reflect on them, and not just sort of, come at them from a presumptuous or reactive place, but to say, well, what's that talking about? And the way that the Buddha is pointing to this, and seeing that image of the light coming through the window, it's pointing to the sense of, that, that, that, that, of, that, the mind not fixing on any particular object, like there's a consciousness, there's an awareness, but it's, it's not, woven into, it's not woven into any fear, anything that we're afraid of, anything that we're regretful of, anything that we're hoping for, anything that we're missing, anything that we're burdened by. 
All of those, it's not dwelling on those, those aspects of experience in that way. 
As he says, if there's nothing for it to land on, there's no, no fear, no, no regret, no anxiety about the future, no planning, no regretting, no nostalgia, then that we're not investing in, in how great it was in the past, or how wonderful it's going to be in the future, or how terrible it's going to be in the future, but there's that abiding in the present, and we're pointing to this same kind of quality of there being awareness as a consciousness, but it's not fixating, it's not landing, and then, and thereby, not creating those seeds of, of alienation and compulsion that, that cause so much dukkha. 
Does that make sense? Are people familiar with this particular teacher? I think Ajahn Tinnisar was very fond of this particular sutra, so those of you who've been along to his workshops have probably heard him discoursing on this one, often before. 
Just for the language, the vinyana being an aggregate, then it's different from this. 
This is a consciousness that is, that doesn't attach and is not an aggregate, but it just gets confusing because, you know, one is, one is the, the aggregate says, this is not me, this is not myself, this is not who I am, but the, this vinyana that you're talking, that is being talked about without, you know, that doesn't land on anything is, seems like it's talking, I mean, it's a different, it's a different thing. 
And so, words. 
Well, that's why we have these, well, that's why we have these days. 
So, because it's to help clarify such things, because just like in English, the same word can be used in totally different, with totally different meanings, like you can go to a week-long conference of psychologists and scientists and say, what is, and just have the question, what is consciousness? You get a heck of a lot of different versions of exactly what consciousness is, right? So that the word, just like within the scientific field, or the, or the psychotherapeutic field, will be radically, you know, used in radically different ways by different people. 
So, in the Buddhist teachings, the same word will get used in different ways. 
So that then, one of the usefulnesses of days like this is then you say, okay, well, it's, right, now, what's it pointing to? So if you come at it from, rather than getting the, fitting the words into an already-existent series that you have, rather take it from the experiential side, say, okay, what do I experience, that feeling of nothing being able to land. 
I've had that just for a moment here and there. 
Now, what was that like? He's talking about that as the consciousness where earth, water, fire, wind can find no footing. 
So he's talking about that as a consciousness, so that you go to your own experience of it and say, okay, so that seems to be what he's talking about. 
Now, how does that fit in with the other things that he said? So you're starting with your own experience and then reflecting on the teachings from that basis, rather than starting with the theory and trying to get the theory to all sort of line up. 
And so then what you find is that you get more of a sense of, okay, in this instance, the word is being used like this. 
It's being used just like with conversation we had earlier about heart and mind. 
Exactly what I was going to say. 
Yeah, so okay, now, what's the context here? You've got to see how it's being used. 
Who's the writer? What are they probably referring to? And then you're taking in those different nuances and getting a sense of the context. 
Okay, it feels like it's this one, this is what they're talking about. 
Let's apply that and see whether it fits. 
That reminds me that one of the other words in my mind is where Mahabuha talks about jitta as that which knows. 
So it seems like that's using consciousness and jitta as the same thing. 
Yeah, I was asked to do an introduction to a book of Ajahn's Tomatoes, Dhamma Talks, called The Sound of Silence. 
And I did the intro to the original one which is called Intuitive Awareness. 
And I had to do several pages on his different usages of the word consciousness because it varies a lot. 
And he tends to use consciousness more often than not as a transcendent awareness. 
That's how Ajahn's Tomatoes uses the word almost all the time. 
So he very rarely means the more conditioned kind of consciousness. 
So I had to do a sort of long explanation and give any examples from the talk that he gave and say, well, this is what he's talking about. 
Just to help clarify that. 
But it's also helpful just when you are reading teachings or listening to the teachings to have that basic reflective attitude rather than trying to fit it into an already existent model. 
Or that sense of, oh, that's interesting. 
Well, how does that work? And be ready to a-shift your own model or see things in a more flexible way. 
Or also just to say, well, I don't know what the heck that person's meaning. 
That doesn't make sense. 
But rather than rejecting it, just saying, OK, well, that really doesn't seem to fit with anything that I know. 
But maybe I'll figure that out later or that will become clear. 
Like for a while Ajahn's Tomatoes was giving Dharma talks about soul. 
Soul, S-O-U-L. 
And he was using soul as a sort of synonym for mindfulness and wisdom. 
Didn't go for very long. 
But he tried it out. 
He's very experimental. 
He tried it out. 
He's sort of looking for words. 
And his own, his phrase, intuitive awareness, that's his translation of Sati Sambha Janya, which is usually mindfulness and clear comprehension. 
So he just is sort of exploring the language and trying things out, just trying to get closer to the meaning of words. 
So to me, I find it's helpful because English, there's a lot of Pali words that really have no corresponding term in English. 
And so it's good to have that sort of exploratory attitude and have a sense of, well, what's this pointing to? How can this fit together? Okay, if this is supposed to lead to that, how does that work? What must this be talking about? And so then you're, but you're starting with your experience as the basic parameter, which you measure things by rather than a conceptual map that you already have got accustomed to. 
When you talk about, they talk about consciousness, landing. 
That whole paragraph was very confusing several months ago when I read that. 
And something not landing on something, like you said, I don't know what the heck they're talking about. 
But it seemed like later on that it seems like consciousness, there is an implication here that there's a movement of consciousness. 
So to me, when I was experiencing not paying attention, not drawing the attention outward, or when the attention is noticed that it's on something and there's some redirection, it seemed like there was no place to land. 
Is that what they're talking about? Could it be interpreted that way? So they say, for example, in the passage 822, the wording says, when consciousness taking a stance, one attached is unreleased, one unattached is released. 
Should consciousness, when taking a stance, stand attached to a physical form, supported by form as its object established on form, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase in development. 
And so on for each of the five kundas. 
And so that it's the mind taking hold of that. 
And as I said earlier about the thing that's making it into a real thing, this body is mine, it's real and it's solid and it's permanent. 
This is my teacup, which I know shouldn't be in here. 
I'll employ an executive privilege for the day. 
So it's that landing, this is mine, this is here, this is a thing. 
That landing and taking hold, it's that phrase of taking a stance on that physical form or feeling or perception or whatever. 
So in that very taking a stance, it's like landing on it, taking hold of it, becoming identified with it. 
That is synonymous with creating, insofar as the mind does that, then it creates the causes of dukkha. 
The less that it does that, then the less dukkha that's created. 
But also with all of these teachings, some of them, we read the words and you think, just like you said, what the heck does that mean? And that's fine, if we read things and think, I haven't got a clue what I was talking about, then it's often very appropriate just to put that aside and then wait till you get to one that says, ah, that makes sense. 
Or I get a clear feeling about what that's pointing to. 
So that rather than feeling that we have to sort of figure everything out, sometimes the way that particular teachings are phrased, they just don't match our own sort of internal mapping. 
It's just like, no, it's a three-pin plug and it's a two-pin socket. 
It's just not going to happen. 
Well, even with the same teachers sometimes, even the Buddha's declaration of his own enlightenment, oh, I'm enlightened, you know, the story talks to the first person he sees and then he says, don't attach. 
Well, you did. 
But he learned quickly, didn't he? Yeah, right. 
It's like, okay, yeah, he learned quickly and then he's telling us not to do the same mistakes or whatever. 
It's like that. 
Like Ajahn Smith talks on consciousness, like you were talking about, he's referring to consciousness, maybe in the particular talks I've heard, in a very different, he's almost talking about the still awareness. 
But if you, then it's okay, then how can this consciousness be moving? Why is it moving? Where does it have to land? Why did he land it? You know, so you start, the mind starts questioning things like that. 
And so there was a whole lot of confusion until you explained now that it could really be, I'm still asking, the attention piece that connects this movement of consciousness, that is only through attention we kind of have our experiences, that's the way of thinking. 
So if the attention doesn't land, is that what they're talking about? Attention and consciousness moving is the same thing? Well, if the, I mean, all languages is relative. 
Right. 
All analogies are partial. 
You can quote me on that. 
So they can only be a good enough fit. 
So if you bear that in mind, then you're never going to get a perfect match. 
And again, like Wittgenstein said, that which we can't speak of, the mind must necessarily pass over. 
So that, that ways of expressing things can never totally capture it. 
So then, like, as we say, the mind moves. 
But, you know, like Ajahn Chahar often says, no, the mind doesn't move, objects change. 
It doesn't go anywhere. 
And, of course, in the whole chapter of non-locality and the unborn, it points out, and I was saying earlier about Sati Center, that where does not apply, essentially, because geography, three-dimensional space only applies to the physical world, that mind doesn't have a place in space where it exists. 
It only has relevance to the place, only has a relative importance or meaning in the material world. 
So saying something moves, it's just a figure of speech. 
Like saying the mind moves is that, well, it doesn't. 
Mind objects change, but the mind, where doesn't apply in terms of the mind? So how can the mind move? It can't, in essence. 
But it's just a convenient figure of speech to describe a thought arising and passing. 
So then that, what we're trying to do is cultivate the quality of attention, which is not fixating blindly or habitually on particular objects, and then saying this is good, that's bad, in an automatic and blindly, sort of unconsciously, judgmental way. 
But it's also, when talking about, say, Ajahn Smeta's use of the word consciousness, I don't know how it is in the Burmese tradition, or in Sri Lanka, or even in India, but in Thailand, virtually every Dhamma teacher pretty much has their own language, and they have their own favorite phrases, so like, the way Ajahn Mahabod talks about the jitta, it's totally different from the way that, say, Ajahn Tate would talk about the jitta, or Ajahn Buddha Dasa. 
Like, there's one teacher, Ajahn Lumpottun, who, they have a monastery next door to us, in Medesina County. 
He would, he passed away now, where he would come and lead retreats there every summer. 
And I was there, listening to him give like an hour-long discourse on the very important distinction between Jnana Dasana, knowledge and vision, and Dasana Jnana, vision and knowledge. 
They're not the same thing. 
Oh, no, don't make that mistake. 
Jnana Dasana is not the same as Dasana Jnana. 
And I'm thinking, I never even heard of that word before. 
Jnana Dasana I haven't, but it's this really big thing. 
And it was like, and it was a freak, and, you know, he was teaching there for many days, and it was a frequent subject of his Dhamma talks, was don't make the mistake of mixing up Jnana Dasana and Dasana Jnana. 
And it's like, if you're a Lumpottun disciple, it's like, yeah, great, Lumpott is really telling us how it is, you know. 
But if you're not familiar with his vernacular or what he's talking about, then after a while you think, okay, when he says Jnana Dasana, this is what he's talking about. 
Okay, when he's talking about Dasana Jnana, oh, okay, I think I get it. 
That's what he's talking about with that. 
So you have to do this, like, your own little language course with every particular teacher. 
And I'm sure it's the same Gil, I'm sure, has his own favorite phrases, Ajahn Tenisro similarly, you know, how many people here read Ajahn Tenisro's books and find you have to translate as you go along. 
And we actually asked him if he could take all his unbindings and unbind them. 
Ajahn Pusna begged permission, so can we just change your unbindings to Nibbana, please, because no one else really likes that as a translation. 
Ajahn Jeff is very fond of it, and it's accurate in many respects, but it's just not going to catch on. 
And so you find, at least when I'm reading his translations, I'm re-rendering words as I go along, but it's his prerogative to translate things as he likes. 
So that that kind of process where about when you're listening and studying, it's important, like, what's this really referring to? Okay, how does this work? If this is leading to the deathless, and if the lack of this is the path to death, now what's that talking about? And what does death mean there? Can it mean the body not breathing? What is that? So that you're always using that reflective investigative attitude when you pick up the teachings, and particularly for this sort of obstruc area of these metaphysical obstruc qualities. 
It's really important just to dig in and look for ourselves and get a sense for it, just making a neat conceptual map, doesn't really release liberators, but getting a real felt sense for how it works. 
Okay, that seems to be what it's talking about. 
Okay, that's what it's pointing to. 
Just like that, getting that sense of, oh, right, the island that you can't go beyond, you can't go beyond because it's awareness, and you can't get behind awareness. 
You can be aware, but you can't be, you can't watch, there can't be a watching of your awareness from an objective point of view because awareness is the back wall. 
That's why you can't go beyond it. 
Ah! And then see, that's why Ajahn Samedha would use that example of, you can't see your own eyes. 
I can see, but I can't see my own eyes. 
Ah, that's why you can't go beyond this, the island that you can't go beyond. 
Ah! So you're just sort of picking up the ideas and themes and sort of exploring them, and then say, okay, now I got it, that's how it works. 
That's what it's referring to, and then it's not just a set of words, like, oh, the island that you cannot go beyond, but you're mapping it onto a felt experience. 
Okay, that's what it's referring to. 
Now, what does that imply then, or where does that lead to, or what else does that bring with it? So it's like an interactive process with it. 
Yeah, it seems to be very frustrating, through different translations. 
It seems like everything could be lost in translation. 
Well, if you want consistency, you will suffer. 
Exactly. 
I found a lot of. 
. 
. 
I guarantee that, yeah. 
Yes, there was a lot of suffering, and then I said, okay, I'm just going to give up reading for a while. 
Well, you don't have to give up reading, just give up hoping for consistency. 
Right. 
Hope is a great folly. 
If I have help, then that gave me the revelation. 
I just have to stop hoping everybody would be consistent with something I had mapped out for myself. 
And it helps, you know. 
But they're all using so many different. 
. 
. 
same words in so many different ways. 
Yes. 
That's the way it is. 
Okay, so speaking of the Unconditioned and Non-Locality, and Ajahn Mahabhuva, let's go on to Chapter 9. 
And we'll have a little bit of a break after this one. 
Okay, so this is page 155. 
And this is where I tell the story about the encounter in Oxford. 
And for the second edition, we could include a piece about Sati Center. 
So the first quotation in this chapter, page 156, so this is about the quality of location. 
And one of the things that's interesting, I first really started to reflect on this when I was in retreat years ago, and I went to retreat time at a Biogiri. 
And so I noticed that even when we were doing meditation, when there was a clear sense of all experience being transient and in state of change and unsatisfactory and not self, I started to notice that even though everything was clearly not self, there was a way that it was all happening here. 
There was a here-ness to it. 
And suddenly it was like, oh, the mind is still creating a here and a there, even though there's no feeling of self, but beyond that, there's a this and a that, a here and a there, that is still being conjured into being. 
So I started to investigate that and the feeling of locational, of that located quality. 
And I realized that that was also a subtle kind of attachment. 
And so then I began to see that actually there were many teachings about non-locality and letting go of that feeling, that subtle kind of clinging of creating like an internal space of here and there. 
Even, you know, that's sort of beyond that, or more subtle than the insight into not self. 
So this chapter revolves a lot around that. 
And this particular quote from Ajama Habua, page 156 says, here as a present-day example and to illustrate the centrality of such relinquishment is the insight which arose for Ajama Habua in the period of intense practice immediately following Ajama Man's final passing away. 
It was this thought which he described as having arisen on its own, and more that it was heard rather than thought, which led to Ajama Habua's full enlightenment shortly thereafter. 
If there is a point or a center of the knower anywhere, that is the essence of a level of being. 
If there is a point or a center of the knower anywhere, that is the essence of a level of being. 
So that's like the quality of awareness or here-ness. 
He's pointing to that as the nexus of birth, of the mind being born and latching onto an identity. 
Just that quality of knowing, having a center or a here-ness, that's the beginning of the vortex, the germination of the self-delusion. 
And following on from that, then we have a couple of the most well-known passages in relationship to the unconditioned ultimate truth that are here in the canon. 
And these both come in the Udana, which is the collection of the Buddha's inspired utterances. 
And these are both from the eighth chapter of that, which is called. 
. 
. 
The book is often translated as the inspired utterances or the declarations or something like that. 
They're kind of where the Buddha made an emphatic statement. 
There is that sphere, or that sphere of being, where there is no earth, no water, no fire, no wind, no sphere of infinity of space, infinity of consciousness, of nothingness, or even of neither perception nor non-perception. 
There there is neither this world nor the other world, neither moon nor sun. 
This sphere I call neither a coming, nor a going, nor a staying still, neither a dying, nor a reappearance. 
It has no basis, no evolution, and no support. 
This, just this, is the end of dukkha. 
There is the unborn, uncreated, unconditioned, and unformed. 
If there were not, there would be no escape discerned from that which is born, created, conditioned, and formed. 
But since there is this unborn, uncreated, unconditioned, and unformed, escape is therefore discerned from that which is born, created, conditioned, and formed. 
Now there might seem unappealing. 
What? No sun, no moon, no stars. 
But again, it's important not to just sort of react to our own habitual perceptions and not thinking this is some sort of really super-duper bleak heaven. 
It might be the sort of top-notch destination, but boy, that's really unappealing. 
But if that does have that effect, there's actually, we have to include some things about the off-putting qualities of Nibbana. 
Both Ajahn Man, Ajahn Chah, and many other teachers are pointed to because there's often a remark from us like, wow, if that's what Nibbana is like, who wants to go there? You won't see your friends. 
It's going to be really boring, no music, no sunrises. 
But that's a superficial view of it. 
And it's also interesting in this passage that the verb to be that's used when the Buddha says there is, he doesn't use the ordinary kind of verb to be, which is hoti, but he uses the verb ati, which indicates the quality of being that is not in a state of time or becoming. 
It's like an essential actuality. 
So it's very rarely used in the Pali, but it's when the Buddha makes these kind of metaphysical statements like that which is beyond the normal senses and that which is outside of the realm of time and conditionality then he uses the verb ati to represent that. 
In terms of using or understanding these passages, these are really important to reflect on and consider and just taking a simple phrase from that like what is neither coming nor going nor standing still? What is that? How does that work? And on page 162 this is also a theme that Ajahn Chah used to use a lot, like not going anywhere. 
And he used a phrase at the end of his life, the last couple of years of his teaching, he used a phrase that he coined himself which was still flowing water and he'd asked people when they came to visit, have you ever seen still water? And they'd say yes. 
So you ever see flowing water? Yeah, of course. 
Did you ever see still flowing water? And then, what did he say? In Thai it's nam lai ning. 
Nam is water, lai is to flow and ning is to be still. 
Nam lai ning. 
And so he'd say nam lai ning, can hai mai? And they'd go, what? And he'd say the mind is like still flowing water but essentially the mind is still, it never goes anywhere but yet perceptions, feelings, moods, they flow through it. 
So the mind is like still flowing water. 
So you live with this all the time, so it's important that you know it. 
And then this passage, when in 1981 it was, I was living in England, it was just the early days of our monastery, the first forest monastery that we had there, Chithurst. 
And one day a letter arrived from Thailand and the handwriting was one of the American monks who lived there. 
But inside he, there was a letter from him and he said, dear Ajahn Samaidu, you're never going to believe this but Lumpur, Ajahn Chah asked me to take dictation and to send a letter from him to you. 
Ajahn Chah could write but he very rarely did and he certainly never wrote letters to anybody. 
But yet, so this was a very unusual circumstance but it was in that summer of 1981 and so then the letter said, so this is what Lumpur asked me to write. 
He said, whenever you have feelings of love or hate for anything whatsoever, these will be your aids and partners in building paramita, the spiritual perfections. 
The Buddha Dharma is not to be found in moving forwards, nor in moving backwards, nor in standing still. 
This Samaidu is your place of non-abiding. 
Chah. 
And that was the last message that ever went between Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Samaidu. 
He had a stroke and shortly after that his health degenerated over the next few months and he became paralyzed and unable to speak. 
So it was really the last instructions. 
Now you think if you had a premonition or intimation that your health was going to collapse and you're the head of 80 or 100 monasteries and you want to send a message to your chief disciple running your only branch monastery abroad, a devoted friend and student, you might think, please do this and don't do that and pass on my greetings to so and so. 
If you want to change things in this way, then go ahead. 
If you want to change them like that, then absolutely don't do it. 
List of dos and don'ts. 
By the way, this might be my last message. 
Absolutely none of that. 
Whenever you have feelings of love or hate for anything whatsoever, these will be your aids and partners. 
The Buddha Dharma is not to be found moving forwards, nor in moving backwards, nor in standing still. 
This somato is your place of non-abiding. 
So that was the most comprehensive and kind final instructions because that fits every situation that we're ever likely to encounter in our lives. 
And so if we look at things in terms of progress or degeneration or even stasis, none of that really fits. 
And so that the mind is always trying to find a sense of progress or a fear of degeneration in that things getting better, things getting worse, hope and fear. 
And what Ajahn Chah is pointing to is that fundamental quality of letting go of time, letting go of self, letting go of locality. 
It's only in that radical and complete letting go then you're able to truly be attuned to every situation. 
So it might seem extraordinarily obstruous, like non-locality, jeez, I'm a realtor, location, location, location, everyone knows that. 
It's like in the Dharma, it's non-locality, non-locality, non-locality. 
This is the true ethic for the new age. 
And so that is extraordinarily practical advice because what happens is that as soon as the mind is trying to buy into getting somewhere or afraid of things going that way and regretting they've gone the other way and creating past and future and self and other and here and there as solid realities, the more that we do that, the more that we are actually in that way out of whack with everything. 
And it's when we let those go and we can tap into this quality of non-abiding, then it's in that moment that we are able to find the right thing to do or to not do, to leave things alone or to act. 
So these passages from the Udana which can seem really far out and obstruous, they're actually, if you reflect on them, they're very distinct and practical advice that neither a coming nor a going nor a staying still, neither a dying nor a reappearance, has no basis, no evolution and no support. 
This justice is the end of dukkha. 
So it can be interesting just to take a phrase like that, no evolution, no basis, no support. 
Just ask yourself, what is that? How do I feel that? Where do I find that in myself? Does where apply? And so there's exploring that and finding that quality. 
And the Buddha very emphatically said, this justice is the end of dukkha. 
Now he wasn't making that as an idle statement. 
Now how and why could and should that be? This is the end of dukkha. 
How is that? How do I feel that? How do I experience that? What do I do with that? So that you're actually not just taking these words as a remote philosophical statement, but finding that place within your own being where there is no evolution, no basis, whether it's that kind of groundless quality of non-abiding. 
But again, as Ajahn Chah said, he'd say, in Thailand huts are always up on stilts and he'd sit on a little wicker bench under his hut and receive people. 
And he'd say, the ground here, this is an abiding, this is a becoming. 
And the floor upstairs, that's an abiding, that's a becoming. 
But the space in between, you can't stand there, can you? There's nothing to stand on. 
But this space between the upstairs and the downstairs, this is nirvana. 
There isn't a place to stand. 
Which again would frustrate people to hell. 
But long before we can't stand there, because there isn't anything to stand on. 
He says, yes. 
Okay, so if there's a question or two on that, then we can have that and then we'll. 
. 
. 
It's just before 3 now, about 10 to 3 or 5 to 3 and then we'll have a little break for a few minutes to stretch legs and use the restroom and such like. 
Ajahn. 
So in this passage on page 156 where we go through this description of it neither being this nor that, neither perception or non-perception, et cetera, et cetera. 
This being the end of dukkha. 
So that's a description of nirvana that seems easy to relate to in some way. 
The question this morning about momentary nirvana doesn't seem to fit in with this description of nirvana. 
So the idea of just non-klinging being nirvana, it doesn't jive somehow. 
Well that's interesting, isn't it? So what I would do is say, oh that's interesting. 
So how does this fit with that other experience? Because also when Ajahn Chah would be describing this, he'd say because that same not going, neither coming or going or standing still, that would be equally embodied not just in some deep state of meditation but in how you walk along the path down to the meditation hall. 
Like learning to walk without going anywhere. 
So this seems like, I mean it's referring to these subtle qualities of mind, like the sphere of neither perception or non-perception. 
But also when he says, I call it neither a coming nor a going nor a staying still, that is like when you feel that you're staying still, then it's like what is not moving? What is this stillness here? Why do I call this not moving? When I feel this going or something is arriving, where is it coming from? Is that real? So even in the midst of ordinary activity, so this isn't just referring to some deep state of meditation, it's just in that, this is how I read it, that when it's taken to its fullest extent, then it's an all-encompassing experience like Arahantship. 
But on a moment-to-moment basis it's just like, oh yes, the body is moving, the tongue is moving, but actually nothing is going anywhere. 
There's an object moving, you say my hand is moving, yes, but that which knows the hand is neither moving or not moving, space doesn't apply. 
Yes, there's movement, but there is stillness. 
So when the mind awakens to that in the midst of any ordinary activity, then it's like, oh right, that's just a figure of speech, that's just a presumption. 
Then in that moment there's a recognition, oh right, there isn't really any coming or going, aha. 
So at that moment when there's no playing, there's no dukkha. 
So then as soon as the mind then grabs that or does something with it or drifts off from that, then there's dukkha again. 
So this language is kind of dramatic. 
No sun, no moon, no stars. 
It gets your attention. 
It relates to nirvana with this kind of a description. 
This other thing is much more subtle. 
I got a flavor of it in your explanation here. 
Thank you. 
And on that note, we can have a break for five minutes or ten minutes.
