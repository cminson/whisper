Good m orning everyone. I don’t have any parti cular 
thing on my mind to  talk about today , so perhap s it’s an 
occasion for  questions you’d like to ask, or something  
you would l ike to bring up for discussion. I’d be happy to 
try to respond.   
 
Participant  1: I’d like to ask about emotions and 
moods. What I know about the m is that emotions arise 
in the body. T hey go fairly quickly . Sometimes you hang 
onto them , and sometimes they disappear. Moods I 
don’t understand , except  that they hang around a long 
time. Is there a connection between the two? Or are 
they completely different?  
 
GF: It’s a good question. I don’t kno w if I have a good 
answer. One distinction is that you can have a w hole 
series of different  emotional responses and reactions 
within a larger mood , which is more constant . You could 
be in a good mood but when someone cuts you off in 
traffic, you get irritated for a moment  – but the good 
mood is still predominant . You could be sad or angry, 
then suddenly see s omething beautiful , and, for a 
moment , feel some delight , but it doesn’t really shift your mood at all . Emotions  are momentary mental 
factors  or activities . As you said , emotions in and of 
themselves are brief . They  don’t last very long . But 
when  emotions last i t’s because we keep  refueling 
them, keep recreating them , and keep being  involved 
with them.  
 
Moods might be somethi ng we’re creating , but they are 
more subtle . For moods, a  deeper operating system in 
the mind  might be involved  than with an emotion . For 
example , someone might be momentarily afraid . An 
emotion  of fear comes through and is gone , but the 
person’s mood might persist  – maybe even for a lifetime  
– with a backgrou nd atmosphere of insecurity and 
worry . The fear of the mo ment , which  arose and passed 
may be because  a mountain lion walked into the room 
and then walked out . It made  sense to be afraid , but 
when the mountain lion left, the fear may have 
dissipated pretty quickly . However,  the insecurity might 
have to do with some really deep conditioning or lesson 
the person learned earlier in life . That lesson , that 
conditioning, that way of thinking operates at a much 
more subtle level than, “ Oh no , it’s a mountain lion!” 
This has to do with our sense of self, and our 
understanding  is of what life is about. It  might have to 
do with some deeply held emotion. T his deeper lay er is 
sometimes harder to  see. It tends to be something that 
can stick  for a longer period of time .  That’s one thing 
that I know . Is that helpful?   
Participant 1 : Yes. 
 
GF: Why is it helpful?  
 
Participant 1 : It’s helpful, first of all, because it confirms 
what I’m thinking , what I feel – that there’s a difference . 
And it confirms what I think I know about emotions . It 
isn’t very clear about moods, but it helps in the sense 
that I feel it’s worthwhile  – that I’m not going on th e 
wrong track to explore it  more .  
 
GF: It’s interesting. I t’s not direct ly connected to your 
question, but in  Buddhism sometimes  a distinction  is 
made  between two kinds of emotions. One is afflictive 
emotions ; and the other may  be call ed beneficial , 
wholesome, or skillful emotions . The afflictive emotions 
are those that hurt, such as  anger, which  – even if 
justified  – kind of hurts . Fear – it kind of hurts to be 
afraid. Self -criticism hurts. Greed (if that’s an emotion ) 
hurts  – having  the contraction around it . Afflictive 
emotions tend to be reactive . They  tend to arise out of 
some kind of clinging, holding onto so mething , or 
resisting someth ing. S ome we call  clinging -based .  
 
Then there’s a whole other class of em otions or feelings 
or moods that are not in reaction or relationship to 
anything . Afflictive emotions tend to b e in relationship to 
something  that we  want or don’t want. B ut it’s pos sible to feel joy  or to be happy independent of what’s 
happening around you, independent of reacting and 
relating to things.  It’s possible to feel love independent 
of someone you love .  
 
One thing  that can happen in meditation is that the 
afflictive emotions, the reactive emotions of the mind, 
can settle away , relax and soften . The mental system 
still has the capacity for joy, happiness, love , and a 
variety of positive feelings . They don’t arise be cause of 
a conventional reason . They arise because the inner 
ecology has , and allows them  to come forth . Someone 
who is fairly mature in the Buddhist path will probably 
experience a lot more joy in life than someone who is 
immature. They’re not creating t he joy, or thinking about 
being joyful, or trying to be joyful  – it’s just there, a 
perva sive feeling of well -being . 
 
Participant  2: I just w ant to share an observation , which  
as I think about it seems obvious , but feels important . It 
felt important through practice this morning . It was an 
inverse relationsh ip between tension and trust.  Thank 
you for the invitation to focus on tension . Something 
occurred  for me that doesn’t occur very often during my 
practice . It was memories of situat ions as a young 
person where there was  a lack of safety or trust in the 
environment . I have carried a fair amoun t of tension or 
anxiety in my day -to-day life through my development . 
Practice has really helped me over the years to recognize that , and reduce  the experience of it . I just 
wanted to share th is observation that I had today, the 
invers e relationship between tension and trust .  
 
GF: The more trust you have , the less tension?  
 
Participant 2 : Yes. It seems obvio us. But to have really 
clearly experienced that through practice this morning 
was powerful . So I just wanted to share that 
observation.  
 
GF: I think it’s wonderful to hear that . A couple of things 
I’d like to say in response. One is that another  word 
that’s been i n my mind related to trust is safety . Trust is 
a little  more internal  – you feel trusting . Safety is a little 
more external. B ut they’re closely connected , and it’s 
very hard to relax and open up deeply unless we feel 
safe. Deep trust and confidence help  us feel safe . But 
sometimes the conditions around us need to be created 
so that we can feel safe , and can open up to something . 
That’s one thing . The other is that it’s really great if the 
trust can be such that you trust opening up to yo ur 
tension . Actually, i t doesn’t have to be either /or. Rather , 
the trust can act ually support the practice so that you 
feel safe enough to feel the difficulties inside.  
 
Participant  3: When I meditate , I don’t usually focus on 
my breath . Sometimes I spend an entire 45 minutes just 
trying to relax myself . Sometimes I just observe myself. So it’s a mixture of different types of meditation . Is that 
okay , or do I have to focus on one and be good at it?  
 
GF: It’s all okay. There’s no external standard you’re 
supposed to measure yourself against in order to  be this 
kind of person, or do this kind of meditation. I think the 
standard  is, “Is it useful for you ? And w hat is most 
useful? ” So if it’s useful for you to just focus on your 
tension , or if it’s useful to observe yourself , then it’s a 
wonderful thing. Y ou’re  lucky to have found what 
benefits your life.  
 
If it’s useful to stay with your breath , then do that fo r a 
while. If you do one way of practicing for a while , and 
you have some question such as  you’re asking now , I 
think the best thing to do is not to ask a teacher for a 
categorical answer about what you should do. R ather , 
experiment . Listening to your question , I would 
encourage you to experiment f or a while with your 
breathing. F ocus  on doing breath meditation , and see if 
that’s beneficial and helpful for you.  
 
This is what I’ve learned  for myself . Sometimes I’ve had 
a certain kind of tension or preocc upation . My mind is 
stuck on something or on some feeling . So, I’ll bring my 
mindfulness to it , and try to be mindful of it carefully , 
and be present for it . I’ll do those things , and then I’ll 
stop paying attention to it , and just be with my 
breathing . Sometimes by simply being with my breathing and not focusing on it, the tension  dissolves 
more quick ly than if I’m focusing on it .  
 
There’s a way in which any kind of focus on our issues 
can very subtly reinforce them  and keep them  going . 
Sometimes it’s helpful just to put them  aside , and focus 
on the  breath as a neutral place . Then, as you’re with 
your breathing , maybe the way that issue  is fueled by 
paying attention to it  can abates, and the who le thing 
can dissolve by itself. S ometimes in meditation, I’ve 
noticed that a faster way to relax my body is just to 
really focus on my breath , rather than focusing on the 
tension . At other times , I find it useful to focus on the 
tension . As I said earlier today , it varies . It’s not one 
way. Part of becoming a wise meditator is 
experimenting  – learning a number of different ways , 
and which way is good at a  given time.  
 
Great ! Thank you for these q uestions.
