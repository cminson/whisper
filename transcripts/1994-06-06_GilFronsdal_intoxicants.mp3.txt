 Okay, so today I was going to do the last of the precepts. I haven't done a series talking about the five lay Buddhist precepts. And before I tell you what the fifth one is, those of you who don't know what it is, I thought I'd tell you a story. The Buddhist monastics have 227 precepts they have to follow. So the five lay precepts are small things compared to that. And there was a monk who wanted to disrobe at the time of the Buddha. And so the Buddha asked him, why do you want to disrobe? And he said, well, there's too many rules for me to follow. I'm not very bright. I can't remember all 227. So if I can't remember them, I can't live by them very well. And so I shouldn't really be a monk. So the Buddha said, well, something like he said, well, some of them are minor precepts. You don't have to necessarily follow all of them. Could you follow 100? And he said, no, even 100 is too much for me to memorize and learn. He said, well, how about 20? That's too much for me. It's really hard. I can't remember anything. I can't remember my phone number or anything. And so then I would say, well, about 10. No, it's too much too. What about five? What about two? And he paused for a little bit and he said, yeah, I could probably do two. And then Buddha said, okay, there are two precepts for you to follow. Seek wisdom and cultivate compassion. Those are the two precepts. So there's a strong tendency in the Buddhist tradition to stress the positive formulation of the precepts, more so than the negative formulation of them. And the negative, not to kill, not to steal, not to lie, no sexual misconduct, no intoxication. And the positive formulation of these five, for example, are sometimes given in order, loving kindness and compassion, generosity. And for no sexual misconduct, it's contentment. And for lying, it's telling the truth. And finally, for no intoxication, it's mindfulness, which is a central thing that we're practicing in our group here, practice of mindfulness. And if we look at the positive formulation of the fifth precept, not to intoxicate the mind as being that we've practiced mindfulness, I think it's important to underline that probably there's no spiritual path practice anywhere, certainly in Buddhism, without the cultivation of mindfulness, without the development of awareness and presence. And so to do something which clouds the mind and leads to heedlessness or clouds the mind and leads to our inability to be mindful and stay mindful, just makes kind of matter of fact sense that that goes against the very effort we're trying to do here. So rather than thinking of it so much as a prohibition, we can think of the positive that we're really trying to cultivate clarity of mind. And so we want to avoid those things which get in the way of that. That understanding of the fifth precept tends to avoid the kind of moralistic overtones that sometimes exist in the West, that somehow it's a moral failing to drink alcohol or be an alcoholic or something, but rather focus more on the benefits that come and the hindrance to a spiritual life that come with intoxication. I've heard some Buddhist teachers say that most human beings, unless they're enlightened, have some version of addiction, that most of us are, you know, I'm Gil and I'm recovering from life. That underlying, underscoring, underlying much of the way in which most human beings engage in life, there's a lot of attachment, there's a lot of addictive attachment, there's a lot of tremendous neediness or desire which propels some of the core things that we do with our lives. The need for security, desire for security, for well-being, for relationships. It isn't simply the desires that are there in kind of a neutral way or easy, healthful way, but there can be an addictive quality to it, a demanding quality to it. So the fifth precept stated negatively goes something like this, a translation to Pali. For the sake of training, for the sake of cultivation of mindfulness, the sake of practicing mindfulness, practicing spiritual path, for that sake I am going to refrain from taking intoxicants, drugs and alcohol, which cloud the mind, sometimes it's translated, which lead to heedlessness, doing activity we're not aware that we're doing. Now that wording is a little bit tricky or a little bit ambiguous, so much so that there's two ways of interpreting it. And one interpretation is the Buddha said, no alcohol, no drugs, no intoxicating drugs at all, just very flat out. And the other interpretation is it's fine, it's okay to take some alcohol, perhaps some drugs, some alcohol, as long as it doesn't affect your mind, as long as you don't lose your heedlessness or your mindfulness, as long as it doesn't cloud your decision-making ability, your ability to see clearly what's going on. And this is the way that I was taught in my first many, many years of Buddhist practice, especially in the Zen tradition, where it was worded, the fifth precept was worded, refraining from abusing intoxicants. So it's different than saying refraining from taking intoxicants, refraining from abusing taking intoxicants. This last year I was talking to another teacher, someone who I kind of think of as kind of a teacher for me, someone I respect a lot, and his advice to me is something I usually listen to carefully. And we were talking about the precepts and he expressed a little bit of discomfort that he had heard that some Vipassana teachers drink alcohol. And I thought, you know, they shouldn't be doing that. They should be clear. As teachers of the Dharma, they should be very clear examples of, you know, no alcohol at all, no intoxicants at all. And so then I told him, well, I guess I fell on the camp of the teachers who drink sometimes. I said that it's very rare. It seems like once or twice a year, I have like maybe half a bear or something. It's not much. And I'm somewhat circumspect about doing it. So like, for example, I usually don't rather not not a secret. I just told you also. But I usually feel a little bit circumspect about doing it so that people in the Sangha know. People in the Sangha know. Because I know a lot of people are struggling with issues of alcohol and drugs. And I think it's maybe more supportive not to be an example of someone who drinks. So I don't hide the fact, but I try not to show it. I try to do it. I try to, I wouldn't do it in the Sangha function or something like that or a potluck. But it's pretty rare. I don't really care to drink so much, but I do. It's very rarely. I told my friend this, that occasionally I have something. And he very pointedly said to me, Gil, I would like you to seriously consider refraining from all use of intoxicants. And he never told me anything that pointedly. He didn't tell me don't. You don't drink at all. He asked me very respectfully, he said, I want you to really seriously consider this thing about intoxication, about alcohol. Because he felt very strongly as a Dharma teacher, I shouldn't drink. So that's an interesting question. So I'm wondering about that. And maybe as a Dharma teacher, I should have a clear opinion on this topic than I do. Maybe I'm influenced by the way that I was trained in my Zen tradition where it said, no abuse of intoxicants. I certainly don't, I don't think I qualify as an abuser. But I'm not completely refraining. So I thought that's an interesting topic for us to discuss. Not, you know, you don't have to weigh your opinions about what I should do. Unless you're strongly moved or something. But what are your thoughts around this dilemma of how this precept is interpreted? Is it to interpret it strictly and say absolutely no intoxicants, no drugs, no alcohol? Or is there a place where maybe for a practitioner, for a Dharma practitioner, maybe it's okay as long as it's done very clearly without any, you know, any, any intoxication of that, of any change, any change in the mind, any cloudiness or dizziness. So we have someone. Where would the use of tea or coffee, and the thing you can paint caffeine, which changes on perception and the work? And sugar and television and movies, advertisement. So once we kind of extend. They're strong, and I've never seen any formal statement in any Buddhist tradition prohibiting caffeine. In fact, in Thailand, the monks drink lots of it because they don't, they're not allowed to drink juice, for example, depends on the tradition, but they're very, very limited what they can drink after 12 o'clock. And, you know, but you can drink tea, or you can drink coffee as long as, in some traditions, as long as it has no milk in it. And you can put sugar in, but no cream. And so some people would say that coffee sharpens the mind. And certainly some zen, zen monks who drink green tea before they meditate, they're doing it with the idea it sharpens the mind. My own experience with it is that it's a kind of a, and I don't think it's, I don't know, when I say it's universal, it's my experience of drinking caffeine, is that the benefits are short-lived, and that there's often a kind of a downside of it afterwards, unless I have some more. And also that I find that a few times I've taken some caffeine product when I'm doing a lot of meditation, it actually keeps me slightly, even though I can be more present in a certain kind of way, at the same time it keeps me more agitated, kind of more restless, more agitated. It's hard to really settle in a very deep way. It's not so unusual for people who do go on retreats to decide to avoid caffeine drinks while they're on retreats. And often there's a three or four day period of withdrawal, it's kind of difficult. But they, a few people have told me about this, and their experience say that actually the meditation actually gets a lot more subtle in the absence of the kind of sharpness that comes from, or alertness that comes from coffee. But the Buddha didn't weigh down this topic, and so it's a very personal, kind of each person, part of the way Dharma practice works, the mindfulness works, I believe, is that it involves us using our abilities, our good judgment, and using our ability of trial and error, and trying something and being very honest about the consequences, and learning from the consequences. So if we're really mindful of what happens when we drink caffeine, and really attentive to the consequences, we'll get the feedback we need to know. And we get the feedback that tells us whether it's useful or not. Do you want to say more? Yes. I found pretty early in my practice that the mindfulness actually made me much more sensitive to the effects of alcohol, and so even after a very small amount I can tell the difference, and my mindfulness wasn't as clear. And it's to the point now, or if I even take one small sip, that instantly I can feel it in my body. And it affects my meditation. So I have stopped for that reason. But on the other hand, I notice also if I watch a movie, that I will all catch my meditation from several days. But I haven't stopped watching movies. When I was 19, I think, I was initiated into TM meditation. It was my first meditation that I did. And I went to go do the initiation, and they told me, oh, you have to come back in a month, I think. I forget how many weeks it was. Because we won't do it until you haven't had any marijuana for a week, for a month. And I was a college student back then, and marijuana was prevalent enough. And so that's what they told me how to do. So I went back and stopped smoking entirely, and whatever the probation period was, their idea was you have to kind of clear out your system. And then I went back and got initiated. And then a few times since then, I had the occasion of smoking some marijuana. And I found, as Andrea said about alcohol, I found it to have a huge kind of negative effect on my meditation. Not just simply in the clarity and building to see clearly and get settled and concentrated. But my experience was the meditation makes me sensitive to the maybe we could call it the undertone of experiences. So even some experiences which the overtone, the surface appearance is they're very pleasurable. The undertone is that they're actually agitating and unpleasant. And I found that with marijuana was that when I started getting more clear in my mind and sensitive to what was going on, there certainly was kind of an overtone of some sort of kind of pleasure. But since I was tuning into the undertone, the foundation of it, I could actually felt the the irritation of the state also. Yes, Mark. Since you brought the subject up, a lot of, you know, in a way it's interesting because the the Dharma seemed to have been brought to the west a lot through LSD experience. And a lot of the original teachers, you know, kind of were first opened up and even Ram Dass's Guru Maharishi called it Christ, you know, the essence of Christ. And it's interesting that, I mean, I actually I've had similar experience to you with with marijuana where it used to expand my awareness, made me think differently about things. And there was a point where it brought me down that my moment to moment presence was I didn't want to disturb that with anything like that. But if you have any comments on something like psychedelics, that some people consider sacramental. Yeah, yeah. That's a very interesting topic. I would probably change a little bit what you said about it. You know, LSD brought a Dharma to the west. I think LSD opened, it's true what you said, but it opens a lot of people up to a whole different dimension of how to live. And then they went looking for where they could kind of strengthen that or develop that. And some of them went to Buddhism and different traditions. Some of the Dharma centers that were built in the 60s and early 70s in America, not in the Vipassana tradition, because we didn't have any of that back then, were built by donations from sizable drug money, drug profits of various LSD dealers. So in that sense, also LSD helped. Bring the tradition to the west. And you know, here in Silicon Valley, we're now trying to develop a Dharma center also. We would like to have a different kind of chip that would finance our efforts. So yeah, I think that I have tremendous respect and appreciation of how effective and powerful that LSD and other drugs like that had an opening of people to a whole new dimension of life. And most of the people I knew who were opened by that and then went to practice at some point stopped taking LSD. So there was, so, you know, at some point, they also, I think, as they developed their mindfulness, their clarity, their compassion, there was something about the LSD that wasn't quite satisfying. It had done there, it opened them up, but then it wasn't really doing, you know, it was a problem, becoming a problem. I lived for a short, for a while. One of the very important openings for me into the world of spiritual practice was I lived in a place called the farm in Tennessee. Some of you know the farm. And it was Stephen Gaskin's commune. Stephen Gaskin was one of the gurus of the, he was an English professor at San Francisco State in the mid-60s. And he took a lot of acid and and became this great guru for the acid generation. And then he went on tour around the country on this big school bus. And all his followers got school buses and was like big caravan of a hundred school buses and they were snaking away across America. And every time they came to a state border, the police would stop them. And they finally settled in Tennessee and built this huge commune. And when I was there, there were some like seven, eight hundred people who lived there. And Stephen Gaskin said that his, he had three gurus, three spiritual teachers in his life. Suzuki Roshi, the abbot to the San Francisco Zen Center back then, his U.S. Marine Corps drill sergeant and LSD. But at the farm, by the time I got there, Stephen Gaskin and the farm had foresworn the use of synthetic drugs entirely. They no longer were doing any acid at all. And what they substituted with was truth telling. And that's why I stated the farm when I got there. These people had cultivated and developed the ability to speak the truth to each other, to a degree to which I had never seen before in my life. And I was just blown away. And that's why I stayed for as long as I did, was to be around people who knew how to speak the truth. And people who are new there, it would take them a while to kind of learn how to do it. And sometimes it'd be hours of discussion, you know, and then after a while they kind of get catch on next time and maybe just an hour. And the next time it'd be 15 minutes and sooner or later all you have to do is kind of wink at someone. You know, people understand what was going on. Almost wink, wink. Do people stop being so defensive? You know, truth telling is very powerful. So it's very interesting. They substitute truth telling for LSD. Isn't that something? Yes. I think someone who spends a fair amount of time studying how the brain works, to me, there's a continuum between movie watching and LSP and everyday life experience, all of which impact this very complex combination of chemicals that you have in your head. And so the precepts are really great because they provide all, they provide together a context for watching us changes on that very complex area, in that very complex area. And so balancing it out. The balance of the middle way is the thing that kind of resonates with me. And along those lines, do you know about Sylvia's workshop on April 4th? No. Sylvia Morstein and someone she knows is an MD whose name escapes me, doing a workshop on April 4th at Spirit Rock from 7 o'clock to 9.30. And the title of the seminar is Meditation or Medication, how to decide which to use. And that's going to bring up some of the dishes, I think. That's it. You know, the wisdom of playing with that brain chemistry and how to kind of tell where you are in that space. Well, this is a very important topic. Not for now, I think, but this is the whole issue of medication or meditation. When I was at the farm in Tennessee, so I was 20. And we lived in, it was a big commune, but we lived in these little clusters. So I was in a tent, U.S., big U.S. Army tent in the snow in Tennessee in the wintertime and wood-burning stove in the middle. And we had one big bed and there were, we had a little sub-commune, right? There was like 12 of us who lived in that tent and we cooked for each other, took care of each other and kind of lived their life together. And so each of these little pods or clusters would, regularly these people who were original characters would show up at the farm, original personalities. And it was often a little bit difficult to know how to handle these people, but what they do, they would assign one of these original people to one of these pods of 12. It would be 12 of us taking care of one of these original people. And that was just about it, you know, all we could handle if there was two was too much. And so we won. And we got someone who was as close as I could tell, you know, autistic. He would, you know, just sit. What he'd like to do was read Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind. That was it. He would sit on the, in this big, easy chair, just, that's all he did. And if you tried to engage with him, there was nothing there. And, you know, he wouldn't do anything besides just sit there and read Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind. I know it's a good book, but... And so we, you know, there was some various, I don't remember all things, but it was very complicated how, you know, to be with him. He was a very complicated person. And we did all kinds of things, try to get his attention and try to snap him out of it. Some of it, you know, I didn't think it was very skillful or very healthy or appropriate, but all of us, you know, none of us were trained in psychology. We're all basically, you know, teenagers are just a little bit beyond. And I remember looking at some of the things we were trying to do, you know, trying to help this person or cope with him. And I felt very strongly at the time. He said, you know, I think maybe there's a misunderstanding here of, that he has a, he might have some physiological chemical problem. And it's inappropriate for us to be trying to deal with it as a spiritual problem. And I think this confusion is one that's going to, has existed a lot in Western spiritual, in Dharma circles and will probably continue forever because Dharma practice is offered as a way of helping people suffer less. But in that some people suffer because of their physiology, their chemistry. It sometimes has been inappropriate to kind of constantly be offering a new meditation practice and this and that to do, and they can't succeed. And they just kind of feel really rotten about themselves because, you know, they're not successful at all. All their favorite teachers are telling to do something and they can't accomplish it. And then finally they take some like Prozac and then they feel a lot better and they realize, wait a minute, you know, there was another story, there's something else going on here. So I think there's a very gray line. I don't think there's a fine line between when medication, when meditation is called for. And sometimes both are called for. But I think that's something which all of us, including myself, would do well in educating ourselves much more about. Yes? About, I guess, 13 years ago, I became very ill and I had to pay, I had to get rid of alcohol and sugar and chemicals in my system. And I was at the same time deeply involved in my, in the beginnings of my biggest practice, meditation practice, and also Dallas, the body practices. And I came to understand that living here is so toxic that there's really no difference between synthetic medications and vegetables that have sex style in the effect that they have on the system or the amount of coffee and sugar that the culture consumes in order to hold the taste of the culture. Or the food that they eat that's contaminated with antibiotics that are given to the chicken. And there's having to pay attention to that in my system. I saw that there was just absolutely no end to the amount of things that were being put into my system. I remember writing down everything that I rubbed on my body. One of my body was deodorants, hairsprays and nail polishing, makeup, skin lotion, or the coat or anything. If you take that whole chemical soup and you put it together in terms of the average person, it's really hard to imagine how much of a film goes across the mind and the immune system and our consciousness. So it's not just alcohol. And the more you get rid of it, we were just talking about this earlier, the hot luck, the more you get rid of these things, coffee and sugar and chemistry, the more sensitive you become to everything. And the more you are in mindfulness, the more sensitive you are to the extraordinarily, the life that you live, the rest of the stuff is net sized with all this other stuff. And this is like what Andrea was saying. I think people who do have a meditation practice usually will begin it sooner or later to feel that they would rather not do anything that kind of clouds their minds. The interesting thing about alcohol that's different than eating food that has insecticides on it or something is that the abuse of alcohol usually involves some unwholesome motivations. It usually involves an attempt to try to avoid some part of life, to deny some part of life, to avoid some kind of suffering that we have. And so it isn't just simply a neutral thing that we do, but we're often motivated by our personal pain. And it can be very difficult for someone who's spent a lot of time trying to avoid their pain, avoid their stress or difficulty, to do mindfulness practice, which actually requires you to look at that pain very honestly. And it's part of what mindfulness practice then entails is developing the compassion and loving kindness and self-acceptance that helps a person very gently and carefully open up to that which is very difficult inside of them, the pain inside of them. So one of the ways to look at this issue of intoxicants is what are the choices we make? What's behind the choices we make in drinking alcohol or taking drugs? What's the motivation behind it? I think it's very easy to be motivated to drink, for example, because we feel a little bit overly stressed or overwhelmed by life. Yes? One of the things in 12-step programs is this about avoiding slippery places. Yes. And to me that's very helpful because I mean really anything can be an addiction, whether it's running or whatever. And so if we're using the mindfulness techniques in very in a very step-by-step way examining what's happening in the mind when we move up to some sort of behavior, we can learn what our slippery places are and they may be very different for us. And one of the slippery ways it works is that if you learn one slippery place, one place where we tend to be addictive and you learn how not to do that, the addictive tendencies might still be there or the tendencies want to avoid our suffering still there. So we'll just choose something else to do it. So if we're great, we've finished alcohol, that's great. So now let's do food. And then we finish food and then let's do sex and then let's do movies and then let's do, you know, and so there has to be, you know, the mindfulness needs to not just simply involve giving something up, but really honest looking down at the roots of what motivates our behavior. And that line, one of the great things to in that taking alcohol or drugs sometimes involves a certain kind of desire, the stronger the addiction, I guess the stronger the desire. One of the really, I think it's kind of fun, challenging certainly at times, things you can do with the mindfulness practice is to ride out the desire. Next time some really strong desire comes on. Don't get into it, you know, but really sit down and meditate with it and feel what it's like to ride a desire out. It's like surfing, you know, the wave builds and gets stronger and stronger and then it kind of breaks. And it's really amazing to list, to feel how the sense of compulsion, the inner sense of pressure and demand, it has to be right now. And it's so important, this is the most important, this desire needs to be fulfilled. And then it crests and peaks and then it fades away. And then two minutes later, there's no more, you know, what happened to that? You're completely at peace. So that I call riding out a desire. I strongly recommend it. It gives the person a lot of personal strength to have had some experience in riding out desires. Because then when in the future, when some strong desire arises, you have enough experience to know there's a temporary passing phenomena. And that you don't have to believe the compulsion that's behind it. It's fun. It's like surfing. Yes. I heard the precepts also read the cycle of Buddha is not intoxicating itself or others. I wondered what you got to say about that for others. Yeah, in the Zen centers, that's the way they sometimes word that precepts. It isn't simply avoiding intoxicating oneself, but we also don't support or intoxicate, cause other people to get intoxicated. I mean, that seems like it makes a lot of sense. You know, you shouldn't do it that way to others. In the Theravāda tradition, kind of separate from the precepts, one of the very strong kind of, one of the strongest things that Buddha said in advising lay people was in what kind of livelihoods a person should not be engaged in. And usually a Buddha, I think, was very accepting of people, but there were certain livelihoods, certain kind of work that absolutely prohibited if you were going to do some kind of meditation practice or spiritual Buddhist practice. And one of those, I think, were four or five in that list, and one of those is dealing with intoxicants, selling or for other people. That's completely taboo for a Buddhist to be selling alcohol. So you can do that with what you wish, but that's what the Buddha said. In a way, aren't the precepts kind of like training wheels to get to more in like a state of mind, and then the ethics kind of flow naturally when you, as you develop. Yes, yes, as she says, isn't it, aren't the precepts kind of like training wheels, that once you get to more mature spiritual state, that, you know, your wisdom and compassion kind of, your behavior kind of is aligned naturally with the precepts. It's not a matter of needing to try to live by them, it's just who you are. And that's, I think, very true. As a person becomes more developed, the precepts, in a sense, become less and less needed. Training wheels is a good word. In some sense, the five precepts are kind of like remedial spirituality. I mean, it's like, it's like, you know, the absolute, you know, basics, you know, I mean, you should, you know, you should have that under, you should take care of that. You know, if you don't have that taken care of, to some serious degree, you know, you need to go to remedial spiritual school and get that kind of taken care of. And then, go on from there. So, I think it's time to stop. And I hope that this series on the precepts was useful and interesting for you. And I was told once that we didn't have enough discussion around some of these topics. So if there are important issues that some of you feel like you want to talk to me about, please come and talk to me about. I think they're very important. I don't want to diminish their importance by saying the remedial. I don't want to diminish the tremendous challenge and difficulty in working with them and the tremendous respect I have for people who are really struggling hard with them. They're not so easy. But they're well worthwhile to grapple with. Thank you all. Good night.
