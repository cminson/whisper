 Any others? I'm Hugh McMillan and this is on this Thursday night series, there are a group of us who talk now and then. I find each time I come to do this that even though I've been practicing for a long time, I feel very unqualified to talk. So, I hope you can be forgiving in your nature. Tonight I'd like to talk about fear, which I guess is what I just talked about. I'd like to talk to begin with about the pervasive role that fear plays in our lives. And what I interpret the Buddha suggests that we can do about that. This topic came to mind, I was in Israel for a month. In October, I have children that live there and grandchildren. And I've been, this has been my family existence for 30 years now. So, I go there many times, but I've been particularly struck in this last visit. Since the Intifada started two years ago. So, that it's my first visit since then and even though terrorism had existed prior to that, it was not at the scale that it is now. And what really struck me about my visit to Israel was that insofar as I observed, it seems that the Israelis have made a pretty committed decision not to let terrorism interfere with their lives. I went to a restaurant one night that was bombed the next night. There were people there the night after that. I went, we went drove by a bus stop every day where there was a bombing while I was there and the people were at the bus stop the day after the bombing. I was very, kids were out in the streets at night walking to school, playing in the streets on their bikes. It reminded me a lot of how it was when I grew up. That kids were free to play. And at the time I was there, the sniper attack occurred on the East Coast and my impression is that although I wasn't on the East Coast that this sniper basically created house arrest for about three states where people did not do very much of their normal living out of fear. The contrast was very striking and it got me starting to think about it, thinking about our reaction to September 11th. Thinking about our reactions to child molestation fears, child abduction fears. And the contrast is pretty strong. I don't know if any of you have seen this recent film that Michael Moore has made about Remembering Columbine or that's approximately the title. I haven't seen that film but My daughter tells me that Michael Moore in this film explores what he calls a culture of fear in this country. Michael Moore lives in Michigan and he goes across the border to Canada and Toronto where Toronto is actually a bigger city than Detroit. Not very far away, 50 miles perhaps. People in Toronto don't lock their doors. He goes door to door and opens people's doors and when the people are inside they don't react in a frightened way. It's a very striking exposure that he makes about what has happened to us as a culture. So I started making a list about how have we imprisoned ourselves in our fear? Starting at the exterior level of our societal functioning. Now this is my list. It's not complete. You might even disagree with it, but it is my list of things that I think are motivated primarily by fear. At the top I would start with our desire to dominate the world. The functionings of our government, our army, our police, environmentalism on the other side of the political picture but nonetheless very fear driven about how things might get really bad. Our insurance industry, homeland security, racial segregation, gated communities, supervised childhood. And at the most mundane everyday level, how hard it is to make eye contact with people on the streets. In our now urbanized community around here. These are not experiences that I grew up with. This is happening to us on an ongoing basis. And now we have a media pandering to our desires. One of the operative phrases for the media is if it bleeds, it leads. Now I'm not proposing that fear is entirely useless. There are obviously important areas of fear. There are very helpful to our survival. Walking across the freeway is an obvious example. There are many, many others. I'm not suggesting that we do away with fear, but I am suggesting that there are different ways to hold fear. And the thing that I grew up with, I grew up with, Roosevelt's legacy was the idea that we should be, have freedom from fear. And I don't think, and that seems to be actually what we're striving for in this society, freedom from fear. I don't think that that's achievable. And I think, the Buddha has many things to say about that. I think, which I'm going to get to, I think that what we have to do instead is think about a different way of coexisting that might be freedom with fear that we can actually learn to live with fear and manage it in a constructive way in our lives and not let it be a destructive force in our lives. Because, and now I want to go to what Buddha has to say about this, the Four Noble Truths to start with. The first of those Four Noble Truths is that there is suffering. It's an impersonal, reality that there is suffering. It arises, passes away. All of the afflictive emotions come up, whether you want them to or not. And it's our assignment, if we so choose, to decide how to respond to that, not to eliminate it, but to respond to it in a way that's not destructive to our lives. The second Noble Truth is the origin of suffering. How does suffering come about? It comes about through craving. Craving for things that we want to grasp closer to ourselves or craving to push things away. But craving, by its very nature, gives rise to its own renewal. I want to give you a very mundane example here. I live in an old house. I haven't locked my door for years. There's nothing in it worth stealing. It's not like I'm some higher being. It's just nothing worth worrying about here. My daughter came to live with me, and next door a house was being built, and I found that there was a homeless person living in that house, a person who I judged to not be particularly trustworthy regarding my daughter's safety. I did some fence mending. I put a lock on my side gate. I fixed the fence, and it seemed like the least I could do. Once I had done that, once I had put the lock on the gate and fixed the fence, then I had to start thinking about, well, you know, I mean, I've got glass in my windows. I mean, it's really not very useful that I just have this fence, and this gate's only six feet high. I mean, should I build it higher? Should I start putting bars on the windows? Should I worry about locking this gate every night? And so there was a whole proliferation of mental activity that I actually induced by taking that first step of putting the lock on the gate, which seemed like at the time I did it, like the least I could do. But it does point toward what happens in our minds as we invest in emotions. They take on a life of their own. They gather momentum. They start running along. They build habits of mind. You can really get caught up in these things. You can spend a lot of time on it. The third noble truth is the cessation of suffering. And that's simply the cessation of craving, the attachment to the being caught in whatever the emotional state is that's creating the suffering. It is not the cessation of the arising of these emotions. It's the cessation of being caught by them. It's a very important distinction. There's nothing in the Buddha's teachings that I know of that suggests that as you are mindful and that you actually eliminate the arising of afflictive emotions, but you strive to reduce the amount of time that you're caught by them. And I suppose one might say enlightenment then is when you notice them immediately, you are not caught by them, and they simply pass over like the wind. But they do arise. That is a condition independent of yourself. It is a condition of the human mind that these emotions arise. So how do we do this cessation of suffering? The fourth noble truth is the way leading to the cessation of suffering. And in a nutshell, that's mindfulness. That is the clear understanding and acceptance of the processes that are arising. There's a bumper sticker I've seen around recently, which I really like a lot. I don't know if you've seen it. It says something approximately like... Just because you thought it doesn't mean it's true. Mindfulness is the achievement of recognizing what is actually happening as opposed to what your mind's mental proliferations are suggesting. We all know our minds are extremely active. They have a life of their own. They run open loop all the time. And they don't seem to stop. It's sort of like as an organ, they kind of do what the heart does. They just do it in a different way. The heart beats, beats, beats, the mind thinks, thinks, thinks. And it's not about shutting down the mind and keeping it from thinking. That is not enlightenment. It's not about basically giving yourself a lobotomy. It's about realizing that what the mind is saying and telling you isn't necessarily true. That the demand is to develop a skill of understanding that there are many levels of looking at what this language is that the mind is speaking. And seeing beneath the superficial proliferation of the mind. And what the Buddha is promising is that if you do see clearly what is happening, and not only see it, but can accept it in an open, non-judging way, which is very hard in our society. We've been taught all of our lives to have critical judgment of things, to simply accept that this is what our mind is doing right now. That it actually disempowers the mind's hold on us. So it's as if there are two parts of the mind. The part that does this running on constantly, and there's this other part that has the capacity to watch that first part, this kind of observer position, and actually just say, that's okay. Go ahead and do that. But I'm not going to let that stuff that you're coming up with run my life. So there's a kind of a duality to the mind in what is being proposed here. There are a number of mental activities and emotions particularly that get in the way of being mindful. There are that set of emotions which are very attractive to us, greed and lust, desire. There's another set of emotions that are very repulsive to us. In a certain way, we want to push things away, hate, anger, fear. And I want to focus on those two, but then there are three others, restlessness, inability to really be quiet and watch what's going on, sloth, torpor, the inability to watch what's going on because you're simply zoned out, or doubt that there's any point to this exercise. But I'd like to focus on the first two, those emotions that pull at us, we pull toward them and the ones that we push away. Now the role of fear as a hindrance, in my experience, is that it tends to not be the obvious emotion that's happening. I think this is particularly true for men. I think our social conditioning for men says that fear is basically unacceptable. I can't speak from personal experience, but my hunch is that that's not true for women as much, and so women are more able to recognize fear when it comes up. But as men, we have a lot of other tricks that hide fear from us. We get angry, we get aggressive, hostile, we hate, we do those kinds of nihilism. There are 11 kinds of things. But also I think that underneath a lot of the positive emotions like greed and desire, actually fear is playing a role. Not always, but I think often. And I think fear motivates, fear of not being accepted motivates people in their behavior about dressing properly, acquiring material wealth, being thought well of in the community. Lots of activities that can take up a lot of life energy are at a deeper level possibly motivated by fear. Now the problem is that what mindfulness is assigning us is that we have to understand not just what the surface emotion is that we are feeling right now, that could be, let's say, as an example, rage. But if we don't recognize that underneath that rage or anger is actually fear, and as a simple example, I'm sure we've all experienced in our fear of being rejected, that when somebody does reject us we immediately react with some kind of defensive rage about, well, you know, they're full of shit, whatever we do. So it's very simple to go right immediately from fear to rage and not get it that what's really going on is fear. And mindfulness and what it brings as a promise is not going to be fulfilled if we stop at the rage. We have to see, we have to continue to investigate, continue to look underneath what that first obvious emotion is, to be sure, perhaps that is the only emotion, perhaps it's simply anger or rage, but it's often something underneath. And if we don't get to the underneath, we will not be able to open to the right thing. We're going to be basically opening to rage when actually it's fear that's underneath. And the fear will continue to work its magic on us without any alleviation. And I'm going to give a very personal example about this. I was on a retreat a number of years ago and the retreat was interrupted by my brother calling to tell me that my long, lifelong friend's daughter had died in an automobile crash. I'd been on a retreat for about two months at the time and it was extremely disruptive news. And I watched myself react to this news and what I saw, the way I reacted was I began to immediately explain away, my friend's daughter's death with this internal litany. They didn't raise her right. She always drank too much. She always partied too much. She wasn't serious. They didn't do what they needed to do, take care of business, yada yada yada. And meanwhile, I was also beating myself up at the same time saying, what kind of a friend are you? Your friend's child has died and you're running this judgment trip on them. And it took me a number of hours to realize that what was really going on was that I was afraid that the same thing had happened to my own children. And in an effort to control my fear, I was differentiating myself from my friend. Rather than recognizing the human bond between us, I was separating myself. And as soon as I saw that it was fear that was working, that whole energy of that thinking process dissolved. And my whole emotional state turned to compassion and love and sorrow and all the things that one would have hoped for, but I wasn't able to come up with until I actually saw what was holding us apart. I want to give another example with a slightly different lesson. One of the unpleasant things I've learned about myself, although I try to accept it, is that in the silence of retreat, my mind has an obsessive planning mode. It has two or three modes, but the one I want to bring up now is it loves to run in these... My mind basically likes to run in two or three different ruts. It doesn't like unfamiliar territory. It prefers to run over familiar territory, and one of my familiar territories is planning. I'm a really good planner. And I used to spend quite a bit of time congratulating myself about that. I thought, you're really cool, man. You just never... You get everything right to begin with. You never get to the beach and you've forgotten your umbrella or whatever, you know. And suddenly... And this planning function on retreat would just go berserk, because when you're on retreat, there isn't anything that you have to do. So your mind is... It can just idle along on any rut that it wants to run on. In my mind, we'd get into this planning mode, and it would plan things for like a year from now, when everybody might be dead. And it really got boring and absurd, but I finally came to realize that that planning was motivated by fear. It was, for me at least, what I got down to when I really looked at it was, it was a fear of being thought badly of, of making a mistake and being judged as a fool. That was actually motivating all this activity, that I would actually make a mistake. Sounds pretty silly, but that's what was going on. Well, when I came to realize that, it's not like my mind then, in this sense of release from suffering, my mind didn't stop planning. My mind has this very, very old habit. It still comes up. But it doesn't have the hold on me it used to have. When it comes up now, usually pretty early into the planning cycle, I realize, oh yeah, there you go again, you know, it's no big deal, you don't have to worry about it. It's not going to happen until next year. And I spend a lot less time really caught in it. I spend a lot less suffering around it. And so, to me, that is the, my own personal experience about this opportunity. It's not like it goes away, but its hold on me is enormously released. Not totally, but greatly. And this gives me the opportunity to stop it at that point, rather than to start to act out, in whatever way that that particularly obsessive thinking pattern might cause me to act out, and then create more damage in my life. It gives me that opportunity to do that. So I'd like to close with a couple of quotes from Thich Nhat Hanh along this line. With deep looking, the body ceases to be an aggregate of grasping, and you dwell in freedom no longer caught by fear. Non-fear is the basis of true happiness. The greatest gift we can offer others is our non-fear. So, thank you. Are there any questions? I'm happy to... Hi, actually. So what do you do when you have the fear come up in your, the fear of the future, or the fear of getting over the death of what happens to the kids? How do you deal with it? I guess the first thing I would say is, as the fear comes up, it's a question of deciding what is the fear that's actually coming up. It might be manifesting itself as, let's say, for example, what happens to my kids. But if underlying that is a fear of change in general, or your own mortality, then I think in order to really have mindfulness come into play, you have to get to the root of what the motivating fear is, and then be able to accept it. That's the nature of life that we have, this kind of fear. It's... The Buddha says, I mean, life is aging, sickness, lamentation, grief, despair. That's the nature of life. And it's not anything about you. It's about our nature. And to be able to accept that as a condition of being alive, fully accept it, is the only way to release its hold on you. Not to say that once you've done that it won't come back again, but that for the moment it will release its hold, and when it comes back again, then you try to be mindful about it again. There's something left out of this, which is an important aspect to this in some teachings, which is, it's important not only to look at what the mental state is, but also how your body is holding this kind of emotion. For a lot of people, I think it may be more about the body's tensions and stress and pains and aches, as it is about whatever mental images are created. And the mindfulness activity is applied to both the mind and the body. And the implicit language of Buddhism is that those two are inevitably linked, that there's no such thing as a separation between mind and body. And it's important to look at the full entire experience. I was a little confused about the particular amount of input in the non-theories, the greatest gift or something, but it seemed like the essence of the rest of what you were saying was that a little bit of fear is inevitable. So how do you explain that? I think what he's pointing to is the idea of not that there is no fear, but there is a state in which you are not attached to the fear, that non-fear has not caught you in its grip. I mean, excuse me, that fear has not caught you in its grip, and that there is a possibility of living without fear running your life. And I think that's what he's pointing to by the word non-fear. This is just my interpretation, out of context, actually. I didn't read that entire piece, so I don't know if he defines it more carefully in the text or not. But I think it would be very much contrary to any understanding I have to imply that there would be a state where fear would never arise. But there would be a state, potentially, that you would get to where you would never be caught by fear. Or controlled by it. That fear would arise, you would recognize it's arising, and it would pass on through without you having ever gotten attached to it. I think that's what he's pointing toward. These are deeply conditioned emotions that we have. I mean, if you start looking into something like fear and try to go back to the earliest time that you experienced fear, it goes pretty far back. There are obviously people who claim earlier lifetimes. I'm not advocating that idea, but people feel that it's that primal. It's not that we can deprogram that whole thing. Yes? When you mentioned FDR, I think he is. This is a quote I thought he made before my time. I think my current story, I think he said something like we have nothing to fear but fear itself. Anyway, it sounds like something that could resonate on time. It sort of has that, that the rule is all about problems. Yes, there are lots of ways to say that, and it matters a great deal how you say it. We've had another slogan in our lifetime, freedom from want. In a war on poverty. And if you believe in the hindrances, freedom from want isn't a possibility either. Want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want. You mentioned just a little bit about the differences between men and women and their feelings of fear. And I think a lot, for me, fear often leads to inaction. You know that it's often immobilizing. And people often see courage as having the lack of fear. But I've heard that it's really being able to move forward even in the face of fear, to recognize the existence of potential danger, but continuing. But I'm often, instead of becoming angry, it's often a state of inaction or an immobilization of how other women have experienced that. Yes? I've kind of done feel the fear and do it anyway, which doesn't ever feel very good. And it just feels like I'm just gutting it out, you know, and doesn't feel very natural. But, Léon, I'm starting to understand the beauty of being able to have the fear come up, but be able to detach from it a little bit. That's like a whole, sort of so different, so entered with different, I guess the other way is almost like reacting with aversion to the fear. And this way is accepting that we are really, and realizing that it's still going to come up, but responding in a different way. And then perhaps acting was helpful and the results of that. I hypothesize that we all have learned in our own bodies how different ways that fear manifests itself. I have my own set of signals, dry throat, rapid heartbeat, depending on the level of fear, adrenaline, big time, if it's really high level. But in the sitting process, where you're talking about very subtle things, I think the signals are also more subtle, and we each have to find our own way through that. There isn't any standard set of recipes about what to look for, and how our body and our mind really process fear and show that we have fear. I think we have to uncover that for ourselves. But my experience is that when I have finally, and frankly as a male, reluctantly to some extent recognized that fear is actually there, when I do recognize it, it's clearly true. There's a knowing that comes with it that's undeniable. And part of it is that it immediately loses a lot of its power. Also, perhaps just to recognize the real cost and the real amount of suffering that is involved in those states that you pay, and to try and weigh that against clearly saying, what is the likelihood? Obviously, I'm not going to walk your class freely because the likelihood is high, it doesn't think that is going to happen. I'm in a social situation where I'm beginning to be motivated by more subtle fears, about acceptance, or so forth. It's simply not worth it, because the worst thing that could happen would be that I'm going to flop in this social situation. There's really nothing going bad about that. I think you can even take that to the point of looking at your own mortality and say, how do they go through this much suffering about something which might happen is probably not going to compare the amount of suffering that's involved. That's a very intelligent thing to say, but I can remember as a child in social situations being totally tied up, nuts. I'm told I hid behind furnaces at dances in grammar school because I was afraid to come out and dance. It sounds laughable from the perspective of now, but I did it when I was a kid. My guess is, depending on how we're relating to fear in our lives now, we may all in some way or other still be hiding behind a furnace. It's a matter of really looking real hard at ourselves. I don't mean hard in a mean way, hard in an honest way. I've experienced fear as a big driver in my life. I've not only experienced fear, but I've experienced embarrassment of having fear, not even powering it. I had to find something that you said, that the root, because I would never allow fear to stop me. I would just push through it no matter what it was, but I would always feel fear almost all the time initially. I think that it has to do with your own feeling of worth, that you attach your worth to whatever it is that you're trying to accomplish that you don't want the fear to prevent you from doing it. It's a vicious, competitive cycle, but in fact, fear is. I know that I had a mother who was terrified of everything, and I learned that behavior. It's a huge part of my life. The thing is to experience it and not give it the power that it has. It's very apt to touch on you. I don't know how it is with women, but I think society doesn't allow you, it's not acceptable to verbalize your fear. It's kind of a double whammy. You have it, and you don't want to have it be exposed. It's easier for women. It's easier for women. I can admit that we're scared. The usual program has now short-sits, if we're through with questions. We'll sit for ten minutes.
