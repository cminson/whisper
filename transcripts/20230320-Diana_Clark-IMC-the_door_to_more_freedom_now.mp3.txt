 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good evening. Welcome, welcome. Nice to see you all. Hmm. You're welcome to move chairs or to sit in a place that's comfortable with those of you that are on the floor. You're welcome to stay where you are, but you're also welcome to move chairs so you don't have to sit behind something. So I'd like to give a talk that builds on a talk that I... Wait, maybe before I go there I'm going to say Happy First Day of Spring. I feel kind of happy about this, the spring equinox. You know, I spent a few days, I just got back from New Mexico, where it was snowing, and it's hard to be like, Oh, it is spring. I felt like it's actually winter, but here is spring. I guess it's spring there too. Okay, so I wanted to build on a talk that I gave last week, and I was talking about this idea that there's a difference between like direct experience, like what we're experiencing in the moment. An example would be like stabbing, throbbing, spacious, contracted, tight. So these are just like adjectives. There's not like a sentence. It's just an adjective. It's the whatever the experience is. And then as humans we put a label on them, and then we often have a relationship with the label, not so much with the experience. For example, there might be stabbing in the knee, throbbing, maybe heat. As soon as we label it pain, then we have a relationship with the word pain. And then, I don't know about you guys, but I don't like pain, right? And there's fear that comes up and all this kind of stuff, right? So, but there's something like stabbing or throbbing that feels a little bit more manageable. Like, okay, this is just this experience right now, and might even bring a little bit of curiosity in. And so much of our practice is about getting clear about this distinction, about what's actually happening, and then the label we put on it. And of course we need labels. I'm not saying we're not going to do that. But often the label can be a springboard for all kinds of story making and thinking, and sometimes we use this separatist word, which is a fun word, papancia, I think, papancia. It kind of has this feeling of popcorn or something like, you know, everything that's going afterwards. So, the example that I gave about with the pain is that we might, the human mind has this tendency to elaborate and to spread out on pain. Oh, my knee's bothering me from that bike accident that all those years ago, and I can't believe that person did that and caused me to have that bike accident. And that reminds me, I need to do this or that, you know, then, you know, like just off we go based on just having this throbbing sensation or stabbing sensation. And so, papancia, this idea of this proliferation or this effusion of this mental commentary, this story making that happens, or maybe like this thinking run amuck as opposed to just thinking of what's needed in the moment to solve a problem or to plan or communicate. Right, of course, we all need thinking for that, but papancia is just that proliferation. Yeah, I'm noticing that you're looking at the light to this flickering light. Is this annoying? Can we turn off that light and leave other lights on? Is that possible? And then there's a light. Yeah, there's a third. Maybe we can maybe that's. Yeah, OK, so we'll be a little bit more cozy. That's better than a flickering light, I think. Yeah. Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Bill. Those of you didn't hear Jim said he thought maybe it was the metasuita in Morse code short, short, long, long short. Good as to you if you can do Morse code. So I'm going to part of the way that I want to explore this is with the suit that passage, which is a story. I want to give this story and kind of annotate or maybe my own version of papancia with this story. Some of you will know this story. It's well known. But I want to maybe emphasize certain parts that aren't necessarily emphasized usually. And I'm not going to tell you the title yet. You'll figure it out because then you'll like, slap a label on. Oh, I've heard this before and it's all about this. But we can just be with the experience of what's unfolding here. So the suit starts like this. Thus have I heard, for those of you who don't know, most suit does start this way. Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Savati in Jeddah's grove in Atapindaka's park. Now at that time, Bahia of the bark cloth was residing by a suparaka on the ocean shore. So just to put this into perspective, the Buddha's in Savati is one location. Bahia of the bark cloth, somebody who wore clothing made out of bark, is near the ocean, about 1,200 miles away. This is a long distance, right? At the time when there's no pavement, there's no roads, that's a long distance to walk without established roads. Okay, so Bahia was residing by a suparaka on the ocean shore, where he was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, alms, foods, lodgings, and medicines, and supplies for the sick. So a few things we can say about this. He's of the bark cloth, so that means that he's not a Buddhist practitioner. But just like today, we could tell the difference from a Tibetan monastic, from a Theravadan monastic, from a Zen priest by the clothes that they wear, just in the same way. We can tell by this that he's not of the Buddhist. And he's a, we could say he's a esteemed and well-respected spiritual leader, enough so that people are venerating him and supporting him, just in the same way that they might support some Buddhist practitioners. And then the suta continues. When Bahia was practicing in seclusion, this line of thinking appeared to his awareness. Hmm. Of those who in this world are our huts, somebody who's fully awakened, are our huts or have entered the path of our hardship, am I one? So he has a little bit of doubt. He has all this attention of other practitioners. They venerating him, supporting him, but he's wondering, am I really awakened? What my experience do I think that I'm really awakened? I appreciate this, that he wasn't just complacent thinking that, okay, because people treat me a certain way, I must be that way. But instead he's like trying to, like he's open to the idea that there's more to learn, more for him to do. But not only that, that he allowed this doubt in his mind to remain there for a little bit. You'll see why in a moment. What happens next? So he doesn't like immediately bat it away. So like, oh, that's silly. I must be awakened. Everybody treats me as if I'm awakened. But he, and he doesn't get into Papancia about it. He's just, this thought arises. Am I awakened? Hmm. So he doesn't ignore it or push it away, but this willingness to stay present with this openness, maybe this kind of doubt, this question about his practice, then allows what happens next. Then, at Deva, this is a disembodied spirit, we might say, at Deva, who had once been a relative of Bahia's and who was compassionate and desiring Bahia's welfare, and knowing with her own awareness, the line of thinking that was in Bahia's awareness, went to Bahia and said to him, you, Bahia, are neither an Arhat, nor have you entered the path of Arhatship. You don't even have the practice whereby you would become an Arhat. So this is quite something, right? The Deva just says to him, straight out, you're not awakened, nor will you be. You're doing something completely different. They never say what this practice is, but just straight up, you're not, maybe as awakened as you thought you were, not as awakened as everybody else thinks that you are. And so Douglas Phillips, who is a Zen teacher and sometimes teaches a little bit of the Theravada also, he likes to interpret this Deva that's visiting Bahia as saying as some feminine wisdom that maybe Bahia was completely disconnected from. But it's when he opens up this question, am I awakened? And is able to just stay with that inquiry and then allows something else to arise, maybe something in his mind to arise. So that's one way we could interpret this idea that the Deva comes. And so she's challenging him, kind of her directness is, maybe we might even say brutal, or maybe it's just fantastic the way that she's not beating around the bush, right? She's just saying, nope, you're not awakened and you're not even on the path to awakening. So despite his many years of practice and all of those practitioners that support him. And so maybe we are not visited by a Deva that says, hey, we are not awakened. But it's not unusual for us to sometimes have doubt about our practice. In so many different ways, maybe we find ourselves yelling at a loved one and we realize, really, after all these years of practice, I'm still upset or I still get triggered by things, I'm still really reactive. Or maybe we find ourselves thinking like hostility towards people who are doing something that we feel like it's really against our values, harming others, harming the planet or just causing harm in the world. And we find ourselves, our hearts getting constricted and not being generous in our thoughts towards them. Maybe we have doubts like, is this practice really working? I've been doing all this meditation, listening to Dharma talks, reading Dharma books, whatever it might be. So maybe there's some way in which we also have had doubts. There's so many different ways this doubt can show up. It can be about ourselves. Maybe I don't have the capacity. We might have this idea. Or we might think, well, those teachers, I'm not sure they really know what they're talking about. They don't seem to be perfect. Or the teachings might not seem compelling. Like maybe there's something else that's easier or faster or whatever it is that we're looking for. Maybe we had expectations about the practice that just aren't being met and doubt arises. So when doubt arises, there's a few things we can do. One is go down the path of some bitterness or resentment. Like, I can't believe I spent all that time practicing. I'm still the same. Or this kind of road of thinking maybe some self-judgment comes in, or maybe even some despair. I thought this was going to help. And if this doesn't help, maybe nothing can. That's one way to go when we feel like our expectations aren't being met. It's a legitimate way. And for many of us, we might have to go down that road for a while before we start to realize that's really not leading towards more freedom. Instead, it just kind of really restricts our freedom limits. So as we start to kind of collapse and feel disempowered. But an alternative way is to just fold it into practice to feel like, okay, I feel unsure about myself and these teachings. What can I do? One, you could be mindful. This is what it feels like to feel unsure or to have doubt. Or we can investigate. We could talk to a teacher. We could talk to other people. We can read Dharma books, listen to Dharma talks. We don't have to just kind of say, well, this didn't work. Maybe a different teacher, maybe a different style, a different tradition within Buddhism. Or maybe not even Buddhism at all. But to not just give up and collapse around it. But instead to take it as an indication or an opportunity to explore and investigate. So then we'll get back to the sutta. So Bahia, after hearing from this deva that he's not awakened and not only that he's not on the path towards awakening. The sutta continues, without hesitation, Bahia asked the deva, but who in this world is actually an Arhat and has entered that path? The deva knows. She says, Bahia, in the northern city of Savati lives the blessed one, the Buddha, a rightly self awakened Arhat. He is truly an Arhat and teaches the Dhamma that leads to Arhat ship. Then Bahia, deeply chastened by the deva, left Saperaka and traveled all the way to where the Buddha was staying. Like he just, okay, that's if that's what it takes. This is what I'm going to do. Pax's bags, or I don't even know if he had bags, right? We might have just been a monastic 1,200 miles walks. Halfway across the continent or subcontinent. Quite something because this could have been an opportunity for a lot of Papansha, a lot of, how dare you talk to me? What do you know? Or, you know, there's so many different ways we can respond to this. But instead he's like, oh, okay, I'm not awakened. Well, what can I do to get awakened? Who can teach me? At this time, right, there's not books or anything else to inform a person except another person. So this is why he's asking who is. That's the way of saying, where can I find the teachings? So he doesn't defend and rationalize, deny, blame. He just wants to go to find where he can find the teachings that can make him awakened. So then we'll continue with the sutta. So Bahiya walks all the way over to where the Buddha is. And when he's there, he finds a number of Buddhist monks that are doing walking meditation. And he asks, Vangambo sirs, where is the Blessed One staying? Where is the Buddha? I must see him immediately. He was told that the Buddha, and then the monastics told Bahiya that the Buddha had gone into town for alms. He's like, he's on his lunch break, kind of like, don't bother him. Bahiya immediately turned to the city where the Buddha was. The Buddha had gone into the town for alms rounds, and Bahiya went in there. And then Bahiya found the Buddha on alms round. The Buddha was moving with great calm, his mind at peace, tranquil, and poised, with the restrained senses of a great one. So Bahiya notices right away that the Buddha is different. Something about him has this calm and tranquility and poise that even before Bahiya has spoken to the Buddha can tell. Something's different about him. He approached the Buddha, threw himself to the ground beforehand with his head to the Buddha's feet, and said, this is a sign of extreme respect. Put your head at the feet of somebody else in ancient India. This is a real sign of respect. And he says to the Buddha, teach me the Dharma, O blessed one, teach me the Dharma, O holy one, so that it will be for my long-term welfare and happiness. He traveled all this way. He wants to hear the teachings. The Buddha said to him, this is not the time, Bahiya, I am on the alms round. And Bahiya pleaded with the Buddha a second time. But holy one, it is hard to know for sure what dangers they may be for the Buddha's life or what dangers there may be for mine. Please teach me the Dharma, O blessed one, so that I may be free and happy. So Bahiya is saying, we don't know when we're going to die. I might die before you finish alms round, or you might die before you finish alms round. And again, the Buddha said to Bahiya, this is not the time for me to give a talking. I am on alms round. So Bahiya, he's persistent. He has this idea that he wants to receive these teachings. But not only that, he has a certain amount of wisdom about impermanence, that recognizing that none of us are guaranteed the next moment. None of us are guaranteed that after our next meal, everything's going to be fine. So he has some wisdom that things are inconstant, impermanent. There's no guarantees. So getting back to the sutta, Bahiya pleaded his case a third time to the Buddha. And this time the Buddha relented and said, well, Bahiya, you should train like this. And the scene will be merely the scene. So scene like what is seen, like what is visually known, like what is seen. And the herd will be merely the herd, like what sounds are heard. I'm saying this because somebody told me a few years ago that they thought it was like seeing, like a pastoral scene with rolling hills, S-C-E-N-E. And it is kind of like that. But then they heard, they thought, well, maybe it's like a herd of cows or deer. You know, they had this whole like pastoral scene. So that's why I'm kind of like spending a little time to say it's the like visual and hearing. And the scene will be merely the scene and the herd will be merely the herd. And the sensed will be merely the sensed and the cognized will be merely the cognized. He's saying, keep it simple. No, but Pancha, nothing extra. Just for each experience, be with that experience, including the experiences of the thought, cognized. The word here is like what arises in the consciousness or something like this. And then the Buddha continues. He says, when for you there will be only the scene in reference to the scene, only the herd in reference to the herd, only the sensed in reference to the sensed, only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then there is no you in connection with that. And when there is no you in connection with that, there is no you there. And when there is no you there, you're neither here nor yonder nor between the two and just this is the end of suffering. And upon hearing this brief explanation from the Buddha, but he is mind was immediately freed from the defilements and he became awakened. So what's an interesting thing here is that that's added at the end. So not only to keep it simple and not to do with Pancha or just, you know, allow our thinking to run amok after each sense experience, but the Buddha is also pointing to this is how we create our sense of self or this is how the sense of self gets created. For example, we'll get back to like stabbing sensation in the knee. Something might be like, I don't like it. Perfectly you're reasonable. But there's all of a sudden this I that has a problem that has to get rid of it, as opposed to something like, and this is awkward, we wouldn't normally do this, but for illustration purposes, I'll say, instead of saying the sensations of stabbing have arisen, or stabbing is known, or something like this, that's different than I am experiencing pain or I'm experiencing stabbing. I admit that this language is awkward and clunky, but there's a way in which there can be experiences without having to say there's an experiencer. Because as soon as we start to say there's an experiencer, and all kinds of extra stuff comes along, things we like and we don't like and we have to like protect and bolster and make sure everybody else sees us the way we want to be seen and that we see ourselves the way we want to be seen. There's all kinds of extra stuff that comes up as soon as we create the self. Or maybe, like, and we're not doing this intentionally so maybe I should say as soon as a self is created, a sense of our self that with our stories, as opposed to there's this experience that's happening right now. It's unpleasant. There's a wish for this experience to go away. These are all true, but there's a cleanness about it. There's this sense that I am experiencing this stabbing and I don't like it and I want it to go away. There's a certain amount of getting tangled up with it a certain way in which we're clinging on to it or grabbing on to it or this self is a way in which we're not just allowing the experiences to rise and pass away, but instead to create the conditions in which we are trying to see if there's a better way to describe this. Often, when I can describe maybe this sense of self as when there's a sense of me against the world or us against them, then there's a real strong sense of, oh, there's an entity, me, here, and everything else is out there and we have to make sure that everybody thinks the right things about us, whatever we want them to think, that we're smart or capable or attractive or whatever it is that we might want others to think, then we feel like we have to show up a particular way. It turns out that's extra. We don't have to do that and there's so much freedom that's available if we're able to put that down. Even if we can't put it down to just soften it, to not get filled with anxiety about trying to bolster the sense of self or trying to make it be different than how it is, trying to change our experience. The reason why we want to change our experience is because it doesn't match a sense of self that we might be creating or something like this. So we might consider that these instructions that the Buddha gave is what it's like when the self disappears and the seeing is just the seeing and the hearing is just the hearing. And the sensed is just the sensed and in the cognized is just the cognized. So, they're still perfectly fine able to move through the world without this extra, without this extra self, which is the fuel for the Papancia, the proliferation of thinking that we like to do. So, what this teaching is also pointing to is that whatever is happening in our in this present moment, whatever it might be, impatience, sleepiness, confusion, annoyance, pain in the knee, whatever it is, we can turn towards that and experience that directly and just that turning towards and experiencing it directly, like stopping any contention with reality we might be having, but just like, yep, this is the experience. That's the doorway to freedom. Whatever is happening, if you're annoyed, if you're happy, if you're tired, if you feel restless, it's just to be with the experience in a clean way as best we can. And if you feel like, I don't even really know what she's talking about, this seems kind of weird, or maybe you're like, yep, I know exactly what she's talking about. Just the sense of, is there a way that we can hold our experience without trying to make it different, without trying to add on to it, without, I'm going like this with my hands open, so to hold this way as opposed to this way, but to hold this way, without being in contention with it or trying to manipulate or manufacture or engineer the experience so that it's different in some kind of way. So this is the good news. Sometimes we might think like, okay, there'll be more freedom as soon as the neighbor's dog stops barking so I can meditate, or as soon as I get a chance to do a lot of retreat practice, or as soon as I find the right teacher or teaching. So we might have this idea that in the future, the conditions are going to be okay, or better, and then we'll be able to find some more freedom. But this is pointing to this precise moment, this moment, this moment, whatever you're experiencing, we don't have to wait for the conditions to get better. It's just we'll be more seeing, hearing, sensing and cognizing. That's the only thing that we will be doing ever. So why not now? Why not this moment? Then maybe I'll just close with this, learning to live in this way, live fully, being with our experience, as opposed to thinking like, okay, well, sometime in the future, that'll be better than, and then I'll be with my experience. And instead to live this experience, this is a way in which, yeah, opening the door to more freedom now, as opposed to in the imagined future, some other time. To live our life fully. Okay, so with that, I'll open it up to some questions or comments. Thank you so much for that. I was just wondering in the story, what does cognized refer to? Is that that we added interpretation to the experience or just that we thought about it in some way? Or what does that mean? Yeah, this is such a great question. It's kind of a clunky translation. I would say what we thought, I would say we would just say thought. I think that's probably a better word to say. So just recognizing that thoughts arise, and then just to be with the thought without saying like, oh, I shouldn't think this. I can't believe I thought that or do anything like that. I would just say that. Thank you for asking that question. It's a good question. Yes, back here. Thanks for that talk. I guess I have a question of at the end when you say you can still move through the world after having these realizations. How does that work necessarily if you're really only experiencing your senses really deeply, not having thoughts about them? How do you continue having like motivation to do things day to day or to go about the world like you described just kind of would be interested to hear your thoughts on that. Yeah, yeah. Do you want to say a little bit more about your concerns about this or using the kind of we do it without motivation or your concern that will turn into couch potatoes. Yeah, I guess, from the description of it of someone who hearing is only hearing. Yeah. Seeing is only seeing it sounds to me like kind of a passive observer of everything that's happening. And I just, I don't know what it feels like to be in that state, but it seems like someone who is, you know, I just can't imagine someone in that state, getting up and eating breakfast and going to work, etc. Yeah. So I'm just curious how it fits into day to day actions when you've reached that point of just what you're describing. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. That's a legitimate question. So eating breakfast happens. Getting out of bed happens. Getting dressed happens. Planning happens. Work happens. Everything happens. But there isn't so much of a sense of like, I have to make it happen. There isn't this sense of I have to engineer, manufacture, create and do everything to make it happen. Instead, there is a more allowing. It's quite something actually that we aren't as we're not as in control as we think that we are. And we're not creating things as much as we think we are. But when we step back, still everything that needs to happen happens. And there isn't this extra thinking, you know, what are people going to think about me? Oh, I better do that or take care of this. There's so much more energy and clarity that actually person can have more impact in the world and can be doing a lot more just because they're freed up from so much of the things that they're doing. And so much of the things that we are that tie us up in knots. I don't know. Is that an okay answer? Okay. I wish I could say precisely something that is kind of like breakfast eating happens. What was that Bill? Oh, okay. I think Bill said I have a comment. Yeah, yeah. Do you or can do right here that person who's spoke earlier. We're just using so everybody can hear. No, right here, Jim. So what I had was, what do you think is the instructive element of the story in the part where he's asking for the insight while the teachers on their lunch break, and instead of repeatedly asking and being told no, and then he concedes and does give that, you know, share that insight while on the lunch break. Like, what is that part about do you think. So a few things that this is a kind of a shows up in the tradition a number of times to be asked three times. It's a, it's a cultural thing I think from ancient India to ask three times. It still exists sometimes in some Buddhist traditions you have to ask three times for a teacher or for certain things. But I'm interpreting it that the Pahillo is persistent. And these are maybe some version of this did happen. I'm not going to say this is a true story because I don't know, but we can imagine that maybe there was a time when something like this did happen. So, well, you know, actually this is not the time. And then there's the tradition of asking three times. So that's my interpretation of it. Yes, right. So I didn't finish the whole suit. I just said that the final piece is he dies. So maybe that was why we can't know we can't know whether there's a real story but the parable right is the he dies and so that urgency was very relevant in this context. That recognition of impermanence. Yeah, yeah. He's telling the Buddha, well, you may die I may die we don't know I don't know and then it comes to find out but he dies soon right thereafter. I don't know if he knew he was afraid he was going to die right. Yeah, yeah. So, thank you for that. Maybe I'll just add a little bit how he dies. This is very, this is like a cow. He gets killed by a cow. So, like that's not really explained it but the interpretation is he got between a newborn calf and its mother or something like this and got trampled by a cow. This is a curious part of the story. But he is not the only one in the suit does there's other people who get killed by cows to. I don't know what to make it up. But he did get why, but he became awake and he was awakened to thank you. And between the teaching and the going that's absolutely right. It's interesting that, you know, the David tells him that he's not on the path. You know, he's in his current practices not leading to enlightenment. And yet he'd laid. He clearly laid the foundation, you know, clearly he'd been cultivating parames and then cultivating samadhi. And so that then when he received the teaching, he was he was well prepared for insight. So it's he wasn't on the path and yet he was cultivating his mind in ways that made him very receptive. Yeah. So that he is attainment was rapid. Yeah. Great, great. Thank you. Thank you for pointing that out. And we know like the earlier in the Suta is pointing out that, you know, he was narrated by others and stuff. So we knew he had it was a spiritual leader of some sort, but not on this particular path. But maybe his heart and mind were being cultivated so that he was receptive. OK. Oh, yes. One more question. OK. Here we go. This will be the last one. I think I struggle a little bit with or a lot. I mean, so human beings are pretty naturally sense making creatures. Right. And so this kind of teaching is inviting us to lay that down completely and just it sounds to me. I'll frame it as a question. It feels like to me that it's inviting us to experience what we're sensing just as what we're sensing to experience our thoughts just as thoughts that maybe that's that's the place where we can have thoughts, which are probably meaning making. But we don't get attached to those specific stories and cognizances or, you know, maybe that's where the trick is or the skill is that it's OK to make, to have to be to have thoughts that are making meaning, but to observe those and not become attached to the particular narration. Yeah, I would say and and not get this proliferation of thoughts right and not just going off on a tangent or something like this. But of course, I don't think it's possible for us to not make meaning. Yeah. Yeah. Of course, we do that. Thank you. OK. OK. So thank you for your attention and wishing you wonderful evening. Thank you.
