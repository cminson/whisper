 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Good morning everyone and a good day. Good evening for some of you maybe. Good afternoon. Lately I've been thinking about the town square, the small square. And I wonder sometimes if this, you know, YouTube, it's kind of open to the world to come by and a little bit of a town square that people come and visit and come through and everyone's invited. And I'm thinking about this meditation session with the metaphor of the town square. Imagine you're a traveler and you come to a small town, looks like a welcoming town, looks like people are happy to have visitors come through. And so you come and make your way to the town square and there are very comfortable benches on the town square and you're happy to sit on the edge of the square and watch the comings and goings in the town square. And it marvels you, all the different people and maybe animals and activities that somehow come through, show up in the town square, stay for a while, leave. It seems like everyone has the ability to use the town square as a public space and there's no sense that anyone shouldn't be there. Everyone looks like they feel like they're quite happy to be there and comfortable and they belong and they can be themselves. And it's belovedly to watch the young, the old, the children, the lovers, the people that argue, even maybe the people on political soap boxes. So all this comes through, all of life comes through. And then at some point it dawns on you as you look at everyone, something seems unusual. You can't quite put your finger on it until you realize that all the people who come into the square, they're all visitors like you. Some of them might stay for a few days, some of them for a few weeks, maybe some of them a little bit longer. But in fact, everyone in the town, everyone coming through are just visitors. And you realize you're a visitor. Everything here is a visitor. So in the same way, it might be useful to think of your capacity to be aware, your mindfulness, as the town square, that you keep open 24 hours a day, kind of, kind of to keep it open. And everything is welcome in, into the town square, into the mindfulness. Your job is to make sure that you are sitting on that bench, that comfortable bench, that allows you to be present and gaze upon all that comes. And maybe if you have a responsibility in that town square, as all visitors do perhaps, is to be accepting, kind to all the visitors that come. So to think of mindfulness as a town square in which everything is allowed to be, to come through. Everything that comes through is allowed to be there. Everything is just a visitor. Some things stay longer than others. And your job is to know it, to see it, to be present, and to keep the town square available to everyone, to keep this town square as a place where all things could be, without you being for or against, without being involved or interfering with anything, just aware, just present. And perhaps this will give you a profound sense of being at ease and at peace, because you know you're in the town square and you can just allow things to come and go, yourself, all things, all the ways that you are. So to assume a meditation posture that is upright, literally or metaphorically, and to gently close your eyes, and to settle into your bench in the town square so you can relax and be present, taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. As you exhale, settling in, relaxing. And letting your breathing return to normal. And perhaps you've actually come to the town square early, early in the morning before anyone else. And you find a broom to sweep it clean, to make it nice for people who come. In the same way, relaxing your body is to sweep and make it nice for all that's going to be there for you. On the exhale, relaxing the face. On the exhale, relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the chest. Relaxing the belly. Be relaxing the whole body, releasing, holding, tightening. And then the comings and goings in this town square. And include the comings and going of each inhale and each exhale. And finally the breathing can be like the pigeons lying around. And as you stay here, sooner or later, all kinds of things will come into your awareness. Let it come, let it go, let it be. But don't leave your bench. Don't leave and get involved with anything. Just watch it, just see it from the vantage point of your bench as if your attitude of acceptance of all of it is the very recipe of providing a sense of freedom and homecoming to whatever arises. And here's something............... And then as we come to the end of this sitting, maybe to take a few moments with the perspective that you're a visitor here in this world. And everything else, everyone else is a visitor. Everything is a visitor. We all have this in common in the comings and goings of all things, just visitors. And with that perspective, perhaps sitting on your bench, watching in the town square, it might be a little easier to gaze upon all the visitors kindly, caring, respectfully, maybe even reverently. And maybe wishing, aspiring that your heart and your eyes can look upon all people and all beings with kindness, that you can look upon all beings with eyes that convey safety, that you can be with all beings with a heart that radiates peace, that you can be present for others in a way they feel free to be themselves. May it be that your gift to the world, that you aspire, that your gift to this world, we're all visitors, that you contribute kindness, goodwill, safety, peace and freedom. And may this meditation practice we've done today, may it be that one way or another, it supports this aspiration to be this kind of person in this world that we live in. Thank you.
