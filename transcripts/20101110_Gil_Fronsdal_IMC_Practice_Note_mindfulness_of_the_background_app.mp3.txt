Practice Note: Mindfulness of the 
Background

There’s an expression about not seeing the forest for 
the trees  – or not seeing the trees because of the forest . 
We can go back and forth between what we focus on . 
Sometimes we focus on the details of what’s happening , 
and sometimes we step back and look at the bird’s -eye 
picture of what’s happening. What we pay attention to 
has different results . Sometimes it ’s interesting to  switch 
the lenses of attention  if we’re focusing one way all the 
time. Generally with mindfulness , the tendency is to look 
more closely at the details  – to look at the trees. 
Sometimes it’s good to back up and take the broader 
vision:  to see the backgroun d of what’s happening.  
 
One of the interesting areas of mindfulness is to be 
mindful of the attitude with which you’re paying attention  
– the attitude with which you’re approaching what’s 
going on: the emotion, or mood, or motivation that’s 
there in the background. Sometimes it’s so far in the 
background that, perhaps, it doesn’t even occur to you 
to look at it. For example, you might be sitting  in some 
emotional or physical pain, and so you look carefully at that. That’s the trees. Or perhaps you realize that your  
relationship to the pain is also important . Then maybe 
you realize  that there’s aversion , so you’re looking at 
that.  
 
But then you s tep back and look  at what’s in the very 
back . What’s  behind all that? Is there some 
background ? Is there some  pervasive, more subtle or 
quiet attitude or mood that seems to be there , whether 
you’re in pain or not in pain? It could be a belief system, 
an id ea, an assumption .  
 
It could be an assumption that life is really dangerous . 
It’s full of threats for you . So no matter whether there’s 
something painful or not painful going on, there’s a 
vigilance  concerned  with threat that’s subtly there, in the 
backgr ound . It’s always there  when being mindful has 
this feeling of “Uh oh, I better pay attention , or 
something terrible  is going to happen! ” 
 
Or there could be a background attitude of something 
that has to do with desire : “I want something .” It’s all 
about what I can get . And so you feel the pain . You 
notice it . You notice your aversion to the pain , but 
behind it all there’s an attitude that , “If everything were  
right, I’d be getting exactly what I want! How am I going 
to get what I want? ” 
 
Or there mi ght be a attitude of some understanding of who you are , of your self -identity , which i s always there 
in the background  – some  background assumption 
about what the meaning of life is  – what  it’s all about, 
and who you are in relationship to other people . There 
are a lot of different background attitudes which can be 
operating . But because they’re subtle , sometimes 
they’re overlooked because the trees are so much more 
interesting than the overall forest or the background of it 
all.   
 
I’d encourage you to see  if you can get a little bit more 
still than you usually might  be. Just intend towards more 
stillness, more quiet in some way or other . And in 
whatever quiet you have, don’t do as much as you 
usually do . Don’t focus so much on the details of what’s 
going o n. Continue with that, of course , but see if you 
can feel or sense your way into the background of your 
mind, your heart, your attitude . See the attitude that 
informs how you’re mindful  – how you approach  and do 
things .  
 
Is there some background attitude? It can be very 
revealing if you look at  that. 
 
I hope you enjoy  your morning . Thank you.
