 I don't have this formal talk prepared, although there's lots of things we could talk about that I think are interesting. That may not be what you think is interesting. So, first let me just ask if anyone has any questions about meditation practice or any Dharma kind of questions. So if things come up, you know, you can ask. But let me just ask you a question. I was just thinking as I rang the bell here, and I was thinking about times when I've been in meditation where I couldn't wait for the bell to ring. I was just kind of in hell, you know, just, oh, when's it going to ring? When's it going to ring? And the bell would ring. Nothing else would change. I wouldn't move. All of a sudden it's just, ah, nothing changed except the bell rang. I don't know if anybody experienced that. This is a few heads nodding, right? Well, what's that? That's just, you know, we just create that in our minds, right? Our whole experience of ease and, ah, or suffering was just completely, in that case, just created. We just made it up. It just points to the power of our minds to create our own experience, really. We don't create our experience in the sense that, you know, if I touch this, it's cool right now. So there's a feeling of coolness. I'm not saying that I'm creating that experience. You know, we could get into some philosophical or metaphysical discussion of whether, but no, that's just, I feel it. But it's everything I make about it, right? It's everything I make about it. So, um, and that really is the heart of Buddhist teaching. I know a lot of people here probably, well, some may consider themselves Buddhists and others may not want to rely on themselves, you know, put that label on themselves or anything, but, um, so you don't have to be a Buddhist. I keep saying Buddhist teaching and the Buddha because that's just my style. But those Dharma teachings basically are about finding freedom in our lives through letting go of grasping and clinging. That's really the heart of the whole teaching, which sounds like when you hear that, it's so simple, right? When we're suffering, when we're grasping onto something, um, and we're trying to hold onto something that we want because if that's what we want or it's pleasurable and it's, we can't hold onto it, we suffer. Oh, and we're trying to keep away what we don't want and we're getting it, that's suffering. So if someone were to say, you know, during those times, try to just let go, you know, to some extent, and then there'll be a little more kind of ease around the experience. You know, when I hear that, I think, Oh, well, sure, that sounds great. It sounds so simple, but it's hard to do, right? It's very, very hard to do just that simple thing. It's very, very difficult to do. And I know when I look into my own life and I imagine that's true, it's true for many of us, um, you know, I just look as I go through my day and how much I'm just caught in suffering and it's just, you know, I like this, I don't like that and I see some person and I don't like them and I want to get this and just, this is really my whole day. Really. It's kind of like that, right? Now don't think about it. I'm just kind of automatically going through life. So really, one way to think about the meditation practice, and I know all of us have different motivations for wanting to practice and we probably all come from many different reasons, but probably most of us share one thing in common, everything. We want to get a little, you may not use this, this, this exact way of saying it, but we want to kind of ease our suffering a little in life. You know, all the difficulties of just life and we're trying to just get some relief. That's, I think many people may not use those words, but that would be true for them. So what is it about just paying, you know, watching the wing with our breath and calming the mind that does that? My take on it is, is that when we, when we have not examined ourselves, when we just live kind of on the surface appearance and we're just caught up in everything, we're at the effect of things, because we're not seeing what's going on. You know, we're just kind of on autopilot and life's just kind of sweeping us along in whichever way it's going, you know, and we're just caught and, you know, and we're just at the effect. And that's really, there's nothing wrong with that. It's just that our peace, our happiness is just dependent on sort of the, what, how would you say, the vicissitudes of life, you know, the winds of life blow this way or blow that way. And of course, we're all doing our best to set up our lives in the best way we can, right? Nobody's trying to, we're all, you know, I say this all the time, but it really is so true. All of us, I mean, I, I only know a few people here, but this is true for every one of us in this room. We're trying to get more of what we want and we're trying to get less of what we don't want. That's really kind of, one way to, it's kind of a, sounds silly to say that, but really it's true. Nobody's trying to get less of what they want. Nobody's trying to get more of what they don't want, whatever that is. And so, we may or, we may be more or less skillful in the ways we go about doing that, but that's really kind of our motivation of what we're trying to do. That's fine. No problem. Except while we're doing that, of course, we're not going to stop doing that. None of us are going to stop doing that, right? We should pay attention to our lives and try and create what, you know, our, head our lives in the directions we want to go. So, we'll keep doing that and we'll be more or less successful at it. And in the process, we're going to get what we get. Despite our best efforts, we're going to get what we get. So, in the process of everything we're going to through about creating happiness in our lives and setting it up that way, can we find some sense of ease of being with our lives just as it is? Is that possible? It's kind of a question. I don't know. You know, you have to kind of ask ourselves, you know, can I find a way to be in relationship with myself and my relationship? And it's really kind of in harmony with the world and myself rather than being in an adversarial relationship with life and with myself, which I think many people, I certainly, a lot of fair amount of the time in my life, I would say I'm actually in an adversarial relationship with myself, with my own being, my whole, just my core of experience. I'm just kind of in, I don't like it. That's this idea of, in the meditation practices, we're able to cultivate certain qualities of maybe a little bit of concentration, ability in our mindfulness, and we, as we, as that grows, we're able to more go a little deeper, but what that deeper is, is just looking closely at this, the nature of ourselves and of our experience. And as we do that, to start to, as we become more aware of it, we're less at the effect and we're more just kind of more aware of it and we can find a way of being in relationship to it. So just take, for example, we could take anything, but by the way, I'm just kind of, I just kind of got going on a topic. I don't know if it's this, I'll keep talking about a little bit and they will stop and there might be some questions. Well, to me, this is kind of the core of Dharma, really. So just think of anything like, okay, I'll come to that in a minute. Let me just finish this one thing. That's a, that's a great one, by the way. Let's, let's, let, what's a thought? Just look at what a thought is, right? I don't, none of us know what it is, but I mean, there's something there, right? When we don't look closely and we're just kind of on autopilot, look how much power our thoughts have. It just drives us, runs us everything, you know, that voice in the head of, you know, you're walking and you see somebody, oh, there, whatever, and the voice goes and we're just believe it, we're in it, we're identified with it. It's real or whatever, you know, oh my God, I have to call so and so tonight and it's going to be, there goes the voice and we're just in it. And it may be real or not, but if you actually try to go and look and see what a thought is, there is something there, but it's not much, it's pretty thin, right? It's ephemeral, you can't grasp it, it's just, there was a little something, maybe a sound in the head, it's just almost a wisp, it's almost not even anything, it's there, but it's, when you see that, you know, but look at the power it has unexamined, but the power examined, we can just, when we can start to see, oh, thoughts. It's just one example, you can look and take anything like that. So we're just trying to find a way of finding a way of ease of being in relationship to life, really. And sometimes, many times, whatever's going on, you know, that might be nice to say, oh, I'm going to let go and have an ease of being, but, you know, that's easy to say when we're kind of here and maybe we're meditating and everything, but then if you go out, depending on what's going on, for most of us, for me, you know, it doesn't have to ratchet up too strong where it gets a little more difficult to find that ease of being because what's going on is really difficult, you know, right? And then what's actually real then is that the real, in that situation, what's really real is I can't be with much equanimity with this experience. I am caught up in this experience, right? And then that's what's real. We have to acknowledge that and have some acceptance in ourselves for that and not judge yourselves, oh, I'm supposed to be, I'm a meditator and, you know, I had a, let me just say one more thing and then we'll come to the board. So last, I don't know if I shared this story here before in Palo Alto, but so last spring, my father is, has advanced Parkinson's disease and he's in quite poor health and has been for many, many years. And it's, anyway, it's very stressful on my family, my mother and my brothers, and it's very stressful. So some of you probably are either going through or have been through family difficulties around health matters of people in the family, you know, it can be very, very stressful. So I was back there for a week in the spring because my father got sick and actually didn't think he was going to make it. He did survive and he's still, still alive, but it was very difficult week and everybody in the family had a different view. You know, my mother just wants to do anything to help keep him alive. And I was more saying, you know, don't, don't hasten his death, but make him comfortable. Let the man go. You know, we all had these different views, got very, very tense. No one slept for the whole week and all our just old family stuff came up. So the reason I'm telling you this is, is towards the end of the week or maybe it's a week and a half, we were just frazzled. My brother comes in and we, he started whatever he lost his started yelling or whatever. I just lost my mind. I just started screaming at him in the hospital room. And I don't even want to tell you what I said, because it was about as nasty as it gets. I mean, really, as I look back on it, it was actually quite painful. I had to really acknowledge that, you know what, I can have a part in me that really, I would say is pretty ugly. That the potential for that is there. I mean, it was an extreme situation, but I had to acknowledge that. So what happens then, my brother comes running up to me, he starts screaming at me. I'm screaming back and we're in the hospital room. There's my father's, he's unconscious, but you know, it's just like, we just went crazy. He comes up, he puts his face about an inch from mine, beat red, and he says, come on, we're going out in the parking lot. Let's go. And here's me. I've been a meditator for like 30 something years. You know, I said, great, let's go. We took about 10 steps. Fortunately, I kind of regained my sanity or woke up and I just went, and I said to him, I said, I just woke up and said to him, wait a minute, Robert, that's my brother, Robert, we're not going to fight. Come on. And so I sort of snapped out of it and woke up. And then we talked a little, and actually we have reconciled and it's better. And I was joking because I could see the headlines. Richard Shankman, long time Buddhist meditator, arrested on assault charges. The point I'm trying to make is when it gets, we then have to acknowledge that that's what, I did that. That potential is in me. So we try to find our way of being in relationship to it. And sometimes we're just caught and lost in it. And through it all, really, there's just, we need a lot of self-acceptance, deep self-acceptance through it all. That's just my own opinion. So anyway, what is it about boredom? We said, what about boredom? What are you thinking? Why does it happen? I mean, if you, why does anything happen? Well, I mean, clearly it's a state of mind, right? I mean, you can be bored when there are relationship things going on or you can be really interested when there's not a whole lot going on, but you're just able to focus in on what might you should for some reason. It captures your attention and you're able to engage in it. So what's going on when you're not able to engage? Well, it could be several things. I don't know specifically, and we could, we won't do it now, but we could, and if you want later, we could take a really specific situation and kind of explore down in and see what's going on there. But when you can't engage, sometimes you can't engage, this isn't the boredom, but sometimes you can't engage because it's too painful or unpleasant. And, you know, we talk about in the meditation practice of working with whatever comes up. So if there's pleasantness, we're working with that kind of with mindfulness or if it's unpleasant, but if it gets really strong, either it's too much force and the aversion gets so strong that we're not able to be there with mindfulness. We're just lost in the aversion and maybe even this most skillful thing is to not be with it in those cases and say, oh, and to know when it's time and it's too much to back off from something. And for me, the gauge is to the extent I'm able to be aware of it is it doesn't matter if it's pleasant or unpleasant. As long as I'm able to be with it with mindfulness and when it gets strong enough where I'm too, either the pleasure is so strong that you're just swept up in it or the pain is, the aversion is so strong that you can't work with it skillfully, you're just lost in it. So that's one thing way in which we can't be with something. Boredom is, I mean, I don't know the answer to what boredom is, I'm just, maybe we'll have a dialogue about it, but for me it's the times when I don't really get a lot of boredom in my meditation practice. I don't know about life or meditation, what you're referring to, but well, it's all life. You know, when you sit to meditate, that's just life. It's just life that looks like sitting in some position with your eyes closed. It's no different than going to being at work. It's just that moment, right? So it's all life, really. You know, we want to be, I don't know, I think it's pretty obvious to me, we want to be interested. We want, I mean, look at the whole, well, think about the whole entertainment industry, which is, you know, we give a whole, like, what are the academy awards? Really, I'm kind of saying it in a joking way, but it just sort of strikes me. We have this huge award festival, we make a big deal because you did the best job of anyone of getting me out of my boredom where I got to escape away into this, like, you were the one who did it the best. We're going to put you up on this pedestal and give you this big award, and I didn't have to just be with myself better than anybody else. You really got me out of my experience. I was just gone for two and a half hours in that movie. It was great. You took me away. You know, we just honor and revere people who can do that the best. I mean, really, I don't know, you may not agree with that, but it sort of strikes me that way. I haven't really, you know, I'm sort of talking stream of consciousness here, but that sort of seems that way. Is there some kind of aversion in boredom, maybe? Well, I mean, there's certainly, let's put it this way. I'm not sure we'd have to kind of think about that a little, but it certainly seems like we do have not so subtle aversion to boredom. Right. I guess I thought the boredom itself was a very subtle form of aversion. Like, you don't really want to be there for it. Yeah. Oh, this is not, somehow this is not worth me or it's not worth my attention. Well, and you know, it's easy to explore with this a little bit. Just take some time, go to where you live, and sometime go there and don't engage in anything that you might know. So you don't turn on the TV, no music, don't answer the telephone, don't talk to anyone, don't pick up a book. Just sit down in a chair on your couch and just sit there. Don't meditate, not meditate, just sit there. How long can we do it? Just sit there. Nobody's going to be messing around with you. It's just no problem. It's like you really just can't do it for very long, right? You'd go crazy. I mean, I don't know. I don't know everyone. I'm sort of making a generalization. Actually, about maybe three or four months ago, I had a situation in which I had a lot of, I was, this happened on a Friday and there's a few things that happened that sort of came together and I was really in a lot of suffering and in a lot of self-doubt and just a lot of my own inner stuff was just up and I was really, really suffering a lot. And it just happened. I'd never done this before. It really came to a peak and then I woke up Saturday morning just in it so much. And I did actually take a day. It would turn out to be just really a very fruitful day. I took a day. I didn't have anything planned, it turned out. And I kept feeling myself wanting to, you know, you want to fix it. We don't want to be with that. And I just sat on my couch and I did exactly what actually what I just described. I didn't go out. I didn't go shopping for groceries. I didn't get engaged in any of the projects. Nothing. I just quietly sat there on my couch and just allowing this experience to just be there. I didn't try not to get all hooked and identified with it but not pushing away and just letting this just painful experience be and just sit there. And actually I pretty much spent the whole day. I wasn't meditating, just connecting with it and being with it and letting go. And it kind of all, you know, it all just arose and passed away and flowed through in its own way. And then through the day it kind of lessened and it just happened in this case that it kind of melted away a little later and that was the day. I mean it is true that it's hard for us so often just to be with our experience and who and what we are. We want something else. In meditation, what is it, you know, we want to, I don't know what it is, be better, get better. We're leaning into the future, you know, even, you know, sometimes if those of you have maybe done some retreats or something you can get some deep concentration and it can be very blissful and you're just, you know, you want to lean into that, get more, you know, it's just, that's just our nature I think as human beings. We're not going to stop wanting to get more of what we want and less of what we don't want. I don't think we're ever going to stop doing that but we can start to just recognize that that's kind of part of being a human being and just kind of get some relaxation around it a little bit. Yeah, that's the whole thing of just letting go. That's when the Buddhist talked about a phrase that he used so often was liberation through non-clinging. So we talk about liberation. We don't have to think about, you know, there's something like it's nirvana and this, what's enlightenment and we're going to merge into some, no. The truth of life and of existence is we know what our truth is. Our truth is, it's right in the feel, there's the coolness, that's experience, it just is. That's the truth. That's the truth in this moment. You know, whatever our experience is, that's our truth. I'm sure that you're not talking about not striving to improve yourself or to reach a goal, but I have a hard time understanding that. By the way, that's a chance for me to plug this class coming up this Saturday. There are flyers out there and it's exactly on this topic. It's going to be down at St. Mark's Church Saturday and there's plenty of space that people want to come. But we're going to spend a day on that exact topic. So I can give you my take on it and actually if other people have thoughts on it too, it would be good to hear. So it's true that there's a difference between cultivating and developing qualities and striving has a different connotation. So it's true that Buddha talked about using this phrase like liberation, finding our freedom in life by not clinging, just learning to let go more, right? Which really implies a deep acceptance with things as they are, not struggling against who we are if we don't like just really a deep acceptance of ourselves in life. It's a radical self-acceptance practice. But if I were to say or someone were to say, don't just stop clinging, you couldn't do it, right? Not picking on you, it's me. I mean, you could do it in a moment, but it's all our conditioning or habits of mind or all the things that are still in there, those seeds that are waiting to sprout that when the conditions come together are going to just hook us back in again. See, all of us have experienced moments of liberation, moments where we were really just not the sense of we may not have even been that self-aware in the moment. We were just in the flow of life. We weren't particularly in aversion. We weren't particularly grasping and clinging. We were just kind of maybe a little happy and open and free just in the moment. We've all experienced moments of it. The problem is those parts in us that hook us back in when the right situation happens haven't been uprooted. So we still have the seeds of the potential and then we keep getting hooked back in, right? So where the cultivation comes in is developing some mindfulness to be able to see more clearly, to help us be present with what is. So yes, we are developing some qualities. It's not really a paradox, but maybe a little bit. We are developing, ultimately our meditation practice is just this arising and passing away flow of experience and we're learning to just be open. It's a training for when we get up from the cushion and go out or from the chair and go out into life. That's really what meditation is. It's just a practice. That's why I call it practice, right? We're learning to apply it just into our lives. If we can only do it on the cushion, I don't know if it's very useful, but can we do it in our relationships and everything? So we're practicing. So we are in a sense developing qualities and the Buddha talked about this a lot of concentration, mindfulness. The same thing about developing what they call seal of the morality, living our lives in a way of non-harming to ourselves and others, all these qualities that we can develop. So to help us just be here and now more fully. If we fall into a striving, because everything's just, it's just a matter of balance. So let's just put it this way. Sometimes we want to be cultivating qualities that's probably useful for us, right? Oh, I'm just, I tend to get angry. I need to kind of work on that a little bit and that might be very healthy and what we should be doing. But if we get too much into the striving and all of a sudden it's gotten out of balance now to where it's like we don't even have some acceptance for who we are because we have to, maybe we do in this example, maybe we do have to acknowledge, well, you know, yeah, you know what? There is, I tend to get angry and we want to just give ourselves a break and be accepting. If we get too much in striving, we can get an aversion to ourselves and it's not okay for me to be who and what I am, then maybe the flavor of our practice can shift a little over more to the flavor of just allowing and letting go and accepting and just being with and not so much the cultivating and then that allows us to kind of be more. And that might be what's more useful in that time. But if we get, if that gets out of balance, it can get into, well, you know, I don't have to try or do anything and everything. So it's all, we tend to go back and forth between both flavors of cultivating and so, and being and with and accepting. The striving is maybe getting a little out of balance. Does that make sense? Yeah, it's a matter of wanting to change or grow. I mean, that in itself implies a non-acceptance. Well, I don't know. But see, look, this is kind of getting to this, what we talked about on Monday night about no preferences, right? So maybe I'll just, when you hear Monday night, I don't want to go. Well, basically we're talking about that there was a, the third Chinese patriarch who was this guy who lived, you know, a few thousand years ago, said this famous quote, the great way is not difficult for those who have no preferences, which I find to be very beautiful quote. You have to kind of look and say, well, what does that mean? They have no preferences. Of course, we have preferences, you know, they have all kinds of preferences. We're not going to stop having preferences. We don't say, well, September 11th, that terrorist attack, well, you know, if it happened or didn't, all the same to me, because I don't have any preferences. No, it doesn't mean that all we all, we have lots of preferences, but it's learning. It's more about just finding that way of being in relationship to ourselves without the struggle. So once again, and the Buddha also talked about this a lot, there's sort of a healthy sense of wanting to grow, right? It's a real positive thing, right? If we want to develop, say, a loving heart, it's a beautiful thing. You know, I value that. And for people who value that, you know, I think according to my value system, it's a very positive thing to work on. So we would maybe want to cultivate that a little bit. And I guess you could say, you know, strictly speaking, technically, well, yeah, it's like getting, you know, changing or getting something where you're not, right? But there's another way you can look at it too. Sometimes when we're talking about developing positive qualities, it's just like in, sometimes you'll hear people say, you know, in Buddhism, they talk about this whole idea of non-self. And I don't know if that gets talked about here, right? So Buddhism talks about non-self. All it means is we don't want to constrict, it doesn't mean you don't have a self. Everybody's got a self. We're all here. We all exist. What it just means is, but, you know, if we try to fix ourself in something fixed that can never change, we suffer. As we learn to just be open to just the beautiful, magical unfolding of ourselves, that change, then we're not having to be any fixed thing and we can be open to be anything. That's kind of the idea of it. So it's not this negative, like nihilistic, you don't exist. It's actually very beautiful, opening to the flow of our being. Okay. That's sort of the no self. Well, sometimes in people will say something like, you have to have a healthy sense of self to have no self. And people say, well, what does that mean? If we look at what it means when we typically think of not having a healthy sense of self, generally those are the areas like, you know, we're, I don't know, whatever. We have poor self esteem or shame issues or whatever our things are. And if they're really, really strong, that might be the kind of terminology someone might say like, not a good sense of self, but we don't have boundary issues or whatnot. I'm not a psychologist, but you know, so I might not be saying it right. But you know, that kind of thing. Those tend to be the areas where we're the most caught, the most identified, the most hooked in. When we heal those up, the more we heal them, we don't have to create some new thing we call this healthy sense of self. It's just by healing up those areas where we're the most caught that we would tend to say, one way to say this, we tend to get, we're getting a healthier sense of self. But another thing is we're just healing up the wounded places. We don't have to create this other thing we call a healthy sense of self. It just kind of arises by healing up the wounded places. It's the same thing about cultivating. Sometimes it can be like on a, like you're saying, if we want to be more loving, if our heart's closed, well, what is it about a closed heart? No, I don't know. It's, but whatever, if we want, if we choose to look there and want to work in those areas, I'm just making an example. If we have some healings, for example, that needs to be done, it always starts with some self acceptance there. And that, and out of that, a healing happens that sort of is a natural opening of the heart and sort of what we would call becoming to more of an open, loving heart. We didn't necessarily have to even strive to anything. It's just more of a, it really does all start with this deep self acceptance, right? I don't know, is this making any sense? I'm kind of just rambling along. I mean, I knew someone once, we had this conversation who was doing these, which I think might be a nice thing to do, but there's doing affirmations, which I think can be very helpful. I haven't worked with them that much, but they were, whatever they would say, you know, I'm a confident, such and such kind of person. And they were just doing these affirmations. And I said, you know, you should, no, you're not. What you should be saying is, is like, I'm a scared person. You don't want to cultivate that, but just acknowledge that. And then from there, you know, just to, and let that be okay, just to kind of open and say, you know what? I'm a scared person. I have bad self-esteem. I can talk to you, believe me, for my own experience about poor self-esteem and, you know, and you need to kind of just recognize it first. That's the self-acceptance. And then from there, not with, and it's no good, I want to get rid of it, but just with a lot of love and tenderness and care for ourselves, then we can start to open up into where we want to cultivate, but always starting with the self acceptance. You guys have any thoughts or comments? It doesn't have to be something that, you know, I have to respond back to. Maybe you have your own comments or…? Yes, actually, when you began, you asked about breathing, whether you had any questions about breathing. Oh, yes. And I have since developed life, and that is… And then in reverse, trying to go up almost through the head. It was a bit thoughtful, though. When you say thoughtful, what do you mean? It was a little too forced. It felt too forced. So you were trying to have the breath be a particular way. Yes. But now I'm doing something that might sound equally thoughtful to some people, but for whatever reason, it's worked better. And it actually works up, up through the chakras, one chakra at a time. For whatever reason, that is working better for me. That seems somewhat counterintuitive. And for that reason, I was curious to know other breathing techniques… Well, that's a huge topic, and I just want to say just one thing, just very briefly about it. Well, two things. First is, there's no right or wrong for everything because there are so many styles of meditation. There's so many reasons why we all choose to do whatever our spiritual practice is, even if it's not meditation. And within the realm of meditation, many, many different motivations and types of meditation. And even within what we would call Buddhism, there's so many different… I mean, it's just vast. It is vast. And the reason there's so many different is because people will find, oh, boy, this is working for me. I relate to this. And other people might feel like, no, no, you know what? Oh, no, I don't like that. Oh, this other one over here. Wow, that's the one for me. And so that's why there are a lot of… There is no one right. And I just want to make sure that that's clear. So having said that, in Vipassana practice, in Vipassana, also there's many styles of Vipassana practice. There's not just one. And actually, even Vipassana practice, there's different teachers who, oh, no, that teacher over there, don't do that. No, no, no, another teacher. No, no, this is the way. Don't do that. And not everybody does it. But I'm just saying so. You just have to be aware of that. So if we're using meditation, which I don't know if you are, to… If it gets back to liberation through non-clinging… You gave me those words on Monday night, and I thought they were quite loud. Okay, right. So just opening, really in a deep way to the reality and the flow of our lives, to really be in harmony with life, if you will. One way you can think of working with the breath in that context is that really there's nothing special about the breath compared to any other experience that's arising, whatever is real and true, in a moment. Right. And we tend to use it for several reasons. One is it's there. It's kind of generally for most people, and this is not true for everyone. It tends to be kind of neutral. That is not true for everyone. And for those people that it's not true, we may pick another primary object. We use it kind of as a home base, a resting place. So in this practice, we're not really trying to have… We let the breath be whatever it is. Let the body breathe itself, if you will. We're not controlling it or trying to have a long or short. We're trying to find the place in the body where we can actually experience the physical sensations of the breath, the clearest and the easiest. So for some people, it may be the air entering and leaving at the nostrils or up in the sinus. You can just feel that coolness of air. For some, it may be the physical feeling of the belly, the abdomen, or the chest rising and falling. For some, it's in the throat or it can be the whole breath. So people will find their own. It doesn't matter which. And then we rest the awareness with the breath. It's not a visualization technique. It's actually connecting with the physical body sensation of the breathing. Okay? We just stay with it. The mind's going to wander off, lost in thought. When you wake up, you don't need to worry about it because when you're lost, you can't even think about it anyway. You're just gone. So no big deal. No problem. When you wake up… So you don't need to be in a struggle to try and stay present, right? You just be with the breath. A little bit of effort and energy, but just easy. Open, free, clear, awake. When you're gone, just let yourself be gone. No big deal. Can't stop it. Once you wake up and go, oh, I've been gone. No big deal. Don't make a struggle. You just come back and you just keep returning to the breath over and over. That's kind of a starting point in Vipassana practice. Okay? What that does is it develops some concentration over time, the ability of the mind to settle down and just to really not get pulled off as much. And as you stay with practice, it will develop more. And it develops mindfulness, which is different than concentration. Concentration is the ability to stay connected with… to not be pulled off something. Mindfulness is the actual knowing something. Okay? So we actually are aware of the physical feelings. We actually know. And so, for example, if you're feeling the breath at the nose and if it's like a coolness, you can actually know the coolness. So we work the breath. And then over time, you can stay with the breath. Really, your whole practice could just be with the breath, and that's fine. And there's also ways we can open up to the whole range of our experience then later on of other sensations in the body and thoughts and emotions. And we can work with them in the same way, being present in the moment for what's opening an experience. Is that… Yes. I think I heard the kernel was that, as you described, it keeps it simple. Yeah. So that's kind of a… And focusing on the sensation as opposed to a more visual… Yeah. And also, you may want to experiment… Has anyone ever talked to you about using a mental note or mental labeling technique? So just one last thing, if I can tell you, just for completeness. And some people find this really helpful, and some people don't like it at all. I think it's maybe 50-50 if you took a poll of people. So you may not… You can see if it's useful for you. Say, where you're kind of connecting with the breath, you can make a soft mental note just to help direct the mind to the physical experience, like in, out, or rising, falling, just to help direct the mind a little bit that way, if it's useful. So… So we only have a few minutes left. So this is what happens when someone comes in and hasn't planned out a talk or anything. It just kind of goes wherever it goes. Anything else? Questions? Comments? It doesn't have to be positive. Maybe you think that all this stuff's a bunch of hooey, like my brother. Is it… Did you do some metapractice or just a quiet sitting? Either way, whenever you want. I like to do just a little meta, but how about if we do this? We have 10 minutes left. Perhaps we could sit and silence, and then at just the very last two or three minutes, maybe just a little meta. Would that be all right for everyone? Okay. As we're sitting, I invite you to notice not only your experience in this moment, but the relationship you're having with this experience. Can we find a way to be open to our experience? In a very accepting, free way, in a way, giving up the struggle, really settling into what is. And if we cannot, if we're not able to just be open with our experience, it is to just acknowledge that and to hold ourselves with great kindness, great acceptance, even for that. So, it's very important when we do meta, loving kindness practice, or actually in any practice or in life in general, the self-acceptance is very, very important, starting with who and what we are as we are, just what is actually real and true. And then from that place, connecting in with whatever's going on in the body and in the heart and the mind. And then with a sense of kindness towards ourselves, to send that meta towards ourselves. Sometimes when we do meta practice, we may not actually feel feelings of loving kindness, and that's fine. It's not important what we feel. It is a practice of cultivation. There's no question about it. And it's about the power over time of growing this meta, this quality of loving kindness within ourselves. So, it's like planting seeds. And it's the power of the mind as we work with this over time and really as a lifelong practice. So, if we don't feel loving kindness, we can still just work on just directing the mind generally in that direction. And if it's useful, you can repeat silently to yourself, there are some traditional phrases that I'll give, or you can make up any phrases of your own, or you don't have to use any phrases. And the traditional phrases which we often use are very simple. May I be happy. May I be peaceful. May I be free from suffering. May I be free from suffering. And then you can allow, if you wish, you can allow your awareness to expand out to all the other people here in the room. And to begin with holding everyone here with the same great self-acceptance as much as you can. Sometimes we can't and that's fine too. But just to the extent we can, opening our hearts. And, once again, if it's useful, you could repeat some of the phrases. Just as I wish to be happy, may everyone here be happy. And just as I wish to be peaceful, may everyone here be peaceful. And just as I wish to be free from suffering, may everyone here be peaceful. Free from suffering. And then finally, to extend out beyond this room and out into the community and out into the world, sending this metta to all beings everywhere, in all directions, to those beings near to us and far away, those known to us and unknown, and those seen and unseen. So we don't leave out any living beings. And once again, wishing just as we wish to be happy, may all beings everywhere be happy. And may they be peaceful and free from suffering. And then to end with this poem from the metta sutta. These are the words of the Buddha on loving kindness. Let none deceive another or despise any being in any state. Let none through anger or ill will wish harm upon another. Even as a mother protects with her life, her child, her only child, so with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings.
