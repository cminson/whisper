 Well, I'm pleased to be here. Here are the echoes. And what I want to do tonight is actually to give a talk based on one of my favorite poems. And it's a bit of an indulgence, but I want to talk about a poem that has been very important to me in my own learning and evolution, and to use the poem as a way of exploring a number of concerns and issues about our approach to spirituality, about our sense of practice, about our sense of learning and waking up. And so what I'd like to do is first to read the poem, and I actually have some copies for you, which I made. But what I'd like to do first is just let you hear the poem read out loud, which I think is how poetry is meant to be heard. I don't think poetry is usually meant to be read, at least in the origins. And this is a poem by Mary Oliver. And some of you may know this poem. How many people know Mary Oliver's work? And this is a poem called The Journey. The Journey, Mary Oliver. One day you finally knew what you had to do and began. Though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice. Though the whole house began to tremble and you felt the old tug at your ankles. Men to my life, each voice cried. But you didn't stop. You knew what you had to do. Though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations, though their melancholy was terrible. It was already late enough and a wild night and the road full of fallen branches and stones. But little by little, as you left their voices behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds. And there was a new voice, which you slowly recognized as your own. That kept you company as you strode deeper and deeper into the world, determined to do the only thing you could do, determined to save the only life you could save. Thank you, Mary Oliver. I'll read it again. This is what my 12th grade English teacher always used to say. You need to hear poems at least twice. And we did. So this is the journey once more. One day you finally knew what you had to do and began. Though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice. Though the whole house began to tremble and you felt the old tug at your ankles. Men to my life, each voice cried. But you didn't stop. You knew what you had to do. Though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations. Though their melancholy was terrible. There was already late enough and a wild night and the road full of fallen branches and stones. But little by little, as you left their voices behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds. And there was a new voice, which you slowly recognized as your own. That kept you company as you strode deeper and deeper into the world. Determined to do the only thing you could do. Determined to save the only life you could save. So what I'd like to do is actually to give out some copies. And then I'd like to go through the poem and explore some of the themes. Because for me it's been a very, let's go in a few directions. So everyone has one. Thanks. Thank you. So first I'd like to talk a little bit about the idea of the journey. Because in many ways we can think of our own spiritual practice. We can think of our own lives as a journey. And it's a very powerful metaphor that's used in many traditions. You know in many traditions we also talk about the spiritual path. We talk about walking along a certain path, which is a kind of journey. And the idea of a journey is I think very, very rich. When we're on a spiritual journey, often we have a sense of the direction we're going in. But sometimes we don't. And sometimes we're on a journey and we don't exactly know where we're going. What marks a journey often is that we've left the old behind. And since we've left our home behind, we've left, you know, we might say we've left our habits behind. We go off and are somewhat open to the unknown. It's one of the powers, you know, of travel. That when we travel things are a little mysterious. We don't know who we'll meet. We don't know what we'll find. Sometimes it can be dangerous. Sometimes it can be wonderful. Sometimes it can be very mysterious. And sometimes it can be probably all of those, right? Mysterious, wonderful, dangerous, exciting, scary, and so forth. But there's a way that we open ourselves to new qualities. We open ourselves to discover things about ourselves when we meet people. And we also sometimes find a kind of openness. You know, when you travel, I've always marveled how sometimes in travel one can meet people, you know, and have the most incredibly intimate discussions with them that you'd never have at home with anyone you meet on the street, right? And so there's something that's very exhilarating about a journey. Now what's interesting about this journey is that it begins in one's own house. And in the journey we move out of the house. And I want to talk about these voices, the bad advice, the old tug. We might say that this is about the old habits that we have, that there's a way in which when we're on a spiritual journey, one of the first things we do is that we see what our habits are. We see what keeps us a little bit stuck. In terms of the poem, we hear the bad advice. What's the bad advice to saying? It's basically saying, stay in the house, right? In this poem, the person goes out of the house. We might say that the bad advice is about keep your old habits. Listen to me like you've always listened to me all your life. You know, sometimes I think that what we do when we do meditation practice is we immerse ourselves in bad advice. That's not what's advertised on the flyers. But there's a way in which what do we do when we sit? We listen to our own minds over and over again. And what do we listen to? We listen to our habits. And how much of our habits is basically, we might say, bad advice. And it essentially divides into the bad advice, the bad advice divides into two categories, our own bad advice and the bad advice of others. So this is what we do. This is what the poem says is sort of the starting point of our practice. We sit very innocently for half an hour. And what do we listen to? Well, I'm exaggerating a little bit, of course. But we listen to the bad advice. We listen to the tug. And basically, what's the bad advice telling us? Don't change. Stay as you are. Listen to me. I'm your mother or whatever. A lot of mothers, I'm sure, give very good advice. But a lot of what we hear is sort of urging us to stay safe. And there's something about going on this journey, which is about getting to know our habits well and learning to see them and then go beyond them. So in the poem it says, the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice. And again, the bad advice is basically saying, listen to me, act like me, do what I say. Stay the same. Don't change. I'll be happy. Promise. Right? And that you felt the old tug at your ankles. Men, my life, each voice cried. So this is a poem about how we break through or break free of that bad advice or we break through of those voices. And I was reflecting and looking at the poem. There was a period about four years ago when I had been really working really hard for about nine years. And I was, I teach at this school in San Francisco called the Saybrook Graduate School, which used to be the Institute for Humanistic Psychology. And at one point I was chair of the whole faculty, which I used to go around talking about saying, my job is I'm chair of the whole goddamn faculty. I don't know if Buddhists are supposed to talk like this, but. And I had also been working a lot with Buddhist Peace Fellowship. I was kind of doing too much and I felt like something was drying up a little bit. Like I wasn't really tapping my deeper passions and gifts. I decided to take about a year in which I would leave the school. And I wasn't sure what would happen after that, but I essentially dropped almost everything I was doing. It was nice to have that freedom, of course, not everyone does, but I dropped most of my teaching and I dropped the work with the Buddhist Peace Fellowship. And I was also co-editing a journal called Revision, which some of you may have seen. And I dropped that. And all these people told me that my actions were going to make things difficult for them. It was the mend my life voice, right? I was told at the journal that I was, I was taking, I had been taking the role for about five years of being the coordinator of five editors. And the managing editor told me, if you stop doing this job, the journal will suffer. My people at the school said, if you leave the school, there are going to be a lot of bad things that happen if you're not there. Don't leave. I probably had some comments from my parents as well. And probably from friends that were essentially doing some version of mend my life. Be careful. How are you going to make any money? Look out. Shouldn't you just stay with what you're doing? It's going pretty well. And it took a certain amount of clarity. Because when people say mend my life. Well, they're giving me a certain amount of power. And they're saying, you're doing good work. And I'll suffer because of you or something like that. So there are these voices. The poem is really about how do you come to your own voice? How do you come to your own life in which you tap your passions, your gifts, your deeper sense of yourself? That's what the poem is about. And when we go in that direction, we find there are a lot of voices. There are a lot of voices that make it sometimes very hard to know what to do. Very hard to know how to find ourselves. And it's one of the reasons that we sit in meditation. Because when we sit, the voices aren't quite as loud as sometimes they are when we're just face to face in discussion. And we can start to sort out these voices. We can start to sort out, oh, do I really need to listen to that voice? How much do I really believe in this or that voice? How much do I follow it? How much do I echo myself, those other voices? How much have I internalized one of the voices? And so this beginning of the poem is really telling us that we need to look at those voices. We need to look at the voices that tell us how to act, how to live, how to be, what to do. And then it says, you knew what you had to do. Though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations, though their melancholy was terrible, you knew what you had to do. And I think that this is really about being in touch with something that really moves us. We touch with our deeper truth, something in ourselves that we really trust. And we gradually touch that when we practice. And of course we touch it in other sorts of ways. We touch that with our friends. We touch that maybe in nature. We touch that when we find ourselves in the activities that resonates with our sense of aliveness and resonate with our sense of vision and human possibility and so forth. And so there's something about the beginning of our practice that demands that sense of knowing what to do. I think none of us would even be here unless there was some inner voice that was saying, there's something to look at or I want my life to be a life of integrity. Or I want to live my life around the development of wisdom and compassion. Or it might be I want to find out what that moment was like when I was up in the mountains and I felt the unity with the universe. What was that about? I want to know about that and have that guide my life. Even though it was one moment and I had thousands of other moments of bad advice. I want to listen to that voice when I felt the unity. Or I want to listen to the voice when I felt love. And when I felt love, fill my whole being, fill my whole body, fill my whole consciousness. And so this is in many ways the beginning of our practice. And it keeps on getting reinforced as we practice more. We have a sense that our motivation more and more gets deepened. And we have in a way, we get more and more as it were into ourselves or into our depths. And we have less trouble maybe with those voices. We have some vision. I remember when I did my first long retreat, which was quite a while ago. I was in my mid 20s. And I felt a kind of homecoming. I felt, ah, I've been in different places, but this is what I need to do. This tells me something very deep about my intentions with my life. And so I think we each are, I think, urged by Mary Oliver, by the poem, that the journey really starts to gain clarity when we're in touch with that sense that I knew what I needed to do. I know what I need to do. And yet the poem goes on. It says, it was already late enough and a wild night and the road full of fallen branches and stones. So what's interesting to me about this is the quality that in a way we start waking up midway through our life. It might be literally at mid age, or it might be, it's certainly for most of us, it's after we've lived quite a lot, you know, minimally 15, 20, 25 years. And there's a sense that we, as Mary Oliver says, it was already late enough. We start waking up and we already have a history. We already have some suffering. We already have a certain amount of baggage. We wake up and we may feel, oh my gosh, how can I live a spiritual life? I'm so flawed. Has anyone had that thought? I'm so flawed. Why couldn't I have just had the perfect parents and the perfect spiritual education so that, you know, I had meditation training at age five and then I had all the right school and instead look what I had. Oh my God, I can't even think about junior high, you know, or, you know, oh my gosh, adolescence, oh my gosh, you know, adolescence is always cited as the reason to do spiritual practice fully so you don't get reborn and have to go through adolescence again within the Buddhist context. But we have these, you know, we wake up in a way late and I was even thinking the Dalai Lama said, the Dalai Lama once said, you know, Dalai Lama is someone who had the perfect training, right? You know, supposedly, you know, it was recognized as a Dalai Lama at age two or three, had the greatest meditation masters of Tibet where his teachers at age five, you know, but you look at Dalai Lama and he said he had some problems too. He came from a part of Tibet where everyone was supposed to be irritable. And he actually said until he was 20, he was mostly irritable most of the time. And he said it wasn't until he was 35 that he really appreciated spiritual practice in a deep way. You know, it took him a while. And, you know, so he had in some ways better circumstances than us, you might say, or maybe not. Who can say? But there's a way in which we all wake up late and reminded me of this passage. Some of you know the work of Dante, you know, the divine comedy. And you may remember if you ever read that, I read it in college and some of you may remember it. And it actually begins with Dante saying, I was in midlife and I woke up in a thicket. Which is kind of a metaphor for saying at a certain point in my life, I realized I was confused and that maybe I could wake up a little bit more. And that's what we do. And I actually found the exact quotation with which Dante begins. He says, in the middle of the journey of our life, I came to myself within a dark wood where the straight way was lost. You get that sense? Where the straight way was lost. How hard a thing is it to tell of that wood savage and harsh and dense, the thought of which renews my fear. And so he goes on to say that this was when he really began his spiritual journey. It was dark. He was in the middle of his life and he started. And so I think that that's really, it's important to remember that that's the way it happens for most of us. I mean, I know for myself, there's a way in which I sometimes criticize myself for not having woken up more earlier. Has anyone ever had that experience? And one of my teachers, Sylvia Borstein says that there's something really peculiar about this waking up process, which is that as we wake up, we often criticize ourselves for how long we were asleep, which when you think about it is a little bit perverse. Think about it. I mean, if you're woken up and all you can think about is how long you were asleep. Why? You should just, oh, wonderful. I'm awake. I see through that pattern. I see that bad habit I've done a hundred times. And now I see it clearly, but sometimes all we think about is, oh my gosh, you wasted so much time. You blew it spiritually. And then, you know, that can of course trigger other patterns in the mind and heart. And so there is, I think that this is maybe this statement of it was already late enough in a wild night. It's really an invitation to be friendly towards ourselves and compassionate and know that we all are, I don't know if flawed is the word, but we have a history, we each have histories, you know, and we have some things which are difficult. We have ways we're stuck. Everyone does. Dalai Lama has ways he's stuck. He says so. No problem. You know, everyone has it that way. So the poem goes on. Little by little, as you left their voices behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds and there was a new voice which you slowly recognized as your own. And so this is really pointing to the way that part of this practice is to really come into our own being. You might say our own authenticity if you want to use that language. Our own sense of knowing what's true, really. It's really about that. Our own sense of knowing what's true, embodying it, and actually distinguishing our own deep voice. You might say it's what I am when I am most myself. And we distinguish it from the conditioning. We distinguish it from what we were told to be or told to do. That's the bad advice. And actually some of the bad advice may be not all that bad. It may actually be helpful. But what we do in this practice is we come to this very open sense of intelligence and compassion which is not at all about accepting other people's views, about accepting secondhand views. It's about really seeing for ourselves, knowing for ourselves. And there's something about that which is also about actualizing our own gifts, our own potential. Something very powerful here. And this I think is what Mary Oliver is pointing to, the sense of finding our own voice. And it's the voice which we find as we've left the other voices behind. We've gone through this wild night, she says. It's not an easy process to find. It's not an easy process to be ourselves, is it? It's hard. And actually I can almost sense there are a lot of tears. There are a lot of tears in becoming ourselves. There's a lot of struggle. There's a lot of solitude. There's a lot of loneliness. There's a lot of confusion. But this is the process that we follow. And this practice is one very basic way of becoming ourselves. And there's a beautiful poem. It was actually a part of a poem by the Vietnamese teacher Thich Nhat Hanh. And he says in this part of the poem, I think this is more or less accurate, he says, don't talk to me about love. Just be yourself. Let me see, I think I have it here. Why speak of the need to love one another? Just be yourself. You don't have to become anything else. So don't even worry about these great categories of love and wisdom, compassion, emptiness, all the other Buddhist terminology. He's basically saying just deeply, deeply, deeply be yourself. That's much easier said than done, isn't it? That's partly why we're here. That's why we practice. We learn better how to do that. And again, we do it by really noticing all the stuff that's in our minds that we have to kind of work through. So Mary Oliver goes on to say, as you recognize that voice, you go deeper and deeper into the world. The voice keeps you company as you strow deeper and deeper into the world. And I love the irony of this. She's talking about being yourself more and more, but it's like being yourself more and more takes you into the world. You might think the opposite. Learn to be yourself more and more, and you're kind of just on your own. You're yourself. But she's saying there's something about being ourselves, finding your own voice, which actually permits you to be with others. That's one way to say it. That as we are more truly ourselves, more authentic, more knowing our own voice, we can be ourselves with others and we can actually be of use in the world. We can be of use to others. We can be helpful. And this really calls to mind the Buddhist image of the Bodhisattva, this very inspiring notion. The Bodhisattva is literally would be translated as enlightenment being, but it's the being who's dedicated both to one's own awakening and the awakening of others. And so for me, this last part of the poem is about the way that when we find ourselves, we find also find ways to be with others and we can actually be of use. And we go, we almost, I mean, it's kind of the rhythm of meditation, isn't it? We withdraw somewhat, we sit and we practice. And sometimes we have to do that for quite some time. Or I know personally for me, doing a number of long retreats has been completely, personally been very necessary that there's a way that I withdraw. I find myself, I do the purifying work of separating out what's conditioning, what's the bad advice and that I learned to see that more. I learned to see the way that I've developed certain self images because of others, developed the ways of being that I come to see my own patterns of fear and confusion. And I get to know those really, really well. And sometimes that takes a certain amount of solitude. Sometimes that takes a certain amount of individual practice, meditation practice or whatever, work therapeutic nature with friends, you know, in intimate relationships. We do that kind of work sometimes a little bit separated from the world, but then it prepares us to go out and be full in the world. That's I think the vision that I think is held by the center that we do this individual work, but it prepares us to really be in the world and to be of use and to bring that wisdom and compassion into the work we do, into the work in the world. So Mary Oliver ends by saying, as you strode deeper and deeper into the world, determined to do the only thing you could do, determined to save the only life you could save. And again, I think there's a sense of paradox almost that as we save ourselves, we go deeper into the world and we actually can help save others, you might say. We can be of use. We see that balance between finding our own life and then being with others. But I sense that she's saying that we have to start with our own life, that in a sense we have to save ourselves first, as it were. Buddhists don't use the language of saving. They don't talk about saving ourselves. We talk about waking up. And as we've woken up a little bit, then we can help others wake up. And we sort of, we could call this practice, waking up together practice. I don't know what that would be in Pali or Sanskrit, but we could call this the waking up together hall. Because we all, we learn how to be alone, but we also learn how to be together. And we, as we form more of a community, we also share with each other and we share what we've learned from our own experience and we can really be of use to people. So I think I will just end by reading the poem one more time and then we could have some discussion about anything that was sparked. The journey. One day you finally knew what you had to do and began. Though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice. Though the whole house began to tremble and you felt the old tug at your ankles. Men my life each voice cried, but you didn't stop. You knew what you had to do. Though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations. Though their melancholy was terrible. It was already late enough and a wild night and the road full of fallen branches and stones. But little by little as you left their voices behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds and there was a new voice which you slowly recognized as your own that kept you company as you strode deeper and deeper into the world. Determined to do the only thing you could do, determined to save the only life you could save. So thank you. Thank Mary Oliver. Thank the Buddha. And thank the hall. So. You picked up all of these vendors on this extreme responsibility and you decided to take off for a year? More or less. Very, very, very badly. No, no, no. Look at me. Well, it was wonderful, actually. And I would encourage people to take time. I think in our culture we don't do that quite enough. We don't take enough breaks. But I let go of a lot of structure. And that was sometimes scary, you know, to have a lot of structure and suddenly let go of it. So it was definitely sometimes difficult. My sense was that I needed to let go of things and let go of structure to let the deeper passions as it were come more to the surface. I had a sense of what those were as it were intellectually. But I needed to feel in my guts something deeper that was motivating me and that when I was so busy was hard to have that. Even if I kind of knew what it was and it was there at times, I wanted to have that be stronger. I wanted to have that aspiration be stronger. You might say I wanted to have my voice be stronger or know my own voice better. And I did some things minimally. I still had to do some teaching with my school. So I worked on an arrangement where I was only to be in contact with students the first five days of each month. And I told my students if you don't want this, find someone else. And so I created boundaries. I had to do some work and I was actually getting some money for doing that. So I created a very firm boundary, which is very important for this sort of thing. So I created a boundary. And then also I probably was positive. I had some contact with everyday life. It just was not so much. And I had about four months out of the year when I had no contact. Because I knew I wanted to do a long meditation retreat in the start in September. And I wanted to do a long meditation retreat in February and March at Spirit Rock, which I did. And otherwise I did some teaching. I taught some short retreats. I traveled to Tennessee, I think, twice in that year. Where I used to live in Kentucky and I had contacts and friends in Kentucky and Tennessee. So I went back there and did some teaching twice, I think. And I also went up to British Columbia on a trip and did some trainings and spent time. I have native friends up there and I spent time with some of my friends up there for a while. But mostly I was around here. Those of you who haven't worked for a while know that it's amazing how busy you can be even if you don't have a job. Anyone experienced that? It's surprising. I have a friend now who's not working and she says she's busier than when she was working full time. But in any case, I let structures go. And I tried to just sort of trust in the unfolding of my life. So it was actually to take some structure off and to be a little more playful. To take each day sort of freshly, what do I do for a while? Of course I had some responsibilities and commitments. And then doing the retreat, I actually did several retreats, including the long retreat. Probably in the year, the 13 months or so that really were made up this time, I did about four months on retreat. So it was a lot of time on retreats. And that opened up a lot of things. But I think I was very, I was fresh. And over the course of, and towards the end of the year, I really got clear in my guts that I was really called just to really shift my life away from the school, do more of this kind of work, both in my own life and in terms of teaching and writing. And also to really have more passion for the connection of inner work and social change, which is one of my passions that I followed with Buddhist Peace Fellowship. So at the end, towards the spring of that year, I started doing some teaching in that area. And it really felt like something was really coming more fully alive. That's the short version. Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. But some of it was quite hard, you know. In that retreat, in the two-month retreat, I really came to grips with some of those old voices and certain number of demons, you know. And that were very, very interesting. And I had one voice which I had to work with, which basically said, you shouldn't have been involved with the school for so long. You should have done meditation much more. You blew it spiritually. It's a harsh voice, you know. Can you imagine that voice? Have you ever told yourself that you sort of blew it from the point of view of your deeper values? Has anyone ever had that happen? No, one or two in the corner. So during that retreat, I had to really work with some. I worked a lot with John Travis, who was just wonderful with the question of sort of self-judgment. So certain men of self-judgments had to come up and be worked through before I could be more fully myself. That's some of the territory that we work through when we, I'm sure all of you know, or most of you know, we work through that territory of judging ourselves harshly, or being confused, or doubting ourselves, all these different energies that we have to grapple with. Please, yeah. What's the meaning of it? Say a little more. Well, you mentioned that I have some idea of that, I don't know where I've gotten from of what it is, but I don't know what your definition is. Oh, yeah. Well, you know, in some traditions, it's actually understood as something that's external, that, you know, these external forces that just come to torment us. I think in this practice, we think, I use the word demon very metaphorically to mean the main patterns which keep me in bondage, you know, and which visit me regularly, you know. And there's, yeah, so my self-judgment could be a demon. My, maybe my addiction could be a demon. It's the way, you might say they're the bars on my cage, the main bars on my cage. And what this practice does is that it, just by sitting with our own minds, and this is why, this is really how the practice works, we sit there and we actually give some space for the demons to present themselves. Because in daily life, sometimes we're so busy, the demons are kind of there, you know, gnawing on our ear or something, so to speak, but we don't get a chance to really be with them so fully. So that's something that does happen with this practice. And in fact, in some ways, when we just sit with ourselves, one of the things, I mean, we also get in touch with our beauty and our love and our compassion, but we do come more in contact with what's really difficult for us and what is sometimes rather unconscious. You could say, at first the demons are really unconscious patterns, you know, it's, and we start to get a glimpse of them by the fact that we find ourselves suffering. And we may not know, here I am, just walking down the street innocently and I have some interaction with someone and I find myself in a bad mood or suffering a lot for, you know, a few hours or a day or two. And we start to just, we just start to study that which brings us suffering. And sometimes that takes the form of very clear psychological patterns and some of them are kind of connected with our family, some of them are with the culture and so forth. Does that help some? Yeah. Please. For someone, if you were to advise someone who's going on a meditation retreat for the first time, what kind of duration would you suggest, what kind of thoughts do you have in that kind of thing? Yeah. Have you done some daily practice for a while? For how long? About a year. About a year. Often on for many years and have you studied a lot? Do you have a pretty good sense of what this is about? I think so. Yeah. And how is your body in terms of when you sit? Is there a lot of pain or not too much? Pretty comfortable. Okay. I think my own pattern was to do it somewhat gradually but I jumped in. I think I did about a year when I first started with an adult education class where someone taught me how to say om. I did that for about a year, mostly in the woods or something. But when I first, I think after I first got meditation instruction, I really got into it. I started practicing a lot and I think I started doing day-long retreats and I didn't do my first long retreat for a year. And then I did about a week but I had done several times of a day-long and a few weekends in that year. So if you want to go gradually, just do a lot of day-longs. But I would say you could actually, from what you told me, you could go and do a week without too much worry. But if you want to just get the flavor of it, do a day, do two days. And yeah, because you have a lot of the foundations present. So you could go into a week, you could actually probably do more without if you wanted to. Please. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot offered besides that, but I'm excused a lot of these. Yeah. The stuff that comes up just because I keep the mouse up for a while. Well, it's, yeah, there are challenges, but there's, I mean, most people I know, there's just so much, so much to learn, and so much that's extraordinary about that, the being silent, and not to have to interact socially with people all the time. I mean, you don't have to, when you walk towards them, you don't have to say, how are you doing? A lot of people, that's incredible relief. And you get on retreats, you can just walk towards people and say nothing, and they don't think that you're weird or something. But it's, yeah, it's, it's wonderful to do that exploration, and I think, I think there are great opportunities here to sort of choose your area. And the other thing to say is that in this tradition of insight meditation, people who lead retreats, and the general idea, it's very, very gentle and oriented towards your own needs, and there's, if you wanna have a bit of a drill sergeant mentality, you can go into Zen. But here, it's a little bit, you know, wanna not push you too hard. You can, although if you wanna be pushed hard, you can ask for it. Okay, please. I'm just curious, I don't see in the context of the call here any basis for this police officer. In fact, it seems quite explicitly saying that you don't listen to the voices, that you don't say one, that you can only say one person at that yourself. And so I'm wondering, am I missing something in the context here? Well, I was, first of all, I think that the emphasis of the poem is to see, mostly others appear as bad advice, you might say. But I was mostly going with, there was something about that line near the end about, that kept you company as you strode deeper and deeper into the world. It's your own voice. It's your own voice, but it's being. Right, but you go into the world. I admit that there's not a really fully developed sense of what you do in the world, but that's what I was interpreting, the sense of going deeper and deeper into it. Because it doesn't have to say that. It could mention nothing about the world, but there's something, and actually, well, maybe you're right here, maybe it's here that I'm making some leaps of interpretation. But I did want to connect the way that finding one's own voice is so closely connected with actually going authentically into the world, which is certainly my own experience. And I think I wanted, we could ask Mary, I could send Mary Oliver a letter and ask her what she meant by that line. But what I was wanting to read in it, and I may have read too much, but what I was wanting to read was this experience that when you know yourself, that's when you really can know others. Yeah. I'm kind of wondering the way that, you know, the students often will use the phrase and know how hard it is to live a pure life. Yeah. When you're living in a homeboat, household, yeah. Yeah. On the report from the home, like in homelessness. Yeah. And that sense of it being in the home, that symbol of the home, that oppressive thing that tied this down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, at least leaving the bad home. Yeah. Yeah, did you like the poem? It's been important for me, you know, and actually this was an important poem in that time that I was talking about. Because it really was about, it's a lot about coming to grips with all those voices, you know, and seeing them and distinguishing which are helpful and which are not. This is the book that it comes from, New and Selected Poems by Mary Oliver. And some of you know her work, but she's a wonderful poet and I guess won the, Pulitzer Prize National Book Award really, lives on Cape Cod. Maybe time for one more and then should we, if we're gonna end right at nine. Yeah, please. No, I have another interpretation of that and I think I just heard some of the value of all of this that you do the work on yourself and it generates out. And so by working on ourselves, we actually affect our communities and our communities then we fall affect larger kind of thing. Yeah. Well, I love the notion, and this is what we work with with Buddhist Peace Fellowship, we work a lot with the notion that we do our own work and we do work with others simultaneously. And sometimes we need to do our own work to, for something to happen, but we can also, especially if we have a way of looking within and a way of noticing our own patterns, noticing where we get caught, where we get stuck and noticing our wonderful qualities as well, that when we notice that, then we can actually start to do practice in an interactive way. We can do that in our relationships, we can do that at work if other people have the same understanding. And so I know when we do, when I was on the Buddhist Peace Fellowship board, we would have at the beginning of our meetings or sometimes particularly when we do three day retreats together, which we did twice a year, we would have communication agreements that gave us some guidelines for how to interact with each other. And one of the guidelines was that when we had conflicts developed, we wanted to work with them. And so when we've done our own work, we can actually know ourselves well enough so that when we have a problem, we don't just blame others, but we can say, we can look and we can say, oh yeah, I know that pattern. That pattern is when someone criticizes me, I get defensive or something. I can know that. And I can, when I know that pattern well enough and I'm in a group, I don't have to instantly get defensive with someone and we can talk about it and there can be a certain maturity of the way we are with each other. So that's another way to look at it that we can also very much do our own work. And some things we have to do just, we have to do the work of moving through our demons or moving through our difficult patterns. But often if we have friends and we have a certain connection with them, they can be very helpful. Like, you know, and of course we know that, right? Probably we know they can be incredibly helpful for saying, you know, hopefully with some humor, there you go again or there's that pattern again or whatever. So I think that's actually where this practice is evolving in this culture. I think we're gradually evolving a way that we do both the inner work and we also gradually come to be able to do the work with others at the same time. And that's hard because it demands a certain level of maturation. So I want to thank you for listening to one of my favorite poems and exploring these really powerful, wonderful issues together. And if you have further reflections, let me know. And I think I can be reached. I think the center has my contact information. Anyway, maybe through, let's see, through Gil or through others. I could leave my email. I just wanted to remind everyone or for those that are new that our center and our speakers are supported through Donna or the practice of generosity. And there are two boxes at the door that if you want to offer something, you can get back to me. Thank you very much. So let's just sit for about another minute or two and we'll do a closing. And the practice that we call a dedication of merit. So letting be present, whatever was most helpful from the evening, be present to oneself now. Maybe from the trip over here or the sitting or the talk or discussion, what had most resonance with oneself? We can ask ourselves, are there any intentions that I take from this evening? Are there any intentions I want to bring into action, into actuality? And so in closing, we do a version of this practice called the dedication of merit, which is an old Asian practice that's typically done at the end of gatherings or retreats. And it's a chance that we offer what's been most valuable, the fruits of our time together. And we offer it to all beings. We offer it for the benefit of all. And we can use different language to communicate this. And I'll just give one very brief way to close. So may we share the insights, the learning, the fruits of the evening. May we share those benefits very widely with all with whom we're in contact. Knowing that we do this practice not just for ourselves, but for all others. And we dedicate this evening to the healing and the awakening of wisdom and compassion in all beings. So thank you very much.
