Greetings everyone.
Thank you for your practice.
And I just invited you if you wanted to put a word in chat about what's coming up after having done this practice of compassion, cultivating compassion for ourselves and then turning to a benefactor or a friend and really appreciating your offerings.
Grateful for mind settling, gratitude, love, allow surprises. I love that.
Compassion, love and intimacy and a bit more compassion towards my mother once a benefactor now and a lot of pain and need.
I'll bring that in. Thank you for that. I'll bring that into the teaching how these categories of friend and challenging being and neutral, they're all so shifting and changing all the time.
And in fact, we can be at a given time, we can be ourselves, we can be our benefactor, we can be our own challenging person, the person we're having challenges with.
So these categories, they're not fixed. So I appreciate that.
Coming in and without attachment to outcome. Yes. Yes.
Present awareness of the breath of the breath of interaction.
Passing to distraction, yes, reassurance, et cetera, et cetera, so many beautiful offerings.
Yeah, timeliness.
So as we continue our exploration this week of cultivating compassion, cultivating compassion.
And just briefly to review that compassion is the love child of kindness, of metta plus suffering.
So when metta, kindness, loving kindness, love, goodwill, so many nuances of metta meets challenges, meets pain, it becomes compassion.
That's what compassion is. Meeting suffering with kindness.
Not meeting suffering with ignoring it or oh, I wish it was otherwise or pushing it away or anger, like why is it happening now?
Why is this person suffering? Why am I so? No, with kindness, oh, sweetheart. Yeah, this is hard.
Yeah, this is hard. Acknowledging that it's hard.
And yesterday we also talked about this cognitive aspect because we need to appreciate, we need to understand, we need to really rock that.
Yes, this is hard. This is hard. This is hard.
Anyone in this situation, myself or others, they would be having a hard time.
This is hard. This is hard. And that ouch, that this is hard acknowledgement is really the first and most important step.
And then, of course, it is important to how to be moved by the emotional suffering and have a desire and intention to see the relief of it, to see it ease.
So that kindness really coming and holding it.
So a few more reflections today as we brought in, we first brought in ourselves and then moved to bring in a dear friend or benefactor, someone who's been kind to us.
Or this category sometimes they're put together as we did, putting together and traditional teachings, they're separate, benefactor and dear friend are separate.
But here we have five days and we usually bring them together.
So this category actually, a lot of times for people practicing with the dear being with these categories,
we can fall into what's called empathetic distress and compassion can become what's called its near enemy in the teachings.
So in the classical language, there is a near enemy and there is a far enemy of all these practices.
The near enemy is something that feels like compassion.
It masquerades as compassion, but is not compassion.
It's actually its enemy, but it's such a near enemy.
So one near enemy of compassion or one masquerader, if you want to use not the classical language, but the masquerader is empathic distress and pathetic distress.
And empathic distress is when you meet, when you acknowledge the suffering of someone who's dear to you.
And this could happen for yourself as well.
Of course, it's not just for others, but for example, I'm going to use the example of others.
You meet their suffering, but you become so engaged, so engaged with the suffering.
And the kindness to goodwill is not strong enough to hold it.
So it falls into just suffering.
So you're just suffering.
You're not holding it with enough goodwill.
It's out of balance, compassion.
When the goodwill, when the kindness is out of balance with meeting suffering, it tips into empathic distress.
And empathic distress could feel like grief, could feel like, oh, this is so hard.
I can't do this.
Compassion burnout.
In fact, there is no compassion burnout because compassion is always balanced with kindness.
It's empathic burnout when we're just empathizing, when we're just feeling someone's pain.
And if you keep feeling someone's pain without the kindness to that self, to support the feeling, then, of course, it's just too painful.
So empathic distress, empathic distress also feels like if somebody is in the waves and they're suffering, you jump into the waves with them and now you're both drowning.
And it's not helpful to anyone in empathic distress.
Or as compassion, there's a sense of stability and you're inviting them.
You're extending a loving hand and you're holding their hand.
You're extending a branch in your heart to wish them well.
You're feeling, you're observing, you are with their suffering.
But there is so much kindness and goodwill and stability of equanimity that you're not falling into the suffering with them.
This is a very important distinction I'm trying to make because many people think that say, oh, I can't do compassion.
It's too hard. It's too painful.
Actually, it's empathic distress that's painful.
So they might be, we might have been practicing empathic distress, not compassion.
Practicing compassion actually feels good.
It feels lovely. It's uplifting.
It uplifts your heart, your body, your mind.
It feels good bringing in some research results.
So when people are practicing empathic distress, when they're just feeling the suffering, not full compassion, but just empathizing,
areas of the brain, networks of the brain, light up in fMRI, and this has been studied by Tanya Singer and others,
Clemechi and others, or lots of papers, where the area of the brain, the networks that light up are just the networks of pain.
And if you watch someone be, for example, if you watch a video of someone being poked, the same area of your brain that has to do with pain for this hand, it will light up.
So similarly, that only the empathy part, if you're feeling someone else's pain, if you're just empathizing, areas of your brain that only have to do with pain, they light up.
So of course, they'll just be painful, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain. You don't want to do that.
However, studies, if someone in the fMRI actually is instructed and they know, and this has been actually studied with Matthew Ricard, the long-term monk and really person who knows compassion,
practice of compassion and others too, with the practice of compassion, both there is the feeling, the areas of the brain that light up when you feel someone else's pain light up,
but also these other networks light up that have to do with kindness, with filial attachment, with warmth, with love, with all of those.
So these two together make up compassion. It's not just feeling someone else's pain.
Ooh, that's just pain. And it's not sustainable. But compassion holds this. So both of these networks, when they all light up, oh yeah, it's actually a beautiful practice for cultivating our heart to meet pain with love, with kindness,
and it feels good. It feels good. There is bitter sweetness. There's a tenderness. So explore that for yourself, please.
And the last quick thing I want to bring up is non-attachment to outcome.
And we do this practice. We do this cultivation, both not attached to outcome, you know, we're not going to call a person, okay, so I've been doing compassion for you.
It's all your pain gone now. Okay, attachment to outcome externally, and also attachment to outcome internally. And this could be a little confusing,
because yes, we are doing this practice to cultivate compassion, but not attachment to results right now. Okay, I didn't feel anything in this practice.
I didn't feel this universal compassion that I've heard about. I didn't feel it right now. Why not? Why not?
And you're planting seeds. Trust that they will actually, they will flower. These seeds will flower in their own time. So have patience. You are doing your part. You are doing your own cultivation.
You're doing your peace. And let go of the rest. Do your best. Let go of the rest.
So much more to say about the practice of compassion. There are more near enemies. Maybe I'll discuss them tomorrow, PT being one of them. I'll discuss that.
And may you practice compassion today, and be tuned to both feeling the suffering, but holding it with love, with care, both for yourself and for others, and tune into how differently that feels than just feeling the pain.
And you can explore that for yourself and see that, yeah, it's very different. One is nourishing, the other is not. The other one is just pain.
Wishing you well the rest of the day. If you practice, opportunities for practice are plenty of them. Life on Earth is challenging for all of us. Being human is hard work.
And actually being on Earth is difficult. So thank you all. Be well, and looking forward to practicing together tomorrow.
