The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Here we go. So hello and welcome everyone to happy hour, to practicing
together in this moment in time. So, so happy hour. Why happy hour? Well,
it's self-explanatory, but it helps to consider why this hour is called happy hour.
The practices of what's called the Brahma viharas, the heavenly abodes, meta, loving-kindness,
compassion, practice, vicarious joy, which is happiness for happiness of others, equanimity,
gratitude, forgiveness, just these various beautiful practices of the heart
are happy-making. They make us happy, make us happy, make other people happy.
It's there are happy-making as you might have experienced. And also happiness may not be
experienced as a big smiley face on the round, big smiley face on the yellow face.
It's a different, it can be a different kind of happiness. There's a sense of peace,
there's a sense of ease, there's a sense of well-being that can come with these practices.
Of course, there are various research studies nowadays that suggests that especially practices
of gratitude and loving-kindness and compassion are conducive to happiness. They haven't done so much
research yet on vicarious joy, it turns out. Actually, I haven't seen too much on that because
it's such an interesting concept in the West to feel happiness for the happiness of others.
I think what usually comes up for people is envy, but actually that practice, happiness
for the practice, happiness of others, vicarious joy is the most happy-making, is the most happy-making
practice. As is equanimity, there's a sense of equipoise and ease and beauty that can come.
The sense of it's a deep happiness, it's a deep, deep-seated happiness and of course compassion.
It's not a sad, difficult, painful experience. People often confuse empathic distress when
they're feeling the pain of others so much that there is no cushioning of care, of love,
so they think compassion is painful and sad and difficult. I don't want to, you know,
compassion fatigue, which is actually empathy or empathetic distress fatigue.
So I just wanted to give a nod to why we're called happy hour. Given that so many evenings,
it's, you know, we practice compassion, etc., which again, for the old-timers, you know, you know
the change and the shift that this makes in your own experience, in your own,
the landscape of your own mind. So with that as the frame for practicing today,
tonight, I wanted to invite us this week, given other so many challenges in the world, especially
in the war zones, so much pain and suffering, that we turn towards it with the practice of
compassion and equanimity, both to hold, to hold witness both for ourselves and for the world,
with this sense of care, love, which is stable, which is stable, it doesn't topple over into
into empathic distress or agony or grief, but feels care and love meets the suffering, meets
the suffering, the love-meeting suffering, but with the sense of balance and spaciousness,
because as you well know, doom-scrolling and exposing ourselves way too much to
to news that is challenging, does not help us, does not help anyone else. It's important to be
informed, it's important to be to be aware and to help in every possible way we can,
but to be addicted, to have this addictive quality to bad news and challenging news that can actually
veer us off into empathic distress is not helpful for anyone. So in that way, I'd like to dedicate
tonight's practice and happy hour to compassion and equanimity, both meeting suffering with care
and equi-poise for the sake of ourselves as well as the world. We also just one last thing is
in order to frame, and the frame also is, as Thich Nhat Hanh said, often on refugee boats,
if everyone panics, the boat capsizes, but if there's one person who's calm, one person who cares,
cares enough to be calm, the boat can't survive. So can we be the one who cares with a sense of calm
in the boat of our friends, relatives, loved ones, or what's happening in the world now?
So without further ado, I'd like to invite us to enter our practice, our meditation posture,
whether you're sitting or lying down, whatever is appropriate for you, respecting your body
so that you are comfortable, you can be sitting or lying down or even standing up.
Ah, arriving, arriving in this moment, releasing, releasing what's not helpful
as we take refuge in the heart space, in the quiet of this moment, in this cultivation practice,
relaxing the body here, releasing thoughts in the past, future,
even releasing, clinging to the present too hard,
and abiding, abiding, spaciously in the sensations with the sensations of this body,
there is a body, there is a body, there is breath,
allowing each breath to be soothing, calming, nourishing, grounding in this moment.
So without a rise, as they will arise, can we release them smilingly, can we smilingly,
not judgmentally, but smilingly release them, release, return, take refuge, ah, here, here.
Ah, releasing, releasing what is not helpful right now,
returning the breath to the body, the refuge in this heart space,
releasing, smilingly.
This breath, there's the goodness of my intention, to connect, to connect.
Connecting, connecting with the breath, with the body, each and every moment, as we settle,
we continue to arrive.
Letting the breath, move through the chest, the trunk, the abdomen, the whole body,
whether it's deep or shallow, and let there be a sense of expansiveness with the breath.
As if the breath isn't just moving through the body, but expands and includes
the whole body, expands beyond the body, as if a sphere of breath, this sense of spaciousness,
that you're sitting in spaciousness, held in spaciousness.
Connected to the breath, let the bodies be soft and relaxed,
sitting in held in spaciousness.
Not effortful, you're just sitting, being held,
in spaciousness, inside, outside, it's already here, you don't have to work so hard,
and it includes and contains everything, even if there is tightness, entanglement,
challenging physical sensations, pain, challenging emotions, it holds everything,
it holds everything, spaciousness, inside and outside can coexist and hold
every difficulty, not pushing it away,
not antagonistically, but patiently, spaciously,
soothingly, caringly, holding all, internally and externally.
With the sense of equipoy, spaciousness, already here,
simply becoming aware of it as if through your peripheral vision,
not directly staring at it. Oh yeah, there is peace already,
and other things too, but the peace is already here.
you
from this sense of spaciousness, equipoys, peace,
expansive spaces, holds you, and everything that might be challenging in this body or mind,
with care, just breathing, sensing, feeling held,
and letting this spaciousness that it's holding,
this being who's me, with care, with stability,
acknowledge that it's expansive, above and beyond
my imagination, your imagination,
a peaceful knowing, a peaceful,
stable, caring, loving knowing,
pervading, pervading from this heart,
from this heart-mind, expansively holding this being who's me and beyond,
all beings everywhere, in all conditions,
spacious, peaceful,
caring, knowing,
permeating through the entire world, boundless.
This care, caring, knowing, loves, cares, compassionate,
can no suffering and touch it with love, touched with care,
meeting, suffering, balanced with care, goodwill, well-wishing,
like a bright, bright, warm light,
the care bringing goodness to yourself and to others, anyone it touches.
You are deserving of meta, of compassion yourself, just as is everyone else.
You are deserving of meta, of compassion.
I all beings everywhere, including myself,
have ease, peace,
may pain, sorrow,
dukkha, challenges,
be held with ease, be met with ease, with love, with care,
may all beings, including myself, have freedom,
both in the midst of and from suffering.
Or simply, I care, I care, I care.
Let there be spaciousness continuously,
if your heart and mind collapse into tightness, remember the spaciousness,
the balance, the equipoise,
expand your perspective, if it collapses at any point.
I care, I care.
I care.
I care.
I care.
I care.
I care.
I care.
I care.
I care.
I care.
As we bring this practice period to a close, this meditation period to a close,
appreciating ourselves for having tried, having sat, letting go of any judgment
that might be arising in this moment.
Oh, you were distracted, you were not good meditator.
Let it go, let it go, release, not needed.
And instead, appreciate the goodness.
We've come together, you've come as a part of the sangha to practice.
How beautiful is that?
How beautiful is that?
Appreciateing, appreciating your own goodness, efforts, cultivations,
even if there was a moment, a millisecond of care, connection for your own
sorrow for those of others and dedicate, together we dedicate the goodness
of our actions, rippling through the word,
rippling through the world for the goodness, for the benefit
of all beings everywhere.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings everywhere be free.
Thank you everyone, thank you for your practice.
So, what we were engaging with tonight, today, is a combination,
is a way into compassion through equanimity, so that there is a sense of stability, care,
spaciousness, and then there is care, love, permeating that then can hold suffering.
So, starting from equanimity into compassion, into holding compassion.
Sometimes this practice can work the other way around people.
You can start with compassion and if it becomes too overwhelming, you end up in empathic distress,
then you can bring in equanimity.
But I like, well, both are good, all practices are great.
And this is a lovely way, lovely way to bring in more equipoise into your compassion practice.
So, any reflections, any observations that you made,
any insights that came up, you're welcome to raise your hand if you haven't shared in the
space for a while.
You can also type in chat, if it's typed just to me, I won't read your name,
it will be private reflection that I will read out.
Type it to everyone, then I'll read your name also, attribution.
What did you notice?
What was this like for you?
Was it different?
Was it interesting?
Was it something that opened up or not?
Maybe it was challenging, maybe there was nowhere to land.
Anything for your own benefit and those of others.
One reflection, I thought of myself as a tree rooted to the ground and offering shelter to others.
Oh, this is such a beautiful image.
Thank you so much for sharing this.
This is so beautiful, it warms my heart.
I thought of myself as a tree rooted to the ground and offering shelter to others.
That is so beautiful.
I am so touched and inspired.
Thank you for that.
Susan, please.
Yeah, thank you, Nikki.
That was so timely.
I was just talking with a friend today who was just so overwhelmed with sadness about
the war situation.
It's just like you were talking to her all the point of your way.
Yeah, but just thanks for that distinction between the empathetic distress and the compassion,
which actually feels good.
And I know that, but it's so helpful to hear that articulated.
And I love the spaciousness of bringing that large, warm presence to hold everything.
Thank you.
Thank you, Susan.
Thank you so much for your reflection and highlighting how timely this offering has been
for you and your friend.
And yeah, please send her a pointer to this guided meditation on audio dharma on YouTube.
And also this metaphor, I love the metaphor, this tree rooted in the ground offering shelter.
How beautiful is that also?
Yeah.
And however way it came up for you all.
So I love the way you described it, Susan, the sense of care, this permeating warmth,
touching everyone.
So thank you for that.
Yeah, beautiful.
And the other reflections before we turn.
Yeah, another reflection, simply letting go.
Yeah, it's with the spaciousness, with the spaciousness of equanimity, there is a letting go.
And here there is also a sense of care.
There's a sense of care that permeates together with the letting go.
Yeah, one more reflection.
I felt the caring in my body.
Yay.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Yay.
That's great.
That's when it's physical sense.
It can be quite strong.
Great, I see Sarah and Hickam, I'm saying your name, right?
Sorry?
Isham.
Isham.
Hi.
But this is Sarah speaking.
Whoops.
You froze.
Uh-oh, losing every word you're saying, Sarah.
Uh-oh, I see other people move.
Yes, I see other.
Yes, thank you.
I see other people move.
But Sarah, you are frozen.
I think you dropped out completely.
You're probably not hearing anything I'm saying.
Okay, so I'll go to the reflection from Deborah in chat.
The practice offered a bomb.
I had to deal with a lost stolen phone today.
Ouch.
Kept remembering that in the grand scheme of things,
this was truly only an inconvenience, a big one nowadays.
Yes, of course.
Throughout the day, meta abounded.
My heart is warm, noticing all of it.
Oh, that is so beautiful.
Wow, I'm so touched with your share, Deborah,
that it is these days losing your phone.
It is quite an inconvenience.
Our lives depend on it so much.
And reminding that it is an inconvenience, a big one,
and throughout the day, meta-embounding and noticing.
Your heart is warm, noticing all of it.
So beautiful.
That's just beautiful.
Yay, I'm so inspired and touched.
Yeah, and what you shared actually prompts me to say that
often when challenging things happen,
when challenging things are inconvenient or difficult things
happen, they are an opportunity to open us,
to push us to be more kind and grateful and gentle,
to even open us more to meta and care and presence.
Otherwise, sometimes we go through our day mechanically
when everything is okay or the same.
So beautiful how this was an opportunity.
I hope you made it into an opportunity, Deborah, to practice
throughout the day with meta-embounding.
So beautiful.
So beautiful, dear Sangha.
So let's turn to practice together in small groups,
in small groups of roughly size of three.
And the invitation is to start with 15 seconds of silence, meta
for ourselves, for others.
This is so equanimity, caring for yourself, caring for others.
And you can share as little or as much as you like about your
practice, holding each other, holding witness,
and care for each other.
Confidentiality is very important.
Speak from your own experience, please,
not from other people's experience,
not commenting on each other, but really respecting,
holding, holding close, caring.
What does it mean verbally to care for each other?
So the rooms are created and I'm opening them now.
Okay, good care, enjoy.
Welcome back, everyone.
The rooms are closed and it's actually seven o'clock.
I think we don't have any time for any reflections anymore.
But if there's something you want to quickly type in chat,
I'll read them.
But otherwise, let's bring this practice session to a close
with appreciation for each other, for ourselves,
for the whole Sangha and extending care
to ourselves, to each other, and to the entire world.
May all beings be well.
May all beings, especially in war zones, be safe and free.
Thank you, everyone.
Be well.
