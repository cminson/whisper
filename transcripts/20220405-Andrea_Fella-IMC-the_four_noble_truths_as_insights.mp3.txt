The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

I wanted to continue a reflection on wisdom.
We could say that the purpose, the whole purpose of our practice,
the cultivation of the Eightfold Path, what we do, what we do as we practice,
is to cultivate the path to develop wisdom which will
allow our mind to understand how it has been a misunderstanding experience.
So the wisdom that is cultivated helps us to understand suffering, basically.
Helps us to understand why we're suffering and why we're struggling.
So the whole of the Eightfold Path is designed to cultivate, to develop,
to support the development of the wisdom that frees the mind.
It helps the mind to let go of the things that create that stress,
create that suffering.
Last week we talked about the kinds of insights into experience
being impermanent, unreliable, not self, as a way to understand that wisdom,
the kind of wisdom that's developed.
And these insights, these understandings are very freeing
when we can recognize experience as being impermanent, not lasting.
We understand that it's not a reliable place to try to hold on to that experience
as a source of lasting happiness.
And so the mind begins to let go of the craving, of the clinging.
Because it understands there isn't, it's an exercise in futility
to try to hold on to something that's impermanent and unreliable.
It also begins to understand, we also begin to understand that
a lot of this motivation to cling is rooted in a mistaken understanding
of me needing to hold on to something, of an identity,
identification with what's happening.
It's not only that we hold on to experience,
but we also hold on to a sense of who we are.
I am the one who does whatever we habitually do.
And paradoxically, we even hold on to these unhelpful habits and patterns.
We hold on to it, at times we hold on to anger or confusion or frustration
because it's familiar, because we have, it has been so conditioned in our experience.
It's happened a lot and we mistakenly attribute a kind of solidity
or a permanence to that as a sense of who I am.
And so these understandings help to free the mind from the clinging,
the craving, the holding on to things, thinking they are reliable,
they are permanent, and that I have some control.
Today I'd like to explore wisdom from another angle.
Another definition of wisdom in the Buddhist teachings is that we deepen
our understanding into the Four Noble Truths.
And there's a kind of different levels of insight that are connected with
understanding the Four Noble Truths.
So I want to explore it from this insight perspective around the Four Noble Truths,
not the more kind of didactical teaching on the Four Noble Truths.
That's a place where we begin, sometimes we begin our practice,
is to just understand the teachings.
And we'll do a little bit of that.
And one of the pieces I want to talk about with respect to wisdom
is these different levels of wisdom.
So before going into the insights in the Four Noble Truths,
I want to talk about how wisdom itself grows in our practice.
So there's one very brief teaching in the sutas about three different kinds of wisdom.
And these three different kinds of wisdom are,
and in the Pali they are Suta Mayapanya,
Chintamaya Panya, and Bhavanamaya Panya.
Suta Mayapanya is the wisdom that comes with hearing.
Suta literally means to hear.
So the wisdom that comes through hearing something or receiving information.
So this could come through reading or listening.
And in this case, the wisdom that's pointed to is,
the wisdom that is pointed to in the first factor of the Eight Full Path,
wise view.
So the wise view that helps us to understand yuka.
So this is really the definition in a way that one of the key definitions of the wisdom
that starts the path is the understanding of the Four Noble Truths
at this intellectual level to start.
That's how we have to begin something, a path of practice.
Without hearing something about it, we don't even know it exists.
And so we begin with some hearing.
So this Suta Mayapanya is really where we start.
The next level of wisdom is Chintamaya Panya,
which is, Panya is the word for wisdom.
I'm not sure quite what Maya means, but basically,
basically, possibly something like based on or as a result of or something like that.
Because the Chintamaya Panya,
Chintam means something like reflection we're thinking about.
So the next level of wisdom is Chintamaya Panya,
a wisdom that comes through reflecting about thinking about.
And so with the teachings on the Four Noble Truths,
some place where we begin, we hear it.
And we don't just simply hear it.
It's not just words that come in.
The way our whole system works is we hear the words and we start reflecting on them.
We think about them. Do they make sense to us?
How can I understand this?
How does it relate to my experience?
So this is the second way that wisdom begins to kind of infiltrate our system.
So we hear something and then we begin to reflect on it.
We think about it.
So the teaching around suffering, the Four Noble Truths,
the teachings around there is suffering.
Suffering is this kind of this dukkha, this,
I think one of the key understandings that begins to happen around suffering is that it's not just,
maybe we could say it's a distinction that suffering is different than unpleasant experience.
That suffering is a result of relating to experience with craving,
with greed, with aversion, delusion.
And that's not obvious.
So the teachings that we hear help us to kind of,
it's like that's where we start thinking about it, like for myself.
I often come back to this early, early understanding I had, this early kind of teaching I got.
I was interested in understanding my anger and I'd read a book that said,
well, you should try looking at your anger, being with your anger,
as opposed to acting on it, just be with, what does it feel like to have anger?
So that was a teaching that came in.
That was something I heard and I didn't understand it.
I mean, I heard it, but it didn't make any sense to me.
My initial response was, well, how is that going to help?
And so that, you know, that kind of, that reflection led to a kind of a doubt
or a kind of a sense of, I don't know how that's going to work,
but at the same time, so along with that wisdom that came in
or along with that teaching that came in, I was also talking to a friend,
or actually emailing with a friend.
And that friend said, this has been really useful to me.
It has helped, it has really helped me to try this.
And so this information that I didn't understand,
combined with the information that it helped my friend,
those kind of went into my system.
And it's like, okay, I'll give it a try.
I'll give it a try.
And so there was a willingness to engage.
And so this kind of reflection, this is the tint of my apanya,
taking in of the information and the reflecting on what makes sense.
And also I would say what was reflected on in that moment was
nothing else I've tried has worked in terms of, you know,
finding an ease or a piece that feels more lasting or stable.
You know, I've tried everything.
And, you know, this doesn't sound like it makes any sense,
but my friend says it works.
So yeah, why not give it a try?
Why not give it a try?
So that reflection process included many, many pieces.
It wasn't just the information that came in.
It was also, you know, my friend's perspective and also my own past experience.
I've tried a lot of things to navigate this struggle and stress in my life.
And very little has really helped.
And my friend says this has been helpful.
So yeah, I'm willing to give it a try.
So that all was the tip to my apanya.
And then the third level of wisdom, the Bhavana my apanya,
the wisdom that comes with development.
Bhavana means growth or development.
And so this is where we engage.
This is the wisdom that comes as we start to engage.
And this is a very iterative process.
The wisdom that comes with the engagement,
the stepping onto the Eightfold Path.
So to bring this back to the Eightfold Path again,
you know, right view starts the path.
And the next step of the Eightfold Path is wise intention.
So we hear something.
We hear something with the teachings.
We reflect on it.
And for me, the intention then arose, I'm going to give it a try.
So the intention to engage.
That's also important in terms of stepping onto the path.
With that intention, then we move into the aspect of wisdom
where it can be, we can start to develop the wisdom.
But through the engagement.
And the Buddha says this over and over again,
you know, the teachings point the way you have got to engage.
You can't just sit there and read and think about.
You've got to pick it up.
You've got to do the work.
So that's an important part of the path.
And the Eightfold Path essentially then lays out from wise intention,
then lays out the steps.
Then lays out the seal of the ethical conduct that supports the understanding
that dukkha, that suffering is kind of not just put on us by the world,
but is something that our minds actively participate in creating.
We begin to have a sense of not wanting to put it out into the world.
We understand that if I want to be free from my own internal suffering,
then the engagement in the world that the heart kind of understands,
yeah, it's not helpful to put that out into the world.
It's not helpful to put unskillful conduct, unethical conduct into the world.
And this also is some ways to begin the path of practice that are behavioral,
that are relational.
This aspect of the Eightfold Path really firmly grounds our practice
not only just in internal exploration, but in relational exploration.
How we are in the world, how we relate in the world.
And yet that cultivation, the cultivation, the development of wisdom
also needs not only the behavioral engagement with refraining from killing,
refraining from taking what's not given, refraining from harming through sexuality,
refraining from false speech, the engagement with ethical conduct.
It also needs the cultivation of the third aspect of the Eightfold Path,
the Samadhi aspect, the wise effort, wise mindfulness, and wise concentration
to begin to look at our own hearts and minds, the deepening of really understanding
how suffering is created.
The difference, really understanding the difference between suffering
and unpleasant experience, really understanding that our minds
are actively engaged in creating what we call suffering.
And that unpleasant experience, we can experience unpleasant experience without suffering.
That's counter-intuitive too, at first, when we first need it.
So these three levels of wisdom we engage in, it's kind of like almost in an iterative process.
It's like we hear some teachings, we reflect on them, and we engage a little bit.
And with that engagement, we often begin to experience something differently.
So that first thing that I, you know, first time I decided to really pick up this practice
and begin to look at the anger over the course of some weeks,
I began really experiencing the value of doing the path of practice, of doing it.
I began feeling much less whipped around by my anger, much less like at the mercy of my anger,
just hapless responding to anger, and much more able to navigate it.
So I began to understand the value of doing the practice,
which led to more wanting to understand how to practice and engage, thinking about that, more understanding arose.
And so there is a way that this practice deepens gradually over and over again.
The Eightfold Path too, it's like we continually cycle through it.
We continually, it's like we're walking the path.
I had this image, I think it was last night as I was thinking about this.
We're walking the path and we maybe have, you know, a little bit of these threads.
It's like each aspect of the Eightfold Path is a thread.
And we've picked up wise view and wise intention, and they're helping us to go a little further.
And we pick up the wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood, and wise effort, wise mindfulness, wise concentration.
We pick up all of those threads and we kind of weave them together.
And with that, there's the understanding that comes with weaving those threads together.
It's like then another thread of wise view comes along and we can weave that one in,
and another of wise intention and we weave that one in.
It's like we continually just keep weaving in deeper and deeper levels of understanding.
And I think that's needed because the ways in which our minds cling and crave,
we start to see kind of some of the obvious ways, you know, like for myself,
that anger was one of the most obvious ways that I suffered and what was going on there.
And as there was some understanding there, that began to weaken.
And there was much more ability to see other things that were going on
that also created stress and suffering in my life.
So we kind of begin with the most obvious levels and those begin to release.
And then we see some other levels of stress and suffering.
So the Four Noble Truths as a basic foundational understanding, kind of the basic wisdom
that the Buddha pointed to, there's a teaching that actually in the suttas,
the Four Noble Truths as statements of what are the Four Noble Truths.
There's some of that in the suttas, the kind of the didactic, you know,
here's what the Four Noble Truths are.
And yet the majority of the way the teaching on the Four Noble Truths is expressed
is as understanding, is as insight.
So it's over and over said, you know, one would understand this is suffering.
So that's a kind of an expression of insight.
This is suffering.
It doesn't really actually on the face of it sound much like an insight.
But it is that shift, that shift that I was talking about of recognizing
the suffering is not the unpleasantness of experience.
The suffering is the mind's relationship to experience.
The mind can be relating to pleasant experience in a way that creates unpleasantness.
Though the mind is holding on to pleasant experience, got some tension and fear and
contraction of, you know, so like we want to keep something and we're holding on to it
and there's fear there.
That's unpleasant.
The fear itself is unpleasant.
The fear that the unpleasantness of the fear is experienced as suffering,
unpleasantness, it's the fear itself.
So the mind begins to understand or be curious about how we relate to experience
and we begin to notice that.
So for yourself, you know, can you remember the times or some times that you notice
that difference, notice that, that, oh, it's the actual picking up and holding on to
that's creating the suffering.
For me around this anger in those first few weeks, you know, it was, it was kind of the
most obvious way it was experienced was kind of like, wow, I've got this idea that somehow
this being mad at this person, being angry at this person is going to make them miserable
and they're 7000 miles away, they don't even know I'm angry and I'm miserable.
The recognition of the difference between what I thought the anger was doing for me
versus what the actual experience was.
That's that understanding, that insight, oh, this is suffering.
The mind is doing this.
So the, the first and second noble truths in this in, in one of these teachings that it
points to not only just the simple insight of this is dukkha, but it expresses it at
three levels and each of the four noble truths has an insight at three different levels.
So that sounds complicated, but they basically have a similar pattern.
So the first noble truth, this is dukkha.
That's the first understanding, the first insight.
The second insight is this dukkha should be understood.
So we see, first of all, we see, oh, this is how it works.
This is what dukkha is.
It's, it's, it's the something, this thing that's going on in my mind.
And that kind of leads to the, the sense of, wow, it would be useful to understand this
thing that's going on in my mind.
So it should be understood.
And the third insight is basically the completion where it has been understood.
That, that experience of suffering having been understood that, that is often connected
with a sense of release of, of, of the recognition of, oh, that's, that's how suffering can end.
And so these three in the first noble truth, suffering, this is dukkha.
This is suffering.
Suffering should be understood and suffering has been understood.
That third one really points to the third noble truth of the freedom, the release from suffering.
So the second noble truth has similar three understandings.
So this is, this is the arising of suffering is the, the way it's framed.
Sometimes it's, this is the cause of suffering.
It's translated as this is the cause of suffering.
But the word itself is most frequently translated from the Pali as arising.
So this is, this is recognizing how does suffering come to be?
How does it happen?
And, and the understanding that happens there is that suffering happens when craving is arising.
So the, the, I think it's an interesting kind of distinction to make with the, the, sometimes
the translation is craving is the cause of suffering, craving causes suffering.
But that, that to me is, is kind of like a causes B means that A and B are different.
They're different things.
The framing of using the, the, the word arising there.
We could say that that second noble truth could be stated with the arising of craving is the arising of suffering.
So it's a, it's a slightly different flavor that craving and suffering are co arising.
They happen together.
And in fact, the experience when we really taste what craving is, it is suffering.
And so this second noble truth then kind of weaves us back into that first understanding.
The arising of craving is the arising of suffering.
This is suffering, this craving.
And so with that, with that understanding, this is the arising of craving with the craving, suffering arises with craving.
Then the second insight around the second noble truth is this craving should be let go off.
Because again, the recognition is that this is the mind doing the craving.
We really feel into as we practice through the engagement with the path we feel into how craving is, is strictly something happening in our minds.
Nobody can make us crave.
And this is good news.
You know, nobody else can make us crave.
No thing outside of us can make us crave.
It is the conditioned habits and patterns that arise in our minds that create craving to arise.
But those conditioned habits and patterns can be shifted.
And so that's this flavor of the second noble truth.
The craving should be released.
It can be released and it should be.
It should be let go off.
Craving should be released.
And then the third craving has been released, again, points to the freedom that comes when we actually experience what it is for craving to release.
The craving has been released is the experiential recognition of the release of craving.
So these first two noble truths, it is the path of practice.
This does not happen.
These understandings do not happen without engagement, without curiosity about what our experience actually is through mindfulness, through wise effort, through wise mindfulness, through a continuity of mindfulness, through wise concentration.
Wise effort, wise mindfulness, wise concentration work together to create that continuity of mindfulness to let us see and understand this is suffering.
To let us recognize that craving, when craving arises, suffering is arising and that craving when released releases suffering.
So that's what happens as we practice.
We see this for ourselves.
And this is a deepening of wisdom.
Each of these insights that this is suffering.
This is dukkha.
We could say that's kind of one level of the experiential understanding.
This is dukkha.
Dukkha should be understood kind of like the picking up of, yeah, this is useful.
This is valuable.
It takes seeing it.
It takes seeing and understanding in our own experience, like for myself, the experience with the seeing the anger as being suffering here and in my experience, as opposed to hurting the other person.
This hurts here. It would be useful to understand this.
So that's a deepening of that wisdom that then engages us more.
It actually helps us pick up more of the intention to keep us going.
So we begin to appreciate that understanding suffering helps us to see that craving arises, that suffering arises with craving and the further cultivation of that, the further exploration, we begin to notice or feel craving release at times.
And so that experience, craving, let's go.
Or we notice craving not arise.
We may actually notice that I would say that was my first real deep understanding in these, in these noble truths is the, the seeing of the anger, you know, kind of the mind getting familiar with the anger over a few months.
And then recognizing one day the kind of mind heading towards anger, seeing the mind kind of inclining to pick up anger.
And but seeing that seeing the mind heading in the direction of anger knowing that way lies suffering.
So that again, that connects with that first noble truth.
Seeing that way lies suffering and the mind let it go before it arose.
It let go of the intention, it let go of the direction before it arose.
And so I experienced in that moment the non arising of suffering.
So we can experience this understanding the third noble truth itself has these three levels of understanding.
This is the ending of suffering.
The ending of suffering should be realized the ending of suffering has been realized those three are the insights connected with the third noble truth.
This is the ending of suffering or this is the non arising of suffering it could be understood that way too.
At times it may be experienced when we feel a craving let go.
We experienced the mind let go of something it's like oh right this is just this happening and we feel a whole set of like the mind letting go and release from a way we've been tied up and caught up in something.
So we feel that release.
That's a taste of that.
This is the ending of suffering, just the beginning taste of that.
And that beginning taste helps us to want to engage more because we feel that's like our system when we feel that release.
Our whole system goes.
Yeah, that way is good.
That way is helpful.
That way lies much less suffering.
And so with that we we also then get much more committed to the path of practice, because we see that what we've been doing, how we've been engaging what we've been developing the eight fold path has contributed to seeing that moment of something different a little more freedom
and non arising of suffering or the letting go of suffering.
My own experience that that moment which I've described so many times I mean I really I really feel like it was no I see it in so many ways I see it from so many different angles that moment where the mind cutting through an apple saw the mind go to the the thought of a person I the person I was angry with and seeing that
the intention you know not being angry in that moment but seeing the intention to jump on that thought and think more thoughts in order to get angry at them.
But seeing that the mind just let it go.
That moment was like all all of those for noble truths the insights into those for noble truths in that moment.
That there was the understanding of that way lies suffering, the intention towards the anger that would create suffering that's the craving that would create suffering.
The understanding that the mind doesn't have to do that the non arising of that craving.
And the next thing that really happened was the mind or that the kind of the appreciation for Wow this is powerful.
This path is powerful I'm going to keep doing this.
So that that next the fourth noble truth.
The three insights are this is the path.
This is the way to the end of suffering.
And so that that recognition of Wow what I've been doing this is helpful this is a path.
This path should be cultivated.
That's the that's the action the path should be cultivated.
Paths should be cultivated and that was really what I landed with.
Not that the path has been cultivated although there's been some cultivation of the path but it was much more.
Yes, I'm going to keep doing this.
This works.
This is useful.
This is helpful.
So the the eight fold path is the fourth noble truth is the path leading to the ending of suffering but the the insights around it.
Those maybe are a little bit less appreciated but I think the the insights around that fourth noble truth.
We know mostly think about the fourth noble truth is being oh yeah I need to learn the eight fold path and do the eight fold path.
But the insights around it.
This is the path.
This is what's helpful.
This is valuable doing.
The eight fold path it's it's useful to have this perspective of wise view and wise understanding it's useful to engage in.
Sila it's useful to cultivate wise effort wise mindfulness and wise concentration.
This is the path.
There's a the this is the path part connects with this is the way that leads towards less suffering and more freedom.
We have an experiential understanding of that with that fourth.
The insight into the fourth noble truth.
This is the path.
This is the way.
That's what really keeps us on the path.
Understanding the value of what we're doing.
And so that's that second insight into the into the fourth noble truth this path should be developed this path should be cultivated.
It's going to help it's going to support the mind having more freedom.
And the you know the third insight in all three of these suffering has been understood craving has been released.
The ending of suffering has been realized and the path has been cultivated.
I feel like those really kind of happen all together.
You know there's the the when we see deeply understand suffering.
We have when we have understood suffering we already understand in that moment when suffering we understand suffering and it it has been understood.
It has been what has been understood is that craving causes suffering and that it needs to be released and it has been released.
And in that moment of the release of suffering is the understanding of this is what the ending of suffering is like.
And the understanding that the path to that cultivation has been developed.
The fourth noble truth this is suffering.
This is the arising of suffering with craving is the arising of suffering.
The possibility for the ending of craving leads to the ending of suffering and the path the eightfold path the actions associated with each of those suffering should be understood that with each of these noble truths there's an action.
And that action ends up connecting to the understanding or the insight.
So we take the action to understand suffering, which leads to the insight into this is duke.
This should be understood and has been understood.
The second noble truth.
The action is to let go of craving.
And that that happens through the cultivation of the path.
So craving should be released has been released.
The third noble truth the action is to realize actually realize inexperience the ending of suffering.
Just thinking about it doesn't cut it.
You've got to realize it.
It's not going to free the mind unless there's realization.
And then the fourth noble truth the eightfold path the path needs to be cultivated or developed.
