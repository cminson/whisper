 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good morning, good day, everyone. I was appreciating so much the chats that I was almost forgetting to start speaking. So thank you all for being here, and I appreciate very much that we have this wide international community that comes together to practice, to meditate, to engage in these teachings, and I feel very fortunate to be able to offer these teachings to such a receptive audience. So thank you. Thank you. So, there is a kind of current of teaching in Buddhism that one of the meanings of karma, when we do something that has karmic consequences, is that it leaves traces, and that when we are doing something without any karmic residue, there's no traces. That it's possible to do things that somehow leave no traces, leave no residue, therefore leaving us fresh, leaving us kind of new or able to meet the next moment without bringing with us the baggage and the influence of the past. So when we sit to meditate, we can start recognizing that there are traces left. So, for example, if the mind wanders off in thought, and then you bring your mind back, but you're not really successfully able to do that, the pull of the thinking is strong, that pull is the traces of momentum that was set in place, that somehow there was a force operating in the way we're thinking, the way we're maybe attached, that remains even once we've kind of let go of the thoughts, or we let go of them for a moment, but very quickly we're pulled back into that world. And that force that keeps pulling us into our preoccupations, our thoughts, the past, the future, our fantasies, the force of that is part of this residue that's left over from a momentum that's set in place of what we've been doing in the past, and what we've been thinking in the past, and what we've been feeding. So if we're feeding in the past, just living our daily life, we're unrestrained in our preoccupations, only thinking about what we want, or only thinking about how we've been wronged. Then there's sometimes, because of the involvement, the identification, the attachment, the resistance, the strength of that involvement with that preoccupation, it leaves a residue. And that residue has a function of like ready to reappear in some way or other, becomes a habit almost. So one of the functions of meditation is to try to be in the present moment the best we can, be with the breath, is to notice how much residue there is, the traces that are left over, where we're automatically pulled away or preoccupied and caught in things. Some of that residue we feel in the tension in our body. All tension is a residue of our, some way in which we've been preoccupied. And it's a marvelous thing to have, that the body relax enough that the residue, at least a surface residue, begins to dissipate. Certain emotions are left over. They're not just fresh and new, but there's residue that sometimes reappears, sometimes years later. The residue, the traces has been left behind, unresolved, and then there comes a residue. There's the traces again. There's no need to feel bad about it or feel bad about yourself that there are traces of karmic traces like this, but it is invaluable to see it, to know, oh, that's what's happening. And it can be a lot easier if we just see it that way. Oh, that's what's happening. These are traces. This is the residue. This is the residue still having momentum. It's maybe easier to disidentify with it, not be so tricked by it to think that it's so important to do. It might be easier just to recognize it in a simple way. Oh, residue, traces, and then begin again. And that clarity of residue traces might make it easier just then to come back into the present moment. So, assuming a meditation posture, and I put a lot of value on the posture we assume in meditation, an intentional posture, that establishes us here in a clear, definitive way, here in this place, in this time, partly because on one hand it's easier to then release the residue, and also because it's easier to see it if we have a posture that's karmically neutral, where the habits of attitudes, dispositions don't dictate the posture we have. And so this upright posture of the Buddha statue represents a posture free of karma, free of the momentum of the past, dispositions and attitudes. Taking a few long, deep inhale, releasing a long exhale. Breathing in, breathing out. Letting the breathing return to normal. And the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out in the body. Maybe it can be like waves washing up and down against shore. If there's been a disturbance on the beach, the waves just come and they go and they smooth out the sand, bringing it back to the way it's been maybe for a millennium, flat. Or we have a coarse piece of wood. And we gently repeat over and over again the sanding of it back and forth. And slowly something gets smoother. So that gentle staying with the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out, we might feel the karmic traces in our body and mind. But staying with the rhythm, like a waves washing across everything. Slowly letting the karmic traces and tensions be smoothed out. Without being tricked into thinking, reacting to anything. Staying with the rhythm of breathing. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. What residue or traces are found in you now? What residue or traces are found in you now? And instead of being involved in them or thinking about them, let breathing be the massage or the waves that softens the strength of the residue. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. Waves smoothing out the beach. And then coming to the end of this sitting, taking a few long deep breaths. Relaxing as you exhale. Maybe relaxing some of the residue of tension, traces. And considering for a few moments how there can be love or care or kindness without any residue, without leaving any traces behind in our hearts or minds. Simple, straightforward, clean love. And to gaze upon the world with such a care. Wishing well for everyone. Without any attachment, any fear, any hesitation. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you.
