 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. And it's lovely to see you again. Thank you for being here. In person, Jim for coming, and Jim's one of our mentors. So here we are, this is our second official class on the second path factor. Before I launch into that, I want to just let you know we have a guest teacher with us today, and she'll be here with us next month too. Leelu, would you like to introduce yourself? Okay, the volume's okay. So hi everyone, I'm Leelu Chen, and I've been mentoring for this program, and this is sort of my first time teaching in the big group session. And it's so nice to see the faces of all the people who are in it. I feel like it makes me love this program even more, just to see each and one of you, and that you all made the effort to come out here today to be in person. I think that's hopefully going to be of great benefit to you. I'm happy to be here with Tanya. Thank you very much for being here with me, Leelu. Yeah, grateful. So our first path factor was right view. And so what we talked about, and I'm sure you read more and went into more depth with right view, was anybody want to, we have a mic there, over there, just wondering if just like popcorn style, one or two words, what do you remember about wise view? Anybody want to share anything? No pressure if not, I can speak. Did I hear a voice? Somebody want to say? No? Yes, great, PJ. Cause and effect. Great. So karma, cause and effect, conditioning, those words are often used interchangeably. They kind of mean slightly different things, but you understand sort of something very complex that we're trying to describe. Thank you. What else? Great. Over here. Suffering. Yeah. And the lack of suffering or that hope that you can give up that suffering I think is for me just wonderful. Great. Have that hope. Great. And the teachings on suffering come from what? What teaching? The Four Noble Truths. The Four Noble Truths. That's right. So those are the two primary components of wise view. Right? And I don't know if I, this is one of the things that I say a lot and I don't know because I didn't get to the end of my talk last time, but so I'm not sure I said it, but it's orienting towards suffering, the presence or absence of it is really kind of a reference point for whether you're on the path or not. It's very, very simple and direct orientation toward wise view. Right? Is to recognize is there suffering or the absence of suffering? And of course, suffering is this huge continuum from extremely subtle, maybe even under the radar to we can't, you know, some, we can't feel like we live, can't live with it. It can be so intense. So this, this, this is a quote from Gil. The task of the first factor, so wise view of the Eightfold Path is to provide the perspective for finding the path by bringing our attention to suffering, its cause and the possibility of ending it. Right? So just to emphasize how important our relationship, our relationship to suffering is and our, our staying connected to the presence and absence of it. I like to think about the Buddha as a map maker, retard cartographer. And so he created this map of the practice, the path, and there's a map for staying on that path. And that's the Eightfold Path. And he is with this map, which points to direct experience, he's showing us the route to freedom. We have to walk it. We have to be actively engaged in the practice. So when we have wise view, when we are oriented toward the presence or absence of suffering, when we understand conditioning, karma, cause and effect, and its role in suffering, samsara, right, right intention will naturally follow. Right intention is both the big choice to use the map and also in a subtle way, and I'll bring this more to the forefront as I talk, the many smaller choices we make along the way at every intersection. Because for me, walking the path is like step, step and oh, oh, which way? Okay, this way, this way, oh, this way, it can be a very common need to reorient, reorient. Each step, even the middle of a step can start to turn us away from freedom and towards suffering. So, if we think about bigger view intention, I'll ask you right now, what's motivating you to be here in your chair right now? Why are you here? What's the biggest reason for you to be here? Okay, are you sure? Let's find the mic, so yeah. The mic, find the mic, yeah. Oh, I think you can ignore it. No, no, no, I do, I do, Bernadette, thank you. The intentions have been wonderful for me, I read a little bit before coming here, and it really is the small suffering. You talked about that little bit of suffering, and then there's this huge amount of suffering, but it's this constant small suffering, you know, the anger, the petty anger. I could go on and on and on, and becoming aware of it is one thing. The other thing, which is so hard for me, is acting on that awareness in a wholesome way. Great, great. Thank you for sharing that. Okay, so this is kind of the just orienting us right now, just orienting, and we're going to move into a meditation now, and then we'll come back to right view, I mean, right intention, okay? So just trying to help ourselves arrive in this chair with this understanding of the practice, and how to engage with wise view, and then like, here's your cheat sheet, wise intention has to do with non-harming, loving kindness, and letting go or renunciation, so that's your cheat sheet, we'll talk more about that. But so as you practice here, you know, just as even in this moment, as you turn towards sitting, you find your body, you set up your posture, because we know that practice is important. With wise view, we understand that by practicing, by orienting ourselves toward the formidable truths and toward conditioning, we're trying to free ourselves from suffering, right? So how do we help ourselves do this? Okay, we assume this posture, and the only way to find this is in the present moment, an embodied present moment. So feel your feet, feel your buttocks, your back, your hands, invite the spine to be upright, to let the energy flow. And I invite a few longer, slower, deeper breaths, maybe taking a moment to raise the shoulders towards your ears, and roll them back to open your chest, or counterbalancing the driving, the phoning, the computing that covers corners and clouds, our chest from breathing, right? And just notice what happens when you've done just this much. How much more are you able to feel connected to the life in your body in this moment? Living it, listening to it, providing a kind regard for your experience. Maybe noticing is there a kind regard for my experience? This is important to establish in a practice a sense of that kind of caring attention, not over controlling, over doting, and not absent minded, something in the middle. A caring, a sense of care about the experience you're having, a sense of caring about the quality of the mind, awareness, about the comfort or alertness in the body, the amount of relaxation coupled with alertness, being able to breathe easily, or as easily as possible for you in this moment. So as one of the three right views, or right intentions, I'm sorry I did that again, is loving kindness. I'll offer guidance in loving kindness meditation. I'll start by saying that when we do this practice, we're not trying to make ourselves experience anything in particular. We don't need to control what we feel. In fact, we want to make sure we're practicing relating to ourselves with loving kindness as we're practicing loving kindness. In the way that we're saying the phrases, how are we relating to ourselves? So there are four different wishes that we offer, and I'll just name them before I start the phrases as a guided practice just to help you start to orient, to look in the direction, to invite the mind to connect with stories, memories, feelings related to one, safeness. What does it feel like to have a sense of safeness? What happens in your body? And I'll just say very explicitly, notice I'm using the word safeness, not safety. And that's because for me, and for I don't know many, safety feels too permanent. Not possible, but safeness is possible moment to moment. While we can't always feel safe in this world, we can have times of safeness. The second quality is happiness. This is a happiness that's not dependent on the world. It's not dependent on getting something. It's the kind of happiness that bubbles up from within when there's a sense of well-being, of absence of wanting more, an absence of not wanting. It might feel like subtle quiet happiness or joy, very subtle sometimes. Something might be associated with an experience of sitting in nature, next to a bubbling brook, or looking out over the horizon, or maybe seeing a little animal or bird. These are moments I associate with the kind of happiness that's connected to loving-kindness. The third quality is well-being, wellness, healthy, strength, vitality, aliveness. And this is in reference to whatever amount of this is available to us at any one moment. Meaning can we have well-being with whatever is happening with us with regard to our physical health situation? So just taking a moment to reflect on the experience of well-being. Well enough, I've been quite ill at times with high fevers and pneumonia and really had a great sense of well-being, abiding, not at odds with what was happening in the body. And of course it's always better if I feel well. But it is possible to have well-being regardless. The fourth quality is ease, a sense of ease. And this too I often associate with being in nature. This might be that feeling of swimming in warm water, resting under the sun, laying in bed on a lazy Sunday morning. Just a sense of contentment and okayness. A sense of being able to be with and at ease in the moment. So these are the four qualities related to loving kindness. And I'll walk you through the phrases just a couple of times. Typically we do them and we orient them in all the different directions. Can be toward self, toward others, toward all women, all men. Then it could be all people in my city, expanding out to the world. There's all kinds of ways to expand. Ultimately the wish is for all beings everywhere, including those seen and unseen. For today's purposes I'll start with for ourselves and we'll do a second round for all beings everywhere. There's instructions, more instructions to be found and explored. So we are orienting wishes. We're not trying to create a feeling. And when feelings that are opposite come up, meet them with loving kindness. Because sometimes this practice pulls out the opposite because it pulls out the clots in the heart, the stuck places. So say the phrase and you repeat it silently in your mind. I invite you to find a voice of a kind being. Maybe think about somebody when they say your name who you feel awe. Maybe try and find their voice when you offer these phrases. May I be safe and protected from inner and outer harm. May I be safe and protected from both inner and outer harm. May I be truly happy and deeply peaceful. May I be truly happy and deeply peaceful. May I be healthy and strong. May I care for myself well. May I be at ease. May I be at ease. Now we'll do the phrases for all beings, keeping in mind that this idea that pretty much every being I can't imagine otherwise would wish these things for themselves regardless of anything else. Wishing ourselves what is a very natural thing to wish and wishing others the same thing. May all beings everywhere without exception experience safeness. May all beings be safe and protected. May all beings be happy. May all beings be healthy. May all beings be at ease. So, a brief introduction to loving kindness if you haven't done the practice before. By tuning in on weekdays 6pm to happy hour on zoom. Alright, so intentions. Now I have no idea, I don't think I'm going to be able to get through everything I want to say. I'm already running really behind. So I'm going to try and do my best at balancing out sort of kind of giving you little snippets, suggesting that you're going to fill it out when you do your readings and listening to the talks and stuff this month. So intentions are alternately thought of as thoughts, purpose, plan, right? And behind every action, every thought, there is an intention. And sometimes we're aware of the thoughts behind our thoughts, purposes, and plans and sometimes we're not. The beliefs or the structure behind. But this is why wise view, sort of trying to help ourselves reorient, reorient, reestablish wise view is so helpful because if we're coming from that place, the intentions will follow. The Buddha says, intention I tell you is an action. Through intention one acts by way of body, speech, and mind. Thinking is connected to intention. It is the beginning of action and the Buddha says it is action. So this is important to understand. It's very connected. So you can see how it's like, wow, that movement between wise view and intention is like, it's a thought, right? Wise view, widest intention. So the Buddha signaled out three attitudes, three ways of thinking that cause suffering and take us away from the path. Those three ways are kind of be thought about as wrong intentions, but I also like the word forces or energies. Lust with greed. Two ill will. Three hatred. The three wise intentions, motivations, non-harming, renunciation, letting go, and loving kindness. So the three wise intentions. So I won't have time to go into this, but I decided I really wanted to mention this that if you ever wonder if these intentions have anything to do with social activism or making an impact in the world, they do. And Ruth King wrote in Tricycle an article, and so I'll just read a paragraph. And I'm just saying this, I'm just referencing this because I want to contextualize that you can apply these teachings to everything. How do we work with our thoughts, this is Ruth King speaking. How do we work with our thoughts and our beliefs in ways that nurture the dignity of all life? How do we ensure justice without fostering generations of harm and hate internally and externally? How do we comfort our own raging heart in a sea of racial ignorance, ill will, and violence? And how can our actions reflect the world we want to live in and leave to future generations? She says, I'd like to offer six practices that support racial awareness and well-being. And the first practice she names is doing no harm. This is one of the three wise intentions. She says, it has to do with conduct and it has to do with us setting an intention. It's not just words that we speak as if it were a New Year's resolution. It's actually a life practice that supports us and regularly aligning our heart and mind with our actions. So it's important to set an intention and reflect on it often. This intention is about doing no harm in speech, action, and thought. So intention can be thoughts of greed for sensual desire or letting go and renunciation. If you connect the two wrong and rights, greed for sensual desire or letting go and renunciation. Thoughts of ill will, such as hating and not wanting, with good will and the wish for well-being, joy or happiness. Thoughts of cruelty, such as wanting to harm or shame someone or thoughts of compassion, just caring about another situation and feeling empathy and a sense of wanting to relieve that suffering. One of the things that we tend to do, people can tend to do, I'm sorry, let me turn off my, I wanted to ignore it, but it's annoying. So let me just turn off my notifications. One of the things that sometimes we can hide behind is saying, but I had a good intention. This is not what the Buddha taught. We don't hide behind the idea that we have a good intention. We need to notice the impact of our intention, not just what we were trying to do, but the results of those efforts. Intention and impact need to come together. We have to, in the teaching for the Buddha, reflect before, this is to his son, Rahula, but before reflect during and reflect after everything. Always reflect before, during, after. It is not always easy to see the thoughts, purposes and plans or resolves that are directing the mind. So let me see. Okay. I'm almost, well, I am at time, but I'm going to just squeeze in a couple more things. So I want to bring in a concept that Gregory Kramer teaches about. I think it's extremely helpful. I see a lot of tangling up around, I'm setting intentions. Well, why am I still doing this? Or I was trying to do something good and I ended up hurting people. I don't understand what happened. So Gregory Kramer in his book called A Whole Life Path talks about three kind of time boxed intentions, ways to look at attention. One is like the overarching, like this, the intention why you're here today, like this wanting to not harm others, right? Wanting to free ourselves and others, wanting to be a good human being. These overarching intentions. And then there are episodic intentions, meaning like short term projects, you know, getting from here to do that, doing this, you know, it's time limited, time boxed. And then there are momentary minute by minute impulsive intentions that happen. So there are three ways to think about how intentions might go wrong or go right. Does that make sense? Great. So I'll give you an example of how I have seen this in my own life, right? So I have an intention, a great wish to not cause harm, right? And to relieve, to help suffering end in myself and others. That's a huge, and to live with an open heart, like a kind heart. These are my huge overarching intentions. Okay. So then I have an episodic event happening. I'm coming to IMC for a class with Gil and Andrea and I'm running late. And so I'm getting ready to go and, you know, I'm taking this class. It fits in with my overarching, right? Goals. But in this moment then, as I'm getting in the car to go, I realize I'm running late. And I think to myself, I don't want to be just disrespectful. So I better hurry because it would be disrespectful if I show up late, right? Well, here's the problem. My eye got pretty attached to not being that person. My me. I don't want to be that person that shows up late. I don't want to look that way. So I have a desire, strong desire to be seen in a good way and to be respectful. And then I don't want to become the person. I have a version around becoming the person that's going to be walking in late and being embarrassed and being looking like I'm not respecting my teachers. Don't want it. Right? So I get very attached. Mind you, I have been actually having a very active practice at this time of driving in this way to offer generosity. Please Phil, come on in. Come on in. Yeah. Just take your shoes off out there. Yeah. I've been trying to stop extra early before stop walks with people in them, give cars, lots of room. I've like actually really been trying to offer like loving kindness in this way in the world. So I've been practicing this, but here I am. I'm this person driving this car running late and I don't want to be that person. And so by the time I get here, I'm like, what the heck happened? I've been, you know, lead footing it. I haven't been pausing. I've been trying to get jump at my, any chance to get through the stop signs because as I got in that car in that moment, I set the intention to get here as fast as I could. And I left out everything else. And that attachment to being that person was strong enough that it was gripping the clinging to that kept fueling my effort to be here fast enough. And I lost my greater connection to my bigger intention. So that's an example of overarching episodic and momentary intentions and how they can bump into each other and have us go sideways. All right. So I have a lot more I could say, but I'm not going to, we're going to move into breakout groups. I think that was good enough, but let me just see anything that doesn't feel clear at this point about what I was sharing about what the wise intentions, wrong intentions, and these three timeframes in particular. Yes. Hold on. Got the mic. Thank you, Bernadette. Thank you, Tanya, for sharing that story about leg footing in the car. I think many of us can identify with it. So I find myself not being the leg fitting, but basically in San Jose, I have an option to either stay like 40 minutes in traffic or to find pathways within the traffic, which is flowing faster and to get into it and keep moving on. What point is it actually wrong intention versus trying to actually just spend less time in traffic? Do you sense any, I mean, is it a bad thing to be trying to go faster? I mean, at least as fast as we can while being safe and be careful versus just take the opportunity to sit in traffic and slowly go as it moves. Yeah. Great question, PJ. So I would say a couple of things. One is, I think it's okay to not to want to get where you want to go, but you want to couple it with safeness, right? And you want to couple it with this idea of non-harming. In my moment of getting in that car, the priority was given to being here faster. So my mind really latched onto that without my even being fully aware of what I was doing because I was setting an episodic or a momentary intention that carried me through a smaller episode than the class, but the driving episode. So watching out for the I investment, me, I need to get home, you know, these kinds of things can fuel our attachment and then it prioritizes that particular goal over creating a safe space. So is that a good enough answer? So basically what you're saying is, watch out where it's changing more to some kind of an obsession or a desire to do things in an unsafe way as well and getting attached to getting here fast. Yeah. Yeah. Which is very easy to happen. So it requires a lot of close attention to the mind. All right. So let's break up into, let's make small groups of, how many do I have? Three to four people. So if you can just kind of maybe turn to people sort of close to you and make small little triangles together or a box here and there. Three corners, four corners. And then once you're settled, just be quiet and I'll give you your next set of instructions. There's actually, it looks like, yeah, so we've got four. It might be better to do, if we have all, if we can have all threes, that's better, if not, no problem. So if possible, it just saves, it makes everybody at the same timing. Sorry, I should have been more clear. It may not be possible. Although Jim, would you be willing to jump in if needed? Okay. Oh, awesome. It happens. It happens. Yay. All right. Go ahead and say your names, please, and where you live quickly. Wow. I'm moving, meet people. And I'm pushing you to go fast. So all right. So I'm just going to remind you, you don't have to pay. You don't have to remember all of these things. It looks like, oh, I love it. I see somebody in the middle of their circle. They have their speaking and listening guidelines on the floor. Yeah, it's beautiful. So we've handed these out. You should all have a copy. If anybody needs a copy, we have some of the, Bernadette will grab them. So if any group wants a copy, just to reference, yes, I see a head yes. But just to remind ourselves, okay, this is helping us set wise view, right? So wise intentions follow. So right over in that group there, they wanted one. So first I'll just kind of quickly move through these things. Number one is what's said here stays here. So this idea of confidentiality. You know, and this includes not bringing up outside of this little triangle with the other person things that you brought up with them now, right? So just keep letting it stay here, this confidentiality. Reactions or responses should be by invitation. So don't voluntarily give people suggestions or feedback or advice and try and avoid advice. We're going to try and speak with kindness, you know, paying thoughtful attention, being particularly respectful of identities. You know, what each person's identity is, not making assumptions, not maybe pointing things out to make somebody feel, I don't know, othered. The nice word to put maybe. And when and if something comes up that has to do with a lot of detail or difficulty or, you know, really upsetting trauma stuff, use like really simple statements, like headline statements. Please don't share. We don't want to get lost in the story, right? We don't have time or the space to get real lost in the story. And another thing is that it's also helpful for ourselves not to be really careful about not sharing what we're not comfortable sharing, right? Stick with what we feel comfortable. All right. Mindfulness while speaking. When talking, know you're talking. Kind of simple. When listening, know you're listening. You can track your mind, track your body, notice tension. Just kind of periodically tune in a little more deeply to how you're feeling, how you're being impacted by both your own reflections as well as those of others. And there's some more things, but this is just, you know, just the key of it is to try and stay connected. Don't let all of your awareness go out into others. Keep some home. Keep some home. So you track and track in yourself. Right. And when you're speaking, don't get lost in your thinking. Be connected to others. All right. So we'll one at a time. You'll have like, I'll ring the bell between people about two and a half minutes or so. So one person at a time will share the invitation is to reflect on a near term. So something in the next week or two, a situation that, you know, coming up and think about either a momentary or episodic goal and that, you know, intention that might be helpful for you. That's one of the three wise intentions. So maybe, for example, you know, you're going to be going into a difficult family dinner and you know, in the family dinner, it's very easy to have impulsive reactions that are critical. So you want to really talk about and think about how do I bring loving kindness or letting go right into that encounter? Or you might be more like an episodic. So you know, you're going to go to a class and you just you want to practice or a party. Let's just say it's a friend's party and you just you're really like self-conscious. If you if you have social anxiety at all, this has been a good one for me of going in and practicing, like taking care of other people. Just how can I help? So this act and an idea of loving kindness, how can I be of service in the social gathering? So I'm not sitting around selfing and feeling awkward. Right? So that's another example of like an episodic. So momentary or episodic situation in the next week or so where you could practice either renunciation. So letting go of greed and desire lust, right? Where you can practice loving kindness. So that's the, you know, safeness, happiness, well being, ease for others. And then I have to look. That's the third one. Good will, non-harming. Right? Okay. So the person that is wearing glasses will start. And if there are two people with glasses on, it would be the person whose glasses are the lightest in color. So if you could start, so just I'll let you like, I'll take another deep breath in, orient, just reflect on the question, kind of pick your situation that you want to focus on, pick whether you want to work on renunciation or restraint, this idea of letting go, this idea of non-harming or goodwill, or this idea of loving kindness, good hearted friendliness. So which of those intentions and in which situation? So just take a minute. Take some breaths into it with this caring regard. Maybe note what is important and maybe what you want to come back to later, if anything. And then take a deep breath in when you're ready and with the exhale, try and empty yourself out. Getting ready for the next share. We're aiming to take a break in about seven minutes, if we can get there. So is there something anyone is willing to share that you think could be of benefit to others and or you know is really beneficial to you so you want to say it out loud because it will help reinforce it? So just raise your hand and Bernadette will bring you a mic. I have a question, so I was sharing in my group about a situation where I felt like someone caused me harm and so I let them know in a compassionate way, compassionate to me and compassionate to them or this other person. And I got a reply and it was one of those non-apologies, I'm sorry if I caused you discomfort or whatever. And also I felt like the response was dismissive, not really taking responsibility and accountability for the action that came at me. And so to express loving kindness to myself, to take care of myself and create safeness for me, I wrote back, it was through email and pointed out, I didn't let her be dismissive, I came back and said no, this is what happened, this is what a ten-year-old could see would know the difference. So the person might think that I was causing her harm with my response, but I was expressing loving kindness to myself and taking care of myself and maybe in another time I might have just let it go, like it's not worth it, I'm not going to pursue this. But I felt like I really had to take a stand, it was important and it was important for me to point out what I saw and whether she accepts it or not, it doesn't matter at this point, I'd rather she didn't reply again, but I had to come back to her. So it's this gray line, it's fuzzy, right? So I don't know what would you tell me? Yeah, yeah, Lelil, I invite you to put your mic on, do you want to respond to this one? You don't have to, I just want to include you and invite you and turn your mic on if you do. You sure? Okay, well you can add. So yeah, I'll just validate how challenging that situation sounds, first of all, and how important it is to express courageous compassion. Sometimes compassion isn't just nice, nice. Compassion can be a fierce compassion coming forward and saying something that we believe and feel and know to be, I don't know for the greater good or something, for ourselves or beyond. And there's different containers to hold this in, right? Different ways to think about this, it sounds like you were really clear that for you this was really important and really a boundary, it sounds like to me a boundary that you were establishing. So I would say in that situation it's just important maybe to just name this as a boundary. In your relationship with me, this is a boundary. And so there's, you know, obviously we want people to understand us or issues or situation and they don't always. So I find it very helpful to remember that there's a saying in AA, there's a serenity prayer, you may have heard it. I like this version of it, it's an alternate version. Grant me the ability to accept the people I cannot change, the courage to change the one I can, and the wisdom to know it's me. I can change me. So like just noticing in yourself and myself in that kind of a situation, there's a renunciation that has to happen for me, letting go of the outcome of what the other person does and doesn't do. And then, you know, there's the Buddha talks over and over again. Whenever he talks about non-harming and this kind of stuff, it's always for myself, for others, and for both. For myself, for others, and for both. So we don't want to bring harm to ourselves, to others, or both. Now that doesn't mean we don't set boundaries in relationships because letting people hurt us is actually hurting them too, right? So it's not to say we aren't fierce and we don't set boundaries. We just have to hold that bigger picture, right? That by allowing people to hurt us, they're hurting themselves. It's not good. It's not good for anyone to hurt somebody else. And we're the only ones that can set the boundaries for ourselves, right? So just take a breath, Cindy, right, Cindy? And just feel in and see how satisfied you are with that answer. And maybe if there's something more you would like to hear, maybe you could say that and maybe Lulu might have something more to offer. I don't know. Good answer. If Lulu has something to add, I'd love to hear. It is worth, go ahead and repeat her answer, maybe Bernadette, or give it to Cindy to say. It's good for the people online. Yeah, it's a good answer. I'm satisfied with the answer. But if Lulu has something to add, I'd love to hear it. Great. Yeah. Oh, I'm just feeling into the tenderness of what you shared and the courage to say something this time. I think that when I've been in situations like that, it's like being aware that I have this pattern of not speaking up. And then when I actually start doing it, it's very scary. And we don't know how people will respond. And usually we might not be that satisfied with how it goes, but that's the step. Tanya was talking about stepping. And then step, and then we come back. So I just want to commend you for taking that step. This relational realm, this is advanced practice. And the other thing I'll say is email in particular is really tricky because it's really hard to find tone of voice. What are they really saying? So to the extent that you're able to say, hey, can we talk on the phone about this? Or if you are able to see this person, if it feels right for you to bring it up again. But it really comes back to you, like in your heart. And whether the discernment, trusting the intention and then discerning whether this time with this person is beneficial to me to pursue this right now. So just richness and then encouraging you to turn to others who you can share this with. Maybe a friend or a trusted confidant. This is really substantial when we feel like just that effect of others on ourselves. And wanting to kind of, I'm sensing from you wanting to preserve, there's a protectiveness wanting to stand upright. So that's what I have to add. So are you okay with a five minute break? If so, there's time maybe for one more question or comment, Vijay. Or is anybody not, let me just see if there's anybody else, Vijay, just for spreading the wealth. But don't forget what you want to say. Was there another hand? Yes, great. Thank you. Can you bring her? Thank you. There we go. Can you read your name? P. P. My name is Pinyak. Thank you. I thank you for sharing the Naham meaning. For me, I never thought about Naham includes Naham to other people. That's most time I understand. At the same time, you put Naham to ourselves. That's very, very important. Thank you for sharing that. For me, I have another related question. So for specific event or activity or interactions, then probably I will. Most of the time, I would do things as normal, do as a kind person and do with good intentions. But now my question is, if one thing I do that with good intention, but long term is not good, how we balance the good intention for one specific thing or for long term? I think you're saying, so how do you balance out maybe there's one good intention, but then there's another part of it that isn't? It's not good for long term. It's not good for long term. Do you have a specific example that you could share? Even my kindness is abused. Your kindness is abused. Okay. I'll let you answer first if you want, since I answered first last time. Yeah, I think there's a call to be balanced with wisdom. So knowing how much you can offer, so you can see for yourself how beautiful this, that you have this arising of an intention for kindness and to offer. But then there needs to be usually this factor of wisdom and discerning, well, do I actually have this in me to offer? And if I offer this, what is the impact on me and those around me? And perhaps you don't have it in you that particular day, or I get requests all the time to say teach or volunteer, and I always want to do it, but I often have to assess, do I really, do I have the time to do this? Because sometimes there can be an overlay of greed to say yes to everything. Oh yeah, I want that and that. So there can be, I think what we're getting to is this discernment. Is this truly, given my life right now, is this truly beneficial to me? I may want to. I may have the intention to be kind, but is that impact piece that Tanya talked about, what might be the impact? And we'll get better with experience because we'll say yes, and then we'll do it and we'll find ourselves completely frazzled. And then we'll think maybe next time, or you'll say yes and you realize you can, and that was worth it and it was really nourishing for you. Does that kind of address? Thank you. Beautiful. Yeah. Oh, did you want to add? Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. Get the mic. Get the mic. Just, I wanted to add, I have studied under check on check cornfield on Taraprak. I'm a meditation teacher. I stay neutral. I just wanted to add the great practices, especially Tara. Tara Brock offers the rain practices, working with difficult emotions. There's the open a bono, you know, either forgiveness practice for yourself or your friend. There is meta. I mean, you're speaking on the, on that today. There is meta also for a difficult person where you want to see the goodness in this person and you can picture her or him and as a child and happy and to see when the other person's leg is trapped. Tara says that always so beautifully. So there, Tara Brock has great resources. Maybe that is also good to help and add. Great. And I would just add again, you know, I've mentioned the teaching to Ruhula from the Buddha before you do something reflect. So before you offer loving kindness, reflect, how would this be for me? How will this be for them while you're reflect, while you're offering the loving kindness? How is this for me? Really? How is it for them? Really? If it starts to feel like it's causing harm to yourself or others, you stop. If it feels like it's not, it's okay. You continue and at the end you reflect again. How did this end up? Oh, I guess I really actually went a little further than I thought. I started to hurt myself in some way. Okay. So let me learn that from that or no, it went great. I'll do it again. Okay. So reflect before, reflect during, allow yourself to change your mind. It's not just about making something happen. It's about paying attention to the impact. Okay. All right. So why don't you take a five minute break and we'll see you back here at 2.30. Starting off with a few breaths as we settle our bodies and our minds to receive some more teachings. And please be welcome to stand during the talk if you need to or stretch. I know we all have bodies that we want to care for as well. So I get to talk a little now about loving kindness and compassion as wise intentions to cultivate and set for ourselves. And these two are particularly dear to my heart. I've been practicing metta and compassion in ways known and unknown to myself. And I think they offer great benefits, so happy to share about this today. So metta, loving kindness. I find this a really powerful practice first and foremost, because if you ever notice yourself angry or afraid, this is usually my go to. I try to see if metta might be available here. This is a place where I can practice metta. This can be anger towards yourself, fear for your own safety, anger towards another person, fear for their safety and well-being. So this is a place where metta can come in and be just such a great resource. So the word metta actually comes from the same root as friend, the word for friend. So it is a fundamental friendliness. And I see it as this open, relaxed state that it's often said that we naturally have metta when we are not scared, when we're not angry, when we're not stressed in some way. If we ourselves have well-being, that is the state that arises naturally in our relationship towards ourselves and others. So this is from Sharon Salzberg. She says, metta is the ability to embrace all parts of ourselves as well as all parts of the world. So it's both inwards and outwards. And in some ways it's aspirational. It's kind of this horizon because as we know in our practice, there are parts of ourselves that are harder to embrace. There are parts of the world that are more difficult to embrace. So it's the cultivation, it's almost this expansion of metta and coming back and replenishing it and expanding it again. The thing that is important to kind of keep in mind about true metta, friendliness, loving kindness is that it is undifferentiated. It's not like I have more metta towards you. And like the true metta, it's just all living beings, that little grasshopper up to that human being, to that tree. You can have this fundamental interrelationship with all that we encounter. And I think it actually comes from deep wisdom because when we are practicing metta, the kind of artificial boundary between me and my that Tanya talked about that gets activated sometimes, it can sort of abate. And we can see that it's almost like you're there and you're standing by the ocean and it's this big wondrous openness or standing in a big field. There's this relaxed beauty in states of metta. So it is a state that we cultivate and is an attention that we cultivate. And I always like to highlight what's beautiful about practicing metta is once you get to know what it's like when you are practicing metta, you'll know what it's like when metta is not there. Oh, I really do not have any metta whatsoever in this situation because we are more familiar with ourselves as we go. So I'll tell a little story when my older child was first born. She was a newborn. I remember having heard about metta and I was home with her for the first several months. And I started to realize that, oh, this is metta. Just how I'm relating to this newborn. There's just such a wish for her well-being, for her safety, for her to thrive in this world. It's a very tender, loving feeling. And then when I started going out into the world with my baby, I started practicing metta to everyone I met. And I would imagine my big, burly neighbor as a newborn. I would imagine that. And it was like, oh, wow. Something could soften because each person I met had been a newborn at one point and is fundamentally very vulnerable in that way and wants to be loved. And so there is a way that metta could kind of shift our perspective on the world. It is tapping into this fundamental nature of all beings that they want to be safe and happy and to thrive. And when you feel that for yourself and those near you, you can see that it's true for everyone. So when we are abiding in metta, we're not abiding in ill will or hostility or fear. One of the wonderful fruits of metta practice is it can naturally lead to concentration. When the mind and the body feel safe and feel like there is this well-wishing, things can kind of collect. But if there isn't a feeling of safeness, there isn't a feeling of goodwill, the mind and the body is just contracted, it's scattered. So metta actually can be quite potent in the meditation practice as well. It's not just a relational practice. It's a state that we can cultivate for our own meditation. I'd like to distinguish the near enemy of metta. So what metta is not, and we kind of have to be careful if metta starts going this direction, is it is not attached. So I have metta for this person, but I'm not attached to them. So I may wish them that they may be healthy and safe. But fundamentally, I know I don't really have absolute control over whether they are happy or safe. And so metta, when it gets over-involved and becomes something else, becomes worry. It can become entangled. So that's when you know this is not really metta anymore. So one final thing I'd like to say about metta is that sometimes it can be helpful to think about it as less doing. It's more about letting go and shedding and relinquishing and then finding that metta that is under, kind of just present in kind of a naturally existing state. And for me, some of the metta phrases that I really like are from this teacher called Deepa Ma. And she's a small Indian woman, and she's since passed. But she came to the states and she taught metta to some of her students. And the phrases that she used, I like, and I use them sometimes because I think there's kind of a less of a doing and more of a letting. So I'll share them with you all today. So she says, let me be free of enemies. Let me be free of dangers. Let me be free of mental anxieties. Let me pass my time with good body and happy mind. More of them, let me be free of enemies. So enemies both internally and externally. Seeing something within myself as an enemy, someone else as an enemy. Let me be free of dangers, that fundamental wish to be, to have safeness, to be abiding in safeness and for others to. Let me be free of mental anxieties, the things that agitate my mind. And let me pass my time with good body and happy mind. So simple, but for me it kind of reverberates with a wish and it's a let me. Sometimes it can be less of a doing and I like that. So I'll speak now a little bit about compassion. Karuna is the Pali word. So sometimes people have a complicated relationship with compassion. So check in with yourself. What is this term evoke for you when you hear the word compassion? Just acknowledge for yourself. What is that like? It's a term that gets used a lot. We hear it a lot today. And what I'll focus on here is just kind of how it's, how it shows up in kind of the Buddhist teachings and the meditation path. So Karuna is defined as the desire to alleviate harm and transform suffering. So it is a meeting of suffering with the ability to hold it. And Karuna requires courage. It requires courage to feel our pain. It requires courage to feel the pain of others. And to do that in a way that's not sucking us in and creating further distress for ourselves. And the definition I like the most is Karuna as the tenderness of the heart in the face of suffering or the quivering of the heart in the face of suffering. In the teachings is one of the four divine abidings. So thinking about compassion as a divine abiding. You know, all of the divine abidings are described as being abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will. So does that come to mind when you think about compassion? Abundant and exalted. So in my own experience, compassion feels energizing. When it's present, it feels life giving. And just like Metta, it can actually lead to concentration, wisdom and insight that's liberating and freeing. So that's why it's a wise intention to cultivate compassion and to bring compassion into our interactions with ourselves and with others. The figure that I often think about when I think about Karuna and compassion is Guanyin. I don't know if any of you are familiar. So she's Avaloti Keshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, much more from the Mahayana tradition. She has this goddess pose. She's a goddess. So in the figures of her, she's really relaxed, she usually has one leg up and she's sitting like this and she has this vial that she's dispensing and this little brush. Sometimes she's holding a scroll. She often has kind of a little smile on her face. She's very embodied and relaxed. And I think about that when I think about compassion. Is this really, is my compassion like this? Or is it like, because then that's not true compassion. That's distress. That's overemphasizing. That's taking on another suffering rather than meeting it with that wider worldview. So I'd like to distinguish compassion, Karuna, from a few things that we might be confusing it is with. So one would be pity or feeling sorry or grief about, I'm careful about grief. I would say pity or feeling sorry for something or someone. There's a distancing in that like, Oh, may that not ever happen to me. You know, a poor thing like over there. And it's not a, Oh no. It's not this distress like explosive reaction. And it's also not trying to fix something and become the rescuer or the savior. I know what you need to do to get out of that situation because I'm still uncomfortable with you in it. Let me just fix it. So those are some ways that compassion can get a little derailed. I'd also like to distinguish it from empathy. So empathy is just pure feeling. I can empathize, I can kind of get a feel for how you might feel. I can take on the experience of others. That's empathy. For me, compassion is being able to stand next to someone in their suffering, kind of like a friend might come and sit next to you. Say you're in the hospital and they come and they just sit next to you. Maybe they hold your hand, stand alongside, maybe even put their hand around your shoulder. It's the ability to hold suffering within something bigger so that the suffering itself doesn't just like eat us all up. It's like we can hold it. And there's a non hostility towards the suffering. There isn't a, you may have the desire to alleviate it and transform it, but there isn't this, no. So compassion asks us to go towards what is uncomfortable. That can be challenging to go towards what's uncomfortable for ourselves, meeting it in others. And as such, I think the practice and the intention requires patience. A lot of patience with ourselves. So it's not an overnight practice that you're going to wake up tomorrow and have perfect compassion towards everyone and everything. But again, it's noticing, is there compassion arising here or is there something else arising? And just being really honest with yourself and noticing what is it like when I'm feeling like I can hold this suffering without getting pulled into it, but still meeting it. And what is it like when I really cannot? This is a quote from Frank Ostasecki who wrote the five invitations and was involved in the Zen hospice project. He says, if we're not willing to explore our own suffering, then we will only be guessing as we try to understand others. It is the exploration of our own suffering that allows us to serve others. This is what allows us to touch another person's pain with compassion instead of fear and pity. So it's kind of a grand thing, but it begins with ourselves. It's almost like when we've explored our own deepest fears and pains, then we're better able to stand alongside others as they meet theirs. And if we feel like someone else is not offering us any compassion whatsoever, you might kind of understand perhaps they haven't been able to meet their own suffering as well. So for me, compassion may or may not involve action. That's why we talk about it kind of as an intention. It can, it definitely can lead to action, but it can also just be an intention for compassion and have that arise as a state. It's more about the relationship with what is happening. Am I relating to this with compassion or am I relating this with fear, pity or cruelty or wanting to harm and push away? I think what's so beautiful about compassion is that it acknowledges suffering with a tender heart and allowing us to open up to suffering. And only then does progress really proceed on the path. And like all of these beautiful intentions that Tanya and I are talking about today, I always like to come back to that it can be beautiful just to have the wish to have the intention. And even if not fully present in its penultimate form, just the wish that I wish I could be more compassionate with this person. You know, I know it's not quite there and I know how that feels when it's not quite there, but I do have the intention, the wish to cultivate this more in our relationship. So I just want to commend all of you whenever you see that kind, gentle inclination towards cultivating these wholesome intentions. So to sum up here, I think I see both metta, loving kindness and karuna compassion. I see them as both coming out of a fundamental wisdom where we understand that all human beings are vulnerable and we're in touch with that vulnerability of ourselves and others. And loving kindness is recognizing that every living being fundamentally wishes to be happy, to be well, to be loved, to be safe. And compassion is recognizing that every human being suffers, every living being suffers. They're subject to impermanence and death. So we're sensitive to those, to that liability of simply being alive. So metta and karuna, may they be fruitful in your practice and may they lead you to greater insights and liberation because that's ultimately why we practice them. And as we practice them, we can continue to see, is this leading to greater joy and relaxation and wellbeing for myself? And where is it difficult? So I'd like to thank all of you for your attention. And I think we're going to move into some breakout groups just to get you guys a chance to think about what I've just shared and talking your groups. And then we'll have a chance to come back for question and answer after that. So if you can find another group of three, it can be the same group or it can be different. So take a moment to settle into your body. Notice how your body is doing, the thoughts, new environment, maybe even invite some wishes for wellbeing for all those in your group. Wish for safety, wish for this dialogue to lead to greater wisdom and happiness. Okay, so we'll do this in a slightly different way. We'll just have each person share one sentence and then we'll do the next person share one sentence and one sentence. So we'll just kind of, you'll be able to go around more than once. And I'll ring the bell. We have two questions, so I'll introduce the first question and then you can each kind of give one sentence responses and maybe after you've gone around once you've thought of a new one and then you'll go around again and then I'll ring the bell and I'll do the second question. So to start, let's go with the person with the shortest sleeves, if it's clear. And if not, then the person who has the lightest color, the darkest color face mask. We'll go with that. Maybe that's hard. And if it's not clear, just someone could volunteer. Okay, so the question is, what are some difficulties or challenges you experience with loving kindness and compassion practice? What's a challenge or difficulty for you? Okay, I see a lot of smiles and I'm hoping that was a good engagement on the topic for you. Okay, so now we're going to do our second question and I guess maybe the last person who spoke can be the first person to reply for this one. What supports or inspires you to engage with loving kindness practice and compassion? So what supports and inspires you? We've examined what some of the challenges and difficulties might be. So what can be, what's his supportive to you? What inspires you to hone in on these intentions and these practices? Sherry, we'll come back as a large group. So I hope you discovered some sources of wisdom and inspiration to speaking with each other. Yes, well maybe we'll take about five minutes just if anyone wants to share anything that for them kind of arose in the group or any new insights or learnings or anything you want to share with the larger group. Yes, over here. Hi, so I just want to say when you were discussing compassion, when you were teaching on compassion, that what these, my memories came to mind very quickly of my children and what really, it was very fast and I realized that when I, when it's sticky compassion, they don't feel heard. And when it's compassion, when I actually am present and because the sticky compassion is you know, I'm parenting half the, you know, it's like get over it. Okay, I understand now here's all the solutions. You know, it's this, but actually when I can hear them and I don't offer a thousand choices and I give them the dignity of their suffering because they deserve to, do you know, I mean, I don't mean a bad way, but I mean, everybody deserves sort of to learn, right? What a difference. They feel heard. So I just wanted to say it really struck me. Beautiful, thank you for sharing that. Yeah, back there. I'm a little struggling to find the connection between the right intention and the two topics that we're discussing, so maybe you can explain that. Yes, that's a good question. So we talked about three intentions that are not so wholesome. So greed for sensual fulfillment and the antidote for that is renunciation. So letting go or maybe generosity, you could maybe what you want, you might like give it to someone else. And then the other one is ill will, so like anger, the antidote to that is meta. So that's why we were talking about meta. And then the last one was, was it cruelty? Renunciation, letting go. It's funny. It's like the three keep changing. Yeah, it's essentially non-harming. And then, so non-harming, right, is one and loving kindness is two. And the third one is well-being, which it's not compassion. Let's see if I find my, go ahead. So there's always lists. Okay, go ahead. Do you want to add? So I think what was left for you was the non-harming, right? Right. Oh, renunciation. Yes. So the renunciation or letting go is paired with well-being. So non-harming, renunciation, and loving kindness are the three wise intentions. And so non-harming is often paired with compassion, right? And renunciation is often like looking at not of letting go of greed, right, of letting go of lust, of wanting things we often need to let go of or ill will, right? Or letting go of these unwholesome things. And loving kindness, right, is the opposite would be ill will or hatred, wanting to harm, right? So I think it's hard because there's different words, right, for them? So I lose track too. So yeah, go ahead, Kristin. Thank you. So I have a question from my own experience of, you said compassion is the courage of the heart and then holding our pain and then the pain of others. And my question is how to allow that pain to flow through, just because something I've done for many years is that I would hold the pain. And then when I'm holding others, it would become mine as well. And then I would get a little delusion of not seeing what was mine or what was the others. And so I've been intentional of like trying to practice with how I can allow it to flow through me rather than holding. But I was just curious if either of you have anything you'd like to share about, like allowing that to flow through or if there's any practices or things that might come to mind. I can start. That's a good question. We've spoken a little bit about wise boundaries. Like when we're meeting someone else's pain to stay in our own bodies and in our own embodiment, when we're meeting that pain and there is a balance between being open to their suffering and being alongside them without, this is me, this is my suffering. So that's sometimes, so in my own work, I work as a chaplain in the hospital. Sometimes I have to step out and say, this is her story. And I really feel for her, but that's not my story right now. And so a piece of that is self care, knowing when it's wise and when you're able to step into that in a non-harming way for yourself and knowing when, you know, I really need to go and take care of myself right now so that I'm not taking so much pain on that it's not helpful for me at all. So it's a balance, it's a courage and there's a wisdom factor here of knowing. Yeah, Tanya, do you want to add something? Which is when I'm untangled. So I just want to make sure I'm resonating with what you're asking, which is, it sounds like you feel empathy for somebody else suffering, is that right? And then you start to feel like you're carrying their pain for them, is that right? Yeah. So one of the first things that for me has been helpful and so it may or may not work for you, right? But is to reflect that I actually can't feel somebody else's feelings for them, that I can't actually do that for them. Does that make sense? The only person that can feel and work through that is them. That helps me unhook a little bit. It helps me go, oh, really then what I need to do is be able to be with them in their suffering, but it's their suffering. It's communal suffering, right? But I actually cannot digest, process, work through somebody else's emotions, somebody else's problem. I can be there, but it's them. They need to meet that moment and I can support them, but I can't do their work for them. And that is very helpful for me because it's sort of like we're integrated, we're interdependent, what I do affects them, but where is the boundary also of my trying to do something that isn't possible for me to do? So I end up, like I can find myself obsessing, ruminating, trying to problem solve, but it's not me that needs to do that work. So that's the main piece that comes up. So I want to welcome any question or response or pushback that you might have to help for more clarity to help you. Thank you for that. Yeah, because the last piece was not only me attempting to carry someone else's pain, then I would identify that it was mine, that was the part. I've come a long way because I find myself not doing it as much. But yeah, it's just a practice. It is a practice and I'll tell you a little story about how it's so, especially I think. So when I was in college, my sister was in a car accident and she actually caused a lot of harm to another being. And I remember I kept imagining what that would be like to have been the driver, to have caused that much harm. I was really, really distraught, really distraught. Like I was dysregulated and I went to one of my professors and was talking to them about it. And she actually said, wait, wait, wait, wait. Now who was driving the car? And it was a real awakening for me to be like, oh yeah, I didn't do that. And so that's the power of the mind, is that we can imagine, we can have so much compassion and care and empathy for others. It's really a beautiful thing. And we need to know, we need to be clear also, like my experience, your experience. Sometimes it is that a real, like that is her, this is me experience. Thank you. Yeah. Oh, I was going to ask something. I think as a follow up, yeah, there are times where you're seeing someone go through something you went through in the past and then it brings up the pain. I feel like maybe it's, I don't know if it's unresolved, but then is it the same stuff you were just describing where it's like, it's their experience and it's not exactly the same as mine, but for some reason it's bringing up like a similar experience I had and it brings the pain out from there. And I don't, I feel like that's hard. And how do you find the answer Iris? I think it's hard to be there for the other person when personally you're going through it too. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's, yeah, I think that was my experience. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to say anything? Yeah. I think the word that sometimes uses it can trigger some of your own brain pain and so just that awareness like, oh, this me and my meeting, this is bring up this for me. And so discerning whether usually it's like maybe it's wise to not be their primary support person for example. Yeah. It's complicated. I know that skillful use of self. Sometimes when somebody's going through something very similar, you have more to offer because you've gone through it, but sometimes you might have less to offer because you're too, you're still working on that yourself. You know, when you're trained to be a therapist or a chaplain or something and you go into a room where there's a lot of distress, you're trained that it's actually not helpful to resonate with the distress. But if somebody is very dysregulated and distressed, they need a balanced, clear presence. So it's very helpful, I think sometimes to keep that in mind. I've seen that. I saw that with myself with my kids parenting when they would get really dysregulated. If I offered empathy, oh, I'm so sorry. It's so hard. It was like, well, it got worse. And I had to learn, it was really like seemed counterintuitive to me to have to learn how to like meet it in this more like, yep, and okay. And so what are we going to do? Or yeah, and here we go. Or you know, different amounts of strength are needed. Sometimes when people are really, they actually really need like, okay, let's just pick up your shoes. You know, like this is what we need to do. And so, you know, if we have the capacity to be that person, to be regulated, it's actually very empathic and supportive. It's kind of similar ideas. Like I'm kind of doing a long, intense personal meditation every day, knowing that I'm probably going to go much deeper when I go into two week retreat. So one of the things I'm noticing, I have a lot more, I have values and troughs, but the troughs of emotion, I go very deep where I can actually experience pretty deep, deep things and then I, one emotion leads to another emotion and like my therapist called it like vortex of emotions. And how do you kind of, when you have a vortex, you're kind of sucked into that and trying to break it away. I'm really much better finding myself grounding within a day or so I can kind of recover. But do you guys, what do you guys do when you go through that, that trough in a very deep meditative state, sometimes you get there. I'm noticing I got there a couple of times in two weeks. You want me to, okay. Well I think I would say that part of what I have found, especially because we're talking about on a retreat, right? So in any, I don't find it so useful myself to fall too deeply into emotional states. I'll just say that. It's not my, I'm not going to do my best processing. I'm just not, you know, I'm not, I lose my wisdom. I lose my ground. But specifically if I'm doing a retreat and a lot of concentration, I put a lot of effort into my effort. I put a lot of attention and care into tracking what, how my mind state is. And I recognize it by noticing what the mind is bringing up or noticing. I'm literally witnessing what's happening in the mind. And so then I need to, okay, the mind's starting to get tight. I need to go outside and do walking and notice the sky to help my mind open up and loosen up. So I do a lot of, maybe I need metta, maybe I need walking meditation, maybe I do elements practice, maybe I do, there's so, you know, it's just impossible to name all the things. But I literally work to rebalance. It's constant rebalancing. And this is part of the really that footstep one at a time. Sometimes when we're concentrated, things can go really wacky really quickly. And so we just, we just have to learn to build it in and to keep regrounding, reorienting and collecting and noticing what's needed here. Too much effort can really throw off my mind. Not enough effort. I'm asleep. So there's, there's a lot of balance that comes into this practice that's needed to help with regulation. So I'm noticing we're at time, which means it's also time for dedication of merit and to appreciate you and Leila, would you lead us in that? Yeah, if you feel comfortable, we can join your hands together. So may the fruits of our time here together, listening to the Dharma sharing, may it lead to our own wellbeing, may it fill our hearts and may that permeate to all those around us, all we encounter and to the whole world. May all beings everywhere be safe. May all beings everywhere be happy and may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you all for coming. Thank you guys so much.
