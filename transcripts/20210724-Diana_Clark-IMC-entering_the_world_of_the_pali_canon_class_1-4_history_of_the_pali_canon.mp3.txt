 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Yeah, I was just kind of happy to be listening to you, David. Unfortunately, I have to speak now. So one thing I want to start with maybe is our relationship as individuals, our relationship to these texts. You can hear in the way that Ying, Kim, David, and I are relating to them that they're meaningful for us and that they've been an integral part of our practice and has been a way in which we've kind of engaged with Buddhism is partly through the texts. But there are plenty of people and plenty of teachers who don't find their way in to practice is through the texts. So I myself and I think all my co-teachers would agree, we don't right now want to say this is the only way. But instead, for all of us to find our relationship to these texts, how are they a support for our practice and how might they be something that helps us to go deeper and maybe find some connection to the practice that maybe we didn't before. And then maybe I'll share this little story that when I first started reading The Suit Does, this was a number of years ago, and I didn't and I felt so inspired. And in my mind, I didn't know I had this idea, but I had this idea like, finally, like all the answers to all my questions, life's questions are going to be here. And it's going to be in a numbered list. It's going to be neat and tidy. I just have to find the right list. And that was kind of like I didn't realize I had it, but I did until I found a list that contradicted another list. They had two different things. I'm like, oh, my goodness. And I just kind of like felt confused and without and like, wait a minute. I was hoping I had holding on to this idea that everything would somehow make sense to be neat and tidy. And so I just offer this that for each one of us to find our way, our relationships to the text, because what we don't want to do, Kim, Yang, David and I, we don't want to encourage a certain fundamentalism or a dogmatism like, okay, we're holding on to this. And this is the truth and reason for us to sow divisiveness or some separation or something like that. So we have an emphasis on practice and with text. So not we're not scholars. You know, we don't earn our livings as being scholars of Buddhism, but we are practitioners. So I kind of want to encourage all of us to investigate for ourselves what our relationship is. And then maybe I would say that through the years, like in Southeast Asia, you know, through these thousands of years, there has been an emphasis on practice more than doctrine. And this is a little bit different than the Abrahamic religions, that there is it's more about ortho proxy rather than ortho doxy. So it's we don't in Buddhism, the text the books aren't held up in the same way in which you might find some other religions, you know, the Bible, for example, or the, you know, whatever religious texts that might be, they might hold them up in a way. And there are in Buddhism, there's a different relationship, it's more what you do, and your practice and your views, these types of things. So I'm putting that in as a kind of a placeholder. But then I want to say what what is, how did we get here? Like, how do we even these books that Kim held up with Thank You Kim for doing it. That was kind of fun for me to kind of like be reminded these are like physical objects we have today. But how did we get here? And first of all, I'll start by saying that this suit does were composed, compiled, edited, we don't know exactly by when I'm using this word composed compiled edited that you go, oh, say this briefly, you know how when in English when we're reading English, and you can, when you read a text, if you don't know anything about the text, but it was written in the Victorian era, you kind of have a feeling like, oh, this was written before, I can just tell by the way they use their words and kind of the sentence is. So there are scholars who can do this with Polly to you can tell, oh, okay, there's some texts that have older use the way they're using the verbs and the vocabulary is older, or this is newer. So there are some scholars who do this. It's nowhere definitive. It's nowhere. Like very clear like this is early and this is late in terms of the strata of what's in the poly cannon, but there is a sense of there is some strata. And maybe I'll just leave it at that. And we kind of as practitioners we have to decide amongst ourselves of whether we are going to try to tease apart earlier from later, or whether we're going to accept everything that's there or how we're going to hold this. So, the suit does are composed compiled edited when whenever they were. We know that it's from a people that were quite distant from our culture and times. Thousands of years, 100 generations. Can you think about that so like you have our parents, great parents, great grandparents, you don't go back 100. So there's been through the ages they've been passed down as Kim said can form hand to warm hand. But when we read them, we have to be reminded that the times were different than, and then, then they are now so sometimes we bring our modern 21st century ideas about what should be in a text what a religion should be how people should be treated these types of things we bring them to these texts from thousands of years ago, and we might find ourselves getting confused or disappointed, or I don't know just to be aware that. Okay, so the Buddha. The way that I think about it is that you lived in, you know, the year minus 4400. I use this word like minus 400 so kind of like help me keep it in this timeframe. So, minus 400 specie. So just after the Buddhist death. There was this was called the first council is the, some of the awakened people who were some of the followers of the Buddha got together said okay we should preserve these teachings. They, and the tradition holds that ananda, who was the Buddha's attendant who had been there during these teachings, recited them, and people listen to them and memorize them. And then upi, recited what was for the vinya, so another just did that one basket who Polly who, interestingly was a barber, and the story is, is because he would shave everybody's head is part of being ordained so he was the guy that shaved everybody's head. So he was in the night he was there and so he heard that vinya teachings that I'll be done with the third basket is done some time later, but in the beginning. the contents of the first two baskets or aldge right after the Buddha died. Writing probably existed in India at this time, I'm not exactly sure, but if it did it was just done for commerce, for or you know like collecting taxes or something like that, writing IOU notes or something like that. Certainly something as important as religious texts would not have been preserved in writing. It was felt this was something, writing was for the mundane, profane, and oral recitation was for the religious text. Maybe I'll say just a bit about this oral recitation. So at that time there was this hereditary priestly caste in India, the Brahmins, and way before Buddhism they preserved their texts orally and this was like the family occupation. This was their trade to memorize texts starting from before the Buddha and even into modern times. Fascinating just like maybe some of you have heard that scientists like to put long-term meditators like some of these Tibetan monks put them into scanners and scan their brains and they're reporting all the differences. Well they're doing the same thing with some of these people who have been, their life work is to memorize texts, put them in scanners, and I'm seeing that they also, their brain is a little bit different than ours, that they have certain parts of their brain that are more developed. So just to say that this idea of oral recitation is not only something that happened thousands of years ago but that continues today and that people have this capacity to do this. So getting back to the memorizing the text, there's this first council soon after the Buddha died. 70 years later this is what the tradition holds that does seem like some monks were misbehaving a little bit or doing something that wasn't quite right. So they said let's get together and remind ourselves of the rules, the Vinaya and the Dhamma. And then this continued for, then I guess there was like okay that this works and then I think there's a third council is then when they started to be a break in the Sangha. That's when there's a schism and then they go off into different directions. So now we have what at that time is not yet the Theravada tradition but one can say becomes the Theravada but then there's some other schools that go in the other direction. There's a number of branches and there's maybe I think there's 18 different schools at one time, this is what is believed. And the Pali Canon is what has been preserved by one of those 18 schools. The others have been lost in their entirety. Let me say this, their entirety has been lost. We have bits and pieces from some of the other schools. Some of what's from the other schools were preserved in Sanskrit as opposed to Pali. Maybe I'll say something like the relationship between Sanskrit and Pali is kind of like the relationship between Latin and French. So where Latin is the more complicated and French is a little bit easier. Similar to Sanskrit and Pali. The ones that were preserved in Sanskrit got translated into Chinese. The Sanskrit originals have been lost, most of them, not all of them, but we mostly have what's been preserved in Chinese and those are the Agamas. So we have like these parallel texts. So we have the Pali Canon and then we have the Agamas. But the Agamas are from different schools, some are from the Sarvastivand and some from the Moolarsar Sarvastivand, those types of things. So what's fascinating is there's the second council, the third council, the fourth council, the sixth council, maybe some of you were alive, 1954, not so long ago, happened in Burma where people from Burmese countries came together and they recited the Vinaya and the Dhamma and I'm assuming they did the Abhidhamma at that time as well and they did some of the commentary on texts. And this was in Burma. It started in May 1954 and it took them two years to kind of go through this and they ended in 1956 and then the council kind of approved the texts and then they got written down using modern printing methods. So to talk a little, I'm just going to say a little bit more now about this memorization. So we had people in 1954 that had memorized. I think my understanding is there was a monk in Burma who had memorized. I had heard the entire Tapitaka but maybe it was just the Dhamma, Suta, the one. I'm not sure. But when we read the text, some of you who are familiar that might notice, that there's, we can tell that they're oral texts because there's a lot of repetition and there's a repetition helps in a number of ways that kind of creates a rhythm as well as there's a way in which the, if you say something more than once, right, you're more likely to remember it. But repetition in terms of like whole paragraphs, but there's also repetitions of the first sound of the word. Like they choose words, so there's an alliteration. There's repetition, the sounds in the middle of the word, and there's also repetition of sound at the end of the word, also known as rhyming. So there's a certain way in which the texts have been preserved. Not only is there repetition, but there's also what's called kind of like waxing syllables. So this idea, sometimes if you see there's a long list of synonyms. In Pali, that synonym, the word with the fewest number of syllables is first, and then the word with the longest number of syllables is last. And that gives a certain meter, a certain cadence to the way that the words are in Pali. So we don't really have that in English, of course, the English translations. So as we've been talking about recitation was used to preserve the text for hundreds of years before they got written down. They got written down probably in the minus 100s, the first century BCE. It's likely that other parts, like little bits were written down here and there before then, but the whole kind of probably got written around that time. So it's hundreds of years of just oral recitation. So they're reciting to preserve the text, but also just as David did for us, the recitation has been always a part of the Buddhist tradition, not only as part of practice, but there's even a suta that's where somebody overhears the Buddha saying out loud a suta to himself as kind of as part of a practice. And there's even like to do some recitation is an antidote for drowsiness. It's kind of like an instruction that's given. Or I'll just say for myself, I had memorized the metta suta in English and would chant that to myself as a way to kind of like help the mind settle and kind of the heart soften. So maybe some of you have that similar experience. Maybe I'll just end with just a few words. To contrast the studies in Pali and Pali Canon compared to like biblical studies is so relatively new, so far behind biblical studies. Biblical studies have been happening for hundreds of years. We would say the Pali Text Society was formed in the late 1800s. With the idea, let's look at these texts and translate them into English. And the first Pali English dictionary didn't exist until 1874. And kind of the gold standard Pali English dictionary right now that was written in 1925, almost 100 years ago. So there isn't a number of scholars that we have working on this is not a lot. It's not easy to find a place where you can learn Pali, for example, Sanskrit, it's a little bit easier. But the idea that there's a paucity of research, there's a paucity of a lot of work being done. But right now, as many of you know, it's so exciting because right now I feel like in these past 10 years, there's been this resurgence of interest and Biko Analiou is doing one of them. Somebody mentioned Joseph Goldstein, who was inspired by Biko Analiou's book to then kind of turn it into Dharma teacher talk and stuff like this. So I feel it's kind of exciting that right now, these texts are really coming alive and getting re-translated because Sujato's translation is just Sujacentral, which we'll talk about later, just went live what, three years ago, something I guess, I don't know how many years ago, something like this. So you can hear my kind of like enthusiasm about this. So just wanted to share a little bit about how we got here, where we have these books. So and maybe I'll turn it over to David now. Yeah, Diana may have, for reasons of time, not shared something we wanted to share, which is sort of an idea about, do you want to go back real quickly, Diana? I think it's worth it. I'm sorry, like I had this year. Okay, so how do they preserve them? Clearly, they didn't have paper back then. And they wrote them on palm leaves. And so here is some of the David and it's hard difficult for me to hold them in one hand. But here is something and then David can show you an up close photo of this. So what David is showing right now is, do you want to say? Interestingly, these were found at a garage sale in Oregon. But these were probably they probably are 100 years old, and they represent a way that these teachings were shared. These were probably these probably served as a as a member as a mnemonic aid for monks, per se, and they were for monks providing various blessings and other ritual observances. I'll give a just a couple close ups so you can see some of the beautiful hand that they're prescribed in these were cut into palm leaves and then brushed with charcoal or what do we call it soot to so that they would stay in these leaves. And just one more so you can get a sense of kind of the different writing that turns up in this one of which and there are many of these I gather that they can be found in markets, you know, in Southeast Asia, having found their way out of their, you know, one one time use into sort of a trade in these objects. Anyway, we wanted to share that with you before proceeding to some, you know, Q&A. So if there are questions, again, if people want to raise their hands, we would like to think that some people say lucky you, you know, my first I gotta say when I first these came into my possession, my first impulse was to give them back, you know, find a place for them to be held in the community and maybe be a view. So it's wonderful to share them with you because in a way that's, I think, sort of an appropriate way of sharing we plan to eventually share them with appropriate monastery or something where they can be kept. Yeah, Wayne, questions. Hi, well, guys, I just want to say again, as somebody said, this is amazing. My I have a kind of a personal question. About 25 years ago, I suffered a stroke that occurred, I understand in the hippocampus of my brain. And my short term, it affected my short term memory. And so my memory is just not good. And, you know, I keep hearing so much about memorization and stuff like that. And I'm just wondering if you can say something that that I can tell myself to keep me going or maybe that's why I yeah, I don't know. I don't know quite what I'm asking, but yeah, you know, I love it. It's a wonderful question. And I think one thing we learn in understanding that these teachings were passed on through millennia, principally by chanting and that they still are is and we recognize this in other world wisdom traditions and elsewhere that that the human mind's capacity for memorization is absolutely amazing. You know, it's vast. The the Odyssey, the Iliad were apparently memorized in their entirety, people still regular people still memorize the Quran, that's a can be a part of Islamic practice today. So, and then the other thing that we know about the mind, and I mentioned these not because they're just interesting factoids, but because they also are related to the Buddha's insights into the way the mind works, and its plasticity recognized thousands of years ago is how powerful the mind is and replacing lost capacity with new capacity, building new habits in the place of old habits, or in the case, perhaps of some of your memory, you know, finding ways to strengthen capacities that have been weakened either by natural change by aging or by, you know, the mind's engagement elsewhere. So I think the power of the human mind, the special nature, the special qualities of the human mind, the ability to reflect on our ability to reflect, which is perhaps not unique to humans, but uniquely important in human life and in this this practice. So that's just a sort of a riff on that question. Are there other questions? Maybe a couple more to end our day. Maybe I'll just add, David, that I'm when you were speaking, Wayne, I thought of a story from the commentaries about a monk who was not good at memorization and was a little bit shunned by the other monks because of this. And the but the Buddha came and gave him a practice to do essentially gave him a specific practice that was well suited to his mind. And the monk ended up waking up before the other monks who were busy with the memorization. So in the end, there's it's the practice that will awaken. And if we can take in enough and hear it as one of the comments said, sometimes just through our heart or through our body, we can take in the teachings in a way that they can be transformed into practice. And in the end, it's the practice that's transformative. So this is not a fundamental barrier that you're talking about. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, and let me let me I have a couple of the thought on that. But let's go to Prajit's question. Yeah, thank you. I was actually kind of wondering, Diana was mentioning that there's the polycanon and also these sort of the Chinese translation the Agamas. I was sort of curious to understand, you know, how similar are they? And like, what are the differences between them on like a high level? Yeah, that's a great question. And, you know, as we put together this class, we thought, oh, there's, there's more classes here, you know, we could do this next year with totally different sort of focus. And that would be one of them, as Diana mentioned, I see Diana's unmuted too, but, you know, they they they the the Agamas are a collection drawn from various canons, various collections of different schools, among them the 18 that seem to be, you know, there a few hundred years after the Buddha's death. And they things are found not only in different places, but sometimes different parts of them are found in different places in the Agamas. And so sometimes they're right where they should be, as it were, but other times, including some very important ones, like the discourse on the establishing of mindfulness, there's different pieces in different places, which helps us understand something about how they might have been used in practice. And also just something, you know, the vagaries of time and this vast translation project that resulted in the Agamas in the Chinese translation. And it's their their translations, I think I'm right, Diana, and saying their translations, not from Pali, but from Sanskrit. So, you know, there's there's another kind of and Pali and Sanskrit are closely related, but they're not the same. And so that too happens. Maybe I'll just say briefly that this research is just being done now. Before historically, there just haven't been individuals who could read class of Chinese and Sanskrit and Pali and a Western language. There weren't enough people that knew all those languages that were interested to do this. And Biko Analayo is one of those people and who is systematically comparing, oh, okay, here's this in the Pali Canon, here it is in the Agamas, how is it different? Sometimes it's just like if there's a list, maybe some of the lists, they're not in the same order. And sometimes there's really big differences. So that's kind of what scholars are doing right now. So let's, we'll be open for more questions next week. But let's, let's move toward closing, Kim. Okay, wonderful. So we've had a lot of information today in various different modes coming in. So we wanted to finish with some, as kind of a different way to engage with these texts. And what we're going to do now is play a chant. One way that these texts remember have been passed down is through oral transmission. And some people, you know, this also evokes a very devotional sense in people and helps to memorize, helps to integrate the text. We may not have a lot of experience with this as Western practitioners, but it's quite a big thing in Asia, still done today. Even lay practitioners would listen to chants and go to the monastery and hear the monks chanting. And this would be a part of their engagement with the practice and with their Buddhist religion. So the chant that we're going to play, it's three minutes long, so I better start it soon. And if you would just listen kind of openly, you know, the intervals that they use are different than are used in Western music and so forth. So just, let's just take it in. And the particular chant, by the way, that we're playing is the opening of the Satipatthana Sutta. So you heard it earlier in English. This is in Kali. It's chanted by a Sri Lankan monk. So it's done in the Sri Lankan style. Today in Sri Lanka is the Uposa today and it's called the Poya day. That's what they say in their language. So we might consider that we're participating today in Poya day. Let me get this set up.

So there was a number of questions that we didn't answer including some of the specifics like how do I find this and what is that so we have a whole other class next Saturday and I just want to thank everybody for attending and you'll get an email from us that will have a link to the audio recording and some of the link from what we just heard you can find the link to that and maybe we'll scrounge together the poly too. Yeah we can easily include the poly text. Great, great so what a pleasure what a pleasure to be with you all and we'll see you next Saturday. Thank you. Take care everyone thank you. Bye bye if you want you can unmute yourself and we can say goodbye. Feel free to unmute and say till next week. Till next week. Bye. Till next week. Till next week. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Bye.
