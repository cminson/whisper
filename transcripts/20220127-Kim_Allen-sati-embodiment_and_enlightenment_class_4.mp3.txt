Fair warning. So welcome, welcome everybody. Welcome to our fourth class of this exploration.
I think we started by talking about an adventure, or maybe even a journey with mindfulness of
the body, Madhavana Kaya 119, Kaya Guttasati Sutta. And when we met on Tuesday, David introduced
the teachings around Jhanas. And Ying introduced the section in the Sutta on progress through
mindfulness, which included a number of wonderful similes. I don't know if you guys are like
me, I really love the similes. There's something about them that is, I find a little delight
in them. And we left the day, or the class, by encouraging you maybe to try different
practices that we had done before, or if you were finding it juicy or fruitful to stay
with maybe another class, sorry, another practice, I'm sorry, to stay with a practice that you
had already been doing. And to maybe reread the Sutta again. Of course, we're reading
the Sutta over and over. It's amazing for me, like all the little tidbits that I find,
or the new understandings that come to fore when I read them again, so maybe you're having
the same experience. So now we just like to open it up. Do anybody have any comments or
questions about the practices, about rereading it, about some of what we covered yesterday,
before we start with some more material this morning, like to just open it up. And if you
like to use your zoom hand, that's helpful for us to see who's raised their hand. Any
questions or comments or something you'd like to share. Maybe I'll ask, what about the similes?
These are, there are different similes that pointed in different places. We had four similes
for each for the Jhana. And then we had all these similes about progress through the body,
with Mara being able to enter or not being able to enter. And maybe I'll just drop in
a few little observations. One is that these similes with Mara, first he's talking about
clay, when you throw a rock or a big ball at clay, or if you throw a light string at
a solid hardwood, we might say this is the earth element. And then second was being able
to light a fire with that wet wood or dry wood, the fire element. And this idea of having
water, a jug that's full of water or empty of water, the water element. So there's a
way, there's these subtleties that are built into the Supta. You only notice if you've
read it a number of times. And I certainly didn't notice that the first time I read it.
Yes, Nancy. Well, now that you've brought up the similes. So the one, the one about drenching
or moistening, like working with clay or working with bread. So the verb needing to
knead the dough. So it immediately brought to mind a way of preparing tea. In the Japanese
tea tradition, there are two ways of making a bowl of tea. One is to whisk the tea and
you have this infusion with kind of like a cappuccino like foam on top. But another way
to make, that's thin tea and then there's something called thick tea. And the action
that is done with the whisk is also called kneading. So it's, you know, about twice the
amount of tea, matcha tea powder and maybe half the water. So you are really just trying
to add enough liquid to get this very thick viscous brew, so to speak. It's kind of shocking
if you've never tasted it before, because it's very, very strong. But the setting for
drinking thick tea is different from the setting for drinking thin tea. And what happens in
the thick tea part of the tea gathering is that this bowl of very viscous brewed tea
is prepared in one bowl that's enjoyed by all of the guests. So everybody drinks from
this one bowl of tea, which is different from thin tea where everybody gets their own bowl.
So I guess what made me think about, you know, this is the kind of the crux, the heart of
the gathering that creates this moment of unity between the hosts and all the guests
drink from the same bowl of tea. It's very powerful. It's usually a small number of people,
like about five, but it can be more, maybe seven, because you don't want the tea to cool
before the last guest gets to drink. But for me, I don't know, that was a very powerful
image of this idea. I was kind of like picturing the whisk kneading the tea, you know, like
in the core of my body instead of this kind of bread imagery. But then the idea of how
it spreads out to create unity with other people, I thought was also, you know, maybe
a nice benefit of mindfulness of the body. Thank you. Thank you for sharing that, Nancy.
And I can, and not having done the tea ceremony myself, but I'm imagining that it's very much
a mindfulness of the body practice, the way that you handle the instruments and handle
everything is very right to be present and precise. And so.
And I would just add to Nancy, you for others who may not know this, I mean, this ancient
tradition is closely aligned with lineages of Buddhist practice. And that's one thing
that may be useful background for people to know, the tea ceremony is kind of infused
with pun intended, you know, practice, but also it's the same, you know, finding the
ceremony that works for you is important. And in this one, too, there's a way in which
you said, Nancy, perhaps, perhaps twice as much water, or sorry, twice as much matcha
as water. And that's the that's that activity of mind in the first John that we talked about
sort of, you know, carefully, carefully working so that the body is drenched still steeped,
right, a T metaphor within the metaphor, completely filling it with, you know, with the pleasure
born of seclusion of the meditation, just wanted to note those things.
Thank you, David. And then Nancy and Jerry, I see you raised your hand, but we'll maybe
wait till the next Q&A period for your comment. Okay. So Nancy Nancy Yamahiro, somebody who
has a Japanese name. Thank you. This wasn't part of the similes, but it is something
that I sort of internalized from some of the other stories and not sure if they belong
in a Suta. My memory of where I learned this along the way sort of fails me, but it's regarding
the Naga warrior and the strength of elephants, and absorbing sort of the confidence or the
strength that those stories sort of evoke. And those became really important stories
to me battling various health things. And so I don't know where I was going with that.
But those are stories that have been very helpful to me.
Thank you. Thank you Nancy. I'm glad they were helpful for you. And I think you're pointing
out what I think is some of the brilliance I would say of the Buddhist teaching is that
with these similes, just as Nancy Hamilton and Nancy Yamahiro are saying, we can find
a way that it's relevant for us, make it our own, that's supportive and meaningful and
I don't know, and make it part of our practice instead of just listening to some instructions
or something. Thank you Nancy. I love this idea of the Naga, the elephant being strong.
Thank you for bringing that in. Okay. So now I'd like to pass it over to Kim. She's
going to talk about some of these benefits of mindfulness of the body.
Great. Thank you. So we've made it to the last section of this Suta where the Buddha
describes 10 benefits of mindfulness of the body. And the section begins with some language
that I found striking, just echoing what Diana said about, you read this again and then
you see new things. So it says, when mindfulness of the body has been repeatedly practiced,
developed, cultivated, used as a vehicle, used as a basis, consolidated and well undertaken,
these 10 benefits may be expected. So on the one hand, it sounds a little bit like a high
bar, you know, about all these verbs about using as a basis, repeatedly practice, develop,
cultivated. But so maybe it is a high bar, but on the other hand, it also says that these
benefits are to be expected. It doesn't say, oh, they might happen, they might not, you
know, it sort of depends whether you're a good person or not, you know, it's just if
you do these practices, this is what will come about. So this clarity kind of matches
what had come just before Ying had talked about that last week, or a couple days ago,
where this idea of sort of being able to drive a chariot anywhere or easily release
water from a pond, there's some certain strength or even power that is kind of implied from
doing these practices of the body, there's a certain strength that comes. And that strength
interestingly is in the mind. So let me see some, yeah, so let's look at these benefits.
The first three have to do with calmly or patiently handling various physical and mental
states, say that in general, so we have a conqueror of discontent and delight, and a
conqueror of fear and dread, those are the first two. So we have, there's this way that
we're not swayed by certain mental states that can arise. And so several of these are
unpleasant, discontent, fear, dread, but also delight. So there's a way in which strong
mental states of various kinds don't overcome the mind and tip us into reactive responses
or unskillful responses. And this maybe reminds us of Mara being able to penetrate when the
mind is not very strong. So we would become overcome by these things. And then the third
one is maybe more about things that come in from the outside that are not under our control.
So we have cold and heat, hunger and thirst, gadflies, you know, these things like that.
And also ill-spoken, unwelcome words, so things that come in from other people and bodily
feelings that are even as painful as might take our life. So wow, in some sense, these
are various unpleasant sensations that come in because the body is vulnerable, in a sense,
you know, to use the words that Lee Brazington used, we've left our sense organs hanging
in the wind, which is kind of how it is, right? We have these open sense stores and stuff
comes into them. And so the mindfulness of the body helps us to deal with all the things
that impinge from without and also what arises within, right? That's what these first three
are about. So we're going to get on to the genuine superpowers. But I would say that
these first three could also be called superpowers. If we could really handle all of these things,
imagine how different the world would be. If more people could calmly endure some of
these painful and difficult feelings, it would be a very different place. But I do want to
get on to some of these less common benefits. So the fourth one is the ability to easily
attain Jhana and go in and out of it and so forth. So interestingly, I'm just going to
skip over that one and say that that is a result that comes, you know, the more you practice
these kinds of things that David was talking about, then, you know, the more readily they
will come. So I want to focus now on these final six, which are benefits five through
10. And we'll spend some time exploring them off because they really aren't talked about
that much in the sort of usual everyday Dharma talk setting. They're not as kind of relevant
for that. So this these six together benefits five through 10 have a name. This list is
called the Abygnya. And I'm going to put up a slide in a moment that shows you how to
spell that. So this word Abygnya means direct knowledge. And it's the same word that Ying
quoted at the end of her talk from section 29 of the Sutta. So someone who develops mindfulness
of body can incline their mind toward any state that may be realized by direct knowledge.
That is the same word as the name of this list, the Abygnya. So I like to call these the kind
of the special knowledges when they're named in this form, the special knowledges. And
so I'm going to share my screen just to kind of organize these so you can see them. Can
you see that? Somebody let me know you can see that we can. Okay, great. So the first
which is benefit number five is a list of eight. I've listed them here, eight, what are called
the supernormal powers. So these have their own name, they're called the itty. And interestingly,
they're all mundane, meaning that none of them indicate any level of awakening. You
could do all of these things and not even be a stream mentor. So it has various things
about appearing, vanishing, going through walls, diving in and out of the earth as if
it were water, walking on water without sinking as if it were dry land, even stroking the
sun and moon and influence with the body. So wow, you know, these are kind of intriguing.
Sometimes as a whole, these are called the transformation of the elements. So this I
like that because we've learned earlier about discerning the body as elements as being a
practice. And it leads toward various things I talked about, not self, etc. But another
thing is that one gains some abilities to manipulate these elements perhaps talk about
that more in a moment. And so then all of these eight together are called the first special
knowledge, the first Avindya. And then there are five other Avindyas, the divine ear, knowing
the minds of other beings, a recollection of past lives, this thing called the divine
eye, which means discerning the destination of beings according to their karma. And then
the sixth is destruction of the taints. And I won't talk about that one either because
that's Diana's going to talk about that one. So we have many intersecting lists because
numbers four through six of these Avindya are also called the Teveja, the three knowledges.
So the Buddha was very, or at least the way people organized his teachings was around
kinds of knowledge. And that was kind of his specialty, right? Knowledge opposes ignorance.
So we have a lot of different and different traditions talk about knowledges in different
ways. Okay, so I didn't want to talk a lot about, I want to talk now about how we can
think about these super normal powers and special knowledges. So, wow, how do we think
about these? So are they real? I mean, and if they are, are they good? Do the Buddha encourage
these? So let's say first that when the Buddha talks about these, they're always contextualized
as byproducts, rather than aims of deep Samadhi practice. Except for the last one, remember,
we're skipping the one that's awakening, that is, of course, a not mundane, that's
super mundane. And that's the one that the Buddha does encourage Diana, we'll talk about
that. So these are founded on the basis of the fourth jhana. That's the understanding
in the texts that when one gains mastery of the fourth jhana, this is one of the things
you can do with it. And so if you really study these early texts, we can't really write off
these powers and knowledges. They're too prominent. They're mentioned a number of different ways.
There are monastic rules about not using them under certain conditions. And in suttas, the
Buddha displays them, not that infrequently, I mean, not every sutta, but you can't avoid
it essentially. So I'm going to talk in some range around these. And I encourage you not
to totally ignore them, and also not to kind of dismiss them in a denigrating way. If you
really want to not deal with them, there is a way to kind of respectfully set them aside.
So I have this quote from Thich Nhat Hanh, who I'm happy to honor. He died about a week
ago. And he said, the miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green
earth in the present moment to appreciate the peace and beauty that are available now.
So this is a really an imminent sense of sacredness in the world. And maybe we don't
need these, these other kinds of knowledges or powers. But if you want to think of them,
you know, want to engage a different way, probably the most common way to understand
these in the modern world. And now, according to the scholar Sarah Shaw, she says they
are eloquent metaphors for the ability to listen, to empathize, to stand back and understand
the minds and backgrounds of others as they progress through stages in their lives. So
she makes the divine ear into a power of really being able to listen well, and reading the
minds of other beings as the emotional attunement and intuition and sensitivity that the practice
cultivates in our heart. You know, when we're less caught up in our own stuff, we become
more tuned to others more available. And so that we gain kind of psychological subtlety
as the mind purifies and strengthens, especially through genre practice. So this is appealing.
I can go with this. But it doesn't explain the supernormal powers like walking through
walls and the transformation of the elements. So if we want to move toward accepting these
more of their own terms, we could maybe make an analogy to science. This is just an analogy.
Okay, I'm equating ideas. Because science is a realm where modern people have developed
and wield a lot of power. Our ability to manipulate and control materials is orders of magnitude,
more precise and powerful than anything understood in the Bronze Age, which is when these texts
were written, were created. So many of the items that we use in our everyday lives would
be completely magical to people of ancient India. For example, zoom. Look at this screen.
You are hearing and seeing somebody far away. Sounds like the divine ear in the divine eye.
And the manipulation of materials that we've done to make say a laptop computer or even,
you know, I don't know, the lamp that's shining above you, how could you explain how it works
that you flip a switch and light goes on, you know, this is not comprehensible. You couldn't
explain electronics. It's just impossible. So again, this is just an analogy so that
you understand the extent of the power that we have now compared to them. So now making
the analogy, we might imagine that somebody could, through the power of a concentrated mind,
gain not ability just to work with the material world, but deep understanding of how mind and
matter work together, such that they could be manipulated, matter could be manipulated with
the mind. Or maybe we could know things much more deeply than the mind can know in its everyday
scattered state, we're leaking energy off of our minds all the time through our random thoughts
through. And when you move into concentrated states, you understand, wow, the mind is really
dissipated in everyday consciousness, compared to how it can gather. So it might be that we
can have kind of a sense of awe and wonder for the power of a mind that is gathered together
and is no longer leaking energy away, you know, like a sieve, essentially, imagine if you had a
bowl instead of a sieve. So, you know, we might, might allow ourselves or kind of open to that
idea if these supernormal powers is that they can evoke wonder in the person witnessing them.
And maybe they really are real. I personally know monastics who talk about witnessing these
from masters in Asia. The great lay teacher Deepamak, who was known by Jack Joseph and Sharon,
and who came to teach at IMS in its early days, was said to have some of these powers
and was said to have displayed them in our time in Asia. So in the end, though, of course, we
shouldn't think too much about all of this intellectually. There's another text, A.N. 477,
that says that the domain of the mind in Jhana is unthinkable or imponderable.
And now quoting Sujato's translation, it should not be thought about. And anyone who tries to
think about it will go mad or get frustrated. So the domain of the mind in Jhana might really be
beyond what we can think about. And so these powers are part of the domain of the mind in Jhana.
So maybe we don't want to get too wrapped up in that intellectually.
Which is, I hope I've given some range, maybe, of how to approach these ideas.
And maybe to reground us, our awakening does not depend on acquiring these powers,
first of all. And probably it doesn't even depend on our view of them. But I do hope
that you've enjoyed getting a little bit more information about them. They're not always talked
about. And speaking of awakening, that is the 10th benefit and the sixth abinna. And that one,
the Buddha, is interested in. And he does encourage. So Diana will talk about that later.
But for now, you'll have a chance to talk. And I'll turn it over to Yang to set that up.
Yeah, thank you, Kim, for that. For me, it was a kind of harp opening talk that you offered.
And maybe also mind opening. And so instead of limiting our, I guess, sometimes the thinking
mind is kind of lack of imagination to relate to some of the powers in us. So you are going to
go into a breakout room to share a little bit now. And so now that you've heard many different
embodied practices, the six embodied practices that Diana made a handout for,
all the way from breathing to corpse contemplation. And then David talked about
Jhana practices and the progressing from there on all the way to awakening. So we wanted to get
into groups to reflect upon this question. So having heard about different practices and benefits
to this point of the class, how might mindfulness, the body benefit or support your practice
at this time? And so how might mindfulness of body benefit or support your practice?
So that's the reflection. And I invite each of you to monologue a little and then pass it on
to the next person. You have about 12, is it a 10, 12 minutes? Okay, 10 minutes. And just keep an eye
on the time. I'm taking her out now. Oh, good. My class has another hour.
All right. And so you go around. And if you keep the point short,
you can definitely go around for the second time, if needed. And then let's see. Okay,
so the person with the shortest screen name, that is the name on your zoom square would go first.
So are we ready, David? Okay. So here you are flying through the walls.
Yeah, exercising some of the superpowers.
Got all kinds of superpowers now.
Yeah. Okay. There's everybody coming back. Let's pause after the, let me make sure everybody's back.
Yeah. I think we're all back. Let's pause before moving to teaching from Diana to
just get a sense of anything came up in the breakout rooms that would be useful to share.
Any questions that arose either in the breakout rooms or earlier today. And I'm thinking that Jerry
had his hand up as we began and maybe just ask Jerry whether the question he had then is still
alive now. But in any case, why don't we ask people to raise their zoom hands if there are
questions or comments, reflections, observations. And I see MRs. Oh, there was a thumbs up.
Let me just check with MR. Was that a hand up?
Okay. I see a no and shaken head. So let's turn to Thomas.
Thanks. My question actually came when I reread the Sutta. And it's at the beginning of the
Janas. So there's a section where it says, again, because quite secluded from central pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states. And I was just wondering, you know, secluded from unwholesome
states, is this referring to the five hindrances? Or what should we imagine if we talk about
having no unwholesome states? And I'll, I can just say something about that.
You know, it doesn't specify there. And I think any, you know, any whole unwholesome state would
be included. The five hindrances is sort of one way to organize, you know, unwholesome states of
mind. And there are maybe broader brushways to states of mind where there's desirous attachment,
wanting, clinging attachment states of mind where there's aversion states of mind where there's
absorption and ideas of self, you know, so that's a more general picture of the, you know, of the
sorts of things that might constitute unwholesome states. And I think even more generally than
that, so I've moved from five to three to one, even more, you know, so even more general is just
anything that points the other direction, right? Anything that moves towards stillness
in this practice is wholesome, skillful, anything that moves us back away from that. And as these
states become more subtle, subtle, that's the kind of movement of mind that may be most useful.
Very little effort, but just as clear knowing that, ah, this, this state of mind, this leads onward
towards greater ease, greater stillness, greater clarity. I hope that helps, Thomas. And other
teachers, Diana, Ying, Kim, any comments? Okay. And I can't remember which hand goes in which order,
so I'm going to say Kathleen, and Kathleen, you haven't spoken yet today, so go ahead and I may
have these things. I think Nancy was before me. Okay, Nancy. It's okay, I've already spoken today,
so why don't you go, Kathleen? Okay, let's go, Kathleen. And then I just had a technical question.
For example, if, if my attention is on my teeth, is it my teeth or is it just teeth out in general?
Yeah. So over the past couple of days, when I was working on this first grouping,
I found it very difficult. The more I practiced to concentrate. And then it came to the point where
I didn't even know what I was exactly concentrating on. My own parts or just the part in general.
Yeah. It was all just kind of going around.
Yes. And I bow to you just because this is exactly how these practices unfold,
or I think, or we could say are intended to unfold. Maybe we begin thinking that we're
focusing on my teeth, my hair of head, my, my hair of body, my skin, my bone, the first five.
But the more we, the more we pay attention, the more we notice that there isn't any
hours in there. There's no that. And with that, things, things can open up in, in wonderful ways.
The opening that happens again, is towards seeing clearly how the mind adds order or imposes order,
how agency is created, how wanting aversion, delusion arise, those things become available
when we let go of that sense of my teeth. So that sounds like a wonderful experience.
And thank you for sharing because it's sometimes easy to kind of look always toward the suffering
that we encounter. And sometimes we don't notice the freedom when it's happening,
the letting go that's happening. It's always useful to go, oh, there's some letting go and,
and be aware of that. So Kathleen, thanks for sharing that. Thanks. That was helpful. Thank you.
Thank you. When, when you first spoke, turning to Nancy now, you said, my teeth, and I heard you say,
because I was confused, my T. So back to Nancy, maybe it's about T. Maybe it's not, we'll say.
No, not about T. So my question is about mindfulness of the body.
How to distinguish when, say, that the heart is, is racing, perhaps before speaking publicly or
asking a question in front of a bunch of people. You know, one becomes aware of that. And then
like how to, this is, I guess, an indication that there's fear or nervousness. But sometimes
the, the fear is natural, healthy. You think I, I need to back away from it? Or do I just,
is it not a, not a cue for backing away, but just something that I need to breathe through and,
and press forward. So I'm just a little confused about how mindfulness of the body helps in that
situation. Yeah, great question. And I think everybody here probably knows something of these
sensations of stage fright. Different things trigger stage fright in different people, of
course, but public speaking is probably right up there at the top. But yeah, bringing attention
to what's really happening in the body, you know, that's the practice. What it leads to is sort of
unknown. And I think we, if we open up to what's happening in the body with the expectation that
discomfort will go away, you know, that may not be, that may not in fact be the, the outcome.
So the opening up to it, sort of whatever's happening, whatever's here and the here and now,
and maybe being agnostic about what the expected outcome is, or the desired outcome,
you know, can be a way to use the practice of mindfulness of the attention directed to the
body. So anyway, that's, that's my thought. There's a wanting of a particular outcome.
And letting go of that wanting, you know, can be served by just being there with what's happening
no matter how uncomfortable it is. Diana, Yang, Kim, Diana. Yeah, maybe I'll add something. And I
just, Nancy, it's fantastic that you're noticing like, wait, there is a physical sensation.
And then there's like a label that gets assigned to it. And even just to notice that distinction is
exactly the direction we're going. And to notice that, oh, sometimes this set of physical sensations
gets a particular label. Sometimes the same set gets a different label. And then it starts to
undermine this idea that the labels are truth or absolutely what's happening. What's happening
is the heart's beating faster, the, I don't know, whatever it might be, be going there. And so just
to notice the distinction between the first step is in a physical sensation. And the second is
assigning a label, because what happens after you assign a label, lots of meaning goes then off we go
into a little bit of a story. It may be a really short story about why am I nervous? Oh, it's okay,
I'm nervous. I shouldn't be nervous. And as a tiny little aside, I'll say that I had a health condition
in which my heart would beat really fast sometimes. And I kept on thinking like, oh, I'm so nervous.
I'm so nervous. But even saying that word, I was nervous, made me more nervous, which just led me
down this whole thing. But then as I noticed like, oh, this is just my heart doing its thing.
Then I just wasn't nervous and didn't make a difference. So the exact same experience with a
different, I'm using a word label, but different understanding or something. So I just offer that
to make that distinction is really powerful and is exactly the direction we're going.
And it's a perfect, it also is a perfect segue to Diana's teaching. And I just want to point out
that these questions really underline how this practice of mindfulness directed the body can
open us up to the most profound teachings in these traditions, including those that,
as Kim pointed out, are uniquely, we're going to move on now, Diana's going to talk about those
that are unique to Buddhist practice that really talk about this particular way of being free,
that these texts give us access to. So Diana. Thank you, David. Well, I'm falling a little bit
like everybody's like, okay, what's Diana going to say the key to everything? Let's see here.
So we'll see how this unfolds. But first, I just want to bring us kind of like zoom out a little
bit to this whole suit done has this lovely beginning where the monks are talking amongst
themselves. And then the Buddha comes and interrupts them and says, what were you guys
talking about? And he does this and a number of different suit does and a number of different
suit does they're talking about different things. So what are they talking about? They're talking
about how it's fantastic that the Buddha knows and teaches that mindfulness of the body,
when developed and cultivated is of great fruit and great benefit.
Great fruit and great benefit. And then when the Buddha hears that this is what they're talking
about, he says, well, mindfulness of the body, when developed and cultivated is of great fruit
and great benefit. And then he gives this whole discourse on kaya-gattasadi sutta,
the mindfulness of the body. So it's in this context of how is it of great fruit and great
benefit. And to, and we see this expression of great fruit and great benefit and a number of
different suit does and a number of different practices. So it's not only mindfulness of the
body, but something that these other practices in the settings, which the Buddha said this,
is always pointing towards awakening is and awakening gets described in different ways.
And so, but there's this, this is how we can understand this great fruit and great benefit
and which makes sense, right? What great maha can also mean like, you know, big, you know,
great, just fantastic, but all means really big. And what's the biggest benefit of practice
awakening? Of course it is. So the whole sutta is given in this context. And, but there's a
number of different places in which the, they're pointing to a little bit indirectly to these
great fruits and great benefits. And some of them, they're embedded with some of these similes.
These are wonderful similes that the sutta is unique and that it has so many of them. And as I
mentioned, for me, I really enjoy having these similes. So in section 22, when describing this
sutta at the very beginning, talking about some of the, still again, and some of the progress
through this mindfulness of the body, Buddha says, anyone who has developed and cultivated
mindfulness of the body, instead of saying a great fruit and great benefit said, has included
within themselves, whatever wholesome states there are. And Bhikha Bodhi says, whatever wholesome
states there are that partake of true knowledge, we could say that conduce to true knowledge.
And true knowledge here is we could understand as awakening. Again, that awakening and knowledge
gets, there's a relationship there to awaken is to have some knowledge, some understanding
that is transformative, completely transformative. And then the simile that goes with us, that says,
just as anyone who has extended their mind over the Great Ocean has included within it
whatever streams there are that flow into the into the ocean.
So whatever wholesome states there are that conduce of true knowledge, so this pointing to
awakening, this practice, the word for true knowledge is Vija. Sometimes it gets just
a knowledge here, but Bhikha Bodhi is throwing in the modifier true knowledge to emphasize
that this is related to awakening. But that's not the only place that it's being pointed to.
Also, again, with these similes. And I'll point out one of these similes that I really
appreciate. This is in section 29. And I'm going to read a little bit of Sujato's translation,
rather than Bhikha Bodhi's, because wow, when I looked at the Pali, I have no idea how to translate
this. It's really complicated. It feels like there may be some corruption there or something like
this. So Bhikha Bodhi does his best he translates it as closely as possible. But Sujato makes
he translates it in a way that's a little bit easier to read, easier to understand. Whereas
the Pali is, it's messy. So here's that here's, I think I, I, the simile I'm doing Bhikha Bodhi and
then the other part of doing Sujato. So section 29, suppose set out on a stand, there were a
water jug full of water right up to the brim, so that crows could drink from it. And when a strong
person tips it, would water come out? Yes, of course, right? This is not a trick question.
And then so the Buddha says, so when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body,
we could say is a great fruit and great benefit. But he says, they become capable of realizing
anything that can be realized by insight, to which they extend the mind in each and every case.
So he's pointing towards awakening, you just extend the mind that direction, create the conditions,
awakening can happen. Okay, so those are some places in which awakening gets pointed to
you in this Sutta. But how does it actually get described in this Sutta? And for that, we can
look at benefits eight, nine and 10. They all, as Kim said, Tevaja, these become like the three
knowledges. Some of you will know that the Buddha in his awakening story, in one version of it,
this is how he became awakened. And it's not how everybody becomes awakened. But apparently,
some people do according to the Sutta and other Suttas, and one version of the Buddha's awakening
includes this. So I'm going to offer one interpretation. There are lots of interpretations
of these knowledges. But I'm going to offer one that's a little bit consistent with how we see
in the in the Suttas. And this includes this idea of rebirth. And just in the same ways with
how Kim talked about supernormal powers, that these ideas about rebirth don't seem to be required
for awakening. And as I mentioned, not everybody who becomes completely awakened has these
experiences about rebirth. But just to, you know, just as Kim did, just to introduce these ideas,
we don't have to be so dismissive of them, but maybe respectful, like, oh, okay, maybe this was
how we might understand it. Okay, so in section 40, is this eighth benefit? One recollects one's
manifold past lives. And then there's any ellipses in the Ambika Bodhis translation and
directs one to go read another suit to get all the details. But what's here is all the aspects
and particulars of one's past lives. So what does that mean aspects and particulars?
One way we might understand this, it's the sense of identity that a person had in their past life,
their name, the name of the family or clan to which one one belonged, the food they ate,
and the pleasure and pain they experienced. If you went back to Majama 51, you would see
that this is the list. So what does this mean? The food one ate represents the kind of lifestyle
they had. The pleasure and pain represents like the highlights and lowlights of their life.
And so that is that this recollection of all these past lives, all these different identities
that a person had, they start to see how they are kind of like constructed. Maybe for example,
a particular name would have been me, me, I have this name me. My family would have been
my family, my clan, and my lifestyle. So this idea that we have this, our identities are associated
with a sense of I, me, and mine. So to see the past lives is to see all these different identities
and that they would have been, they die by all these rebirths actually really means read death.
I think that sometimes is a better way to think about it is this read death. So it didn't matter
what identity that it all got created and passed away, right, this read death. So this and then
another one arose in the next life and went away. So this arising and passing away again and again
and again, like innumerable times, all these identities. So it's a way, one way we might
interpret this knowledge is that there, all these identities are coming and going arising and passing
and there is not a substantial self that's going from one life to the other.
It's just causes and conditions, this identity arises and then it passes away.
But just with this incredible timeframe. And so we start to see that all creating these identities
is futile, it all ends. Death, read death, read death, read death, how many deaths,
amazing number of deaths. So it doesn't matter how many past lives. And maybe it's also to say that
the Buddha, most likely in all these read deaths and lives that so many identities. So it wasn't
like, okay, as soon as I get the right identity, and it's going to stop. No, it just kept on going.
So that's how we might understand the recollecting the past lives, the first knowledge.
The second knowledge, which is also the ninth benefit in this is just like
Satipa Tana practice, for those of you who are familiar with us, that there's this idea that
we contemplate internally and then externally, right, that's part of the refrain. If you don't
know that, that's perfectly fine. But just as he was seeing that all these identities had
oneself, oh, this is something with other people too. It's not unique to the Buddha's past lives.
Everybody, everybody else is doing this too. And not only that, so maybe I'll read the
how it gets described here with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human,
one sees the passing away and reappearing, inferior, superior, fair and ugly, fortunate
and unfortunate. And one understands how beings pass on according to their actions.
So you see other beings are doing the same thing. And it passes on according to their actions.
But it doesn't mean that just because exclusively good actions in one life, you get a good rebirth
and read death. That in fact, it might be that some action that happened in the distant past
shows up in the next life, even though the preceding life was filled with all kinds of
good things. So again, you get dissuaded from this idea like, okay, as long as I live a good life
and only have exclusively good actions, then I'll get have a good rebirth and live happily
thereafter or something like this. But this idea, you kind of get dissuaded from any idea that
any conditions, any actions are going to make a difference in terms of there's going to be this
read death again and again and again. So this disenchantment with what we call samsara, this
rebirth, read death. And we can reinterpret this to all be about, you know, in this present life,
I'm talking about it in past lives, but we could also think about all these psychological moments
right of rebirth and read death. So one way to understand this is that the first knowledge gives
this temporal dimension of the Buddha's realization going back and back through all this time. The
second is maybe this spatial dimension of that there's no refuge. There is no existence in which
you can escape this read death, rebirth, read death, rebirth. And it's with these deep understander
scenes that there is this letting go, this really deep and maybe for us unfathomable letting go
that allows this uprooting of what is traditionally called the taints here,
sometimes also called influxes or effluence or defilements. But this sensuality, I just get
the conditions quite right, the taint of becoming, this taint of ignorance, just this letting go
that happens, it becomes completely awakened. There's no more this underlying trying to find
something else or get the conditions just right or constructing a self that's finally going to be
happy. It's all let go. And this is awakening. This destruction of the taints asavas is the word.
And this is the 10th benefit. This is the third knowledge and some of the descriptions of awakening.
Completely uprooted, never to be seen again, never, not only like temporarily put aside but
uprooted completely. So with that, I'll turn it over to David.
So we want to turn now to a little meditation. And in our notes to ourselves, we've called this an
integrative meditation or a meditation of integration, bringing together the various
things that have come up today. I've tried very hard to not prepare in any way to guide the
meditation, really trying to find out what comes up here and now and maybe illustrate a little bit
for you how flexibly we can find that these instructions presented in 119 fit by the present
moment we find ourselves in. Of course, this will be me providing some guidance, but it may
tap into things that are coming up for you or if nothing else illustrate how it's coming up for me.
Kim and Diana have pointed out how these practices have this amazing power,
this simple practice you could say, we're having talked about it now in very big theoretical terms
to put it in maybe just more mundane terms. That's the wrong term because it has a technical
meaning here, but to put it in just everyday terms, the practice of mindfulness directed
to the body allows us to become comfortable with our discomfort. And this can be from
the lightest of discomfort, a little an itch, some bodily sensations of burning, throbbing,
discomfort to the profoundest to become profoundly comfortable with our most profound
discomforts, our greatest fears, our greatest longings, our greatest unknowings.
So let's bring ourselves to a posture suitable to meditation and sit for really just a few minutes,
maybe allowing ourselves to experience at any level in any way that we find available
comfortable with discomfort, bringing the eyes down perhaps
with the closing of the eyes or resting the eyes, turning our attention inward,
balancing our engagement with the visual sphere and the zoom world with our inner world,
bringing attention to the posture, noticing in our bodies the balance of the body and maybe
making small adjustments to balance ease with curiosity, with energy,
seeking a balance in the body and in mind of relaxed alertness or alert ease,
and then bringing some attention to the breath,
maybe noticing a deep in-breath and out-breath and again adjusting the balance of energy to ease.
And what comes up in this guidance right now here and now is maybe the idea introduced by a question
earlier and maybe in the meditation now which I think I'll leave largely quiet, largely silent,
we can keep leaning, keep inclining the mind if more effort is necessary to keep choosing
a direction of ease, a direction of opening, a direction of lightness.
This takes some gentle activity and intention and even discipline, maybe like mixing tea,
where we keep working for a balance, a balance of enjoying the pleasantness of the meditation,
knowing that that's part of the path, opening to whatever pleasant is available, whatever
or easeful is available,
maybe making note or noticing that there can be some ease even with some discomfort,
maybe there's some busyness of mind, some questions unanswered, some things to do,
something that happened earlier this morning or in childhood,
we can be easeful with what comes up too.
If we find as we may that the mind moves away, attention gets snagged, caught up,
the mind becomes contracted around a thought, a plan, a memory, thoughts of others, thoughts of
ourselves in the world, we can gently guide the intention, our attention back to the body.
Drawing from the instructions of the sutta, we could notice the weight of the body if that's
useful, the stability of the body in this meditation posture, the groundedness of the body
inevitably held to the earth by gravity,
alternatively we could bring attention to the skin, noticing the sensation of air on the skin
and maybe we notice as was observed earlier today in a question that
it's just the sensation of cool or warm on this skin that covers the body.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Perhaps even in this briefest of meditations, there's a sense of
stilling happening, maybe something akin to waiting into a still pod.
As we step deeper in, we become aware of
ourselves steeped and drenched and instilled with the cooler calmer waters into which we
we wait and step down.
As we sit, thoughts become whisper less organized and maybe we can let them drift out around us.
Maybe in the stillness that we sit in,
whatever part of the experience in which stillness is available,
inclining toward that stillness,
maybe there's a gentle undulation of
things coming and going, experience arising and passing away,
sounds coming and going,
the breath coming and going, thoughts coming and going,
the breath, the thoughts, the sounds, our dowers
don't belong to us, don't need us,
and we can let them calm and go.
Again, over to you.
Thank you, David.
So we're coming to an end of our class today. We want to offer another opportunity for any
questions, comments that you may have at this moment. Can you use your Zoom hand?
Now I see Yanquay. Yes.
Hi everybody. I have a question about what Diana was explaining toward the end about the 10 benefits
and I sort of understood the way you were, as if it's a progression, like 7, 8, 9, 10. Initially,
I was reading it as a list could come in any order and so I was just curious about that and
then number nine, I was reading it as like karma was what was important that will pass away according
to one's karma so that actually we could do good karma, we could reap merits and dedicate merits.
But the way you were explaining it, it sounds like you were going on this progression, we were
dissuaded from any good, like oh, it's just awesome, sorry, no matter what happens. We're
going to be having all these multiple lives and until you get so sick of it, then you'll be ready
to let it all go. So I just wanted to feel a comment on that a little bit more. Thank you.
Diana, please. Thank you Yanquay. Yeah, so I would say in the description of the Buddha's
awakening that it is, maybe we'll just say the tradition holds these last three
as a progression and we don't see one without the others. I mean, we see destruction of the
saints without the first two, but if we see the first one, then we see all three. So they come as
kind of a unit and having said that, the order is as we see here, maybe it could be the other way
around that this the way that I'm interpreting it or and I didn't come up with this idea all by
myself, I'm influenced by some of the granolios writing that it could be you see the past lives,
sorry, the past lives of others, the karma and you write the way I did say it, I kind of, I did
emphasize that doesn't matter whether you do good things in the world or not. Maybe I overemphasize
that. The point is that there's a number of sutras that point out that even though, let's say for
example, this life is filled with tremendous, really fantastic wholesome good actions,
there might have been an action that was really bad in the many preceding lives
that influences your next life that comes to fruit. So it doesn't mean that just because you're doing
good karma now means that your next life will be good. And the understanding is we've all done
unskillful actions in past lives. So there will always be like this
opportunity to have experienced the fruits of unwholesome actions of past lives. But
and this is a particular frame, maybe I'll see, you know, we don't have to adopt this frame,
but to see that these earlier knowledges are really to help us lose our enchantment with
samsara, just to help us feel like, okay, there's no way out. There has to be, I can't just make
all the conditions or identities just right. I need there's something else that needs to happen.
So I don't know if Yan Kuei, if that was helpful. Okay, great. Thank you.
And as I say, maybe embedded in that, there is this particular way of organizing this is
in the direction of complete relinquishment, right, relinquishing, letting go.
But embedded in there, in this knowledges, for me, there is also a sense of a deep knowing
and the conditionality. And so also knowing and the actions that it leads to what is beneficial
for oneself and for the world. So there is that aspect of it as well. So it doesn't get excluded,
but it's embedded in this. However, the presentation often can get
highlighted in the direction of letting go and the freedom. Yeah.
So I think I'm going to turn it to Kim, who's going to wrap up the day for us today.
Okay, thank you. Maybe I'll just, I'm just inspired to add one more comment about conditionalities
that, which is the teaching that's being pointed to with these seeing all these lives and
arising and passing and re arising and repassing. So another part of that knowledge that comes is
that there can't be a beginning or an end to all of that. The Buddha talks about from
beginningless time, there has been there have been beginningless rebirths, etc. And so seeing how
conditions operate, it becomes nonsensical that there could be a beginning point before which
there was nothing or an end point within the conditioned world. And that also drives this
sense of looking for something that's not within all of that. And this being said,
the understanding comes also that there are conditions for being able to release and those
conditions are wholesome. So we understand all of that together. Okay, so we are coming to the end
of these regular class type sessions, 830 to 10 sessions today. And then we'll move on to our
a half day of practice on Saturday from 830 to 1230 Pacific time. And I guess I'll just say
that you will get the handout that I showed on the screen if you want to read more about the
supernormal powers and special knowledges if you want to practice any of those before Saturday,
for example. And it'll include the Zoom link, it's the same one we've been at.
And if you want to reread the whole sutra, I guess we keep saying that, but you could. Or
just coast on the practices you've developed so far. And we look forward to seeing you on Saturday
for that somewhat more extended session, which will largely be practice. If you're,
if you need a little teaser, we're going to practice all four postures. So since this is the body,
you will do sitting, standing, walking and lying down, you don't always get instruction and all
those four kinds of meditation. So that might be of interest for some of you. All right, so
see you soon. Have a wonderful couple of days. Take care, everyone.
