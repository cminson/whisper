 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, hello everyone and welcome. And... One of the ways that the Buddha talks about realization or about the depths of possibility in this practice is that it's something to be known and experienced through the body. And the emphasis on embodiment or the body is quite strong in these early teachings of Buddhism. And so we begin with our body and taking, assuming a bodily posture that might support bodily awareness. A process of coming maybe home to your body or settling into your physical experience here and now. I think of our physical experience as adding the full dimensionality to our life. We live in our thoughts only. It's like living in two dimensions and with the body it becomes three dimensions maybe. Something like that. So, assuming the meditation posture that you for this period of time and gently closing your eyes and attuning yourself to your body. Kind of like us from the inside out. Not from your mind, so much as thinking about it, but feeling and sensing. And there can be an intimacy in sensing and feeling our bodily experience. And maybe this allowing ourselves to feel and sense the body. It's a little bit like someone putting a gentle hand on your shoulder, reassuring hand or loving hand. That's something reassuring and of making that connection with our body, touching it and being touched. And then from the depths of your body, whatever that means, deep inside, gently arising from that depth. A deep, deep, full inhale. Stretching outwards into the ribcage, the shoulders, kind of a stretching and expanding of the torso. And as you exhale, a settling, a calming, a returning to the depths within. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And to relax your body on the exhale, relaxing the face, softening the shoulders. Softening the belly. And then settling in now to the body's experience of breathing. As if in this body of yours, you will find the path of meditation. You will find the path for where to place your attention. Where awareness can be awakened in the body, breathing mindfully. Feeling the vitality, the aliveness of the physical body, the hum of the body's aliveness. And to relax and settle more deeply into an embodiment of the body. Here, body's always in the present moment. Here in this body, gently, quietly. Feeling the embodiment of the body breathing. Just here, body breathing. Letting go of your thoughts. Maybe sometimes letting go of whatever you're thinking every time you exhale. Letting go of thoughts and letting go into the body. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Letting go of your thoughts and less navigating from your mind, but more navigating meditation through your body. Awakening capacity to be present with your body. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. And as we come to the end of the sitting, the more we are connected to our body, the more likely we are to be close to the source of love within. And what would it be like to let yourself become quiet and still so that the place of tender care and love and kindness is something that you can feel more connected to, allowing something to settle and let go and feel the place within where there can be a warm regard for others, where there can be a generosity of heart, a willingness and capacity to appreciate other beings. And from this place, perhaps, to intentionally conclude your meditation with a wish for the welfare and happiness of others. May it be that others can be happy. May it be that others can feel safe. May it be that others can experience peace, and know a peaceful life. And may it be that others could wake up to freedom, to experience the heart free and unfettered. May the benefit and goodness of this meditation this day, may those benefits be shared widely to the welfare and happiness of all beings. May all beings be happy and free.
