Mindfulness and Precepts

Here in the West , it’s possible  and very easy  to receive 
mindfulness instructions cold . By that I mean that,  
without  preparation of any kind, you can come to IMC or 
other places and receive  teachings on mindfulness . And 
many people find this very beneficial in their lives . 
 
Traditionally, however, in Theravada  Buddhism, 
mindfulness isn’t offered by itself , but rather is offered 
together with other teachings that  are considered 
foundation al. One important foundation  for mindfulness 
is ethical behavior. M indfulness is built upon being 
careful with your behavior . Often, t he simple st way to 
talk about it is to talk about the precepts. T he prece pts 
are not a requirement or  something  puritanical , but are 
seen as a foundation, a support , for being able to do the 
practice of mindfulness . So, if you are a lay person, 
sometimes even before you’ve learned to do 
mindfu lness , care is given to emphasize looking at your 
behavior , and see ing if there are ways to align your 
behavior more with the five precepts .  
 The first precept is  usually  translated as not to kill , 
which is probably just fine . But the literal translation 
would be not to hit anything that breathes , or not to 
harm anything that breath es. I guess p lants , breathe , 
but I think the idea  here is breathing with lungs . So not 
to harm  is a higher order than not to kill , and  is more 
inclusive.  
 
The second precept is not to take what  is not given . 
This differs from  not steal ing in that unless something is 
clearly offered , you don’t take it , even though it  may not 
necessarily stealing.  
 
The third precept is not to engage in sexual 
misconduct . This connect s to the first precept  not to 
harm , which  is the basic principle for  all of  the precepts . 
This means not to engage in sexual conduct that 
causes any harm to any one – neither to those  parties  
directly involved , nor to those  indirectly involved.  
 
The fourth is not to be involved in false speech . 
Perhaps false speech is a little  broader than just not to 
lie.   
 
And then the fifth  one is not to intoxicate the mind , not 
to be involved in altering your mind state  by intoxicating 
it.  
 
There’s a wonderful mutuality between aligning yourself – living by these five precepts – and being mindful . 
Generally , if people ar e going to break or violate the 
precepts, they do so with a  lot of mindlessness – there 
is something the y are not paying attention to. For 
example, being mindless of the impact o f your behavior, 
and of the people who are affected . If you really took in 
how you are hurting someone, how y ou are betraying 
someone , and you really understood that, then you 
probably wouldn’t violate the precepts . So, if you want 
to live by the precepts , then it’s more likely you’re not 
going to be mindless in that way.   
 
One way that  the precepts have this mutual relationship 
with mindfulness practice is that since  you now have a 
limitation on what you can do , that limitation becomes a 
mirror to help you see yourself better . If you have no 
restrict ions in your life ( no precepts at all ), you can just  
act on e very impulse you have , and not  really see 
yourself . If you have an unfettered ability to do 
something , you don’t really see what’s motivating you , 
or what beliefs and attachments are  involved . You can 
be very , very attached to something; but  because it’s 
easy to fulfill what yo u are attached to , you don’t even 
see that you’re attached. However,  if you can’t fulfill 
your attachment , then the frustration shows you, “ I didn’t 
realize I was so attached.”   
 
I’m sure none of you are at tached to your computers or 
the Internet (if you d o have computers and access to the Internet ). It’s as easy as breathing these days.  I’m 
sure it’s just an ordinary part of life , and you’re not 
attached at all . But if the electricity go es out for three 
days , or the Internet go es down , or your computer go es 
down , you can probably feel the  frustration, the 
momentum, the desire, the wanting that’s there . 
 
Part of the function of the precepts is to create a 
limitation on the unfettered ability to do whatever you 
want to do . You may find yo urself about to lie, or to 
exaggerate, or to not speak the truth in one  way or 
another. Or you are about to take a pencil from work; no 
one has offered the pencil , but you’re  about to take it. 
But because you have this precept, you don’t .  
 
Or a mosquito c omes into your house  [claps as though 
killing a mosquito] . You could easily just squash it and  
be finished with the mosquito. But b ecause of the 
precept not to kill , you say, “ Oh, I can’t do that. I  can’t 
just swat the mosquito.” T hat inability to s wat the 
mosquito because of the  restriction  of the precepts  then 
becomes an opportunity to look at what motivates  you. 
What’s going on for you that you want to kill the 
mosquito? Is it fear? Disgust? Annoy ance? Impatience 
with other approache s where you’d carefully catch the 
mosquito in a net and take it outside?  I used to go 
around and catch mosquitoes using  the cup  of my two 
hands, and then I’d ask someone to open the door so I 
could release them outside because I didn’t want to kill them.  
 
Or the pencil at work . No one has  offered you the 
pencil , so w hat’s motivating you to take the pe ncil? Is it 
really innocent? What are the feelings, the motivations, 
the sense of self  going on now that  you are not  going to 
take what’s not given?   
 
Or I find myself wanting to exaggerate. I t can be as 
simple as telling someone, “ I ate at the best Thai 
restaurant in the world. This is the best Thai restaurant , 
you know.” I t’s kind of a colloquial way of saying it was 
really great . But it is an exaggeration. It can’t possibly 
be true . What kind of a statement is it? So if I have this 
precept not to lie , it becomes a reminder to be mo re 
careful when I speak. What motivates  me to exaggera te 
about the restaurant? Sometimes I’ve seen  in myself  
that I’ve exaggerated , not because I t hought they 
needed to know this was the best restaurant ever , but 
rather because by saying that I ate at the best 
restaurant , it’s kind of like advertising  myself . Look at 
me. I had this great experience. I was able  to choose 
the best restaurant. I know something that you don’t 
know . Actually i t wasn’t so innoc ent. So now I ha ve to 
look at what’s going on.   
 
The precepts operate as a mirror , and this  become s 
interesting when you’re going to transgress against the 
precepts . It isn’t necessarily that you are now a bad person . But it becomes an opportunity for you to look at 
yourself more deeply . And i f you look at yourse lf more 
deeply, chances are that you will  see that it’s not in your 
best interest to behave in those ways  – that you’re 
losing touch with some inner sense of peace, well 
being, freedom, compassion  – something that’s actually 
quite valuable.  
 
The mutuality of mindfulness and precepts also works 
the other way . That is , as people do mindfulness 
meditation practice and feel better about themselves, 
and feel a certain depth of peace, well -being, love, 
compassion, o r no longer being caught by things , then 
this becomes a reference point for not w anting to give 
that up . You see yourself  in another way . You have this 
deep appreciation for another way of living .  
 
Generally when people break the precepts , they’re not 
so peaceful  – they’re not so settled in themselves . It’s 
much easier  to violate the precepts when you’re 
stressed out, caught up, angry , or filled with greed. 
When those things are not there and you feel better 
about yourself , then that becomes a support to  live 
ethically.  
 
In fact , it’s said that at some point when someone is 
deeply mature in their practice , they  don’t need the 
precepts anymore . Not because they can now do 
whatever they want and harm people . They don’t need them because there’s no inclin ation to do those things 
anymore, due to their deep sense of inner contentm ent, 
well being , and peace.  
 
And then the other direction in mutuality from precepts 
to mindfulness is that unethical behavior tends to 
promote agitation . If you a re agitated , it’s harder to be 
mindful and  settled for the mindfulness practice . So to 
live b y the precepts is a protection and a support for the 
practice of mindfulness, peace, and freedom . And the 
practice of mindfulness is a support for the precepts . 
The two go hand in hand.  
 
A classical  Buddhis t would be equally interested in both , 
as they live  life and try to b ring mindfulness into it. 
People  often ask, “ How do I integrate mindfulness into 
my life?” and the way is to have a heightened interest in 
ethics and ethical behavior.  
 
I’m confident that all of you are conventionally quite 
ethical . So the n the  opportunity is to be more subtle or 
more nuanced in how yo u understand the precepts and 
apply them in your life  – not in a moralistic, puritanical, 
judgmental , or even obligatory way  – but in  a way that  
support s you in your practice and  in your life.
