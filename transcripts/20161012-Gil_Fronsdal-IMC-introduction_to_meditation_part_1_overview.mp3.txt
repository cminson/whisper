Welcome, and now to IMC. 
My name is Gil Fronsdal, and since people are still coming in, I'll start kind of slowly with what's least important. 
But one thing I should say is that if you have trouble hearing, there's hearing system devices. 
There's on the counter, just around the wall there, there's these little devices that Kate's holding up. 
And sometimes I say the most profound things in a quiet voice. 
So if you have trouble hearing now, you might want to use one of those. 
And so my name is Gil Fronsdal, and I'm one of the two primary teachers here at IMC. 
And I've been part of this community, meditation community, for 26 years now. 
Started in 1990. 
The group preceded me, started about 1986 or so. 
And then when I came to the area to study at Stanford, I came to study Buddhist studies, religious studies, specialty in Buddhism. 
By that time, I'd spent over 10 years of my life in Buddhist monasteries and meditation centers. 
And so I was asked to take leadership of the small group that then slowly grew. 
When I came, it was in Palo Alto, and then it slowly grew. 
In 2001, we bought this building here and moved in in 2002, and we've been here ever since. 
And it's been a remarkable journey. 
I never thought I'd be in the area. 
It wasn't my plan. 
But it's been such a remarkable opportunity, such a remarkable good fortune to be able to teach mindfulness, teach meditation, teach Buddhism to a large group of people who have come through here and have an audience for this and share this with. 
This is wonderful. 
One of the favorite things I like to do is to teach this intro class. 
And even though I've taught it many times before, I'm sharing something that I love deeply, something that I find tremendous value in, and something that I think one of the reasons I don't tire giving the intro class is that I continue to find new gems, new treasures in the practice of mindfulness. 
Even though I've been doing it now for 40 years, it just seems to still come alive and open up and become richer and richer for me. 
So I love sharing that. 
And partly giving this intro class is also a time for me to kind of discover something new about mindfulness. 
I'm always hoping to surprise myself when I give this class that something about what I've internalized or understood will come out in a new way. 
So we'll see how it goes this time around. 
And the way that this class's five-part series is offered, it's an introduction to mindfulness meditation both as a basic skill that can be used in meditation, but also the idea of all the ideas that I teach in meditation apply pretty much equally with daily life. 
And as many of us know, mindfulness now has gotten quite popular. 
When I started teaching it, very few people knew about it. 
And now, you know, it's just everywhere. 
And so I'm very happy about that. 
I'm very happy to offer the mindfulness teaching to stand alone by itself, something applicable in our daily life. 
But it is a Buddhist practice. 
IMC is a Buddhist center. 
And so you'll probably get periodically, as I teach, some references to Buddhism or the Buddha. 
And if that's not to your liking, you can just leave that part out. 
It's offered optionally. 
I think the mindfulness practice itself is quite effective and powerful. 
And mindfulness does not need Buddhism whatsoever, but Buddhism needs mindfulness. 
So for me, the two come together somewhat. 
And then as mindfulness develops, especially in the Buddhist context, it develops into what's called insight. 
So mindfulness is very simply the ability to see clearly. 
And as we start seeing more and more clearly, then we have insight. 
And so we're the insight meditation center. 
So one of the names for what we do is not mindfulness meditation, but it's insight meditation, because the insight is the consequence of developing mindfulness. 
And I'll talk more about that in the last class, the insight part. 
So mindfulness uses a very simple capacity that each of us has, the capacity to be aware, to pay attention. 
And it's perhaps a little bit of an irony that I ended up being a mindfulness teacher, given how often my mother told me as I was growing up, give, pay attention. 
And so now, you know, I'm making up for it now. 
And so it's a simple capacity. 
There's nothing particular mystical or Buddhistic about attention. 
And what we're doing is taking something we all have and use all the time, kind of constantly, and developing it so becomes a conscious part of our life, so that it becomes stronger. 
And so it becomes a strength that we bring with us, the strength of being present in our lives, the strength of being clearly aware as we go through our lives, and the strength of being able to see what's actually happening on deeper levels than we can if we're on the surface of our life or not really paying attention. 
One of the reasons why many people in the modern world like mindfulness is the way it helps to destress us. 
And it's very helpful to bring calm. 
It's helpful to deal with a lot of stress, helpful to deal with certain pains, even certain illnesses they say now. 
There's a lot of clinical studies about the value of mindfulness for all kinds of health reasons. 
I don't like, as a Buddhist teacher, I don't like to say much about the health benefit of mindfulness because I'm not qualified, but what I can say is that maybe mindfulness won't help any of your ills, perhaps, but it'll make you much more at ease in having your ills. 
And you'll find a way of coming to terms with it, come reconciliation or some kind of heart or psychological healing in relationship to some of the physical things that might be going on or some of the psychological challenges you have. 
We learn to shift our relationship to many of the challenges we have in our lives, and so the challenges, they exist as events, but they're no longer our challenges. 
They're just something we can hold in a very open, compassionate, clear heart, and we're not struggling with them or fighting with it. 
And in the Buddhist context, mindfulness is the key practice that leads to awakening, to liberation, spiritual freedom. 
And that spiritual freedom in Buddhism is defined by a heart that is not constricted or limited by anything. 
And so that kind of unrestricted, unshackled mind is one of the definitions of liberation. 
You don't have to be interested in that, but I just wanted to mention that it's quite powerful the practice of mindfulness if you get into it, if you kind of are applying it in your life. 
You'll find many, many benefits, and it would be great if, like me, after 40 years, you're still finding the benefits, still finding it coming alive and supportive of your life. 
So what we'll do here for these five weeks is I'll give you instructions for mindfulness meditation. 
As I said, many things I'll say are applicable outside of meditation as well. 
So the line between meditation outside is pretty porous, pretty open. 
But the focus kind of will be on meditation, and the instructions will be given sequentially. 
So each week will be a foundation for the next week, and it'll grow like that as we go along. 
And the goal is to have some sense of how to be mindful, how to be aware in an effective way, useful way, in all areas of our life so that no areas of our life are left out where we can bring this clear, non-reactive attention to. 
But it's too much to say, okay, just be aware of everything. 
That just leaves people confused. 
So what works better is to do it step by step. 
And so today we're going to talk about mindfulness of breathing, the basic kind of structure of meditation practice, the posture you have, the basic approach, the attitude, and the very basic instructions of beginning with the breathing. 
And then next week, kind of like concentric circles maybe, next week we expand out to include the body. 
And it turns out in Buddhism that being embodied is really important. 
So that really kind of feeling and sensing and living in your body rather than disconnected is the avenue for how awareness develops. 
Many people associate awareness with maybe with the mind and the intellect, paying attention. 
But in the sense that the deeper or the fuller awareness we can develop, fuller mindfulness, is almost a kind of bodyfulness that the awareness kind of radiates or comes out of our whole being, not just from the control tower in the head. 
And then the third week, building on that, I'll talk about mindfulness of emotions. 
Emotions are a very important part of our life. 
And some of them are quite difficult for people. 
And there's a lot of beauty in our emotions. 
And it's wonderful to learn how to bring mindfulness to it. 
Turns out it's easier to be mindful of emotions if you know how to be mindful of the body. 
So that's why it follows. 
And then the fourth week we'll do mindfulness of thinking. 
Thinking is an important part of life. 
It can't do without it. 
But a lot of thinking that we do is sometimes unproductive and sometimes it's actually counterproductive for our lives. 
And so to get a handle on this inner world of thoughts that goes on for us is really helpful in many, many ways and certainly can reduce a lot of stress if you have a wise relationship to your thoughts. 
Turns out it's a lot easier to pay attention to thoughts if you know how to be mindful of emotions. 
It's a lot easier to pay attention to emotions if you know how to be mindful of the body. 
It's a lot easier to be mindful of the body if you know how to be mindful of your breathing. 
So it's a very nice kind of process of kind of going like this. 
And then the fifth week I'll talk much more about bringing this whole practice into daily life, how it develops insight, and some of the ways of continuing with the practice. 
So that's the plan of how it's going to go. 
Usually these talks are recorded, so it means that you can listen to it again. 
Or if you miss a class, you can listen to it that way. 
Also, previous of these courses are online, and you can listen to past courses too. 
You can listen ahead, you know, and then compare what I say here with what I said in the previous class. 
And you'll find that through IMC's website on the menu there's a link to what's called audiodharma. 
So today I talked to someone who has been doing mindfulness for a while, and he said that discovering mindfulness was something like one of the first times in his life where he discovered how to be non-judgmental to himself, how to hold himself in a non-judgmental way, and that mindfulness was kind of one of these practices that you can't do wrong. 
So in that combination of a practice that doesn't judge you, holds you in non-judgmental ways, and you can't do wrong, I mean, what can you do wrong then? And that's very important to say at the onset, because many people, when they start doing meditation, will conclude that it's really hard, because you set yourself at a task to be present, to be in the present moment, and the mind doesn't want to be present. 
Or all kinds of thoughts, storms come up, or emotional feelings come up, and there's a swirl in there, and it's kind of hard to stay present and not be pulled off into the swirl. 
But that's to be expected, and it's not a problem that it happens. 
It just means that the practice kind of begins with that. 
And the idea that we can always start to practice fresh any moment. 
The mindfulness doesn't carry with it what happened five minutes ago or one minute ago. 
So you might carry with you, oh, I did really badly before, or I did great five minutes ago, and I'm going to do that again, or that was terrible, and I should never meditate again. 
This idea of carrying the past with you into the present is just a burden. 
And so this non-reactive, open, very forgiving or accepting practice of mindfulness is ready to receive you and hold you fresh as you are each moment. 
So what happened five seconds ago is not that important. 
What's important is now you have a chance to connect, to be mindful, to be aware of what's now. 
So mindfulness is the practice of bringing careful attention, of bringing attention to whatever is happening in the present moment. 
In such a way that as we're present, we're not being pushed around by experience. 
We're not caught in them. 
We're not grabbing onto things. 
We're not running away. 
We're not getting lost in fantasy or distractions. 
We're learning to stay present. 
As we learn to stay present with our awareness in the present moment, a lot of the forces of stress that we have begin to dissipate because a lot of the stress we carry with us, a lot of the tension we carry along have a lot to do with what we're thinking about in our preoccupations and concerns. 
A lot of the emotions that are stressful often have a lot to do with our concerns, our preoccupations with the past, about the future, about fantasy, about all kinds of things, that usually things which are not present here and now. 
So as we learn not to kind of be caught in those but be present here for what's here, a lot of that stress begins to kind of fall off and fall away. 
And it's fairly common for people who get a hang of how to do this to find that it's very calming in their life. 
And then they can bring that calm with them into their lives. 
So the way that. 
. 
. 
So we're going to talk about meditation. 
And so the basic elements of meditation, and then we'll do a little bit. 
And each time we come here, we'll do one or two short sessions of meditation. 
So you get a hang and feel of it, or how to do it. 
And certainly it's my hope that during these five weeks, that you would do some of this meditation practice at home during the week. 
You don't have to. 
I think there are many people who come to this intro class who don't meditate whatsoever, maybe never, except when they come here. 
But there's a lot of wisdom teachings that I'll be offering you, wise understandings of your life and what goes on in different parts of your life. 
That some people take those wisdom teachings and they can use them as they go through their lives. 
However, if you meditate every day for these five weeks at home, you'll understand so much better what I'm teaching. 
You'll start kind of making it your own. 
And you can build on the instructions much better. 
So whether you do or not is up to you, but I'd encourage you to because I think you'll just get more out of this in that way. 
So to start with meditation, I like to talk about posture. 
Because as I say in AA, bring your body and the mind will follow. 
So you want to bring your body into the present moment. 
So your body is a real support. 
I was once on a retreat and I was pretty mindful. 
Very present, mindful. 
I was actually quite satisfied, but I was doing pretty well. 
And then after some time, I thought, you know, I've been sitting meditating like this for days on end now. 
I think it's probably good for my body if I went and just meditated in a more restful posture. 
So the retreat center had a very nice couch. 
So I leaned back into the couch, soft couch. 
It was great. 
And that turned out to be the fastest meditation I've ever gone through. 
Because as soon as I leaned back in, I felt asleep. 
And then when I didn't wake up until the bell rang. 
So you want to have a posture that supports you to be alert, but also allows you to relax. 
And there have been physiological studies about what posture helps people relax the most deeply. 
And the two apparently most relaxing postures to be in is in the corpse posture and yoga. 
And the cross-legged lotus posture sitting upright like this. 
There's something about the balanced spine, the aligned body that allows the musculature to relax very deeply. 
I think it's even deeper if you can be self-supporting with your back than if you're using a backrest. 
You would think, you know, by intuitively using a backrest is more relaxing. 
And the short term might be, but to avail yourself of some of the deeper capacity of letting go is sometimes easier to do it if you're self-supporting upright. 
So the idea is to have a posture that's intentional for intending to be present in here. 
So I'm going to talk a little bit about sitting on the cross-legged, and then I'll sit talk about sitting on the chair. 
You're welcome to do either one. 
The classic one in Buddhism is like the Buddha is to sit cross-legged on the floor. 
And Buddhist mythology or lore says that the next Buddha that's going to come along is going to be sitting in a chair. 
So if you're a chair-sitter, you'll be in good company. 
So if you're sitting on the floor, I actually recommend you don't actually sit cross-legged, but rather keep one leg in front of the other. 
Sometimes it's called tailor fashion. 
Sometimes it's called Burmese fashion. 
And the reason for not physically crossing your legs is that it puts a lot of torque on the knees or the ankles. 
And unless you're very open in the hips, that most people it puts an undue strain on the legs, and then you have to deal with the strain as you're sitting there. 
And this is actually also sitting this way is more balanced. 
As soon as you put your one foot up like this, like half float, it's nice to sit this way. 
But it stretches one side of the body more than the other. 
It's not quite as balanced. 
So to sit this tailor fashion is quite nice for people who can do it. 
And the idea is to sit on a cushion. 
So you're elevated. 
The more elevated your body is, the easier it is to get your knees down. 
And ideally your knees would be on the ground. 
And so you have to kind of experiment with getting the right height. 
People who are tight in the hips generally have to sit higher. 
People who are very loose and open can sit lower. 
And so we have lots of cushions and later on you can experiment with different heights and see what works for you. 
If you can't get your knees down, then you can get something, some other pillow, and put underneath them so they're supported. 
One on each side if you need to. 
And that way they're not being stretched unduly. 
And the usual way we have is to sit on these round cushions. 
And you kind of sit on the front third of them. 
But there's other ways of sitting too. 
There's what's called the half moon or the crescent moon pillow. 
I think you have one that you hold it up there, that great green one. 
So you see. 
And some people find that works really nicely because it spreads the weight of your bottom and then broad kind of way down to your legs. 
So people find it's kind of nicer to do that. 
It's also possible to sit on the floor but do so on your knees. 
And if you take one of these round cushions and put it upright like this, you can put it between your feet and then sit down like that. 
And for people who can't sit cross-legged, this allows them to be low. 
And one of the advantages of sitting cross-legged on the floor or sitting this way is your center of gravity is low. 
Cross-legged it's even lower. 
And the lower the center of gravity, the lower your kind of masses, the easier it is to kind of let go and relax. 
So there's some kind of physical benefits in sitting this way. 
And then if an alternative to this is the bench. 
And Tom, can you hold up the bench for people? We have a whole bunch of benches and that little cubby hole there. 
And so you would sit on that. 
And it goes above your lower legs and then you sit. 
That's nice for some people. 
And then if you're sitting on the chair, what you want to do with your lower half of your body is to sit in such a way that your feet are planted on the floor or on some kind of support. 
And your legs would not be crossed. 
So there's more intentional and clear and strength if you're kind of both down, firmly down. 
And the classic instruction is to have the legs more or less parallel to each other. 
Ideally with the knees slightly lower than the hips. 
If the knees are higher than the hips, it pushes out the lower back and that can put a strain over time. 
And we have a variety of cushions that you can use, including some firm foam cushions, I think. 
Anyway, to put under your feet, if your feet don't reach the ground, that's a little different thing. 
But anyway, you want to have some support if you need to. 
And if you are tall and want to sit in the chair, then there's various support cushions that you can put. 
Tom has a wedge. 
It's one option that you can use, but other cushions to get some height for you. 
Some people like to sit on a chair to have their legs out wide, to have a wide space of support. 
And that also can work well. 
Either way, whether you're sitting on the floor or sitting in a chair, an interesting thing to do is to take your hands on either side of your hips and push yourself off the chair, off the floor or the cushion. 
And so you're lifting your chest up, lifting yourself almost off the cushion and chair. 
And then as you let go of your arms, let your shoulders roll back. 
If you do that, you probably feel more open in the chest and your shoulders roll back. 
And it makes it easier to breathe. 
And it's a more alert posture to sit in. 
With your hands, you can do anything where they're basically doing the same thing. 
I usually meditate with my hands face down, close to my knees. 
Some people do it face up. 
The classic way is to have the hands together, one on top of the other, in front of you. 
So it makes kind of like a nice circle here. 
And whatever is comfortable for you, but what you want to be careful for is that how you're positioning your hands is not pulling your shoulders forward. 
And so if you have your hands all the way down on your ankles like this, it might have a strong ball tendency to start pulling you forward. 
Or if you have your hands too far forward over the edge of your knees, it might also kind of pull you forward. 
And so you want to have your hands pulled back a little bit so that the elbows are kind of lined up with the edge of your rib cage here. 
Or if you have your hands together in front of you, you can put something like this to support them. 
And so they're held up a little bit. 
This may be a little bit less tendency to collapse. 
And then some people will have a lot of tension in their shoulders. 
Nowadays, especially with computers and the way people live, there's a lot of being held up a lot. 
And so that tension can show itself when we're sitting this way. 
And sometimes it's a little trick to alleviate some of that and kind of get the alignment better for the shoulders. 
Is to take one shoulder up to your ear. 
And then while it's still up, you stretch your arm forward as far as you can. 
And then a big circle up to the ceiling and then around with a hand pointing towards the ceiling and put it back on your thigh. 
And if you do that, you might find this shoulder that you used to do a little more open and relaxed and kind of rotating back. 
So the trick is to first bring the shoulder up and then, well, it's up forward and then all the way around. 
And any of these things that helps you kind of be more open and upright supports being attentive, being alert. 
Your body is kind of being alert. 
Then you want to have your head squarely on your shoulders. 
And where else would it be? The head is actually fairly heavy. 
And so if you're not lined up, kind of on the center of gravity there, so you're leaning forward, your muscles have to hold you up all that weight. 
And if you do that for a long time, the muscles in your neck and back get tired. 
But if you can keep your head aligned properly on the spine, then the musculature, the tendons, the bones will keep it kind of much easier. 
Some people will turn their head. 
Some people will tip their chin up. 
Some people are looking down. 
All these puts a build a strain over time and limits, it kind of physically limits how easy it is to develop a balanced open mindfulness. 
So you want to kind of make sure your head is balanced. 
And one way to do it is you try your best and then is to, at some point during meditation, is to open your eyes and see where you're looking. 
And if you're looking at the ceiling, that probably means you're tipped up too much. 
If you're looking at your ankle, or if you're looking over to the side, it shows you you're not quite lined up. 
And in our tradition of meditation, we usually instruct people to close their eyes in meditation. 
It's optional. 
And actually some of our colleagues will teach people to keep their eyes open slightly. 
And our schools of Buddhism emphasize open eye meditation. 
If it's equal to you, then I encourage you to close your eyes. 
If you prefer keeping your eyes open, it's fine. 
The instructions then are to keep your eyes kind of half open, looking down at about 45 degrees, with the kind of focus you'd use to look at a mountain far in the distance. 
So you're not really looking at anything. 
You're just kind of, you know, just loose, relaxed focus and eyes are open. 
So those are the basic elements of meditation posture. 
One little warning about it, if you're especially sitting this way, sometimes that the leg, if you're not used to it, will go numb and fall asleep. 
And generally that's fine. 
It's not dangerous unless you stand up too quickly. 
Once in my career, and I heard about a woman who stood up too quickly when her leg fell asleep, and she fell, and she broke one little bone in her foot. 
So if your leg goes asleep, make sure you massage it first or shake it or something, and don't get up until you have your sensation back. 
Very rarely, if the feet go numb, and it takes more than three or four minutes for the sensations to come back, then the chances are that you're pinching a nerve, and you're not interfering with the blood flow. 
And you never want to pinch a nerve. 
So if it takes that long for the sensation to come back, then when you go to meditate next time, be very careful you don't sit in that way again. 
Be very careful that kind of numbness doesn't build up. 
You know, change your posture, do something to stop from happening. 
You can make lasting damage if you don't move. 
In our kind of mindfulness tradition where we're trained to pay careful attention, I've never known anyone to have this particular form of damage, but in other schools of Buddhist meditation I've practiced in where the focus was not so much on being mindful but on being concentrated. 
So you're really focusing on one thing and ignoring everything else. 
There I've known people who've damaged themselves and caused psychiatric problems or nerve damage, some kind. 
So it's rare, very rare, but it's worth telling you about. 
So those are the basics about posture. 
So in a few minutes we'll do our first meditation session. 
Do you have any questions about the posture before we start? Or what I said, yes? I was wondering if you're in a chair, do you recommend resting your back? Yes. 
Great. 
So if you're in a chair, if your body allows it, ideally you wouldn't use the backrest, you would sit away from the backrest so you can have the benefits of being upright. 
Some people have to use a backrest and that's fine if that's the case. 
If you have to use it, the best way to get is to have support really low down. 
If you get really strong support, firm support and lower spine, then the upper spine can be self-supporting. 
Another thing, some people feel that some people need to have full support the whole length of their back. 
And the interesting thing to do then is to take some kind of like a towel or some kind of, you know, a coil or kind of cylinder and put it down vertically along the spine and then lean against it this way so that it pushes your spine in and your shoulder blades go back, opens your chest a little bit and that can make you feel more alert if that works for some people. 
And then there's all kinds of variations of how to sit and meditate. 
So people have all kinds of conditions with their body and so there's lots of different ideas of how to support different body conditions so you can come and talk to me and I can make other advice. 
My co-teacher who I teach with, Andrea Fella, she does a fair amount of her meditation lying down because she has back problems. 
And so she's been a very successful meditator lying down. 
Some people do a lot of meditations standing up. 
So there's all kinds of ways of doing it. 
So if you have trouble with any of the posture that I've told you now, let me know and we can talk about it. 
So we'll take just a minute to stand and stretch. 
If some of you sitting in chairs want to try sitting on the floor, get a cushion and then I will do our first meditation. 
So the core of mindfulness meditation is to notice what's happening. 
And if you notice that you're not present, you're doing the practice at that moment. 
If you're not present, if you're lost in thought, really lost, then you don't have a problem because you're lost. 
But once you notice that you are lost, there's still no problem because now you're present. 
So if you have enough presence of mind to be critical of yourself because you weren't doing it right and you can't do it, you think, if you have enough presence of mind to notice that it's not going well, you have enough presence of mind to do this practice, just to be present and notice what's happening. 
Oh, it's like this. 
Oh, it's like this now. 
My mind is racing. 
My mind is sleepy. 
My mind is distracted. 
And if you just notice that, that's really all it is. 
But in a heightened way, a clear way. 
Now, to help with this, it's really good to settle down, to develop some calm and stability in the mind. 
And one of the classic ways of doing that is to do meditation on breathing. 
Breathing is one of the great tools for calming down and centering the mind and supporting the mind to let go of all its concerns, it has all its thoughts, and kind of arrive and be here in the present moment. 
And so we'll start with meditation on breathing. 
But remember, even though the focus now is on breathing, if you can't stay with your breathing, the practice is to notice what's happening. 
So if you are successful at staying with the breath, great. 
You're doing it well. 
If you can't stay with the breath, but you notice that you can't, great. 
You're doing it well. 
You can't do it wrong, okay? And then we do it again. 
Notice again, and then we do it again. 
And this continual doing it again is kind of the art of mindfulness. 
So taking a posture that is alert and calm. 
And that means usually sitting a little bit straighter with your spine than you normally would. 
And then gently closing your eyes. 
And then beginning by taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. 
And as you breathe in deeply, feel your rib cage stretch and expand. 
And as you exhale, feel the torso, the rib cage relax and release and settle in. 
And then let your breathing return to normal. 
And then spend a few moments scanning through your body to see if there's any obvious places that you can relax. 
So you might start with your forehead and eyes. 
And as you exhale, to soften, relax your forehead, your eyes. 
There's nothing you need to be looking at when you meditate so the eyes can rest. 
It might be possible to soften and relax around the shoulders, shoulder blade area. 
As you exhale, relaxing the shoulders. 
It might be possible to relax the belly, soft belly, belly hangs forward. 
The belly drops down towards the pelvic cavity. 
And then as you exhale, see if you can relax all the other parts of your body. 
Your body globally can soften. 
And then within the body, this part of your bodily experience, notice how the body experiences breathing. 
Notice what parts of your body move as you're breathing. 
Parts of your body are engaged with breathing. 
And then bring your attention to that part of your body where breathing is most compelling. 
So it could be the experience of the belly rising and falling. 
Or the chest rising and falling. 
Or the sensation of air that goes in and out through your nostrils. 
Or it could be that you're aware of the full breath body. 
So let yourself be present for where breathing is easiest to experience or most compelling. 
And then notice the rhythm of breathing. 
The coming and goings of the in breath, the out breath. 
The alternation of breathing in and breathing out. 
And feeling the physical texture or sensations as you exhale. 
The movement of the chest or the belly or the hair in the nostrils. 
If you have trouble finding the sensations of breathing in your body, you can put your hand on your chest or on your belly. 
And you might feel the movements better that way. 
So let yourself be present for where breathing is easiest to experience or most compelling. 
So let yourself be present for where breathing is easiest to experience or most compelling. 
And each time you exhale, let go of the thoughts that have arisen. 
For the end of the exhale, let your thoughts fade away, float away like thought bubbles. 
So let yourself be present for where breathing is easiest to experience or most compelling. 
The breathing is always in the present moment. 
And so we're using breathing as a way of establishing a more continuous connection to the present, to hear. 
So the mind can relax and center itself. 
Let go of the past and future. 
So just hear with a simple experience of breathing. 
So let yourself be present for where breathing is easiest to experience or most compelling. 
So let yourself be present for where breathing is easiest to experience. 
Let go of the past and future. 
And then to help you stay with your breathing, you can very quietly in your mind have the thought in as you breathe in, out as you breathe out. 
Soft, soft whisper that's there mostly to encourage you to stay there with your breathing. 
So you're there for each in-breath and each out-breath. 
And if anything is happening, it makes it challenging to be with your breathing. 
You can let go of your breathing and just notice what that is. 
Kind of step back and maybe get a bird's eye view of it. 
Oh, this is what's happening. 
See if there can be a clear awareness, clear recognition. 
Oh, this is what's happening. 
And after it's been acknowledged, maybe you can start again with your breathing. 
So we'll continue for one more minute in this last minute. 
See if you can be gently but committedly with every breath. 
And then to end this sitting, you can take a few couple of deep breaths again as you breathe in deeply, feeling your body. 
Feel your body against the chair or the cushion that you're here in this room. 
And then when you're ready, you can open your eyes. 
So mindfulness meditation, the way that we teach it here at IMC, begins with breathing. 
And meditating on breath is a way of calming down or stabilizing the mind so that it can be in the present moment. 
Sometimes we talk about arriving into the present because usually the mind is somewhere else. 
And so to come back into the present and then to have an anchor in the present. 
And sometimes we talk about the breathing being an anchor. 
A ship which is not anchored is going to drift off the currents and the winds and just kind of wander off or, you know, float onto shore and crash. 
So we don't want to get lost out at sea or crash against the shore. 
So sometimes we want to be anchored in the present moment and that the anchor is going to be the breathing. 
So we stay, it kind of keeps us in the present moment. 
And it also is a training to help us to relax the pull and tension of a lot of those thoughts that keep us spinning and pulling off and going away. 
Every time you come back to your breathing, you are letting go of some of the momentum of distracted thoughts. 
Come back. 
And a lot of what meditation can be about is the movement of coming back to the breath. 
It doesn't matter how many times your mind gets lost. 
So don't get discouraged. 
What matters is how many times you come back. 
And the more opportunities you have to come back, the better, I suppose. 
So, you know, go ahead. 
Get to do it again. 
Get to do it again. 
And bit by bit, drop by drop, the inner ecology, the mental ecology begins to shift. 
Bit by bit, there is not so much glue to our distracted thoughts. 
There is not so much pull towards them or preoccupation with them. 
And bit by bit, we kind of stabilize the mind so the mind is here. 
A mind which is stable and relaxed will be in the present moment. 
A mind which is tense and distracted won't be very present for what is going on. 
So we are trying to help ourselves be here. 
And the breathing is one of the ways to do that. 
Once we are kind of stabilized and we are here without the mind drifting off, then we begin to have access to a more clear form of awareness. 
An awareness that we can use to bring our attention to different aspects of our life without the mind wandering off, getting lost in the thoughts, trying to comment about it or analyze it or think about it and all this stuff. 
It just kind of sees it for what it is and can be present and let it reveal its secrets to us. 
Let it reveal what is really going on in a way that can't if we are not present. 
So the breath meditation is where we begin. 
So do you have anything you want to say about that meditation that we did? Any questions about it or do you want to report a little bit what happened? In a room this many people and there is a wide range of experiences of how it goes, all of which are permissible. 
But if you can use the mic then everyone can hear. 
When you sense some physical discomfort, what do you do? So when you have some physical discomfort, what do you do? If it is too uncomfortable you welcome to change your posture or what is called the rest posture in meditation if you are sitting on the floor is to put your legs up like this towards your chest and wrap your arms around your knees like this until you feel more rested and then you can sit again. 
Next week I am going to talk about mindfulness of the body and then we will talk about how to bring mindfulness to discomfort. 
And discomfort can become the object of attention and you can develop a lot of mindfulness by learning to stay with it. 
And one of the things we are learning is how to not only notice some kind of discomfort, but to notice our resistance, our aversions, our fears, all the kind of ways we get distracted and cut up in relationship to it and learn how to separate those out from each other so that we are not caught in the swirl of reactivity. 
And then it can be possible to be comfortable with discomfort and actually be present for something that is very uncomfortable in your body and be very much at ease watching it and being with it. 
So that is kind of like the aim of one of the benefits and come from mindfulness. 
So next week I will talk more about it, but for now you are welcome to change your posture or what you can do is ignore it, if you can. 
Because in the first week we are mostly focusing on breathing. 
To whatever degree you give a sense, it is reasonable. 
You can just ignore everything but come back to your breath. 
Stay with your breath, ignore everything, come back. 
And then later we will talk about some of these body, emotions, thoughts and things like that. 
I saw a hand up there on the stage. 
Thank you. 
Can you eventually become so practiced in the breathing meditation and the sense of presence of now that in the midst of a very stressful day you can immediately call upon it to center yourself immediately. 
Can you get that good? Immediately is maybe, I don't know what you mean by that, but yes. 
Let me just say this because that actually is important in my question. 
Can you within, if you are well practiced in this, can you within a few breaths begin reducing your confusion or stress effectively? Yes, I can do that. 
You can do it, but sometimes it might take longer. 
One of the great things in the middle of a difficult day with a lot of stress is if you can, like a work or something, is excuse yourself to go to the bathroom. 
And a few people question why you are going to the bathroom. 
But you are going to breathe and sit there and just breathe for a while. 
And that might take five minutes. 
Usually it will give you five minutes to do what you have to do at the bathroom. 
And then after five minutes, maybe you, not just two or three breaths, but maybe it takes five minutes to kind of get some difference. 
Over here, just another mic. 
I'll be right in the back. 
I had just two quick questions. 
One was I've always been confused about where you inhale from and where you exhale from. 
And then also I have a tendency to always breathe shallowly. 
And so during meditation, when I've heard, oh, now just start breathing naturally, those for me are typically shallow breaths. 
And so I feel like that's not, I'm actually going for a deeper breath. 
So trying to be more conscious of it, that means I would have to exert effort and think about that rather than breathe naturally. 
So I always feel kind of torn about that. 
Yeah, I think that, I mean, the first question, generally we breathe in and out through the nostrils rather than through the mouth. 
So that's where the question is. 
And just, you know, let it go in and out. 
And generally, in our particular tradition here, we don't, for the most part, emphasize any particular way of breathing. 
So you don't have a shallow breath. 
It's just as good as a deep breath for the purposes of developing mindfulness. 
And why some people breathe shallow, some people breathe deep. 
It's very variable from person to person. 
Some people hold their breath, but some people just breathe that way. 
Kind of naturally, it's what they do. 
And so the advantage of this kind of non-judgmental awareness that we're doing is you can just be content to notice the breath that you have. 
And it doesn't have to be some idea of what a deep spiritual breath is like, you know. 
And after all, we're in California. 
It should be a deep, relaxed, open, something special. 
Just notice what it is and be with it. 
And what happens is that over time, it shifts and changes. 
Part of the advantage of mindfulness awareness, it tends to. 
. 
. 
Imagine that your fist is always in a fist. 
Your hand is always in a fist. 
And you go around and you think that's all you're allowed to do. 
But then slowly, the fist begins to relax and open and open slowly. 
And you're surprised to discover that there's a palm in there. 
And it's actually kind of nice. 
It's useful. 
It's soft. 
It's nice. 
You can stroke the cat. 
You can do all kinds of things with the palm of the hand. 
And so if a person holds themselves chronically tense, without paying any attention to it, it can persist. 
But if you bring awareness to it, it's hard for the hand to stay tight. 
The more awareness we have, the more the tendency to relax. 
And some tensions, the physical tensions, take longer than others to relax. 
But some of them, like if you're just kind of tightened up some place, in the middle of a difficult day, and you bring awareness to yourself, what's going on, you say, well, I'm really tense. 
A lot of things, you can just relax 90% of it pretty quickly just by noticing it. 
So what I'm trying to say is that, same with the breathing, if there's some way in which the breathing is held, or tight, or a little bit contracted, constricted, that if you bring awareness to it, it self-corrects. 
So it's possible you need no correction, and just the way you breathe, and it's possible that something loosens up with time. 
People who, when the mind gets very concentrated, and you're really in the present moment in a strong way, the breath gets very, very subtle, and you could say shallow. 
There's a sign of being concentrated and calm. 
And sometimes it can get so calm, and so subtle the breathing, that people no longer feel the breathing whatsoever. 
It's like the breathing has stopped. 
And some people, when they have that happen, get afraid, because you're supposed to die when you stop breathing. 
But meditators usually don't die from that. 
And just after a while they get, oh, after a while it becomes kind of a cool thing. 
Oh, look, mom, no breathing. 
Yes, speaking using the mic. 
Oh, yes, you were first, I saw you. 
Go ahead. 
But then you can give it. 
I find it easy to notice, momentarily, a breathing sensation. 
For example, a chest rises, my breathing. 
But that sensation lasts less than a second. 
That's what? It lasts less than a second. 
Yes. 
And so as soon as it's gone, I already think about what I'm going to have for dinner, or whatever. 
And so I find it difficult to maintain the awareness. 
Yes, so it's a practice. 
And so the practice gets stronger, you do it, and you keep doing it, then it gets like a muscle that you develop. 
But one exhale is made up of many sensations. 
And so the idea is to stay with the full, the whole kaleidoscopal sensations that come and go. 
And so you might want to get a little more interested in what's going on. 
Because it's possible you're just on the tip of the iceberg about what the experience of breathing is like for you. 
So you might want to kind of look a little more carefully. 
And then maybe your mind won't wander away so easily. 
And the other thing is what I suggested is, say in your mind, in, out, as you're breathing. 
And sometimes when I was in Burma practicing in Asia, the label they gave was to say, rising and falling. 
There's a chest of the belly rose, rising and then falling when you exhale. 
And the idea was you use a very simple, subtle, innocent thought to help you stay present, rather than letting your thoughts be idle. 
And idle thoughts will get in trouble, you know, will wander off. 
So you might try using a very simple note like an in. 
And some people find it helpful to draw it out. 
So the whole inhale, they say in. 
There's not supposed to be a mantra, just kind of stay there, stay there, stay with that until the end. 
Okay. 
So please. 
Thank you. 
So in terms of discomfort, physical, I suppose it applies to emotional at a later stage, you said, first you said, just pay attention to it. 
And then you said, oh, you can ignore it. 
So those seemed contradictory. 
And I find that if I ignore it, it just, I keep getting distracted. 
So the essence of this practice is to notice it. 
And we'll talk about that next week. 
The idea of ignoring it was only for this week, because if you can, because the first week, it's nice just to get really familiar with the breathing, develop, kind of get comfortable with it, learn to be with it, come back to it, learn about this movement of letting go of your distractions coming back, and just kind of get a real hang of what, feeling for what it's like to be meditating on the breathing. 
Next week, I'll talk about the mindfulness of the body, including discomfort. 
And then I'll teach you how to bring careful attention to it so you're present for it. 
Does that make sense? Yeah. 
Okay. 
My question was regarding mantra, using a mantra. 
I've been doing that for a while. 
Is that different than what we're doing tonight? Well, the people who teach mantra might have a different answer than I'm giving you. 
But mantras are great. 
They're very helpful. 
But from a Buddhist point of view, mantras are more a concentration practice where you're focusing your attention on the mantra, and you can get very calm and very concentrated that way, but you don't necessarily become, develop insight, the ability to see what's going on in your life. 
And so I've known people who've done mantras for years, and they've developed the capacity to get very concentrated, and sometimes very blissful. 
It's a wonderful thing to do. 
And then they've come on retreats with me, and I've said, you know, why don't you stop doing the mantra here, while you're here, and why don't you just notice what's going on? And they'll come back into me and say, I had no idea. 
I've been distracting myself through the mantra from all my psychological mess that I'm in, or all this how I'm wounded, or all my fears and all my preoccupations. 
And I've been holding it all at bay by staying with the mantra. 
And what we're trying to do here is to develop an awareness which doesn't hold anything at bay, doesn't exclude anything by focusing on something like a mantra, but has the ability to bring a wise attention to all ears of our life. 
So from a Buddhist point of view, we say that concentration practices exclude mindfulness practice includes. 
And mindfulness meditation becomes fully mature when it's all inclusive. 
And all ears of our life, we know how to bring it under the view of attention. 
So we know how to bring our emotional life, our psychological life, our mental life, our social life. 
We all know how to be with it in a way that is supportive and provides a degree of freedom and peace in the middle of whatever we're doing. 
Is that a satisfying answer? Yes. 
The question is, I haven't gotten anywhere with mantras. 
So let's see how you go here. 
I haven't done any harm. 
We can do maybe one more. 
Thank you. 
So I'm going to refer back to your example of how you sat back on a couch and kind of relaxed too much. 
I felt myself every once in a while, even though I'm upright and everything, you just drift off a little. 
And I'm wondering, in addition to posture, are there things we can do to kind of stay more alert and aware? Yes. 
There's a variety of things you can do. 
One is this idea of the mental noting, the in-out. 
That sometimes you're using, doing something a little bit energetic in your mind that helps the mind stay a little bit more alert. 
And there's a whole practice using mental notes. 
I'll talk more about it another time. 
But so you give the mind something to do. 
The other is just kind of a mental brightening. 
You kind of some mentally kind of, if you can understand what I'm saying here, brighten the mind, wake up the mind. 
So there's more energy in it, more alert. 
The other thing is you can open your eyes slightly. 
And when the eyes are open, you're less likely to fall asleep. 
And the last thing to say is that it's pretty common for people to get drowsy and be sleepy. 
A lot of people in this country have more need for sleep than they have for meditation. 
Whereas sleep deprived culture. 
And so that's part of the territory. 
And especially in the evening like this, I would expect a good number of you are pretty sleepy. 
And it's not uncommon for people to fall asleep. 
I fall asleep sitting up here sometimes meditating. 
So it's part of the territory. 
You don't have to be discouraged by it. 
And just part of it. 
Notice that the best you can and try to wake up. 
But you don't have to feel bad about it. 
Remember, there's no mistakes here. 
Just notice what's happening the best you can. 
So a few things about meditating at home. 
It's nice to choose a time of day where you're most likely to be alert and most likely not to be interrupted by anything or tempted by anything. 
Classically, that's early in the morning when you first wake up. 
Some people can straight out of bed. 
They'll sit down to meditate. 
Some people will do it after their coffee. 
But the idea is when it's quiet, you're less likely to get phone calls and emails or whatever. 
You can just kind of turn everything else off and just kind of practice. 
Some people find it works better to do the end of the day or in the late afternoon or the middle of the day. 
Just find and figure out what's best for you. 
There is an advantage to doing it at the same time every day because of the benefits of habit, being accustomed to it. 
You're familiar to it. 
Your whole body and mind kind of knows what's coming. 
It knows what's happening. 
It's kind of used to it. 
And so you don't have to. 
. 
. 
You can kind of settle into it, into the groove easier. 
It's nice to do it in a setting where you're not tempted by the things around you. 
So try to do it some corner of your bedroom or the house that you don't associate with a lot of other things. 
So your smartphone is far away. 
Your computer is far away. 
TV is far away. 
Books are far away. 
Whatever. 
So you're not tempted by things. 
You sit down and just. 
. 
. 
That's the place where you do it. 
And then you have to watch some of the tricks the mind has because you can. 
. 
. 
People can be sitting meditating. 
They can think it's very important to meditate. 
They're really into it. 
This is like really significant. 
They want to give it a try. 
And 10 minutes into the meditation, it's just really clear that the freezer needs to be defrosted now. 
It has to be now. 
And so you have to be careful for the mind's tricks. 
You can come up with a strong urge on now. 
And so the idea is to put everything else aside. 
Unless the house is burning, just let everything else go and just kind of stay present. 
You can get a. 
. 
. 
Now that many people have smartwatches, the smartphones, now they have timers that you can set to. 
. 
. 
It's nice to have time, not time it, but to set a timer so that you don't have to think about when to stop. 
And check every few minutes on your clock. 
Just set it for however long you're going to sit and then don't think about it until it goes off. 
A number of places, including on our website, there's meditation timers that you can get. 
And you can put these meditation timers on your app and then they have a very nice bell, you know, that you listen to rather than the smartphone kind of generic thing. 
And then there is a handout, this kind of yellow paper that's there on the end of the stage. 
And that has some of the basic instructions for today in print. 
You can read about it. 
It also has some mindfulness exercises you can do in your daily life. 
And it might be helpful and interesting to do those to kind of learn how to bring more of this mindfulness into the rest of your life. 
And also it says there, I think a suggestion is the first week you're going to sit 15 minutes a day. 
And then next week it's going to be 20 minutes and then 25 minutes. 
So you get to kind of slowly build to more. 
You're welcome to meditate more if you'd like, but 15 minutes is a good beginning as you're getting a hang of it. 
And what else to say here? Yes? I have one question about the mantra. 
With the in-out or om-home, things like that, those even be distracting too? They can be. 
So the idea in-out is not the mantra. 
A mantra is something you give yourself over completely to and you let it fill your consciousness so that you're not really noticing anything else. 
The in-out is just a very soft whisper in the back of the mind. 
It's like 5% of your mental effort is going to say the in-out. 
95% is to notice the inhalation and exhalation. 
So it doesn't become automatic. 
It doesn't become a mantra. 
It doesn't become a primary focus of attention. 
And so I think that one thing that I usually say at the beginning that didn't occur to me today, I'll say it now, is that we like to let people know that everything that we offer here at IMC is offered freely. 
That's part of our kind of religious approach to Buddhism, is that we have generosity in offering it freely. 
And that's a spirit which is given this. 
While it's offered freely, no charge for it. 
And at the same time that all the expenses for IMC and the livelihood of the teachers like me who work here comes from the generosity of people who make donations when they're here. 
And if you're interested in making a donation support this, there's a box by the door. 
And there's one slot that says operations and that's for the running of the place. 
And there's one that says teacher. 
And that's for whoever the teacher is for the event, a particular event like this event would be for me. 
And so that's for you. 
Nothing's expected because it is freely offered. 
And at the same time, our ability to do what we do is because of the tremendous generosity of so many people that we're all very grateful for. 
And I ask you also, please don't park in any of the parking lots around here except for ours. 
We only have space for three cars, a teeny one. 
But don't park across the street because they might tow your car in the nursing home across the street or in the dentist parking lot next to us around here. 
Because even if they're closed and there's no, you think, oh, they're closed and no one's using it. 
I can use it. 
It bothers them a lot. 
And we have to be good neighbors to the different businesses around here. 
And so we ask you, don't park in those parking lots. 
And so good. 
So anything, any last words? Thank you. 
Thank you. 
And so there is this hand out there. 
You can pick it up. 
Also, let me introduce to you a few people here who have been longtime meditators and actually teach this course sometimes. 
And there are here some, lots of experience. 
You can ask them any questions you have now because that's partly why they're here is to be available. 
So up here is Bruni with her red shawl. 
And Tom is sitting back there, this clipboard. 
And then Kate also, who's the manager? You can check in with her and ask her questions. 
And Hillary at the sound board here, you can also check in with her. 
And I'll be up here too if you want to ask any questions. 
So thank you for coming. 
And I hope that this mindfulness becomes rich and valuable for you.
