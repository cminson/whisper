So a warm welcome. Welcome everybody. What a delight it is to share this exploration as David said before we turned on the recording this adventure that will be going on.
So a really, really warm welcome to everybody.
Let's say a few words that the four of us have been teaching together we've been friends and I've been teaching together for a while and I think this is our 11th course together so it's quite something and maybe I'll just express off hand my delight to be able to teach with
Ying, Kim and David and just how and we can want to share this with others how fun it is to talk about some of these ideas to explore to learn from each other and to just my adventures are always more fun when they're with other people.
So maybe with that I'll hand it over to Ying.
Can you all hear me okay? Yeah, okay. All right.
Yeah, I was also reflecting on this particular course that four of us will be teaching in mind when it's a body.
What an adventure it's been for me and for all four of us as we were preparing for this course. So I just, you know, right now I can't wait to share this with you all.
So delighted to see you all to be here early in the morning for some of us and maybe different times for others.
I'll pass it on to David.
Ying, yes. Welcome everybody again. And I don't have, I don't think I'm having to add except maybe to say that we style these study and practice courses and we find particular delight in entering into some of the ancient texts that undergird this tradition and these traditions.
And particularly not looking at them in solely an academic way but really trying to bring them into the heart of our practice and this is probably that can't imagine any better way to do it than mindfulness of the body.
You know how to bring sort of that study aspect into the realm in which you know we're most intimately connected with maybe our suffering and with freedom.
Yeah, what an amazing field of practice, the body. And so I also just want to bow to my fellow teachers for the fun of working with these texts and for the adventure of the body.
I've now gotten on to that, that phrase that I interpreted from David. And, you know, just however many years you've had your body.
There's still more to discover about it. Mindfulness of the body is a really rich and amazing field of practice. And what I love about it is that it's so close at hand, you know, you don't have to go somewhere to feel your body.
It's always with us in a sense and so what a gift that our greatest teacher is always so close.
So at least that's one way of talking about, you know, what what we're doing here with mindfulness of the body but I wanted to share as we like to do at the beginning of these classes.
So some of what we gleaned from the forms that you turned in the registration forms. So we do read those. And I always love to see, you know, some of the, I can't read all of them, of course, but I'll give kind of a summary of what we, what people are bringing into this and when you meet and talk with
them in the small groups you'll get to hear even more. So just kind of geographically we have people from six countries and 20 US states. So we are well dispersed.
And then, let's see, a number of people say that they are currently working with pain or illness in the body, you know, that's one of their most prominent experiences right now and so this is meaningful for them.
Let's talk about other aspects of the relationship with our body. Some people can't feel their body very well. And so they would like to connect with it, you know, this is seems like an opportunity to get more embodied.
Some people feel that they have been at war with their bodies or have not had a positive relationship with them. They've been putting demands on their bodies or other things.
They have the sense of wanting to improve the relationship. That's a good idea, given that we're going to be with the body till the end, which is more than we can say for any other body.
Right. So, so other people have a view of wanting to deepen the gratitude and respect so having a positive relationship and wanting to make it more positive or just in general deepen the experience of the body.
And people note that they are heady, and they are often in their head our environment, our society tends to encourage that especially all this zooming we've been doing for a couple of years.
There's really a kind of a way that we can get stuck in our head and the body might be something of a refuge of coming back into the present moment back into something tangible.
One of the things around this was I want to practice in the body, not in spite of the body. So, kind of encourages our relationship.
The body is also understood by some of you to be a gateway to the mind, which is what we'll see in this suit. You may start out with mindfulness of the body and that's what you think the realm is, but the body leads straight into how we see the body,
how we feel about the body, how we perceive, how we perceive change, it goes straight into the mind.
So some people commented that the body helps them learn about their emotions, you know, maybe the first way you know that you're having a certain emotion is feeling agitation or heat or tension.
Other people said the body's always in the present moment, so it's a great support for mindfulness. Yes, that's exactly what this suit is pointing us toward.
The body is useful.
We present in the body so some other Buddhist teachings are often expressed through the body.
And people have mentioned that they've tasted some of the deeper mind states, such as Jhana, and this is a powerful bodily experience as described in the suit is.
And so they're wanting to learn more about that and fortunately the suit that talks a lot about concentration states.
And then there's the body as a vehicle of insight. So it's a great place for letting go.
We're seeing impermanence and for understanding not self and uncontrollability.
So there's a lot of insight to be found through our experience of the body, and then expanding out more broadly the body is a very practical way to integrate our cushion practice with daily life.
You know, you're sitting on the cushion, you feel your body, you go out, you wash the dishes, you vacuum the rug, you go shopping, you hike, whatever it is that you're doing. So the body is the kind of the connector between all those.
And of course a few people mentioned appreciation of the way these courses allow us to learn together as a community in a group with other people.
All of those I think would be our hopes also. And so welcome to the adventure.
Okay, so with that kind of introduction, of course, you know, we, we wish that all of us could put our voices in but I do this summaries because there's quite a lot of us.
So, I want to now move into some of our aims for the course. Of course, it's all of those things that you mentioned, but let me now talk a little bit about the Sutta in particular Majumani Kaya 119, the Kaya Gatasati Sutta, the Sutta on mindfulness of the body.
So this is one of three Suttas in the Majima and probably across the canon in general that are highly meditation centered, really practice oriented.
So there's an overlap, I'm just going to name this briefly because we're going to learn about it more later. There's an overlap between MN 119, the Sutta we're looking at, MN 118, the Sutta on mindfulness of breathing,
and MN 10, the Satipatana Sutta on the establishment of mindfulness, the general, more general establishment of mindfulness. So these are a family of meditation centered Suttas that Diana is going to talk about later today.
So then, you know, what do we see in this Sutta overall, we see a lot of practices offered the whole beginning of the whole first part of it is this long kind of list of practices that we can do and at the end of each one it says this too is mindfulness of the body.
So the class is going to go through some of these practices in detail, we're not going to be able to do all of them, but it will allow us to kind of savor the flavor of these practices if you will and understand for ourselves some of the benefits that they bring.
One difference between this Sutta and the other two that I mentioned is that this one in particular focuses on concentration states, including the John as states of deep absorption.
And that's just particular to this one, the other two to two suit is on mindfulness don't include that explicitly, although it can, you know, can come about of course from doing those practices.
I just want to read the section that's called the refrain and again you'll hear about this again, probably several times today.
So, it's, you can hear the concentration in it that's why I want to read it. So it says, as the meditator abides, thus diligent, ardent and resolute their memories and intentions based on the household life are abandoned with their abandoning their mind becomes
made internally, quieted, brought to singleness and concentrated. That is how a person develops mindfulness of the body. So it's kind of clear what we're leading toward is some kind of concentration but they'll see that there of course, you know, the practices are not all about that you
only get to that at the end there's lots and lots of stuff to do in daily life and all kinds of other things, even reflective practices.
So it's interesting to me that mindfulness of the body leads to some of the most profound states of mind.
Right. So we'll discover that through these practices that there are different layers of the body, you know, there's the physical body that we all feel and act and move around during the day.
But there's also, you know, sort of more subtle layers of the body that are intimately interconnected with the mind. Maybe the, we could call it the subtle body or the energy body. So it might be that the body is not quite what you think it is.
Let's look into that as we explore over these five sessions. So our encouragement to get the most out of this class would be to do the practices. And in particular, it might be interesting.
To survey the practices that are in the text of the suit that we've already sent that to you. And we'll be going through it in some of the sessions is to find a practice that feels interesting to you, like, Oh, I haven't done that one.
Or I've just started on that one and it seems promising whatever it is, find one and really do it during these five sessions, because you'll have a chance to ask questions about how it's going.
And of course, our last session is a four hour half day, focusing on practice. So you'll use really an opportunity to do some of these practices, you might want to stretch yourself a little bit, not just doing the usual kind of things sit down like this of breathing something
like that.
Try something a little unusual. Here's your chance. So with that, I will pass it along to David.
Thank you, Kim. Yeah, I'm excited.
I've heard all that. I'm ready to go.
Yeah, so we can we can start sort of our start the adventure. Maybe we're going to use this metaphor now.
It's sort of placing locating this practice mindfulness directed to the body, among, you know, the various practices with which we may be familiar, we may have heard about we may have read about. And what emerges in this exercise is just that, again and again, in the texts that that are the foundation
of our traditions, the, all the discourses attributed to the Buddha and his, his community of practice, all the collections of which there are various all the different suit as of different lengths and different purposes.
Mindfulness of the body emerges again and again as a, as a foremost practice as a leading practice as a central practice.
We thought it would be interesting to give some examples of this just to get, get a get a flavor of what, what the importance of the practice and maybe find some inspiration in the way mindfulness of the body is, is addressed or where it comes up in the suit does.
And so, here are a few examples drawn from various places in these wonderful collections of texts that come down to us. One, that may be familiar to some of you who took a course we did last summer about the, the awakening poems of followers of the Buddha members of the
Buddhist community. Ananda, some of you may know a long time companion of the Buddha and the person to whom is attributed the memory, the memorization of many of the, of the discourses in his awakening poem has this stanza.
He says, if your friend has passed away, if your teacher has passed and gone, and of course he's referring to the Buddha, if your friend has passed away, and your teacher has passed and gone, there's no friend like mindfulness of the body.
So this locates it in this very, it is kind of wonderful to me quite poignant sense that when, in a way, we have maybe doubts or we lose our way or lose a teacher that mindfulness of the body as Kim pointed out is always available.
It's always the body's always here, the adventure is always available.
Turning to a couple longer quotes in the, the, what are they called here the numerical discourses the collection called the Angutara Nikaya.
The collection that numbers discourses by, or that organizes the discourses by the number of the things in them.
And mindfulness of body in a way not surprisingly in the very first section that devoted to ones, and there are many, many of these.
But here's one that I just loved this morning.
And I'm, I'm going to change a couple things gender, I'm going to correct for the fact that we're not in fact monastics but lay practitioners, I think, probably all of us, most of us certainly says meditators or practitioners.
When one thing is developed and cultivated, ignorance is abandoned true knowledge arises, the conceit about self I am is abandoned, the underlying tendencies to suffering are uprooted.
What is that one thing mindfulness directed to the body.
And the phrase is completed by stating that the other way around when this one thing is developed and cultivated ignorance is abandoned true knowledge arises, the conceit I am is abandoned underlying tendencies to suffering are uprooted.
I'm going to keep going in this route, and eventually probably about 2pm, my colleagues are going to say okay stop that's enough.
But I have a couple more before.
These are these are two from the Samyutta Nakaya this one I just found the other day again there, they appear so frequently that when you run across them it's this reminder of the, the place of this practice.
This is the boot in the Buddha's voice.
I will teach you practitioners, the unconditioned that is nibbana and the path leading to nibbana.
Listen, and what practitioners is the unconditioned what is nibbana, the destruction of craving the destruction of aversion the destruction of delusion.
This is called the unconditioned nibbana.
And what practitioners is the path leading to this unconditioned to this nibbana.
Mindfulness directed to the body, this is called the path leading to the unconditioned.
And this points at something that we'll explore and that Kim already sort of gave us a foretaste of that this practice is foremost or important, in part because it has the power to lead us to being more awake in this life.
So I'm going to finish this little tour with sort of an abbreviated paraphrase with a couple quotes from a much longer passage and much longer sutra.
And some of you will be familiar with this sutra. This is a sutra about about six animals.
And it compares it uses this metaphor of six animals to tell us something significant about the place of this practice in in our practice.
It's, and I think I can do this just kind of reading it. It's, it goes something like this, it's a story, and this is another way that the suit is.
Give us insight on the teachings by providing them in a narrative frame or giving us a simile or a story says suppose.
Very common phrase suppose monks suppose practitioners that a person has caught whoops I'm reading the wrong translation suppose that a person were to catch six animals that had different domains different feeding grounds.
And this person would bind them with a strong rope.
Having caught a snake, for example, they would bind it with a strong rope, having caught a crocodile, they would also bind it with the strong road, a bird, a dog, a jackal, a monkey, each would be bound with a strong rope.
And having bound them with strong ropes. This person would make them not in the middle, and then he would let go.
Those six animals that had different domains and different feeding grounds would each pull toward their feeding ground and domain the snake would pull thinking, I'll enter an anthill.
The crocodile would pull thinking, I'll enter the water, the bird would pull thinking I'll fly off into the sky, the dog would pull thinking, I'll enter a village, the jackal would think, I'll go off to a charnel ground, the monkey would pull thinking I'll enter the woods.
And when having exercised in this way, they became weakened and fatigued, then they would just follow whichever animal was strongest, and they would submit to it and they would come under its control.
But then the opposites given suppose practitioners that a person were to catch six different animals with different domains and feeding grounds and bind them instead of with a knot in the middle, bind them to a strong post.
Having caught a monkey, he would bind it with a strong rope having bound it with a strong rope, she would tie it to a strong poster pillar and thus, with the other animals.
And thus, those six animals, each with different domain with different feeding ground would pull each other toward or pull toward their own feeding ground and domain.
The snake would pull wanting to enter an anthill, etc.
But in this case, practitioner, when these six animals are fatigued, they would stand near the poster pillar.
They would stand near it, they would lie down near it.
And then the sutra goes on to compare the post to mindfulness of the body.
In other words, when we don't have a strong post a strong pillar a strong reference for practice something as rooted in the here and now of our experience as the body.
We're going to get pulled off into different directions and the strongest voice in our head or the strongest urge of the body will be the one that we submit to that we lie down around.
And yet with a practice like mindfulness of the body in the middle, serving as a strong post.
Everything eventually comes calms down submits to settles near the center near the near the near the post that is mindfulness of the body.
So, I want to say one thing about this practice that I've just engaged in and hopefully introduced you to, which is that when we do this study and practice.
We, we look at whatever we're looking at mindfulness of the body in the context of this huge array of wonderful ways of approaching this topic.
We find that Majma Nakaya 119 the central focus of our of our adventure of our exploration is informed by how other suitors in the vast collections of these discourses, how they place mindfulness of the body.
And we can go to an awakening poem, we can go to sort of a, that analytic way of understanding the place we can go to a story like the one just shared from the Samyuta Nakaya to get a sense of nuance or a sense of different forms that the teaching can take.
So we encourage you to do this to we we this is something we engage in regularly as part of our way of bringing study to practice.
We want to tee up the meditation that follows and this course this particular one this five course series that we've designed the longest we've done has a lot more meditation in it.
And in a way that reflects that the that this this this teaching has to be experienced firsthand.
And so, but let me just tee it up with a couple things and I'll point to a couple things that Kim has mentioned.
We can sort of characterize why mindfulness of the body might be such a might be a foremost practice might be such a central practice.
I think we can see and we'll start to experience it in the meditations that mindfulness directed to the body connects us to what I like to call the hereness and the nowness of our experience.
And the mind is very much focused in the there and then of our experience, the body keeps connecting us to here and now.
Sometimes you wonder, you may have had the question I have, why are Buddha so into the here and now?
There's a lot of answers.
But the body connects us to aspects of the here and now that make us appreciate that the suffering we create for ourselves happens in the here and now.
And it's available is available in the here and now and the body gets us there to this key place where we can learn about understand the sources of suffering, how it arises, how it passes away, how we can how we can use that as a as a way to be awake.
The mindfulness directed to the body also as Kim has sort of foreshadowed.
It helps us helps us understand the way mind makes sense of experience aspects, fundamental aspects of our experience arise in the body.
And when we bring mine to those experiences, magic things happen.
Don't want to say magic things.
Scientifically, real things happen, no magic involved in our practice, we end up not creating things but paying attention to stuff that's always there in our experience of which we're largely ignorant and frequently find ourselves looking the other way.
But for example, when we bring attention to the body, we can notice that there's balance.
There's simple or uncomplicated nature of things, there may be a slower pace of things there may be less striving that's in the mind.
And when we bring the mind to those things a little bit of some of those qualities of our bodily experience can rub off on the mind.
We could go on and on talking about ways this works but maybe the best way to understand or start to enter into how attention to the body can open up a way of seeing that freeze, or some of the significant the central profound insights of our tradition is to is to
get together. And so let me turn it over to Ying to without further ado, engage in some mindfulness directed to the body.
Thank you, David. Thank you for team up so nicely.
So with this words, we are going to do a practice together based on one of the practices in this suit and that is the four great elements that earth, water, fire and wind element.
And so I invite you to join me to maybe just take a few moments to settle into a sitting posture and some of you, if you need to move, find your spot to sit for the next 20 minutes or so in the meditative way.
Please feel free to do so.
And this meditation.
I wanted to point out is that it's not exactly word by word following what's in the suit.
But it's an expansion, it's experiential. And I learned this particular way of practicing with the elements through one of my teachers, Philip Moffitt and his students and also my teachers.
So I invite you to maybe open to this way of practicing with the elements.
As we begin, offer some generous moments to allow our self to arrive.
Live here and now. Sometimes I use this image as you were arriving at an ancient temple.
The temple of this body.
And the temples are made of the same material, same elements.
As we arrive, bring along some sense of reverence, curiosity.
And sometimes the sense of arriving is that of settling in.
Maybe feeling the connection of the body with the floor.
Allow that contact to be felt.
And for me sometimes the sense of landing here, landing here and now.
Arriving at the temple of this body.
And gently put away preoccupations, stories.
We'll begin by tuning in to the earth element.
And this kind of a tuning in is allow ourselves to rest in the felt sense of earth element.
And start by just resting our attention in the contact of our bodies against the chairs in the floor.
Maybe there is a general sense of the settling.
Earth element is a heavy.
Sense of a settling down.
Body making contact through our skin, flesh and bones.
Maybe you feel some sense of a firmness.
Earth element is firm, hard.
Receiving the felt sense of earth element.
Letting go of the beliefs and ideas of what earth element has to be.
As you rest your attention at the contact of the body and the earth.
Resting, resting in the earth element.
The earthy body resting on earth.
There may be a sense of grounding.
Earth element grounds us like the foundations of the temple.
Let's savor the sense of the grounding.
Earth element is still.
Unmoving.
You may feel that the whole body.
Earth element feels like the pillar.
Big pillars holding the body.
Strong, firm, unmoving.
Allow the felt sense of earth element to come alive in you.
As yet the knowing is happening in the body.
Mindfulness of the body in the body.
Dropping out of directing from our head.
Body has the organs of a perception.
Knowing happens.
Lifting the body.
Allow the sense of a stillness to pervade.
Throughout the body.
A Buddha offered his young son, Rahula, in his instructions.
Rahula meditated like the earth.
When you meditate like earth, pleasant and unpleasant feelings, contacts will not occupy your mind.
Sitting like a mountain.
Quiet.
Unmoving.
Strong, shakeable.
You may get a sense of composure, collectedness right here with the body.
With the stillness in the field of our knowing and awareness.
Open our awareness to the felt sense of the movements.
Movements of the breath.
Wind element.
Turn your attention to the wind element.
Here and now.
Maybe the movements is smooth, light, or heavy, rough, however it is.
Riding along with the wind element.
Wind element moves, courses through the body.
Allow the body to lead the way.
Dropping a sense of, I have to control this, manipulate this.
There may be vibrations right along the edges of the movements of the breath.
Maybe the humming in the body, subtle energetic feel.
A live body, vital.
Quiet.
A sense of temperature may come along the fire element.
You may feel the earth element become prominent again.
Maybe through the sense of the stillness.
The movements of the wind element and the stillness of the earth element
all exist right here.
In the sutra, the refrain that came read, it says,
As one abides thus diligent, ardent, and resolute,
one's memories and intentions based on the household life are abundant.
And I'll paraphrase that the unwholesome, unskillful qualities of the mind are abundant.
With their abandoning, the mind becomes steadied internally.
Quieted, brought to singleness and concentrated.
Samadhi.
This is how a bhikkhu or a practitioner develops a mindfulness of the body.
Bhinga.
Thank you everyone.
We'll make a little transition to invite some words from the field.
So we have a few minutes to do a debrief and any questions
things that you'd like to share at this point.
Just to remind you to stay connected with the body as you make this transition.
So please use the zoom hand if possible.
And that helps us to see and to keep that hand up as you speak
because we get, we lose you once you lower your hand.
Aileen, please unmute.
Thank you so much for this meditation.
What I appreciated most was when you said let go of ideas and beliefs about earth element.
Because I found my mind was going back and forth between feeling my hands and thinking about what is this earth element.
But the barrier for me and maybe other people, I don't know, is
the mind has trouble landing because there has been so much training about how the body is evil and women's bodies are especially evil.
And so the real dissociation from the body because of that.
So, and those aren't just beliefs, they're there, but the feelings of, you know, I can't land because I can't get through this.
This is a barrier and I can't seem to penetrate sometimes. So that's what came up for me. But thank you very much.
Yeah. And it's so grateful that you point this out and it's absolutely true for so many people, including myself, right?
And for a long time and there is this kind of disassociation with the body, not quite sure how to land.
And yet to this, you know, wonderful practices that we are offered and offer as the gateway, kind of the doorway, go into the temple.
You know, kind of maybe hovering around outside of the temple for a while and not quite sure.
But, you know, gradually as we learn to really drop into the felt sense. Yeah.
Thank you for sharing that.
And maybe can I add just a word here.
Thank you again, Eileen for bringing this up.
All for something that's been helpful for me doesn't mean it'll be helpful for you or for others, but just as this kind of that this element practice emphasizes that Earth is nature.
And we are nature to like how could we be anything otherwise, and somehow just connecting to were made out of the same chemical elements we could say literally but just that we're nature also somehow that was really helpful for me like oh yeah I'm made out of the same stuff.
This is made out of the plant in my room is made out of, you know, just that, I don't know, so I just offer that the kind of to use in particular this element practice as a way to just maybe to connect or find a way in.
Thank you. Thank you.
Jerry, that'll be the last question.
Next session. This is sort of general so I guess over the next two weeks I'll be able to have opportunity to work on this question because it's one of personal interest, which is my focus now lately in the last couple of months and I just finished a search it online retreat this morning.
So, embodiment, which is also that's why I took the call. And so, would you say mindfulness of the body is the same as embodiment, or that one leads to embodiment I mean the expression to be mindful of the body in the body to me is getting very close to what I would
call embodiment because it was embodiment. There is no thinking mind.
Unless you invited in knowing is knowing, you know, if I clap my hands or pinch myself or burn my finger there is no cognitive intervention to tell me what's happened. It's immediate.
I mean body, the body speaks. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we use all those words almost sometimes feels so tricky, but embodiment is so much what mindfulness body is pointing to allow our knowing to happen with the body.
You know, because we're so used to living in the stories and beliefs and concepts of what how things are. Yeah. Thank you.
So we're going to switch to the next session. Diana will be teaching. I take us.
Thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, so part of why I love these series is because it's study and practice they were trying to integrate these different approaches and thank you for that beautiful meditation. Now I'm going to bring us over a little bit to the study part here.
I've been saying these words, it's similar to the other mindfulness soup does every frames are similar and that's fantastic if you happen to have all those suit does in your mind and you're familiar with them.
But I'm going to point to a little bit of specificity here of what we mean by this.
And I'm going to share screen I'm going to show some documents which you will all get in an email after this class. So you don't have to try to memorize everything or take notes or anything like this but just just an opportunity to kind of like,
put together these particular suit does kind of maybe the, maybe the little bit of the study part of this. Okay, so with that is an introduction. I'm going to share this with you all.
And that's from my teachers which I can see, whether you can see this. Okay, great. Thank you. Okay. So, in this tradition, there are three primary mindfulness suit does probably you guys are familiar with this but maybe not everybody is we, and we use all three of these
foundations. I'm going to start here in the middle. Majama Nakaya 10 Sati Patanasuta foundations of mindfulness. I think many of us are familiar with this. And this one has contemplation of the body I'm using this word contemplation because that speaker bodies translation
so we would think of it as the first foundation, the foundation of the body, then you will see down here foundation of feeling mind and my logic dramas. So many of you might be familiar with this.
Then I'm going to go over here to the right mindfulness of breathing, the Anapanasati Sutra. It has some mindfulness of breathing. You'll see here that mindfulness of breathing is kind of like the first
practice and Majama 10, and these much precisely, as well as over here, Majama 19 Kaya Gita Sati Sutra mindfulness of the body. So mindfulness of breathing, which we hear about a lot and in my role as a Dharma teacher or
someone who's leading guide meditation, I'm often doing mindfulness of the breathing, probably because it's in all of these suttas. What's interesting here, right, is this mindfulness of the body in the Sati Patanasuta is actually for those of you who are
here, it has a bunch of different practices underneath it that align exactly with the contents of this mindfulness of the body. And to show you what I mean here I'm going to scroll down.
What I'm going to highlight is the absence here. So the mindfulness of the body has these six. I wish I could show this. I wonder if there's a way if I can make this a little bit smaller, so you don't have to make you see sick with the
feeling. But maybe for this point, I just want to highlight that these of the body are exactly the same in the Kaya Gita Sati Sutra and Sati Patanasuta.
And then the Anapanasati Sutra, except for the breathing part. But this one that we're looking at today doesn't have contemplation of feeling mind or mind objects, it just has the body. And what it does have are the Janas, which we don't
see in the other suttas.
And what's interesting here maybe is where these little blanks are these hyphens are. So, to zoom out a little bit, Kaya Gita Sati Sutra mindfulness of the body has these six main practices.
Ying just led us through this one elements.
There's five others mindfulness of breathing is one of them that we're all familiar with probably.
But it doesn't contain feeling mind or mind objects, but it does contain Janas.
So that's how they kind of like overlap and the polly is the same between these these that they're shared.
This is just the practices, the language around the practices is different in all of these suttas so the actual practices are the same, the language around is different.
And one way that we see that is with the reframe.
And what does that mean a reframe.
The reframe is some, maybe we'll say a paragraph that's repeated, much like the chorus in a song.
And you know often the kind of the course and the song you hear again and again and that's what gets stuck in your head. It's the same idea here that it gets repeated again and again.
And so, I'll just let's look briefly at the reframes.
And this is, here we go.
How the, what we're talking about here in the friends and again you'll get these
article these PDFs, so that you don't have to memorize. Here we go, Diana, you can click this and click this. Here we go.
So, here are the refrains. Here is the one from mindfulness of the body. Here's the four foundations of mindfulness.
Here's on a potasati and I just put it in here.
Majama 62.
Just because sometimes people talk about that as a mindfulness one. We are not going to in this class going to talk about these other ones, the refrains for the other ones.
This is more a handout for you to understand. But here's what Kim Reddit, Ying Reddit. Here is this refrain.
Abides diligent ardent and resolute.
Memories and intentions based on household life are abandoned.
They're abandoning when become steady and internally quieted practice singleness concentrate.
So, this expression gets repeated after every single one of those practices, all six of the body practices, plus all for the johnms.
So, this is like you're hearing this and reading this again and again. It's a little bit unfortunate that in Beka birdies translation he uses, he highlighted them he used ellipses.
So, you know, maybe it doesn't jump out to the reader as much because he wanted to maybe.
I don't know make it. I don't know exactly why he did it, but just so this is something that gets repeated again and again.
This focus on concentration.
Abiding a certain way, abandon memories and intentions becoming concentrated. And I'm going to contrast that with the refrain that's in my foundations of mindfulness or mindful for foundations of mindfulness.
Contemplating X as X where X can equal body feelings mind or mind objects, just as Jerry said earlier, the body is body internally externally both internally and externally, rising and passing and vanishing.
So, this one for my first night is more pointing towards insight.
The refrain in kind of capacity suit point towards concentration.
Same practices.
After each practice, and one suit other's emphasis and concentration, and another suit that there's an emphasis on insight, more mindfulness.
This is something that's kind of is interesting to think about that, that how these same practices, how they're held to find the emphasis that's given can go in different directions.
That's one interpretation. Another interpretation is there is no difference and why are we making these distinctions between mindfulness and concentration to begin with.
This is just something for us to explore in our own practice. What is the difference and what creates the conditions in which there might be some more insight, or in which there might be some concentration, or do they just go together.
As maybe as the concentration increases maybe there's some more insight, and then maybe there's a little bit insight which supports a little bit more concentration, and maybe they continue to like go together.
This is something to explore and maybe keep one's mind open about it or just be sensitive to.
But in this class, we're going to point a little bit more towards the concentration side, because that's what's unique to this particular suit as I pointed out, it wasn't in the foundation suit or that it's not explicitly and mindfulness breathing.
So now there's one more thing that I'd like to talk about. And that is to just unpack a little bit what are all these practices of mindfulness of the body.
And we'll be spending our next classes together to spend more time with them and explore them. But I wanted to kind of give you a big overview of them.
So again, I'm going to share screen.
Okay, whoops, here we go.
So, these are the overview of the practices that both kaya kittasadi supta and sajipatana supta share is the same.
Moving here are the sub elements. So, each one of these sex breathing clusters, well, through activities, anatomical parts elements, corpse and decay, all of them have some practices.
But I want to spend a little just highlight a few things.
One, that notice that there are some verbs associated with this.
When it knows whether they're breathing in and out long knows whether they're bringing in and out shorts and maybe you will recognize this as some of the present practices.
I have some notes here some footnotes giving you the poly if you're interested.
The verb here one knows about breathing knows about their posture.
And then this idea of acts and full awareness, a different verb here with anatomical parts, a different verb reviews.
And then with elements is reviews, again, and then with the corpse and decay practice, as though one were to see one compares one's own body with it.
Another highlight here by highlighting the different verbs is that it's not just one precise activity that we do, but there's a little bit of difference in them that we're not sometimes when we think of,
I'm going to stop share here.
Sometimes when we think about we're going to do mindfulness of the body, we think of it's the exact same activity just done to maybe different elements.
But my highlighting the verbs, I wanted to highlight that. No, there's a little bit different use of the mind is a little bit different approaches in.
This is part of what, when Kim at the beginning was talking about this opportunity to kind of like stretch ourselves is to recognize, oh yeah there's different ways in which we can approach or use or experience, review, see, contemplate, know these
different types of ways of being with maybe mindfulness of the body and will this is what will continue to explore and unpack as we go with this course.
So, maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.
Thank you, Diana for that beautiful overview and comparison, and starting to turn our minds toward, you know, maybe the some of the precision of what's found in this suit.
So now, you're going to have a chance to talk with each other, we're going to make some breakout groups, and I want to just give a little framing to it's very simple questions so.
I want to talk a little bit about being in breakout groups and just how we'll do it this time.
So, just as a general overview for breakout rooms.
We don't need to be telling long stories, it's more to focus on the way the practice is what what it means for us and you know things that might be serving a general conversation about the practice.
So, to give advice to other people, even if they present something as a challenge for them, for example, or they say they're working with something.
That isn't really an invitation for us to then say well what I do is, unless they've asked for that, or unless you ask permission to do that but just to be clear about that.
Let's see the way we're going to approach this particular question is, I'm going to, I would prefer that you do monologues you'll be in groups of three or four.
You'll have a chance I'm leaving a little time at the end for you to talk amongst yourselves but if each person could have a chance to address the question while others just listen and you know don't ask counter questions or otherwise but just let the person
explore for themselves.
And the question is, what roles has mindfulness of the body played in your practice.
And it does say it couldn't be just one role but roles is in plural in case it's played more than one.
There's a little monologue on that and then there'll be a little time to discuss them on yourselves. I think you'll probably each have between two and three minutes.
So, please respect that there was probably a very wide range of experience with the body, you know we had a question earlier where it's clear that the body may be a challenging area for some people, or it might be that somebody in the group has
mindfulness of the body for a long time has different experience of it so that's, in fact, great, you know we want to see that there's a wide range along the group.
So, with that, you'll go into your groups just be just enjoy this time to kind of connect over this topic as we begin to explore it over these five sessions.
I put a little thing in the chat at the top you'll see a little blue text blue bar appear when it's time to change into the next person. So if you could look for that and also maybe just sort of self time yourselves.
You can divide up you're going to have 10 minutes in the room and you can divide by the number of people try to leave a couple minutes at the end. Okay.
So, see you soon.
Hello everybody. Welcome back.
Let's take just a few minutes to see if there are any questions anything that came up in the in the breakout rooms that that yielded a question prompted a question. And again, use the use a little zoom hand.
Like now you can find under the reactions tab and my still writer has it changed again. Yes, reactions allow you to raise your hand.
Any questions anything come up that any questions remaining from earlier.
Nancy, I thought I saw you reaching for your hand so yeah, yeah.
I find it I know where my actual hand is.
Yeah.
One thing that kind of came up on our group is many of us are quite anchored in mindfulness of the breathing and breathing happens within the body I mean it seems to be, you know, inseparable but again, there is a, it does seem to be a discrete focus like mindfulness of the
body is one thing and mindfulness of the body is another emphasis I guess. I don't know I just be curious to hear more about that distinction and how important it is.
I'll say one or two things but I think there are a lot of ways into that question. Yeah, it's it's a good point and interesting that the breathing has this central place in, you know, in mindfulness of the body.
Mindfulness of breathing is inescapably mindfulness of the body, and it sort of takes us to the center of our experience, because the breathing happens. Again, without making up or imagine anything, it centers us in a profound way to be with the breath to be with the
breathing, because it is taking place at the center of all we know.
So, that's one of many reasons that the breath, you know, sometimes, and it can be something you can bring into your own guided, you know, your own guiding of your own meditative experience. Sometimes, we're encouraged to bring attention to the body, and then to the breathing
happening in the body. And that can sort of, you know, locate the experience of the breath, the in-breath and the out-breath in, you know, deeply in the body's experience of everything, and maybe expand it out a little bit so it's less of a narrow focus on the breathing
and more of a broader body focus in which the breathing is, you know, taking place. But I'm curious, Kim, Diana, Yin, that's just what came to me, because my mic was turned off, but go ahead and jump in.
Maybe I'll just add that there is a way that I find useful in incorporating the wind or the air element along with the breath, and, you know, in a way that the air element is directly related to all kinds of the subtle movements happening in the body.
And so, breathing is one particular way, and then there may be, you know, vibrations, the humming, the tinkling, and that's all part of the movements of the air element or the wind element, you know, and in Chinese, it's chi, it's kind of moving us in some way.
So that's one way to kind of expand this slightly. It doesn't have to be anything drastic. And for me is when I'm with the mindfulness of breathing, I can just expand slightly and to kind of move around the edges of the breath.
And that began to feel the subtle vibrations and movements and humming.
And so that's one way, because I share.
Thank you, Ying. And, you know, we'll talk more about this question, I think, Nancy, as we go forward.
But today we need to close, and we wouldn't want to leave out homework assignment. And for that, I'm going to pass the microphone to Diana.
Okay, I have to be the bad guy that gives everybody the homework.
No, you guys get an opportunity to practice with no. So we're going to start looking at more at the practices starting on Thursday, just two days from now. So the invitation is to just look at those sections of the suit that those are sections for through 17.
And, and you'll see in the suit as well as in the handouts again you'll be receiving what I shared with you earlier.
And if there's a practice that is a little bit curious about or somehow resonates with you in some particular way, an invitation to explore it will be offering some ideas or how to practice with them.
And there are so many different interpretations of the specifics of how to practice with these different practices. So we don't want to say there's only one and say, but just to encourage me to familiarize yourselves with them.
And if one seems kind of interesting, give it a go.
Sit on the question and see what that is like.
Otherwise, we'll see you in just two days. And with a really deep bow of appreciation.
And Kathleen, I see that you raised your hand.
Yeah, just a question on the numbering the four through 17. So that would be like one, two.
I can't see what you're pointing to.
I printed out the suit to actually. So, along the pages, there's like one, two, there's three and four.
Mindfulness of breathing. Is that what you mean by four through 17. Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Okay. Okay. Thank you. And we'll see you.
Feel free to feel free to unmute and say farewell. Take care till we till we meet again on Thursday.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.
Bye everyone.
Adios. Take care.
Bye everybody. Thanks.
Bye.
