Dharmette : Buddhism Simplified

In Buddhism there  are many practices that are offered 
and taught , and many approaches for how to practice . 
There are endless teachings  in Buddhism . Boy, there ’s 
no shortage of teachings to be offered. To find one’s 
way through all this can sometimes be a challenge. But 
when I look back and see what the Buddha taught , 
there was a teachi ng that was unique to  the Buddha , 
where t he Buddha sa ys, “This is what’s unique to me. It 
wasn’t unique , but it was the  ‘special ’ teachings of the 
Buddha s – and It comes down to the teachings on the 
Four Noble Truths. That’s what’s special.  
 
When I was practicing in Japan many years ago, I 
remember they gave the monks a high school primer on 
Buddhism  in Japanese . On the front page of  this primer 
was a story of some  old Chinese monk. I think he was 
living in a tree , so it was kind of unusual. The governor 
of the province came to see him, and asked , “What  is 
Buddhism about?” The guy in the tree said, “The Four 
Noble Truths.” The governor said, “What do you mean? 
This is a great world religion . Any child can understand 
The Four Noble Truths. Is that’s all you have to say for 
yourself?” The guy in the tree said, “Any child can understand it, but an old governor might not understand 
how to live it.” So the governor bowed.  
 
The idea of The Four Noble Truths can be said quite 
succinctly . I think  the reference point  to always keep in 
mind  is to understand : “Are you suffering? ” And does 
the approach or technique that you’re doing help you 
become free of suffering? Does it help you release the 
clinging  or compulsion that you’re living under – or does 
it not? That ’s a very pragmatic, experiential thing to 
explore. Where is the drivenness? Where is the 
compulsion? Where is the clinging  or grasping? And is 
there some freedom or ease to be found in the release 
from the grasping  or drivenness , the ending of it?  
 
You can see that in the choice of practice you do. I’ve 
done this . I’ve done walking meditation think ing that 
what I want ed to do is get concentrated. So I’m trying to 
get concentrated , but I’m dr iven or clinging  to this idea 
of getting concentrated.  I’m supposed to be the great 
walking meditato r. If I don’t pay attention to the right 
technique of walking meditation  – there  are many 
techniques of walking  – but rather if I notice how I’m 
suffering as I try to do this , then I’ll see the stress 
involved with trying to get concentrated and trying to be 
the great walking meditator. I can feel that suffering  and 
grasping . Sometimes  it’s a much e asier thing to get 
happy, relax,  and find peace than it is t o keep on that 
route of pushing, trying to get concentr ated, huffing and puffing , and hoping that somehow something will 
happen down the line.  
 
The emphasis on  grasping and letting go of grasping is  
a fundamental  essence of  The Four Noble Truths . 
There’s an obvious benefit right here and now. There’s 
an obvious way in which you can see the Dharma right 
here. The Buddha said that the Dharma is meant to be 
seen here and now. I think  that in that simple 
movement , you see the Dharma.  
 
People have huge philosophi cal questions about 
Buddhism , but the issue might not be about the right 
philosophy . The issue that might be more interesting is 
how are you holding the philosophy? How are you 
holding the drive to understand the philosophy? There 
might be grasping and cli nging there. The Dharma can 
be found in that simple movement of letting go of the 
drivenness  and the compulsion to understand. 
Understanding is still important. You still might pursue 
understanding, but the suffering was there in the 
compulsion.  
 
In a lot of situations in our life, there are worthwhile 
things to pursue  and do . But the Dharma may be not 
found in what yo u do, but rather in  how you hold it  and 
the relationship you have to it. So in this very simple 
movement  – is there some way in which you’re 
grasping, clinging  or driven? Is there  compulsion  or obsession?  Or can you drop it? Can you open up to it? 
Can you soften? Can you release what’s going on? In 
Buddhism , we sometimes  say that  this is the guideline 
to find our path  – rather than finding the path of practice 
through  some complicated philosophy  or complicated 
techniques of practice. The path unfolds in that simple 
investigation right here and now. Where is the stress? 
Where is the suffer ing that we have? Where is the dis -
ease? Where is the discomfort? And where is the 
freedom from it? Where is the relaxing from it?  
 
Sometimes  we focus a little bit more on the suffering 
side, because we want  to understand it. And sometimes  
we focus more o n the freedom side , and what gets 
released  or opened. But it’s that movement between the 
two where the Dharma and the path are  found. It might 
not seem  very profound. It might seem like it d oesn’t 
take you very far – it’s just kind of simplistic. Any child  
can understand this , right? But to do this thoroughly and 
well, to really do the inve stigation to understand deeply 
where the holding is  in our life  is a task of a lifetime. It’s 
a beautiful thing to do. As this path evolves, if you do it 
thoroughly or well, the tendency is  that it just keeps 
opening and opening to deeper aspects of who we are 
and what’s going on.  
 
A phenomenal depth of freedom  and u nderstanding can 
open up in due time through this simple investigation of : 
Where is the suffering ? Where is the clinging ? Where is the release ? And where is the freedom from this ? In 
some ways it makes Buddhism pretty easy. In some 
ways it takes the Buddhi sm out of Buddhism , which is a 
good thing.  
 
So those are my thoughts for today. Hopefully they’re 
useful. And if those thoughts cause suffering, now you 
have at least one idea what to do with that.
