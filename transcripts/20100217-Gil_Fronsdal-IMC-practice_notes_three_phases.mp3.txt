1 Practice Notes : Three P hases  of 
Practice

I find it useful sometimes to divide up mindfulness 
practice into three different parts.  The first is to see 
what ’s happening, to recognize what ’s happening, to 
see it as clearly as possible. To see it means to not be 
judging it, or for or against it, but to really just see how 
things are.  
 
The second aspect is to feel it. So not just seeing it, 
but really to be inside your experienc e and feel what 
it’s like. Even with something like hearing loud sounds 
outside, you feel the vibration, what the listening feels 
like in the ear drums or in the head or wherever you 
might feel it. What does it feel like in an embodied 
way? So it ’s really in the subjective world of feeling, 
just here, not thinking about what ’s out there.  
 
And the third is to soften around the experience, and 
to soften means different things. It might mean 
softening the seeing, the mindfulness, so that it ’s 
more equanimous, less reactive – just letting it be as it 
is. It could also mean softening in the body. It can 
mean softening around it, so whatever the experience 
might be, there isn ’t any grasping at it, or there isn ’t 2 any resistance to it. It could be right in the middl e of 
the experience itself. If there ’s some holding there, 
some tension, it might be possible to relax that 
tension. Or if it ’s not possible to relax it directly, maybe 
soften around it. Often there can be subtle or big ways 
in which we are bracing ourselv es against life, or 
tensing up around something. And sometimes it ’s 
more useful to notice that, rather than noticing the 
object of our attention. There can be a softe ning of the 
shoulders, the arms … 
 
At the beginning of the sitting, I was  noticing 
somethi ng as my mental concern, thoughts that I had 
coming here. And as I was present for it and felt it, 
and softened with it being there , what softened for me 
was the muscles of my forearm, not the head or the 
brain. But it was the way in which my arms were kin d 
of pulled in, tightened up, and engaged with whatever 
I was thinking about.  
 
So, to see, to feel, to soften. And at different times it ’s 
good to give yourself clear attention for each one – to 
differentiate. Now is the time to see; now is the time to 
feel; now is the time to soften.  
 
You don ’t want to make softening into a big project . 
Do whatever is easy, whatever is simple. And when 
softening is not really necessary or the name of the 
game, then just see and feel. And when you ’re already 
feeling somewh at intimate and connected, then you 3 don’t need to emphasise or practice feeling at all; all 
you have to do is see.  
 
When the attention is still a little bit moving back and 
forth, not quite concentrated, then the seeing maybe 
is more like looking – lookin g meaning a more active 
verb; you actually look. But as the mind gets more 
settled and stable, there ’s no more looking, but rather 
just seeing as an inactive verb. Just seeing what 
happens as opposed to something we do to look. We 
just see;  we’re present f or how things are.  
 
So as you practice this morning, it might be interesting 
for you to consider these three phases of practice: 
seeing, feeling, and softening – in your walking 
meditation, your sitting – and see if that might be 
useful.  
 
So thank you.
