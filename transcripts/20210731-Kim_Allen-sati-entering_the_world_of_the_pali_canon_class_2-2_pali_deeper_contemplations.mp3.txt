 All right, Kim. Okay. Good. So now we're going to shift gears again, and I'm going to spend just a brief time talking a little bit about Polly. This class is called Entering the World of the Polly Cannon, and at some point we need to reckon with the fact that the Polly Cannon is in the Polly language. And, you know, we've just heard about translations and something about that process and something about reading, and all of that does let us know that there are very reliable English translations available. But at some point, sometimes we get a sense, well, why not go to the source, you know, could we access these texts in the original language in which they were written down. And there's a number of reasons why this may be of interest. So if we start looking at the Polly, even if we don't know very much Polly, we will notice, like if we look, say, on Suta Central, where they have the English and the Polly next to each other and you start kind of navigating through, sometimes one Polly word is rendered into a number of different English words, because it's used with different nuances, even within one text, you may have the same Polly word translated differently. A good example is the word cheetah, which is sometimes translated as mind and sometimes as heart. Some translators cheat and say heart mind, no they're not cheating. And even recently, Biku Sujato has translated cheetah as intention, which is a little different. So when I've heard Ajahn, sorry that was Ajahn Sujato, and Ajahn Sujito has translated cheetah as awareness. So we have different English words, and that may even occur within one text so you don't realize it's the same Polly word being translated those different ways. And then we also get the reverse sometimes one English word is being used for more than one Polly word. So for example, in the eightfold path. The fifth step right effort is summa vayamo. And the fourth word effort in the five faculties is virya. We just use effort for all of them and many people don't realize that the eightfold path step for example is a different, you know is a different word in Polly. So, let me say immediately that it is not necessary to learn Polly grammar and become a translator. English translations we have now are quite sufficient, thanks largely to Biku Bodhi, and others now. But we thought people in this group might be somewhat more interested than average and learning a little bit about Polly. So I'm just going to say a bit. My view is that everyone who's a Buddhist practitioner would benefit from learning some basic Polly words and phrases. So at the very least to learn the common terms that are used in Dharma talks, such as Dukkha, Metta, Sati, Sila, Samadhi, Panya, Nipana words like that, there may be, I don't know, 25 of those something like that that would be really commonly used. Teachers will, of course, most frequently translate them when they say them but every now and then not. And so just knowing them can provide a little connection. A good place to learn some of these words would be various glossaries of Polly terms and on Sutta Central when David was showing those indexes at the bottom. The last one he didn't show was called terminology. And if you click on that one, while you're checking out also the similes and the names and so forth. You'll get a wonderful reference for basic Polly words. So I would recommend looking at that resource. And then once you've seen a good glossary like this you might get interested then in learning some of the key doctrinal terms such as those that are found in the lists. So you might want to learn the five faculties, which are Satav, Virya, Sati, Samadhi, and Panya. So you recognize maybe some of those words that I said earlier, or you might want to learn the factors of the eightfold path or if you're more ambitious the 12 steps of dependent arising and we start to get interested in these words sometimes and how they resonate through the teachings. And then we might move on from nouns to verbs like the noun Sati mindfulness comes from the verb Sarati to remember. And so that can be useful to well, remember. Now we don't learn Polly in order to speak it, but there is, I think also some value in learning pronunciation. And for me at least basic pronunciation, you can see for yourself but for me, being a little bit careful and making some effort to pronounce the Polly is part of the respect that I offer to the language and to the tradition. I want to share my screen show just some really basic pronunciation terms. Let me see if that works. Yes. Okay. So if you learn just four things you can really do. Is it showing okay thank you for the thumbs up. If you learn just four things you can do really well with Polly. First is that C is pronounced CH. So the word like chara and or cheetah. That's even better. Okay. And then th is an aspirated T it's not like, like, we don't say there about like the word therapy. Although it's a nice link, I guess, but that would be a Tara Vada, so a T with a aspiration after it Tara Vada. And then pH is not pronounced like F in Polly it's pronounced it's an aspirated P. So that's P with a after it. So Diana likes to give the example that it's like the pH in upholstery. So this word Pasa contact is also pronounced in that way. And then we can distinguish long and short A's which Diana mentioned earlier so here we have Tara Vaa, the long A Vada, Tara Vada. So there's the A and the A two different kinds of A. So then, this is really near the end, but the time I have but I'm going to scroll down and give you a little quiz. Can anybody pronounce this word. This is a word for the Buddha, so it's, you know, kind of important so this word is pronounced to target to a target to based on some of those earlier rules I had. So, this is just, you know, some examples and it's it's worth it to go through somebody made a chat comment about whether the, there's a pronunciation, it's possible to hear the poly on to the central, and it is I do recommend that as well. And also the chant that we heard was in poly for example and that that chanter had really excellent poly, I have to say, they had Sri Lankan accent maybe but the poly was very clear, I thought in that chant that we heard last time. So, if you really want to go deeper into all of this we're going to give you a handout that has, you know, places you could actually learn poly grammar. And also, no references like to this book I mentioned earlier reading the Buddhist discourses in poly, which is kind of nice, not a beginner book, by the way, you would want to start somewhere else. But just my last point is that, for me, I'm not a poly expert but I have put some effort into it over several years, and have found in my own practice that there are new Dharma understandings from reading the text in poly compared to reading them in English, so I just offer that from my experience it's not necessary please don't feel obligated or get guilty or feel like this is necessary, you know, anything like that but just just sharing from my heart. There's something about these texts in their original language that can resonate and can deepen practice when we're connected to the text also in other ways it just settles into the system, somewhat profoundly I would say, and that provides a transition to being to tell us more about the deeper contemplative aspects of these sacred texts. Yeah, thank you, Kim, and thank you for my co teachers I just truly delighted to being a student. Teachers here. So, we'll take a moment to maybe transition to another way being with poly cannon. And maybe in transition from what Kim Diana and David said, I'd also encourage those of you who have a different mother tongue and different language. I know that some of them are available and that you can look up for me, my mother tongue is Chinese and reading it in my mother tongue language, the translation sometimes can be very powerful and like Kim was saying, evoke different sense, because the language also involves culture or hearts that may be hard to be expressed if we're only looking at one specific way of relating to it. So that's also available. And I'll shift the gear by saying that some of you might have heard Gil Frontstone, one of our teachers have said this, often on maybe retreats and even in the pandemic period I heard him saying this a few times that is, imagine yourself to be a contemplative. Imagine yourself to be a contemplative. And I found out this word contemplative and the contemplative life evokes a sense of vividness and being alive and unwashed. And so today, one way I was thinking of sharing some reflections about how we establish cultivate relationships with poly cannon text is along the lines of maybe a contemplative relationship with this text. We're entering into this world and not kind of Russian just all of a sudden getting to know everything and reading this huge books and I certainly had done this before. And I remember trying to tackle this city manga one of the commentaries and was so effective to put me asleep. And I remember from your while, not until I really deepening in the practice and doing it on retreats and and in daily life at some point, I find my mind ready to take in the text and so I think for all of us, when we engage with this text. And I think that this is a little by little kind of a process. So, I'm going to go through some of the notes here. So I want to see a few words about how one can deepen the contemplative relationship with text and maybe offer some tips and some methods or her. I'm based on some of my own experiences working with with the text and observing others as well. But I would say this isn't a maybe just one kind of relationship and then for those of you who are engaged with this. Maybe you find other ways that not necessarily lumping into contemplative and then could be very supportive in your cultivation as well. But I just say today, and this will be the focus of my reflection. And I'll speak about this in few dimensions and that has to do with cultivating our understanding and reflection of the teachings from the text. And maybe remembering the text and then acting according to the teachings. And we heard a Diana sharing this Dhammapatta verse. When we hear the teachings, how we act. And then the last one is knowing what what the teachings are pointing to for ourselves. And so the first dimension in terms of understanding the teachings from the text. Often, I guess a lot of us engage with the text through reading. We can do silent reading. We read out loud. We've heard some of this in our course. Also, maybe reading at different places, sometimes fast, sometimes really slow. And I would also kind of invite some creativity if you're reading with a small group together, especially the scenes in Mahatma Nikaya, you can act them out. And just really make it alive in you. Visualize the scene and kind of act it out. And for me, I also have recorded my own reading of certain passages in the sutta. I know Diana recorded many sutta and as she read in different sutta classes, sutta study classes. And then you can listen to them. And they're also audiobooks now. For me, was evoking kind of different senses in engaging with this text, allow the text to begin to sink in ourselves deeper. So maybe you hear and you read and then you evoke your own voice or others voice into the system. And then also read them again and again and again and again. So at different times. And so maybe different times, different words will start jumping out at you. And some of them you may not understand, like Diana was saying, you may have even a sense of dislike. But over time, something may shift and change in terms of how you relate to the text. So that's related to understanding and maybe reflecting the sutta. And then you can also bring the verses in, in a meditative contemplation, just like a couple of times that we did in this course reflecting upon the text. And I love, I think all my time spent in reflecting the text and studying text at work in study groups. So that's another way as you know you're all experiencing this together. So a whole group of people doing this together. And I remember early days of a sutta study led by Cheryl Catherine was happening in Kim's apartment. So doing that in small groups and can be really really helpful. And the next dimension is after maybe reading, contemplating, reflecting is to memorize and maybe remembering the teachings, some of the verses really touch you, set them in our memory, the whole mind and heart and body. And part of it is, I know for myself, I'm very forgetful. I'm going to read a bunch of things, but then a lot of things just kind of fall out of our memory. But if we're really kind of making tension to set certain verses that touch us deeply in our memory, it has many different functions. So for example, the medtasutta we shared. It has a protective function for me. So sometimes if I feel like I'm rushing about to say something that probably aren't very nice then helpful. And I could remember the words. And this is what the wise people would do. And I'm to kind of take a pause. Oh, oh, okay. You know some other options might be available. So you have this function of protecting ourselves and also really just to remember like a study to remember to remember being here. And so I'm setting it in memory, whether through chanting, bring it alive in us or play a recording and letting them set into the system. Practicing with the text on a retreat can be really helpful. Some of you may have done this and I know Biku Anariel has came to IRC before did retreats where sutta study is part of it. And so if you have opportunities, definitely, you know, that's another way of engaging with the text. And act accordingly. That's maybe the last word I'll say that is the text touches us in certain ways when we began to cognize it, understand it, but not until we really sink deeply in our own body, mind and heart. We are not yet changed by it. So allow it to change how we behave, how we act, and how we operate in this in this life in this world. And the last word I'll say that this kind of a deeper and richer relationship with the text comes gradually. So not overnight. We don't have to rush ourselves and we must do something we must behave a certain way. But really allow it to take a sweet time. And so, then you all enjoy this journey, maybe a lifetime relationship with the text. So, thank you. Thank you, Ying. Now, in the unhurried spirit that Ying just encouraged us to, we'd like to move into some small group discussion of what's coming up for these things. The question for the groups is sort of, how might, given what we've just been exploring these last couple days, how might engagement with the Pali Canon fit into your practice? And for those who already have a place for it, what's new? What might come up that you've heard about that you hadn't considered as a way to use the text of the Canon to enhance your practice? These will be groups of four or five will have about 20 minutes or so. Why don't we proceed in the order of the first initial of the screen name? And go in a spiral, move around, maybe just pointing out one thing that comes up for you and, you know, reflecting on what comes up with others and use that kind of format to have a rich conversation. If you notice resistance, again, kind of riffing on what Diana and Ying have both pointed to, if there's resistance or if you feel, you know, an intention to master the 57 volumes of the Pali version of these texts of the Sutta Pitika. Just watch those things as they come up in your practice. If somebody seems much more experienced and you feel as words that have come up about ignorant, I've heard today, or, you know, not knowing much, just watch those things come up in your experience. This is another way that we just make immediate use of this, of everything that comes up as practice. So if we're ready, Diana, I tried to give you enough time to do the work behind the scenes. Enjoy. Enjoy one another's company. Here we go. Let's wait for a couple more groups to close. There we go. Good. Maybe that's all of us are close. So we have just a few minutes for questions or anything, shared reflections, anything that comes up in the breakout rooms that would be useful to share with us. So, again, use your Zoom hand if you can find it in your version of Zoom and share a reflection, ask a question. And I see, just looking at hands, Randy has previously asked a question today, so I'm going to just say Nancy. I see Nancy's hand up. Thank you, David. Are there. Is there a specific study group of people that read aloud read the text aloud. You know, if you find a couple friends to do that there is one. I think I think there are many. I think there are many and we really encourage people to sort of, you know, begin begin one and others, other teachers may know of specific ones but I think there are there are a lot of study groups and you know if you're in one and there isn't reading that that would be something to add. So anyway, that's my, that's my first response. Kim Ying, are there ones that you know of that you can refer Nancy to. Yeah, Kim has one. I wanted to be careful, but. Yeah, I offer a weekly suit of contemplation on Fridays from 11 to noon online. And we could include some information about that and not follow up email. Everyone's welcome to join and we read the text out loud and then discuss. Great. Thank you. And maybe I'll just say the girlfriend stolen I are starting a course on the module and the kind of starts next week. And for that, there will be audio recordings of the suit does so that you can listen to them as well as read them and the audio recording is me right but so you not, I'm not a professional suit or reader, but somebody who has a love for the suit does. You know, part of your class. Yeah, a final note would just be that we will continue our intention at yankin Diana's and mine is to continue offering these classes in this study and practice mode, in which we, I think, more and more. We read texts out loud, because that can be such a inspiring thing to do and thing to hear so keep joining us for these find them on the city center page and we'll probably provide some links going forward. So, let me call next on April. Oh and unmute yourself April. Just a technical question because I'm usually technologically channel and really have to work at it. So, this, this, these sessions you're offering are going to be separate from the actual class that Diana and Gil are doing correct which is on Thursdays from 330 to 430. But you will also offer separate opportunities for maybe group engagement or clarification of the teachings or whatever. And the link, you already said the link. Something like classroom something or another. So just technically, maybe go through how if people didn't get the link or they need to know how to navigate it. How would we do that. So both, both sessions are going to be recorded. And you can go back to either of them. If you can't make it. Correct. But they are going to be, they are going to be separate. When the emphasis is on reading all the material. Before the class, whether you're going to hear it around a recording, or you can manage it in person, the idea is to go through the material, so you can make some sense of it, as you go as, as the classes present. Exactly. So, yeah, I'm just trying to clarify the process because I found it kind of confusing. Like, what's the, you know, that, that these were foundation classes but that's not the actual class. So I had to kind of work through in my mind. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know if other people had issues. I mean, apologies if it's not been clear and probably it's because we continue to sort of build the airplane on the runway as we. But yeah, our intention is to this be sort of a, you know, a foundational class for people and that and that any of the other classes in a way now when we refer to the Satipatanasuta or Majima 10 or Majima Nikaya 10 it'll make a little bit more sense and be easier to find. And then, you know, we continue to record and provide links to those when when that seems like the right thing to do. And then, you know, these classes are follow on classes only in the sense that we're kind of offering through IMC and the Sati Center and they are all kind of interrelated they all bring various versions of this group together who cares about bringing the suttas into their practice. And then Kim's classes yet another, another. Just clarify and. Because there's so much going on. Yeah, yeah. Maybe I'll say just one minute of somebody else do. Yeah, but with the Majima Nikaya class that Gail and I are doing that we set up a Google classroom, and we're just going to be building on it just be adding and adding and adding more and more documents as the course goes. So that's a little bit different than what we are doing here here you didn't have, you didn't have to read things beforehand. Right. But, but, so to get into that Google classroom following the link that you got after you registered. You have all the material. So let's take one or possibly two more questions Sandy you have your hand up. I just wanted to follow on on what you said about memorization. Thanks to Kim's encouraging us during her sandwich retreats to read the meta suit every morning. I love the translation that she gave us so much that I memorized it and have made that sort of a daily practice for myself of reciting it first thing in the morning. So I just wanted to encourage people when you read something in the suit is that you really respond to that memorizing it can can be a really wonderful thing because you just have a different relationship to the text. Once you've memorized it, and it's it's kind of part of you versus just reading the words on a page. And for people who are interested in that I just wanted to say that particular translation is called the Amara is done by was done by the Amara Vati Sangha. I'll type that into the chat, you can Google that and find it, it's just a terrific translation. Yeah, very much appreciated Sandy nicely noted and an additional aspect of that is that, you know, when you bring things into your mind you're you're continuing this practice of thousands of years of this being a way to incorporate the Dhamma in your in your life, and you're continuing to carry it carry it on, and you'll find it per se, with regard to something we've been talking about today that here and there a word will stick. Maybe it's a pronoun, or maybe it's another thing and that too is a way of engaging that is in your mind it's like oh this word this or this translation of a word, you know, just doesn't, it doesn't, you know, that something's going on in the mind so that that is something also to be encountered with memorization or just reading out loud as people have pointed to. So, one more question I saw Randy's hand up and Randy I didn't mean to say, go away, we do have a minute, if you have a question come back, where's Randy, and if not, that's fine and if there's another question. Hi. I actually just had a little technical question for it to follow up on something Diana, you said last week which was the relationship between Sanskrit and poly that do which I can Google also but you said that the relationship was like between Latin and French. So, it that kind of intrigued me so I wonder if you had anything else to say about that. I guess my point was, well let's say this. If you study Sanskrit, you can figure out poly. But if you study poly, you can't necessarily figure out Sanskrit. And because. So, in the same way that French doesn't have as many cases declensions if you like, as Latin does therefore French is a little bit easier. That's kind of a thing. So maybe I'll just stop with that. So thank you for those questions we appreciate that. Appreciate hearing what comes up. And I'll pass it over to Kim to sort of start to move us toward toward close. Great. Thank you. So, yeah, we're getting near the end of the second session and final session of this course on entering the world of the poly cannon. And I just want us to maybe step back and gather a bit in these last few minutes. So we've really been on quite a grand tour, if you will, you know we looked at a little bit of the history of how these texts were put together and we looked at particular translations. We felt them in our body through the readings we considered that the, they're in the original poly language strategies for contemplating and making these texts, a part of the practice. And just so we've really kind of made ourselves somewhat more intimate I hope with these sacred scriptures, and with the teachings that they transmit. So I thought we would just take a moment to reflect and just consider for yourself among all those things you don't have to then say, Oh no, what was all that. Don't worry about it. Instead, think about kind of focus on the highlights that stood out for you. You just take a moment of reflection. What is it that is lingering in your heart from these two sessions together. And then I would invite a sense of trust that what feels meaningful to you right now about all of this that we've covered about the poly cannon is probably exactly what you were supposed to receive from the course. It's just the perfect thing. And so just having that sense of trust is one more contemplative method for approaching the suit is, is we just trust that what we read will stand out in certain ways and that what's meaningful will start to work in us. And as it works we change, and then when we read the text something else will seem meaningful, and there's a process going on there. So I would like to end on that note of trust of faith in these sacred scriptures that we've looked at. And in the spirit of continuing to engage with these we all just mentioned that our next opportunity is actually coming up in just a couple of weeks. We'll have a short class three sessions on the awakening poems of the senior monks and nuns the Tara gatta and the Terry gatta and Diana's going to put a link in the chat. If you want more information about that. So that will be, you know, perhaps somewhat different from the classes where we've looked at pros and certainly from this class which has had a lot more informational content so that we and we did that deliberately that's so close to this one we thought let's do something really different so we're going to look at poetry. Yeah, I think that's it so I'll pass it on to David, or if there's anything else that needs to be said that I forgot somebody else could chime in. And I'll just be back right on on what Kim said by saying to that, having spoken now about reading the texts out loud, we that will be part of the awakening poems class we are intention is to use our voices but also your voices and and sort of bring the readings bring these verses into our practice very directly by putting them in the voices of the community that is guarding and transmitting the teachings in this way. So let me, let me end with a couple notes we often get questions after the class or at this point about how people can support the these offerings at the city center. We, the four of us I can speak for the four of us I think here, we love the way that the Dharma practices supported Boyd up by a field of generosity and gratitude makes us really happy to offer these teachings freely, and just seems like magic that the city center and IMC and IRC are all supported entirely by the community's practice of generosity and the incorporation of generosity in their practice as part of their practices Diana said, an integral part of the practice, certainly that practice that we see reflected in the poly cannon. So having said that Diane is going to paste in there a link to that allows you to go straight to the little donate button on the, on the city center page, should that be. Should that be part of your practice. So, let's close it's a minute after but let's close with a brief dedication of merit. And I'd like to recognize in this, the generosity of spirit that brings us together as a community to, to engage with these aspects of our, of our practice and may to make to evoke the simile or metaphor of the raft. May this engagement with the poly cannon may the poly cannon itself be something that we use that's useful to us in crossing over and becoming more awake in the world. May we not cling to it. May we take benefit from our engagement with it and share that widely with all the people we come into contact. And may we not experience it as a burden, one more thing to be mastered or done or done well, may we hold it lightly and find in it, both inspiration and insight. So may all the beings affected by our practice, big and small, here and there. Safety, may they be healthy, may they thrive, may they be free from suffering and the roots of suffering, may all beings be free. And with the fading of the third bell, we invite people to unmute and say farewell till our paths cross again, which may be just in a couple few weeks, or sometime in the future. Take care everybody. Thank you so much.
