 So that was a little taste of ancient Buddhist practice that goes back to the Buddha, meditation on goodwill. Or usually in English it's called loving kindness. In the ancient Indian language it's called metta. And the word metta, maitri in Sanskrit, is a cognate for the word for friend. And maitra in Pali is the word metta, the word for friend is metta. And metta is metta. And metta, this feeling of loving kindness, is a kind of friendliness, offering a friendship or friendliness to ourselves or to others or to our experience. The Buddha offered this as a practice for a lot of different reasons. One reason he offered it is as a concentration practice. To say these phrases over and over again helps us stabilize and concentrate and focus the mind. And the mind is really scattered, it's very hard to meditate. He also offered it as a protection that if we can go through our life with a sense of kindness or friendliness, you tend to be treated a lot different than if you go through life harshly or unfriendly. So it's a kind of protection. And the tradition says it protects you from snakes and scorpion bites and charging elephants and all kinds of things that I'm sure you're concerned about. And loving kindness practice is important because it begins working on our relationships, understanding what they are. And sometimes in doing this practice of loving kindness, what becomes very clear is we don't feel loving. That's not what's going on. In fact, here one more expression of loving kindness, you know, you're probably going to choke the guy. Sometimes this practice of loving kindness can arouse anger in people, not because they're not necessarily angry at the practice, but because it's kind of like you think of this loving kindness practice as kind of being a tenderizer. And there's a lot of crust and hardness around the heart. And as the crust of the heart gets tenderized, what's in the heart gets released. And the heart carries a lot more than just courage or love. Sometimes it carries anger and resentment and grief and a lot of different things. And as the heart begins to soften, those things can bubble up. And part of the functional loving kindness practice is as a kind of a cleansing practice that begins cleansing the kind of things that would maybe get in the way of being able to go really deep in meditation practice. So loving kindness practice is called purification practice. It kind of clears the heart for the deeper work that's going to follow. Also as we said with generosity, if you practice generosity, you get to see where you're holding onto, where you don't want to be generous. If you practice loving kindness, you get to see where you're not kind, where there's ill will or something going on or coldness or indifference or all kinds of unhealthy relationships to others. And it's considered helpful to see that. So as you try to explore, what do we need to be kind here? Can I find, can I generate goodwill towards others? We learn a lot about ourselves in that process. One of the things we learn about is how we relate to ourselves. In the teachings of the Buddha, in doing loving kindness practice, you're always supposed to start with yourself. And for many people, especially here in the West, self is not a very easy person to do loving kindness to. Someone once said that it's almost as if in the West you're not supposed to like yourself. If you like yourself, that's selfish, it's self-centered. You're not supposed to like yourself. You're supposed to kind of feel like you're somehow unworthy or not quite up to snuff and a little bit of embarrassment to the human race. And the idea of kind of feeling good about yourself and feeling that you're precious and valuable doesn't really have a good place in many Western psyches. In Buddhism, the idea is that we are, each of us individually, very, very precious. Human life is a very, very precious phenomena. And in that we have human life, it's a really precious and dear thing. It's a lovely thing. And to feel that preciousness, to be concerned about that preciousness and to have love for our kindness towards it is considered to be one of the pyramids, one of the foundations of that pyramid. If you can generate a friendly relationship to yourself or a friendly relationship to others, when you sit down to meditate, you're much less likely to be consumed by anxiety or consumed by animosity or consumed by desire or a lot of things get in the way that wouldn't get in the way if basically it's very simple relationship of friendliness, to be friendly towards yourself. I know a lot of meditators can have an unfriendly relationship to their thoughts, as if thinking is their enemy. If you only have the mind just shut up, then I can really sit and meditate. And we would like to try to develop a friendly relationship to any part of our experience, be friendly towards our thoughts, friendly towards our feelings, friendly towards our body, friendly towards the whole realm of existence. Working that, massaging that, seeing what it takes to get that, working with the difficulties of finding that is a very, very important spiritual practice in its own right. So the loving kindness practice begins with ourselves. And then as a meditation practice, it's extended to it towards others. And the first other person it's done towards is someone else for whom it's really easy to have goodwill. And in the tradition, the assumption is that that's your benefactor, someone who's just been really generous to you and helpful to you in some way. And so it's an uncomplicated relationship and you just kind of offer your kindness back. Then you do it to a friend. And a friend you might have a lot of care for, but a friend might be a little bit more complex. You feel a lot of friendliness towards your friend, really good. But they did take your car, borrow your car once and return it a little bit scratched. You feel a little bit, a little more complicated, a little bit with friends can be. But so you start working with developing that open-hearted goodwill that someone is easy for and you start working kind of working to expand it outwards to people from who it's not quite as easy and they're not quite as easy, not quite as easy. So you go from benefactor to friend and then you go to neutral person, someone who you don't really know very well but could be encountered casually and you don't have much of a feeling for them and for or against. And you see if you can develop kind of a basic sense of goodwill towards that person also. And then you try to do it to someone who is considered to be, who is a difficult person for you, the jerk. Can you see what does it take for you to somehow find the capacity to have some basic goodwill for someone who is difficult in your life? That's not an easy endeavor, but it's considered to be a spiritual practice in Buddhism to work that edge, to explore what does it take to ask the kind of questions that Pasha asked. How do I do that? How do I see someone with compassion or loving kindness who is a jerk? And the important thing to realize is that you're not doing it for that person's sake. You're doing it for your sake because the opposite of having a capacity to be loving or kind or open-hearted is to be closed. The assumption in Buddhism is something like the basic nature of the heart is to be loving. And it's not loving if there's crusts over it, if there's resistance or holding back or fears or angers. And we want to return the best we can to the natural state of goodwill, the natural state of love or the nature of the heart. So a very important Buddhist practice is to work with this goodwill. Some people don't like it. When I was introduced to this practice of goodwill, of loving kindness, I did not like it. I actually thought it was ridiculous. And I thought it was artificial because it was generating love, feelings of goodwill. It's either there or it's not there, but you don't kind of muster it up. That's not really sincere. And so I basically ignored my teachers for quite a while and they didn't seem to mind with this particular instructions. And then at some point in doing the mindfulness practice, the heart began to dissolve and all this love started shining forth, kind of being there. And then I understood what this practice of goodwill was all about. It was kind of natural. A strong sense of goodwill naturally arose as the mindfulness practice purified my heart. So some people will put it off and forget about this layer of the pyramid because it's too difficult and go to a higher level and then it kind of goes, works backward also. Or in some people, the classic path is to develop this layer of relationship of goodwill. And many Buddhists will start a session of meditation with five or 10 minutes of doing this loving kindness meditation first. They're going to set the tone to set the kind of atmosphere of goodwill, the friendliness in which the practice is going to occur. It's also interesting that as you do this practice of goodwill for others, that your relationship to those people will probably change. It's very interesting, for example, with neutral people. Someone is neutral, you know, someone, you know, maybe the male carrier, someone is relatively neutral. You hardly ever notice the male carrier. You're not home much during the day when they drop off the male. You know, you're kind of like, you're just a person who drops the male off. It's nice. And then you start including that person in your loving kindness meditation as your neutral person. And lo and behold, after a while, you see that person and the person just brings you to light. Hey, that's my person. You know, I've been sitting for the last week at home thinking goodwill towards this person, you know, and you know, it's no longer a neutral person. And it's really sweet thing to do. The Buddha put a lot of emphasis on the importance of love. He didn't use the word love because it's an English word, but it comes to the same thing. What he had to talk about, you know, in some in some Western languages, they distinguish different kinds of love, which we don't do very well in English, I believe. But like in Greek, they have a God and arrows and feel feel yeah. And same thing in Buddhism, there's different words for love. And some love forms of love are understood to be tinged or intermixed with clinging with neediness with attachment. And that kind of love, the Buddha said, is not very helpful for the spiritual path. But there are other forms of love that are untinged by attachment or clinging or neediness. And he gave four, he gave a variety of pointed to a variety of kinds of love, but four primary ones. The first one is this one of loving kindness, this basic feeling of goodwill of kindness towards others. And it's considered to be the foundation for the other three. So if you have a basic attitude of goodwill towards someone and you encounter that person in a day, the person suffering, that goodwill gets transformed to compassion. Compassion is the feeling you have inside of you in your heart. It's kind of an uncomfortable feeling a little bit, but a kind of empathy for that person suffering and the wish that person be free of that suffering. So it's more than just empathy, because empathy is just kind of sharing in the suffering of someone else or the joy of someone else. This is actually wishing that person suffering be alleviated. And if you have the ability, you might act on that or you might not, but it's the wish for it. It's a form of love. Compassion is a very profound and important form of love. If you encounter the same person on a day, the person is really happy, has some great success and has some great wonderful things are happening, a person just delighted. Then the goodwill gets transformed to what's called sympathetic joy. You feel the empathy of their joy and you wish that joy to continue for them. This is really great. You're happy for them and you want to go for it. And I hope this stays with you for a long time. You wish them well. If you encounter the person on a day when everything's kind of going well, these are going really well, there's no suffering, there's no great happiness, everything's going smoothly and easily for the person, then love takes the form of something called equanimity. We feel this equanimity towards that person, which sounds a little bit strange in English. They're called equanimity as a form of love. So I'll give you an analogy that's used in the Buddhist texts for this kind of love. These four. A mother has four children. The first is a newborn and just wonderful to have the newborn, everything, the birth went well, the baby's healthy and sleeps well through the night. And then the mother just has all this goodwill towards this baby, just wishes the baby well and wishes the baby has a good life and is happy and they have a little baby blessing and their friends come over and they wish, may this baby be happy and well, may grow up and have a successful life. Just all this goodwill is there. And the mother has an older child who is maybe a teenager but has a lot of difficulties, a lot of health issues, a lot of personality challenges, has trouble making friends, does a deal with health. And the mother feels so much compassion for this child. And may this wants to help this child to be free of his or her suffering, does what you can to help the child. And the form of love the mother takes for that child takes form of compassion. The child has another, the mother has another child who maybe is 21, has left home for a few years, has graduated from college perhaps or something like that and maybe graduated from college with good grades and just gotten a good job and just feels at the top of the, has a wonderful relationship and just the top of the world, everything is going really great. And then mother just feels all this delight and the love takes a form of sympathetic joy, delight, yes. And then the mother has a fourth child who is middle age, whatever, has, you know, it could have happened. And you know, and has, you know, established in life, the career is going well, has families going well, grandchildren are well established and getting going well. And the mother of there has this quality of equanimity. Another analogy for equanimity being kind of a love is called grandmotherly love. It's a kind of love that a grandmother has, that a grandparent has, that sometimes lacking in the love that a parent has, especially new parents. And you know, grandmother has seen it all before and doesn't get all excited about these things, the kids crying, it has a temper tantrum and you know, the first time parents, it's like, they're like walking on eggs, you know, it's like, but you know, the grandparents, you know, they've seen it all, they have all this love for the child, but they have a lot of space for the child to be who they are and they're helpful and all that. You get the idea, right? So equanimity is a kind of love. So as part of the Buddhist path, for those who are interested to do this, cultivating goodwill is an important part. Cultivating love is a very important part. Some people will do it intentionally, will actually do practices like meditation practices to cultivate goodwill. Some people will act on it in their life. Remember, body, speech and mind are the three sides of the pyramid so that some people will speak words of goodwill or words of compassion or words of sympathetic joy. May you be happy or wish you well or whatever. And some people will cultivate it in their hearts or in their minds. They'll generate, try to generate it and increase the capacity for feeling love. Love in Buddhism doesn't have to be an accident. It's something we can develop and strengthen. It's kind of like a muscle, that if you work the muscle, the muscle gets stronger. If you allow the possibility for yourself to love, if you let the more you can love, the more you'll love. It's like growing a muscle. Some people don't give themselves much chance to love. A little story, maybe it's not a good one, but when my son was, my oldest son was, I think maybe he was a year old or I don't know, pretty young, maybe younger. I was carrying him down the street in Palo Alto and we were kind of walking down slowly and this guy walks by and he really looks serious. Like maybe he looks really upset or moody or stern or serious. And he's walking down the street and my son sees this guy and he gives him the most amazing smile you can imagine. Have you ever seen a little baby give a smile? Like you're like the most amazing thing they've ever seen in your life. They're just in awe. They're just so delighted. I mean, you're like, you know, better than the breast. You know, just like, it's just like, they're just eyes are just... And then my son was looking at this guy in that way and we were kind of walking side by side for a while. My son was just staring at him and I just wanted to yell at this guy, pay attention. Pay attention, you're missing this chance of a lifetime. The opportunity for him to feel some love in return or feel this delight was right there in the sidewalk, but he didn't make it available to himself. He didn't open himself up to make a, you know, just kind of preoccupied, I guess. Are there more opportunities for us, for all of us, for you to experience love than that isn't easy to do? Your partner comes home or your friend comes to visit and you leave the television on and you go like this. You know, it's maybe a great thing to do, I don't know. You know, it's maybe a good thing. Maybe it's really important what you're watching and it's really neat, but it's a lost opportunity, isn't it? You know, as you're used to for some of the walks in the door, it's kind of like, you know, it's an opportunity there to kind of connect. So the suggestion is that loving kindness is something you can work on, both in terms of developing it and in terms of availing yourself of what's already here. If you just kind of relax a little bit and look around and make the connection. When's the last time you told someone you loved them? I remember a friend of mine who, when someone he knew died, he went around afterwards to all his friends and said, I love you, I love you. Because he really regretted that he hadn't said it to that person. He didn't want to miss a chance again. He didn't know what you know. And I was one of the recipients of that. And he was so happy. He was so great. I love you, Gil. And it's a great thing. But of course it's sentimental and we don't want to be that way, right? And also, it's dangerous to do that, right? Because if you do that, then you're opening yourself up to other people and they're going to take advantage of you, aren't they? Aren't they? No. Being kind to people doesn't mean that you avoid using your wisdom in good sense. Being kind to people doesn't mean that you know when to say stop or no. It doesn't mean when you kind of take care of yourself. It doesn't mean that you have to open your door to all the homeless and let them sleep in your bed or whatever. It's fine to say, wisdom is an important part of this. So part of this working of loving kindness is beginning to develop a healthy kind of relatedness to other people. Exploring what does it mean to be kind here? How to be kind? What's wise kindness? To be kind involves taking some risks. And what happens if you start taking a little bit of risk with people? How do you do it in a wise way? How do you do it with healthy limits of how much you offer yourself? To start developing healthy relationships that are based on kindness and goodwill is understood in the Buddhist tradition to create a really good foundation for you to be able to do the very personal work of meditation itself. The deeper kind of meditation work is more personal, interpersonal. So what do you think of that? What's your question now? Now it's your turn. Yes? I like the way this is a very kind of text of loving kindness. The question is not equanimity. I haven't put it described as loving, staying surrounded, or a friend like this, but to do this, I thought it was more something. What was not not good? Is that not a right understanding? Or is that just another way of looking at it? I don't think it's so accurate. Indifference is not equanimity. Equanimity is a relationship, a feeling we have in relationship to someone else, that we would characterize as kind of a loving relationship. It allows the open-heartedness to be there. But if someone is making poor choices in their life, and you can't do anything to change their choices, sometimes equanimity arouses when you realize, you are making your choices, I can't make them for you. I don't wish you harm, I don't wish you suffering, but you're making these choices. And that understanding of how people are responsible for their own choices can help cultivate equanimity and not love. So we're not kind of tumbling over ourselves, or feeling regret, or feeling bad, or being in all kinds of problems that might arise. So I think of equanimity as a form of love, because it's something that happens in relationship to other people. It's a very positive, very warm, beautiful emotion. The heart or the mind is very strong. The mind or the heart feels quite radiant. And radiance of the heart is often associated with love. So I think of it as love. So what some Buddhists will do is they'll actually specialize for a while at cultivating these meditation practices. And it's really a phenomenal thing, the capacity of the mind, the heart, to generate loving-kindness, generate good will, and to be saturated and filled, almost like you'd be filled with white light. Nothing else is filling your presence, or filling your mind or your heart, than just this radiance of love, of kindness, which kind of goes out in all directions. It's considered to be a very deep form of meditation. So it's something we've worked with. It requires a lot of concentration. But there are a lot of Buddhist meditation practitioners who go on retreats, spend long times of their life, cultivating this very, very deep concentrated mind, in which they could have this very, very radiant goodwill or compassion or equanimity or sympathetic joy. It's one of the great things. In places like in Thailand, in Burma, there are monks and nuns who have spent 20, 30, 40 years doing the practice of loving-kindness. And it's said that if you go into their presence, there's like a field around them of kindness and love and good will. That's not just a foot away from them, but you can feel it. And you go into the presence and just feel so wonderful to be around them. So to repeat myself a little bit, one of the reasons why this is an important foundation for the pyramid is that in experimenting and trying to cultivate a healthy relationship to people around us, we have to come to terms and deal with the unhealthy aspects of our relationships. And to be honest about that and to work with that is part of the spiritual life. We don't want to do a spiritual bypass and become an enlightened jerk. I mean, it's possible. There are people who attain certain level of enlightenment. And I know people who have attained certain level of enlightenment and they became worse because they got kind of arrogant around it. And so it's possible. You can take that route to spiritual bypass. But what the Buddha was emphasizing is it's actually better if you do the pyramid approach. You actually kind of work on yourself more holistically. And so your relationships are a very important part of who you are. As you work on healthy relationships, you get benefits from that. A lot of benefits. It's not just you do it for their sake, you do it for your sake also. And you sleep better at night, which is nice. You feel safer when you go into society because you know that you're basically a good person. You also get the benefit that you begin your motivation for spiritual life is fueled or supported by your relationship to other people. That your care, your compassion, your desire to help others fuels your attempt to try to develop yourself spiritually, become a better person. So you're not just doing it for yourself. If you're really plagued by anger, it's really good for you to somehow try to resolve the anger and not be angry. It might save you from a heart attack. But it's really good for your neighbors too. And if you sense how good it is for your neighbors, that's part of the motivation. So cultivating love, opening ourselves up to the possibility of love, appreciating love and kindness in the world around us, recognizing it in others and telling them that you appreciate it. I see something really beautiful in you. Thank you. It's really great. Somehow beginning to help create a field of kindness around you. It belongs to this area of Buddhism, this layer of the pyramid that I'm calling love. Next week we'll go further. Now that we've taken care of the sentimental stuff. So those of you who are uncomfortable with this, like I would have been when I started, you could just, you know, break your tongue and come back next week. We do have a couple more minutes if someone else has a question you'd like to ask. Yes? Could you talk about love in the context of people? And by that, a specific example, I mean right now, regardless of what the situation is, anyone can find somebody in the Iraqi situation that they feel is evil. And can you feel compassion and love for anything you've been talking about relative to the people that you feel are coming around and are peaceful? Well, that's a whole theological question about that. Are people fundamentally some way? Or is it kind of, is it who they are at the essence or is it some kind of layer that's covered over their essence? And you know, the whole question of what is evil. And I haven't actually studied this very much myself. So I'm not, I don't feel qualified to say, you know, what evil is. I just know I have a bias towards seeing people not as evil, but seeing actions as evil. But ready to see people as, you know, as, as if not pure at their essence in some way, they have the capacity for the potential for it. And in Buddhism, we have a story, which a very important story for Buddhists, a story about a man in Anguly Mala, who was at the time of the Buddha was a mass murderer. It said he had murdered 999 people. And he had a garland, a necklace that he wore on his neck with a finger of each of those people. And you go around, people were frightened of him. And the Buddha got wind of this. And so he went into the forest where he was and performed a little miracle play thing. And where Buddha's walking very calmly down the forest and this man started walking after him with his sword and killed the Buddha. And the faster the man walked, he started running. He couldn't catch up to the Buddha, even though the Buddha was walking really calmly and slowly. There's magic, right? And so finally the man yelled out, stop. And the Buddha continued walking. He said, I have already stopped. Why don't you stop? What do you mean? It's up to you're walking. I'm the one who's stopping, telling you to stop. Oh, I've stopped being harmful to all beings, but you're still harming them. And something in that exchange caught his attention. And he was ordained as a Buddhist monk and with a relatively short time became enlightened. And so the idea that people are redeemable, even mass murderers of that degree, that they have the capacity, it's held up in the Buddhist tradition because of that story. But the important thing about this one important thing about your question for me is that is that the important part of the loving kindness practice is you're doing it for yourself, not for someone else. You're doing it so there's no crust over your heart. You're doing it so that your heart is not closed. And even if you're encountered evil, does your heart have to be closed? It might mean that you say no, you might put the guy in jail. You might do all kinds of things that are healthy and appropriate. But you don't close your heart. You're not doing it for that person's sake. You're doing it for your sake. Because if you close your heart, you're hurting yourself. There's a saying in Buddhism that goes, if you're angry with your enemy, you're doing your enemy a service. You're causing a harm to yourself. Your enemy could not do himself because your enemy can't get into your heart. Only you can get there and cause it to suffer. And when you're angry, you suffer. So you kind of see it's like you're doing it for yourself. And that doesn't mean you have to be condoning. It doesn't mean that you have to be soft and warm and fuzzy to evil people. It means that you don't close your heart. And then you do all kinds of wise things. Put them in jail. Last one, maybe two more. It could be quick and then we'll stop. The idea of saying the words may be happy to a friend or a benefactor. I can say that on one level, which is just very verbal in my head. And I can also say it in a way which is very much in my body. And in experiencing a warmth in my heart, and almost a wanting a full body kind of expression experience, it seems to be a lot fuller experience for me. And I'm wondering if that's the right direction. It's a good direction. It's a healthy direction. A direction to be encouraged if it happens. But I'm a little bit reluctant to say the right direction because then you might feel other ways directions might be wrong. It's not so you sit down to do this kind of practice and all kinds of things might happen. You might not have access to warmth. And sometimes it is just a mental thing because that's all that's available. And it's still a useful thing to do. The important thing in loving kindness practice is not how you feel. So you don't have to be all warm and loving. Exactly. It's the intention you have. It's an intention of goodwill. I wish this person well. I don't feel so soft and warm, but I have this wish that they'd be well. They'd be happy. And what we're doing is strengthening that intention because intention is one of the most important aspects of your psyche in Buddhism. And it's like a seed that you want to water and develop and strengthen. Your feelings when you have a lot of warmth and all that. That's much more like the weather. Intention is something that's much deeper and much more long lasting and more of support for us. I invite myself to be a guardian most of the time. I have some areas built in myself to protection. And most of the people that I'm dealing with are coming from about the same thing. They're very inclined to fit and the word face by looking at babies and the thing is smile. Can you speak a little bit to how Red Hat could just open up this garden of goodness? It could do it in a variety of ways. It could do it very directly for some lucky people. Where you're just kind of developing that loving kindness. It grows and grows. Some feeling of warmth or some feeling of love or kindness or tenderness. And just kind of feel like it's a radiance that grows and grows and grows and then from the inside just dissolves the crust. That's one possibility. It could be lovely if it could be that way all the time. Other times what happens is that as a person tries to develop loving kindness, they become more and more acutely aware of how they're holding themselves protected. How isolated they feel. How alone they feel. And they feel the pain of that. A person's only protected because there's some pain inside. And so you feel that pain and your heart might have to break before you can actually discover that capacity and drop the protectiveness. And you might need to cry for a while. You might need to somehow let yourself open up to a depth of difficult emotions that feeling protected has never allowed you to open up to. So that's another route that it takes. Sometimes it works by as you do loving kindness practice, a person becomes aware of anger or resistance or something that's going on there. As soon as they become aware of it, they let go of that loving kindness practice and they switch to mindfulness practice. And they practice mindfulness on those feelings. They try to work through them a little bit. And things like that. Spend more time with babies. It's a very worthwhile thing to do with human life. Is to work through and try to lower the barriers that we carry with us. It's really worthwhile to spend more time trying to do that. So, thank you.
