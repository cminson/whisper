 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So arriving with yourself, opening to how you are in this moment. And this place in this time. And perhaps exploring the possibility of relaxation. Maybe the head, the face, the neck and shoulders can soften and relax. Maybe the arms, the hands can soften and relax. Maybe the upper torso can relax all those muscles around the rib cage. Maybe the muscles across the stomach and abdomen, the middle and lower back can soften a little bit. Maybe the hips, legs, the feet can relax. Maybe too there can be a softening more deeply inside the body. Sometimes it's possible. I find just inviting a relaxation inside the body sometimes can support this. So maybe the inside of the throat can relax. Maybe the heart can relax. Maybe the stomach and intestines can relax. And perhaps too the mind can relax. The mind, tension in the mind is often felt with worries or concerns. The mind being pulled away from the present moment. As there is a relaxation of mind, it quite naturally lands aware here in the present moment. Just a simple awareness of sitting here in this place in this time. An awareness of body, maybe an awareness of breathing. Receiving the experience, whatever experience is easy, natural to connect with. In this moment, it may be the breath. It may be body sensations or the experience of hearing. Maybe with this relaxed awareness, you can simply settle back and let the flow of experience show itself. Sometimes body sensation, sometimes emotions, moods, sometimes hearing. Even at times we can be aware that thoughts are passing through and not need to be caught by them, but just aware. No need to have a contentious relationship with anything. And at times a particular stream of thought may catch us and pull us out of the present moment, take us away from being here. And at some point mindfulness will return. And in that moment, can you appreciate the return of mindfulness? Appreciate this capacity to be aware and to recognize experience. And what is the experience as mindfulness returns? Have you been shaped by what you were thinking about and that's okay? Can you know that? Well, this is how this body and mind are now. Just receiving how you are in this moment, the felt sense of how you are. And if it's useful, it can be sometimes after the mind wanders, it can be useful to remember that relaxation is supportive. If tension has crept in during the mind wandering, it's fine to take a few moments to relax again. The body to relax, the mind to relax and receive. And receiving whatever is simple and easy to connect with in this moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
