The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Well, I've been thinking about... by the way, welcome. Welcome everyone. It's so
great to have you all here. Thank you for coming. It's just nice to see all your
faces again. We're forming kind of a sangha here, but we have formed one. And if
any of you are new, well, a special welcome to you. Nice to see you, yes. I
can't see everyone. My big computer wouldn't work today, so I can only see a
few little squares here, but I see someone who just waved to me. So a special
welcome. And to let you know that we do have small groups that have been quite
supportive to many people to get together in an intimate setting. You know, four, five,
six, seven of us, and we share what's happening in our lives together. We do
some Dharma discussion together, and I think we all leave those groups feeling
a little bit better than when we began. So if you'd like to, if
you're interested in something like that, please just write to the IAMC Senior
Sangha and let us know, and we'll see about getting you into a group. And what
we've been discussing a lot in these groups, these last couple of weeks, is
resting in ourselves, resting in being ourselves, resting in awareness. I've told
this story many times about this Rabbi, Zuzia, when he was dying. Very beloved
Rabbi, all of his congregants were around him, and he was crying, and they were
besieging him. Zuzia, Zuzia, why are you crying? What's going on? Are you afraid
that when you get to the gates of heaven, God will say, Zuzia, why were you not
more courageous, like Abraham? Why were you not more, you know, full of
integrity and led your people through vicissitudes like Moses, and he just
shook his head and just kept shaking his head, and then he said, no, that's not
why I'm crying. I'm crying because God may say to me, Zuzia, why were you not
more like Zuzia? So what does it mean to be yourself? I think that has a, those
words, be yourself, has a kind of a somatic, you have a somatic sense of that,
kind of a somatic relaxation comes over us when we think, oh, I can just be
myself. And why are we, why are we not ourselves so much of the time? When it
feels just so good to be yourself, some woman in a small group was talking
about just sitting with her cat on her lap, and the cat was purring. That's
when she thought really herself. So nice. Why do we betray this so much? Why do
we betray ourselves so much? We live with this ignorance, this confusion, that we
need to be something other than what we are, that what we are isn't enough, that
we have to be something in other people's eyes. We have to be something
special. We have to achieve something special. We have to be something
different than what we are. And we keep running this race, running this race, and
we never win. We never get to the end of the race. It's like a marathon that
never ends, proving ourselves to others, trying to be something special,
successful, whatever, trying to create a self. But none of these pursuits of a
better self have ever created any lasting happiness for us. So maybe the
greatest kindness we can have for ourselves, the greatest compassion we
can have for ourselves is like, forget it, drop it. It doesn't matter. Drop all
this nonsense. Just allow whatever is to be. Maybe there is really not a self, but
we have experiences. And if we relax into whatever is here, and just allow
ourselves to be like sitting in a chair with our cat or whatever makes you
feel at home with yourself, allow that more and more of the time and more and
more situations, that kind of allowing is a great kindness. So let's try this a
little bit. Meditation. So if you could take a loosely erect, comfortable
meditation posture, and relax.
When I use the word relax, I don't mean to become something else than what you
are. I don't mean to create some other special state. We're like just allow. Just
allow whatever is happening to happen. And just sit here, being yourself. Almost
like not even meditating. Making no effort at all. And feeling whatever you
feel. Everything is allowed. Coming into the body.
Bringing a kind intention to this.
May I have the ease of an open heart. And wishing that for your loved ones. Maybe
think of a loved one, or a group of loved ones, and wishing that for them. Looking
at them, looking at them right in front of you and wishing them, may you have the
ease of an open heart. And wishing this for all beings. All beings have the ease
of an open heart. All beings on both sides of the political aisle. They all
races. They all beings regardless of their sexuality. The powerful, the not
powerful, the rich, the poor, the famous, the not so famous. They all beings have
the ease of an open heart. And then come back to be myself. Being at home with
myself.
And whatever feelings you're feeling.
When we talk about rest and relaxation, we think there has to be some special
feeling, some special experience we need to have. But here, there's no
experience we need to have other than what's happening in this moment. Drop the
effort. Just rest naturally. I've had enough of this ignorance and confusion.
Chasing after this and that, trying to become this and that, caring about all
the wrong things. This life that is rapidly deteriorating. Now I just want to
be myself. Forget all of that nonsense. And feel the kindness in this.
I don't have to judge myself anymore. And if we judge, I don't have to judge the
judge anymore. Being kind, even to the judge, just wanting to give it all up.
Kindly allowing this groundless, selfless field to open up.
Open to everything. When we meditate, we often think that
distraction is the enemy, is the obstacle. But we don't have to worry about that.
If the mind wanders, let it wander. If you get lost for a while, just get lost.
Who cares? Allow your mind to leave, to wander off, and trust that it will come
back. It always has. It always will. It always will. To allow this process to
unfold naturally. Just let whatever is happening to happen. And feel the
generosity to yourself in this. Let the kindness pervade your body. The love
pervade your body. I am enough, and I've always been enough.
Giving up all concepts. All expectations. Giving up all worries and concerns about
the future, and the past, and just relaxing into yourself. What zoos you long
for. What we long for. To be free of our ignorance, and all of the stress and
suffering unnecessary. And if you notice in this relaxed, effortless,
peaceful, natural state, if you notice the radiance of awareness, that's a big
bonus. If your body is calm, let it be calm. If your body is agitated, let it be
agitated.
See if you can be kind to yourself. More of the time. Maybe reflect on what you're
going to do today, or what you're going to be doing the next few days. See if you
can bring this kindness of allowing yourself to some of those, or many of
those activities. Why not? Okay. When you're ready, you can open your eyes.
Well, thank you. Thank you for being here, and thank you for meditating. Just as
this is such a great gift that we can give to ourselves, to relax and be at
home with ourselves. What a gift. How generous. How kind. We can give this gift
to others as well. Let them be themselves. Allow them to be themselves. Without
needing something from them, or expecting something from them, wanting
something from them, just let them be themselves. Give them that gift. That's
compassion. That's love. That's just being. Especially to your loved ones. It's
great to have this global wish for all beings to be happy, but when it really
counts is with your loved ones, with your intimate, with everyone, but making it a
point with people that you're close to, your friends, your grandchildren, your
children. Allow them to be who they are. Give them that gift. That gift of peace
and ease with you. Know that inside this person that's so close to you, inside,
they're just like you. They're identical to you. They want to be free. They want,
even though, even if they're not conscious of it, they long to just be
themselves. How nice it would be if they could just be themselves. Have the ease
of an open, relaxed heart. So see if you can see into them, and know them, see
them, and see how maybe you can help them in some way. Maybe helping them just by
being yourself with them, by being at ease with them, like a good grandpa, looks
like grandchildren playing. So as a prompt for discussion, consider this
concept. It is a concept, even though we can embody it of being yourself, and
and how, what situations are you mostly yourself?
What are the conditions for that? Why is that so?
And maybe how can you be, extend this, be more like yourself, more at home, in other
situations in your life. So that's, that's about three or four ideas right
there. So just pick out one or two and, and let's break up into small groups and
discuss that for just a little while. I kind of went on, on to the long, sorry. So
Chris will break you up into break up, break out groups now and can discuss
this. Okay, here we go. We've got 12 minutes. So we would love to hear from you. We'd
love to hear what you, what you share about being yourself. Any, any, any
reflections around that would be an act of generosity to us, to share
yourselves with us. So please, and Chris, I can't see people because I've got this
small screen. So can you just unmute yourself and speak if you want to speak.
I made two new friends. I was sharing that yesterday, David, in our small group, I
had said that my home, where I felt myself and the most comfortable was being
alone in my home. And I have been for many, many years. And I remember when I
did say that, that David's face began to look a little sad for me. And I thought,
oh my, you know, maybe this is not a good thing to feel. And so I mentioned that
just now in our chat with my two new friends. And, and they just made me feel
so, so good as they described their home and so much of their own homes were
very much like mine. Not totally like mine, but so much like mine that it made me
feel. And I'm not sure that David was even responding to what I was saying. He
might have just been thinking his own thoughts, but obviously I'm a reactive
person and very interested in what others think of me. So thank you. I was not
feeling sad for you, Fred. I was appreciating you. Thank you. Thank you.
Yeah.
Okay, please.
In our little group, we talked about the time of this time being filled with
less distraction and more chance to have patience and to be really connected
with, you know, our own lives and be it in Maine or here in the Bay Area, just
the appreciation, I think, for having, you know, the spiritual practice and
having things simpler around you and just having a chance to be relaxed and
with yourself. So that's what I got out of our group. Thank you, Diana. So our
group, we talked a little bit about what we, David had talked about in our small
group this week about acceptance, acceptance of who we are and, you know,
being comfortable with that and non-judgmental but with that and the
other great quote that our, we had three people and the woman had a great quote
that said, what other people think of you is none of your business. And I just
thought that was great. That's wonderful. Thank you.
Thanks.
David Ham has his hand raised. Yeah, please. Just unmute yourself, please.
Hi. Thank you. Our group, we were talking a little bit about what it means to be
yourself and not to be yourself. And then the question of what is often
referred to as not self and some confusion around that or, and I just
thought it's very, been very helpful when I heard Gil, our teacher at IMC, talk
about that the actual translation of that is not no self, it's not self. What
is not self? Not so much a discussion or an attempt to get to a place where there
is no self. And so one of the people was talking about, you know, just going to
Trader Joe's and, you know, the, the, the force that society puts on you to be a
certain way, which, which I would think is more kind of not the self that I
really care about, you know, the self that I care about is the connection with
other people has a more spiritual feeling. So I just thought it was interesting
that your question, David, brought up some stuff about, well, what is the self
and what self do I want to present? Thanks. Yeah, thank you. And maybe do I, do I
need to present a self? I mean, I feel like as I'm getting older, I feel more
comfortable just saying what I think and being myself, it just feels like
something that I'm growing into, I guess I would say. And everyone, we had a kind
of a theme in our group, which was that, I mean, I don't know that we all voiced
this, but several people did, that we're very comfortable being with ourselves.
And of course, that's what's drawing us to meditation and we love retreats, you
know. So anyway, that was one of our common commonalities. We get lots of time
to be with ourselves on retreats for better and for worse. That's true. I have
a something I got an email today about why meditate. Our real weakness is
thinking that we are not good enough, and that there is some outside security
that you have to find. If you feel that somebody else has the sanity, and you
are messed up, then you think that you have to become like someone else rather
than becoming yourself. When through the practice of meditation, you realize this
is what you've been doing, then your life becomes real and workable, because it's
been workable all along.
Very good. Well, yeah. So, thank you all. Thank you for your wonderful
responses and reflections. And, you know, I hope you keep this in mind almost like
a koan. Am I being myself right now? And why not? If I'm not, why not? Why not
just be myself? Am I being myself as a little, maybe a mantra? Be myself. Be at
home. And feel the kindness in the app. So, now we get to hear the wonderful
wisdom of Robert. So, please, please continue with this, Robert. Thank you.
Okay. All right, everyone. It's very nice to be here with all of you. Let me
adjust my screen here. Get it on gallery view so I can look around and see all of
you. All of you wonderful people who've lived a long life to get us to this
point and then find us asking the question, can we be who we are? Can we be
ourselves? Well, I say better late than never. So, I was really touched by David's
talk and his meditation this morning. I mentioned to him, while you were in the
breakout rooms, that he actually took me to a place of deep relaxation that I
didn't expect and haven't touched for such a long time. So, it was really quite
beautiful. So, I want to sort of piggyback on what he was saying and
come at it from another perspective. So, I will start with just a few thoughts.
And this whole pandemic business has really had a profound impact on so many
people. So, like so many others, we've all had to find new ways to accommodate and
adjust to the changing conditions that make the access to compassion so obviously
and vitally important in these times and in the different worlds that we all live
in today. So, some of those adjustments really are quite simple. They're just
being in different parts of the state or the country or the bay or the world. And
there are folks who might have, I don't know where everyone is from, but I know
in the past people have joined us from Europe and Asia or elsewhere. And people
are in different time zones, so we've have to adjust to these time zone
differences. And then there's just this reality of Zoom. It's a whole new way of
communicating with one another that wasn't available to us really in such a
global way before last March. I remember when the pandemic closed things down in
early March, I was teaching a class and one day I gave a class and the next day
I got to notice that there was nobody allowed in the building. And everything
basically changed on a dime and suddenly we had to figure out how to teach
using Zoom. So I say it's a big adjustment that we've all had to go
through and thank goodness for Zoom. And I also want to say that in spite of
sitting here in front of a computer screen by ourselves alone, literally, we're
spread out far and wide across the bay or California or America or the world. I'm
also really confident that we can all sense into being part of this community
that's been growing here, this beautiful community of like-minded individuals
with the wisdom and the experience and really the agency to thrive and maybe
even, I want to plant a seed, maybe even to change the world. So I'd like to
give a shout out to each of you. Some of you come every month, some of you come
when you can, some of you are new, but each one who's participated in these
monthly sessions has played an important role in co-creating the
community that we've actually developed here. And if it wasn't for you, we
wouldn't be here. So having said that and in some indirect way pointing to the
role that each person plays and the importance of the role that each person
plays, I'd like us to take an opportunity to just pause for it, just for a
moment to pause to think about and consider your own unfolding path. Most of
us are seniors, I think most of all of us are seniors, so we've lived a long life
and just think about the path that we've walked on in our life. Consider how you've
grown and I want to suggest I want you to think about all the goodness that
you've created in the world during your lifetime. Think about the people whom
you've touched directly and indirectly with seeds of loving-kindness and
compassion, seeds that you've planted, whether you intended to or not. It's nice
when we know we're planting them, but sometimes just by being who we are, we
are planting these seeds. And at the same time I want to say yes, I know we've all
made mistakes and we've done things that we've regretted doing or we've left
things undone that we wish we hadn't left undone. And yet over the years many of
us have also cultivated real expertise in being hard on ourselves, really hard on
ourselves, sometimes even cruel. It's both and giving the best at us and beating
the hell out of ourselves. So I want to suggest that this doesn't mean that we're
flawed or broken, nor does it separate us in silos of isolation. It is part of
what actually connects us to one another and the messiness and truth of our
common humanity. We are really in this all together. So I want to say that you've
not lived in vain, no matter how you consider the trajectory of your life.
You've made a difference and no matter whether we live for another day or a
year or long into the future, we'll continue to make a difference. And maybe
we even have a lot more yet to offer to the world. Just let that thought
resonate in you. Let yourself feel the possibility. So I want to give a shout out
again to every one of you for making this moment of opening to being open, to
growing, to really continuing to look at what is true for you. Who am I really?
How can I relax into just simply being here? You're all remarkable human beings
and the world needs each and every one of you. So part of the way that we bring
ourselves, I think, I'll speak for myself, part of the way that I bring myself with
more and more skill into my daily life is through the cultivation of the quality
of compassion. You all know that I teach compassion, so this isn't a surprise to
many of you. But really the development of self-compassion is something that it
bears looking at carefully. And I've done a lot of studies around this, but what
it really comes down to is that it's recognized through the cultivation of
awareness. Without awareness, we don't know when self-compassion has arisen. And
while we might benefit from it, the benefit isn't as great as if it's
conscious. So I want to talk a little bit about self-compassion and then I
want to give you all a chance to spend some time thinking about it and talking
about it with one another. But what I want to say is that self-compassion is
recognized through the cultivation of awareness, as I just said. It's a
response to our own suffering and our own stress and the confusion that we get
swept away by whenever we fall into a state of wanting things to be different
than they actually are. And when we don't recognize that that is what we're
experiencing in that moment, when things really challenge us and we wish that
they were different, we sort of are triggered and we don't recognize that
we're triggered. And we will eventually come back. Yes, that's great and that's
true and that's really comforting. But there is a certain skill that can be
cultivated when we recognize that the state of being triggered is different
from the state of being in presence with ourselves. So simply bringing awareness
to that very moment of experience when we lose ourselves, when we are triggered
by something, when we're seduced by something, when we're pulled away by it.
Simply bringing awareness to that very moment of experience isn't itself
enough to awaken self-compassion. So really, my friends, it's that simple and
direct, but as we all know, it's not easy. It takes practice and it takes patience
and it takes kindness and it takes the willingness to screw up over and over
and over again and not give up and not give up. Life is messy. So self-compassion
can be known or experienced in many different ways from the release of holding
on that feels like we've put down a heavy burden and we can finally breathe
easily again. It's like just relax, relax. We don't have to be all the things we
thought we had to be. It's that feeling of letting go, of just putting, putting
down, of just meeting ourselves as enough in the moment. It's as though we have
fallen out of our lifeboat in some way or off of our balance beam, you see, and
we're able to climb back into the lifeboat or get back onto the balance
beam. It can be known in that way. It can also be known as waves of soothing,
beautiful, warm and fuzzy compassion energy that fills this up with the
embodied experience of love. That's what compassion is. That's what self-
compassion is and it's healing. So there are things that we can do and ways that
we are able to cultivate access to the awareness of self-compassion,
but the practices are not to be confused with the known experience of
self-compassion itself. So there are practices that we can engage that will
allow us to recognize self-compassion. Those practices are important and vital
and beautiful, but they are not the actual embodied experience of self-compassion
itself. Over time, or in the end, we finally come to see that we really can't
make ourselves feel or be kind or compassionate to ourselves. And as I've
worked with people, I hear over and over again, if I could just be more
compassionate, things would be different. If I could just feel more
compassion when I'm triggered or agitated or angry about it. If I could
just see it's like this idea of making ourselves be something that David was
pointing to in his beautiful talk. You see, all that making, all that striving, all
that stress making is actually an obscuration of block to compassion or
to self-compassion. So we come to know instead that these behaviors or beliefs
or activities or mind states are what create the conditions for self-compassion
to be known directly as an embodied experience. These create the conditions
in which compassion can arise and can be known. And we recognize that those very
behaviors and activities of mind and body are what we can cultivate as a
skillful means to awaken and bring forth the quality of true self-care, of
self-respect, of self-consideration, of self-compassion. And in doing so, we can
connect with and access this quality in its full fruition. Compassion is innate.
We don't make ourselves be compassionate. We simply access this quality within
ourselves. The way that we describe it comes after the pre-verbal experience of
actually experiencing it, feeling it in some way. And this is true. I encourage
you to check that out in your own life. I have. Just as it's true for me, and I'm
gonna go out in a limb and say, I think it's true for you, it's also true for
everybody else too. Self-compassion, the quality of self-compassion, is closer
than your next breath and it's as elusive as trying to own or catch
hold of a cloud. It is what will carry us through the challenges of our life
from day to day and moment to moment. It's how we meet the things that trip us
up with kindness. You see, if this quality wasn't there, we would be worn down by
life so quickly because life gives us one obstacle after another to navigate
around or over. So it's the transformative power of compassion that can change our
perspectives and our beliefs, our unexamined biases, and it can open our
hearts to ourselves and by extension to others as well. I loved what David said
earlier. He referred to it as, he didn't actually label this as self-compassion,
but this is, he said it in another way, the kindness of allowing. The kindness of
allowing. It doesn't, of not excluding any part of your experience, even the
things that we think we shouldn't be thinking or the things that we want to
think and we are not able to think or feel or be. You see, thanksgivings coming
and many of you have grandchildren and we have families and you know it's not
really safe to get together with them and yes, COVID has given us times to be
alone and and see that aspect of our, you know, hanging out in our homes and so
on and so forth, but it's also created conditions in which people are, you know,
feeling separated and separate. So the kindness of allowing things to be as
they are, as they truly are. You said, how nice to just let ourself and others be
who they are. Just allowing yourself to be with the full spectrum of whatever
you're feeling or thinking or wherever you are. I want to say that you're
enough, you're plenty, just the way you are. You don't have to be other than the
way you are. So my friends, self-compassion is a quality that's worthy of your
serious and focused attention and some people believe that self-compassion is
a prerequisite for true compassion for others to awaken in us. There's this
belief that if you can't be, if you can't love yourself or if you
can't feel self-compassion or compassion for yourself, you can't really feel it
for other people. And that seems to be something that's a commonly held belief.
So in my personal experience, I don't think that that's actually true. I think
that people can be really, really hard on themselves and not even know what
self-compassion is like. And yet they can be compassionate towards other people.
They can recognize and feel the suffering or the distress in others and
really wish and have the motivation to in some way hold or heal that suffering
to mitigate it or to alleviate that suffering. And they can't do that for
themselves, but they can touch that quality, that pre-verbal quality that I
was talking about, where the heart, where you connect literally with the heart
of love. Compassion is an expression of love in response to suffering. So where
you connect directly with this place of love. And when you do that and you can
feel that by extending that quality to other people, you can know that that
quality is something that's available to yourself. Now, if you've spent a
lifetime beating yourself up, it's not so easy. And we talk about judging and
judging the judge. You know, one of my colleagues says it's not a judge. It's a
damned Supreme Court of Judges. It's in there that's, you know, cracking the
whip and commenting and criticizing everything that we do. So it's learning
to not push that away, not try to pretend that that hasn't happened, but just to
meet that moment and see, oh my God, this is tough, this hurts. And just the
recognition of that can open the heart, can awaken the heart. So I learned that
I was one of those people who just did not know that I wasn't able to be
compassionate towards myself. And years ago, I volunteered to to be a
San hospice project caregiver. And David did that work. I know that some of you
probably have done that work, but I recognized that there was this quality
within myself where I really did want to help other people in some way. It was in
its nascent form, but I did recognize that this was something I wanted to do.
And I did not recognize that I didn't have that same feeling towards myself. You
see, but it was through doing that work and cultivating that quality and
witnessing other people doing that for other people who were dying in the
hospice. And the way that the people received the care, the generosity and
the appreciation, the appreciation I want to say for that generosity of heart,
for that compassion, actually created the conditions within myself to become more
and more familiar. And then I had many more years of beating the hell out of
myself before I finally recognized, you know, this is this is the quality if
it's there for other people. But what would it feel like to turn and face my
own, my own moments of difficulty? And because the way that I dealt with that
was that it was those big huge things that were so hard to touch and so off
limits for me that I didn't realize I could start small. I could start in
moments where I got triggered by something. I wanted something, I didn't
get it, or somebody said something that made me angry, or I said something that
I wished I hadn't said, or I was embarrassed about. And to just, never
mind getting caught in the story of whatever the situation was, but to
actually go to that feeling where the heart contracts or I get, you know,
unable to speak or the jaw clenches or whatever it is for you and to just meet
that moment. This is a moment and to just see it. And in this seeing, there's the
there's a kind of relaxation that can begin to happen. So, so with these
thoughts, I'm going to ask Chris to put you into breakout rooms. And we have
about 12 minutes, Chris. So maybe you could. They're about, excuse me, they're
about 10 minutes till 12.25. So maybe you're hoping discussion might be
better on your note. All right. All right. So there's, there's, I have two prompts
here. And one of them is, what are some examples of how self-compassion has
shown up in your own life? And the second one, you can talk about both or either or
anything else you want to. What blocks the experience of self-compassion for
you? Because it's, that's important. If we know what blocks us from feeling
self-compassion, we might be able to access self-compassion. And it's not a
one-off. This is something that grows over time. So Chris, if you would send
them off into their breakout rooms, and then we'll come back and have a few
moments to discuss.
So I think most of us are back.
Chris, if you see people putting their hands up, would you call on them? And what
I want to suggest to everyone is that if you go up to the upper right corner of
your Zoom screen where it says view, and you click on that, the drop-down box will
give you the choice of a speaker view or a gallery view. And if you put it on the
speaker view, you'll then be able to see whoever is speaking. So let's hear from a
few people what your experience was with this topic and what you spoke
about in in your small groups. How does self-compassion show up in your life or
some examples of that? Or what are some of the things that blocks self-compassion?
And please, please don't be shy. What's true for you is true for everyone else.
And we have a certain amount of time to share, so I'd really like the sharing to
be rich and forthcoming. So, Gail has her hand up. Go ahead. Great, Gail. Thanks.
Well, our group was centering on what blocks compassion for us, and we all
seem to talk about the judge as being one of the blocks. For me, a feeling of
hurt will come up, and rather than just stay with it, stay with the hurt, there'll
be all kinds of thoughts about how I should be beyond it or I shouldn't let
it get to me like this. And then other people were talking about different
voices, one of which says I don't deserve to be really compassionate with myself
or another which would say, oh, I'm either selfish or I'm not selfish without me
that every moment something new different can come out and to have the
thought in mind that we're either this or that can block the flowing of
experiencing and including self-compassion. So here's where impermanence
really comes in handy that just we don't have to define ourselves as
anything because we're always in a new moment and selfish moments are bound to
come up to various degrees and acceptance is a lot of it. So that's the
general theme that we were on. Thanks Felicity. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah,
the idea of impermanence, huh? This is a skillful means. You see, we don't have to
define ourselves in any moment. We just have to be with the moment and recognize
that this is what's happening in the moment and that itself gives access to
self-compassion. We're not making ourselves be compassionate. We're just
seeing what's happening and we access it in that way. That's the moment I was
referring to. We have time for one more comment and then we'll do a five minute
break. I wish we had more time for the discussion here, but... Trudy has her
hand up. Trudy, please. You're on mute, dear. Trudy, you're on mute. There you go. Yeah,
I had a gallery view, so it was harder. Yeah, I just wanted to remark along the
same line as Gail that, well, I'm happy that you mentioned, Robert, the
difference between preparing for self... excuse me... preparing for the process and
actually experiencing it. You did... is that correct that you were delineating? Yeah,
I think that's really important to know when I actually experience self-
compassion, that it's a different thing from getting ready and developing the
proper stance and so on. It's like the difference between the map and the
territory. The map is not territory. Yeah, I want to thank you for bringing that
up and I'm going to spend more time on the actual experience than maybe I have
been before, so thank you. Right, thank you. Thank you. Just as we... I wish that we
had more time, but we want to give you a five-minute bio break and then we'll
come back and Fiona will say some a few words with you and... yeah, I feel bad
because this is such a juicy, rich topic. I'd like to just be able to go on with it,
but you can go on with it yourselves. You can go on with it yourselves and just
what Trudy said, to recognize that moment as different from that, which is the
means that you cultivate those conditions for that moment to be known.
Knowing that, if you know that, you can really make a difference in the world
because it's the same for everyone. Every single one of us, that's the same and we
have billions of people who don't know that and you all do now. So, I wish you a
nice break and we'll see you in five minutes.
Well, I feel quite full with David's talk on relaxing around self and being
easeful and Robert looking at self-compassion, that feeling, easing the
heart for oneself and sort of a gateway to also expressing compassion to others
in our world. I had been thinking, this last time, I was very attuned a month ago
when we met about the change in the seasons and had been thinking about, you
know, we're moving into, you know, fall this last week or so here in the Bay
Area, the fall has been quite beautiful but it's so fleeting and we're moving
into a darker time of winter and the season and what I read, I get a lot of
inspiration daily from my insight timer, both meditation and the groups and about
a week ago there was an entry about Diwali, which is not in our culture or
my culture, but I wanted to share with you what this woman wrote. She said, today
is Diwali, the biggest festival in India. It means a lot to me because the entire
family comes together to celebrate. I relate it to this because of
Thanksgiving coming. Any family fights get patched up today. A practice my
grandfather started that we still follow. Everyone participates in booking
traditional food. The best part is lighting clay lamps in the evening,
symbolizing the end of darkness. This Diwali is different. I lost an uncle to
COVID. My husband and I are stuck in different countries and due to the
current situation as a family we decided not to travel to the family house for
celebrations, so each one is celebrating individually in different
countries, cities. Despite the usual cheer, I lit the lamp hoping for better
times, thanking for stability. Things could have been worse and honoring life.
I hope Diwali illuminates everyone's life with happiness, peace and prosperity.
Namaskar. And she put this out to the sangha, this virtual sangha on Insight
Timer. And I just looked up Diwali on Wikipedia and it said it symbolizes the
virtual victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over
ignorance. And that image of lighting, lighting the light, you know, I told my
small group the other day I was sitting in meditation, you know, holding this
subject of darkness in life. And this song from Sunday School came up and I
don't dare try to sing it at this point. But it was, as a child we loved this song
and it was this little light of mine and it was a, we'd hold up our fingers, the
candle, you know, this little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine. And then you
know, it was hide it under a bushel. No, I'm gonna let it shine. And all around
the neighborhood, I'm gonna let this light shine. And I ended up laughing, you
know, while I was sitting on the cushion. It filled me with such happiness and joy
to remember these words. I must have been nine or ten, you know, we learned this
song. And I felt the lighting of this candle, these, the spark, this light and
feeling the same thing, both in Gilles talking about really relaxing into the
self. What is there? What is this essential goodness deep down, deeper than
personality, deeper than our life story? What is this sense of home and that home
of this sense of light? And how to relax enough to just share it, you know, to tap
into it. And, you know, it's still early, we've got a month away now before
solstice. But next weekend, in my root spiritual line was raised a Protestant
and they would talk about Advent. Okay. So this was the four weeks before this
big celebration of Christmas in December. But it really struck me as a child. It
was lighting the candles. So the first Sunday of Advent was you light this candle
and each following Sunday, you would add a candle so there would be more and more
light. And it was not emphasized, but it's this deep tradition in the West to
actually go inside and look in this time of increasing darkness to discover that
light inside. You know, what, what is that sustaining, inspiring light that we
can turn to?
Relax into and feel as our deepest home. And I want to read to a poem on
darkness. This is the time to be slow. Lie low to the wall until the better
weather passes. Try as best you cannot to be or not to let the wire brush of
doubt scrape from your heart all sense of yourself and your hesitant light. If you
remain generous time will come good and you will find your feet again on fresh
pastures of promise where the air will be kind and blushed with beginning. And I
feel that around the garden in nature. I've put the garden to bed for the
winter. You know, it was all this exuberance and life and harvest and, you
know, now all the beds are cleaned up, dark, I've planted seeds, nothing's
happening. It's just all very quiet. I don't know if you can see this. I'm going
to hold this illustration. I saw this a year ago. It was at the solstice time and
it's the roots of a tree and under the roots know the animals sleeping or the
light deep down in the roots. This little girl, she's reading. She's going deep
down in the roots and feeling safe and at home in the light underground. And I
love this image in the garden. This is the time where our roots go down. This
time we're entering into the end of fall, the beginning of winter, really
setting our roots down deep and maybe relaxing into the shorter days and the
longer nights. Sort of trusting how nature goes in these cycles in our life, too.
You know, we have these cycles, activity and then with retreat. And this has
been this one big retreat the last coming up nine months. How to really trust
and cultivate our roots going deeper down and finding new ways to approach a
holiday or the holidays. What does this mean? You know, lighting the light,
lighting the candles of Advent or the the oil lamps of Diwali or the candles at a
Thanksgiving gathering.
Trusting that light. And bear with me, there was this writing from my insight
timer groups. This is the last, I was going to read it last month and I just
was so touched. This was written by a fellow from Northern Canada.
Like so many of us, this has been a challenging year for me. Challenging and
fulfilling, uncomfortable and free. Rot with triumph and loss, acceleration and
deep sadness. Such is life, really. Every year offers a plethora of experiences
and a wide range of emotion to go with each one. Moments, however, and their
relative emotions seem rather amplified this year. Remaining vigilant and
disciplined through tragedy has, at times, seemed counterintuitive. Yet, we
prevail. As winter lies before us, it can feel for me that it's too much. Darkness
descends and with it cold and ever-increasing physical strain. It feels
as though there is a great mountain looming over me and there's no way out
of its shadow. When there's no pass and the summit is impossible, only one
choice remains. I must move the mountain. How exactly does one move a mountain? By
picking up a rock is how? One stone at a time. And when I get caught up in the
enormity of the task, when I feel the job is simply too big, I have lost my way. It
is then that I have forgotten that this moment is all there is. It is then that I
have forgotten there is no mountain. Just this one stone that is in front of me. My
job is simply to move one stone and that I can do. Winter looms. This morning,
snow begins to fall on a dark and lonely Alberta highway, flashing amber lights.
It's a convoy of combines. As they turn down a gravel road, I know that a
community of farmers have joined together to harvest a neighbor's field
before it is buried in snow. As my weary spirit stoops to pick up another rock, I
know that a community of beautiful spirits stoop with me. I know that you
are here to remind me that it's just one rock. That this moment is all there is.
And for that, I love you. Here. Now.
Both these voices to me, the woman sharing her Diwali and the man from
Northern Canada, speaking to this song reached through technology, but felt so
deeply in their hearts, the support of practice, delving deep and trusting our
hearts and sharing that was so touching to me. And I loved Robert saying, what a
beautiful song we are cultivating here. Nourishing our roots, taking the time,
listening to each other and hopefully remembering to light this inner light
that is our home and our deepest inspiration. So I thank you all. Thank
you for coming. Thank you for being here.
So I would like to just sort of extend Robert's wish that our own developing
our sense of self, self compassion is a gift to us and to those we meet and to
the greater world and move forward, trusting our hearts, trusting our true
selves just to be natural and to be open. So blessings to you all. Thank you
everyone. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Nice to see you, Barb. Nice
to see all of you. Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving and we'll see you in a
month. Happy Thanksgiving. Be well, be happy, be safe, really be safe. We love
you all.
