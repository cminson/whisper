The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org. Yes, good. So good
evening everyone. This is the third week that I'm here for Andrea. She'll be back
next week, at least for a week I think, right? Yeah, and she's gonna go off and
teach another retrait. So, I've been sort of following a theme for the last
couple of weeks, and last week we were talking about vulnerability and
inner defensiveness, and I thought I would sort of carry on with this theme,
but as I was reflecting on this over the week, there's a way of approaching this
that's very conceptual, and we can get confused by thinking about these things
too much, and this is, you know, guilty as charged. I do this all the time. I tend
to be a head person, and I'll think something to death, and then I realize
that, wow, it's not really that difficult. All I have to do is feel into it and
experience it. So, I want to say that there's a place for both things, and
when you're talking about something, you almost have to, or I do, because maybe
I'm not skilled enough, but I almost have to talk about it from a conceptual, in
a conceptual way, but that doesn't mean that we can't feel into it and
experience these things. So, I just want to go back for a moment and touch on a
couple of points that we were talking about last week, and that is that in
order to really be ourselves, in order to be intimate with ourselves, we have to
come to terms somehow with sense and the feeling, the actual feeling of the fear
of being vulnerable, because when we touch these deep feelings within
ourselves, these deep places within ourselves, where we sort of lose ground
and lose signposts, there's a feeling of vulnerability that comes, and this
vulnerability can be really unsettling and disturb us, and there's a direct
experience of that, and then there's a description of it, which is what I've
just offered here, and the description sort of is to get one to approach this
without turning away. So, vulnerability to be vulnerable and allow yourself to
be vulnerable is a sign that you're actually opening, that some sort of
opening is happening within us. This isn't easy, this is not an easy process,
it takes practice and it takes learning, and for a lot of us, we are so almost
immediately overwhelmed by these powerful feelings that we can sometimes
touch, and that sometimes come up out of nowhere, we don't know where they came
from, they just come up and sort of overwhelm us. We don't have the
wherewithal to even recognize what's happening, and so there's the experience
of just being washed away by whatever it is that's coming up. So, let me give you
a sort of a more immediate example. When we're meditating and the mind drifts
off and we get lost in thought, we're thinking about the future, we're thinking
about the past, we're on some sort of a, you know, thought train, we're just lost.
We don't have the awareness to recognize that what's happened is
that we're lost in thought, and at a moment, at some moment, we wake up, we
don't know why we wake up, but we wake up and we realize lost in thought. I was
talking to someone on the phone today as I was driving down the freeway, and we
were talking about this, and she said, oh my god, I drive down the freeway
and I'm driving for 10 minutes, and I don't remember a thing because I was
so lost in thought. I don't know how I got from point A to point B, but then I
wake up. I don't know why I wake up. This is a very simple example of what I'm
talking about, and when something comes up like anger, for instance, we can be
lost in anger, we can be lost in anxiety, we can be lost in wanting, in any kind of
powerful emotion, we can be lost in delighting quite literally. So it
requires, especially if these are difficult kinds of experiences, it
requires a sense of willingness to practice just learning how to be with
what's there, just learning how to recognize what's there. So this also
requires courage, it requires compassion, and it requires a willingness to
actually experience this sense of groundlessness, this sense of vulnerability,
and something that I was trying to emphasize last week is to not abandon
ourselves at that moment, at that place where there's a rub, where things are
sort of raw and real, but uncontrollable, they're out of our control, and this
happens to every single person. Everybody in this room has experienced it. I was in
two meetings today, and the meeting sounded like it was about something else,
but it was about not being able to be with this place that scared us, the
people that were in the meeting, and we danced all around it, and somehow we were
able to recognize that's what was really going on, but this really does take
practice. So when we guard against these feelings, when we defend
against these feelings, when we shut down against these feelings, what
actually happens is that we cut off our awareness. Now if you think about it, when
you're having an experience that feels raw or dangerous or vulnerable in some
way, you're feeling this way, there's a tendency to want to not be with it, right?
Or am I the only one that doesn't like to be with things that don't feel good? So
there's this tendency to not want to go there, to not be there, and it can be
something very simple, like I want something, you know, I want tea, I don't
want water. It can be something simple like that, or it can be something really
big and significant in our lives. So when we guard against it, we actually are
shutting down awareness. We're shutting down our ability to be aware of what's
actually going on, and so what we're doing is we're being with the experience
that we're having through the lens of wrong view. We're not seeing clearly
what's happening. This is not right view, this is wrong view, because we
have, we've obscured the reality of the situation, of the experience. So one of
the ways that, one of the ways that we can begin to actually get closer to the,
to being with the direct experience is to practice mindfulness of the body, is to
practice actually making a friend with your body, getting to know what's going
on in the body when it's actually happening, because the mind can be here,
and the body can be here, and they're in two different places, and they're not in
harmony, and when that's happening, there's no realistic chance of having much
clarity. And this is how most of us live. I mean, this is a normal way of living.
This is actually, it may be programmed into our evolution in a way we, we, our
default mode is to really be on guard. We don't want that tiger jumping out from
behind the tree biting us in the ankle. So our default mode is not to be calm
and centered and receptive. Our default mode is to be on guard and being
careful. So this is programmed into us, this is our evolutionary program,
programming, and it's our cultural conditioning. Our culture, I won't just
say Western culture, but the culture of the world today is so fast that we
really almost don't have much of a chance unless we have some, some good
fortune to start to hear some of this, some of these teachings, to slow down
and learn how to become intimate with ourselves, because the mind can trigger
responses in the body, and the body can trigger responses in the mind. It's a
loop. It can go both ways. So we, we have to just begin to recognize that. And so
where do you feel vulnerable? You can begin with that. What does vulnerability
feel like to you? What does it feel like when, when something comes up and you
feel on guard or you feel danger or you feel, you see? So a lot of people feel it
in their gut or in their solar plexus or some people feel it in their, their neck
and their shoulders. And there's a million different ways that you can feel it.
But if you begin to just feel into the sensation of the ex, of the experience
that's arising, you will notice quickly that there's a difference between
feeling the direct sensation and what you immediately start to think about in
response or in reaction to the sensation. Does this make sense? So I get a feeling,
right? This feeling feels like, like I'm in trouble or something. This is
red alert. I've got a red alert feeling. And this feeling might feel, I might just
be feeling hot. I might be feeling a knot in my chest or something like that.
But the mind immediately spins a story. It immediately starts to tell my, I start
to tell myself a story about what's going on. What this means, why this, and pretty
soon it's layered with judgments. This is proof that I'm not worthy. This is
proof that I'm unlovable. This is proof that I'm this. This is proof that I'm
that. You see? And it's not. All that's happening is that I'm feeling these
sensations in the body. And these sensations might feel unpleasant. There's
a word in Pali called Vedana. And it's the feeling tone of all experience, which
is said to be either pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant or unpleasant. In other
words, neutral. So most of us want things to be pleasant. We don't want things to be
unpleasant. And when they're unpleasant, there's a kind of evolutionary and
cultural programming that kicks in immediately that resists this unpleasantness
and wants things to be different than they actually are. When all that's
happening is that we're reacting to a feeling. This feeling, we then, this
experience, we then conceptualize and tell ourselves a story about it. You see?
You have this feeling, you have this feeling, I have this feeling. You have the
details of your story, you have your story, I have my story, you have your story.
The stories are different, but the feeling is the same. You see? And if we can
begin to just touch into the fact that there are these physical feelings, and I
just want to talk about it on that level, on this material level, that there are
these sensations that are just sensations. And these are sensations that are
associated with anger or fear or jealousy or sadness or grief or delight or
happiness or wanting or lusting or whatever it happens to be. That's
what these feelings are associated with. They're just feelings. But what happens
is we misunderstand these things, especially if there's any kind of
unpleasantness associated with it, and we spin off and get lost in anger, fear,
grief, you know, resentment, etc. etc. The list goes on and on. So what we can do by
bringing our attention to cultivating this mindfulness of the body by
making friends with our body, what we begin to do is learn how to be with the
direct experience that we're having. And if we can be with the direct experience,
the simple sensations, in this case I'm talking about just the sensations of
recognizing maybe an emotion or a thought, we can learn how to be with things
that are difficult in a very simple and gradual way. It's like we don't want to
like take the most difficult thing in our life and then try to do this. It's
like not, it's unrealistic and it's not going to happen. But you can take baby
steps, you know, let's not call them baby steps, because that's it. You can
take bite-sized portions of this, but you can know that this is what you're doing.
You're trying to learn the capacity to be with what's actually going on inside of
you, without putting layers and layers of filters and labels between the
experience and yourself. This is how we defend against this feeling. This is how
we separate ourselves from this feeling. This is how we obscure ourselves from
right view. Right view is to simply see anger is present, wanting is present. You
see, when we can see that anger is what has come to be in this moment, we don't
get lost in the anger. We simply recognize that anger is there, and then we
may actually have a choice about whether we're going to engage it or not
engage it. Generally, if you can see that that's what's there, it loses its
steam. You see, it doesn't necessarily just instantly resolve and reconcile, but
it doesn't control you anymore. You're not enthralled with it any longer. But
this means that you have to be able to be courageous enough and have enough
faith and trust that by staying with the actual experience that you're having,
that you might have some deeper insight into what's going on. You see, and so at
a certain point, it does require us to cultivate this sense of faith and trust.
So you can't do that. Most people can't do that. I certainly can't. By just
deciding I'm going to do it, I have to experience it directly. That's how I
started here, and I want to come back to it more than once in this talk. We tell
ourselves, and we understand things sometimes through words and concepts, but
it's through the direct experience that knowing happens. And knowing is what
awareness is. Awareness knows what vulnerability is. It knows what that
feeling is. You see, you don't have to ask yourself, am I vulnerable? You
simply know you're vulnerable. You don't have to ask yourself, am I happy? How do
I know if I'm happy? You know if you're happy, right? You don't have to ask
yourself if you're alive. You know that you're alive. Awareness knows aliveness,
that type of thing. And when we resist our experience, we close down our
awareness. We shut down our awareness. I wanted to come back to that and make sure
that this is clear, because this fragments our experience. This separates us
not only from other people, but it separates us from ourselves. And when
we're separated from other people and ourselves in this way, this gives rise to
what they call in Pali dukkha or suffering. This actually creates the
stress that we feel in our lives. So we have this kind of cultural
conditioning. We have this lifetime of habit of thinking that in order to
survive in the world, we have to protect ourselves. We have to guard against all
the tigers that are coming in all the different ways, the saber-toothed tigers
that are coming in all the different ways at us. And so we have, we see threats
coming at us externally. We feel internal threats coming. We feel all of these
demons, so to speak, we'll call them demons, they're inner demons. And really
what are these demons other than our own thoughts about things? They're basically
just mental states that we construct in our minds through trying to get away from
feeling what's actually happening. And I'm talking about difficult
things, but some people are afraid to actually touch the feeling of love.
They're afraid to love. They're afraid to be happy. They're afraid to be glad.
They're afraid to feel gladness. Just as it's important for us to look at what
causes us to suffer, we can look at the beauty and benefit and wholesomeness of
feeling gladness within ourselves and recognizing when kindness and beautiful
sublime qualities like compassion have arisen. And it's not like we're using
those things to antidote anything. We're just bringing awareness to the fact
that those things exist within us just like all the shadows. So when we feel
vulnerable, I think I said this, it's one of the weeks I was here. When we feel
vulnerable and the heart, this is a sign of opening, let's say the heart is
opening, it's not just these sublime qualities that show up. It's not just
the feeling of love and connection and unity and compassion. These
shadows will come out as well. And this is a purification. This whole path of
meditation is one of purification. When we start to meditate, we sometimes
don't realize that because many people come to meditation because
they're suffering. That was that was my case. I came, I was in deep despair when
I came and found meditation. And my idea was, wow, I need something to turn my
life around because this really sucks. And so my initial thought and my
initial intention was to do something where I could find a little bit of peace
and some refuge and some happiness in my life. And I had no idea
that when I started to meditate, I was going to touch places that I
hadn't, that I wasn't anticipating. And I had no, I spent the first years of
my meditative life basically sitting on a cushion weeping. I had, you know, what
what is this all about? You know, and I'm out at spirit rock right now. I'm with,
you know, 90 yogis out there. And there are people sitting in the meditation
hall and on the benches outside, literally weeping. And you would think,
why do these people come to this meditation just to cry? But it's so
important for people to touch these places. It feels so cathartic. Some people
say I'm afraid to start because there's an ocean in there and it'll never stop.
It'll, you know, and it'll never stop. But it will, it changes. It changes. It's
like we have to sort of let these things out so that we can see that they're
there, so that we can see what's scaring us, so that we can see our demons, and so
that we can see that in fact we're creating our own reality with our
thoughts and our mind states. So these, these defensive mechanisms, this
protective stance in a way where they're just, they're just enslaving us and
imprisoning us in a wrong view. It's to use a Buddhist term. It's just, these
are the things that need to be seen, that we don't want to see, and that we
habitually default to our ways of avoidance or aggressively confronting,
pushing against. You know, some people are aggressive in fire, right? Some people
will withdraw and hide. Some people will just go into, to a denial that's just
because they don't have a clue what's going on. So there's, there's different
ways that we actually deal with these things. But to be ourselves, to really be
ourselves, we have to learn how to open. And in a way, we don't really, we don't
do the opening. We just make ourselves available to what's actually happening. We
learn to see what's actually happening. And in the seeing, we open automatically.
In this seeing of suffering, the heart opens with kindness and compassion. You
see, we don't want to suffer ourselves. When we finally get it, wow, I am really
suffering. When we get that at the level of experience, not concept, but that the
level of experience, it's completely different. And the natural response of
the heart is to open. And the heart will hold us in compassion. When we witness
someone else, even a stranger on the street, that's suffering in some way,
really distressed in some way, the natural response. You know, we go past, we go
around the corner and there's been a car accident and something happens in us.
And we just respond. This is, this is the natural response of the human being is
to open. So to be ourselves means that we have to open. And most of the time, we're
basically guarding against being open. And we have to see this tendency. So I'm
going to read something that Gil wrote. And if any of you are new to the center,
Gil is the founding teacher of this particular center. And he teaches a
course on mindfulness. And this comes from him. It's a beautiful
paragraph because it says a lot in a very concise way. And he's talking about
cultivating mindfulness of the body. And again, I'm bringing this in as a way to
learn how to be with our experience directly and not conceptually. So he
says, one of the marvelous things about the body is that it's always in the
present moment. Now, that's something we're thinking about. Our thoughts and
our minds might be somewhere else, but the body, it's always here and now. So part
of the task of meditation practice is to bring the body and the mind together so
that they're in the same place at the same time, so that they're working
together harmoniously, and so that they're not at odds with one another or
going across purposes. When you meditate, it isn't a matter of bringing your body
to your mind. It's a matter of bringing your mind to your body. Your body is
always here. We have to bring the mind back. So it's a matter of bringing your
mind to the body so the two can be together in harmony. If you're sitting
here and thinking about what you're going to do tomorrow, then your body is
here, but your mind is in tomorrow. If you're sitting here and thinking about
what's on television tonight, then you're here in the present, but your mind's
in another place. It's really important for the purpose of mindfulness
meditation to bring the body and mind into the same place in the same time,
and this creates harmony. So most of us tend to live in our minds. Most of us
tend to live in the world of our mind, and we're thinking about, just like he
said, we're thinking about the past, we're thinking about the future, we've
got plans, we've got regrets, we're scripting everything, and in the middle
of all of this, guess who's there? Guess who's the star of all of this
planning and thinking? Me. Me, me, me. It's all about me. You can be sure when
it's all about me, there's going to be duke somewhere. You can absolutely be
sure of it. So when we begin to pay attention to the body, when we just
begin to pay attention to what's going on in the body, when we begin to
recognize we have a sensation, the sensation is maybe a tightness in the
chest or heat in the chest. So instead of thinking, oh my God, I'm so damn
angry, we realize heat and contraction in the chest, period. And then we begin
to see, oh, this is an association with anger. Anger has arisen. This is the
result of the arising of anger in this moment. We also, if we can have that
kind of perspective, we know that anger will pass. It's not permanent, it
won't stay with us, right? So there's not this tendency to cling on to it. And
most of all, there's not the tendency to identify with it. We don't use this
feeling as a way of creating an identification or a movement towards
becoming an angry person, somebody who's angry. And once we do that, once we
think that we're this angry person, then we sort of, it's like we freeze
ourselves into a frame. And that can last for as long as it lasts. You see, I am an
angry person. I am a miserable person. I am the smartest person on the earth,
et cetera, et cetera, whatever it happens to be. So again, if we can come into the
body, it helps us to let go of the mind and just to focus on what's going on in
the body. This is really important because this helps us to become aware of
and ground ourselves in the present moment. This helps us to know. I'll speak
from my own experience. When I'm wandering around in my mind, when I'm
thinking about things, this is not to say that thinking is a bad thing, but in
terms of what I'm talking about here or meditation, when I'm off on a thought
train, I am not present. I'm not in the present moment. I'm lost in thought. You
see? But when I'm grounded with the sensation of a contraction in my chest,
for instance, at least I know that I'm in the present moment because I'm
feeling what's actually happening. Now, if I can stay with the feeling and not
spin off into a story, then I can really be present. But this helps us when we
start to use the body. It helps us to learn how to be present, and it also
helps us learn to distinguish when we're present and when we're not present. So
the body, if we would just make friends with the body and trust the body, we
could learn an awful lot. So one of the ways to train us in body awareness is
to use a classical meditation that's been taught in Asia and Thailand and
Burma in places like that for thousands of years, and it's called four-element
meditation. And this is where we begin to recognize the traditional four
elements that bring us into the physicality of the body, and the elements
are earth, water, fire, and air. And when I was in Burma, my teacher taught me
this meditation, and he taught it with a specific methodology and sort of a goal
in mind. But let me just talk a little bit about it. So the quality of earth is
the quality of solidity. It's the quality of weight, heaviness, hardness, softness,
that type of thing. This is like earth element. It's hard. Okay, your fingernails,
earth element, your teeth, earth element, your bones, earth element. This is water is
moisture, flowing, liquidity, that type of thing. So the blood, tears, saliva,
moisture in your mouth, any kind of sweat, any kind of, and the body is almost
entirely made up of water, although it seems like it's not. It is. So this water
element, fire is the temperature that we feel, the warmth in our mouth, the
coolness of the air on our skin, heat from fever or anger, or, you know, the
coldness that we might feel in a state of fear. So that's the fire element. And air
is motion. It's any kind of pushing. So this is a kind of a weird thing. But if
you were to bring your attention to your mouth, do it right now. Just bring your
attention into your mouth. Close your eyes for a moment and bring your
attention into your mouth and run your tongue over your teeth. Run your tongue
over your teeth. And you can feel the hardness of the teeth. So you get the
earth element. You can feel the the wetness in your mouth. So you get the
water element. You can feel the warmth in your mouth. So you get the fire
element, the heat element. And you can also feel the movement of the tongue
pushing against the teeth. And that pushing quality is the air quality. And so
you can begin to simply use this, just like people would use the breath as an
object of meditation. You can be with the body and be with whatever sensations are
arising. And just you can purposely go through the body. Earth, fire, water, air.
Earth, fire, water, air. It's a way of concentrating the mind. But it's also a way
of recognizing that this body is simply made up of elements. It's not an
identity like we think it is. Maybe I won't go there. It's a way of being with
the body that sort of allows us to be with the direct sensations. So basically
it allows us to be with with the body without being with the concept of what
the body actually is. So if I were to ask you to close your eye, let's try it
again. Just close your eyes again and hold your hand out in front of you. Just
hold your hand out in front of you or rest your hands on your knees. And in
your mind, just what does that feel like? What does it feel like to hold your
hand out? Now make a tight fist with your hand. Really tight, tighter. Do you feel
burning or aching when you do this? Now relax the fist slightly. What do you feel
when you relax the fist? Now as slowly as you can, open your hand. Just open your
hand slowly. And now you can open your eyes. So I want to say that none of those
movements or exercises were hand. Hand is really just a concept. It's a mental
concept. What you experienced, what we all experienced, was a series of changing
sensations. So beginning meditators will often say, or not just beginning
meditators, but more commonly beginning meditators will say, I felt my hand. You
see, this is how we move through the world. I mean we have to have certain
concepts to move. But actually what happened was we experienced a series of
changing sensations that we have conceptualized as hand. So another
example that I've heard teachers give is to hear the sound of
an infant crying. And basically what's happening is that we're
hearing vibrations strike our eardrum that we quickly perceive and label infant
crying. So we do this infant crying and then comes this Vedana. This feels, oh
that sweet little baby or would that baby shut up? What's the matter with the
parents? Why don't they take care of their child? And we start moving into
these different, you know, so it's the same thing. It's like you hear the baby
crying and you think sweet and I hear the baby crying and I think, what, get that
baby out of here. They shouldn't let babies on airplanes, that type of thing.
So this is what the mind does. And if the mind could simply, if we could
simply, no, we're not going to notice every vibration that hits our eardrums.
I'm not suggesting that. But I am suggesting this is a way that we can
begin to use the body to actually be with our experience. You see, because if
when the fist was tight and it was burning and aching, a story instantly
comes to mind about something's wrong. Why is my fist on fire? My hand is never
going to be the same whatever the story happens to be. Or I've got this tight
fist. I'd like to smack someone. All that's happened is that we're
experiencing the feeling, the sensations of the fist being like this. And we
tell ourselves there's this initial perception and then it spins off into
this story. And we can begin to ruminate on this story. And actually
scientists can track what happens in the brain, how that loop is created, and how
you break that loop. And that loop incidentally is broken through practices
like meditation. Because when people meditate, they create new neural pathways
in the brain that allow the meditator to see the experience that they're having
as an experience that's not permanent, that's changing. They begin to see anger
as anger rather than my anger. Isn't that interesting? Because now the
scientists are in fact validating and corroborating what the teachers have
been, what the contemplatives have been teaching for thousands of years. Which is
not to say that the scientists are in any way less than or the
contemplatives are more than. It's just that it's very interesting that science
can now actually track what's happening in the brain when we begin to do these
practices where we begin to see with right view what's happening. Because when
we can't be with our experience, when we can't be vulnerable, when we can't stay
with that feeling, we are lost on, we're lost on this like gerbil wheel. We're
just going around and around and around and around in circles and we're doing
the same thing over and over and over again. What we don't see is that when I
see the baby as irritating and you see the baby as sweet, I'm actually
throwing the second dart or the second arrow that's in the famous Buddhist
story where there is the direct experience of something being painful
and then there's the suffering that comes when I think why me, how did this
happen to me, this is never going to end etc etc etc. And then I just
exacerbate the pain that I'm actually feeling. You see, if we can learn to be
with our experience just a little bit at a time, just in bite-sized pieces, we can
learn to be with big things that scare us or with big things that delight us
without being washed away. It gives us some capacity to allow ourselves to be
human. And to be human means, I'm sorry to say, if this is bad news for some of
you, to be human is to know that there's shadows inside and to know that there's
luminosity inside and to be able to accept the truth of that. And when you
can, then there's a kind of equanimity that begins to develop that allows you to
live with greater skill and greater wholesomeness and ease. And so in simple
ways like this, we can learn how to be with our feelings of vulnerability without
abandoning ourselves when things get sort of raw and rough. And by
not abandoning ourselves, we're learning how to really be a friend to
ourselves and to the world. We're learning how to transform wrong view
into right view. And when one person does that even a little bit, it has a
tremendous impact on the world. It has a tremendous impact on us ourselves and it
has a tremendous impact on the world. And we can learn to be with things as they
are in the moment and accept that for this moment, this is the way things have
come to be. You see? So whether this is a moment of difficulty or a moment of
ease or a moment of delight, this is the way things have come to be in this
moment. And when we can be with that in a direct way, we're being with the truth
of our experience and being with the truth will set us free. The truth will
set you free. So it's my wish that everyone in this room tonight be set
free. So those are my thoughts for the evening and I hope they've been useful
in some way. And we have just a few minutes if anybody has any questions or
comments or anything that you would like to say and for those of you who would
like to skadoodle out of here, please feel free. Yes. There's one phrase that I
found particularly affecting that you've used over the last few weeks and that
was the idea of abandoning ourselves when we don't stay to experience some
strong emotion or some negative emotion or some positive emotion. And I just
wanted you to know that I found that particularly meaningful and something
that was like, oh, you're right. It was easy for me to understand that. Yeah. I
also find that a particularly useful way to stay connected with experience
because the biggest challenge I think most of us have in our lives is that
we can't stay with ourselves when the going gets rough. So we default to
whatever our temperament happens to be. So some people are angry and aggressive.
Some people are retiring and non-confrontational. Some people are in
la la land and they just, you know, they get lost. So these are the three
characteristics and we default to those things in a myriad of ways. And I may
have mentioned it, but I had this experience of feeling a deep in
meditation, this would happen, a deep sense of aloneness, not loneliness, but a
kind of an aloneness. And this aloneness felt very threatening and
groundless. Like there was nothing, nothing reliable that I could pin my
any hopes on. And there was a feeling of abandonment, but I didn't, because I
didn't feel lonely. I didn't know what that abandoned. And I realized that I
was abandoning myself quite literally. And I think that people do this without
knowing that they're doing it. It's when the rub gets real that we bolt. And
bolting is natural, who wants to be with pain. But we can learn to cultivate the
capacity to be with things like deep grief, for instance. This is not an easy
thing to be with without turning away. And this, this is compassion and this takes
courage. And this takes practice and this takes kindness. And this takes learning
how to be a good friend to yourself and being willing to try. So with that, I
want to say thank you all. And may the merit of our coming together to
practice and to meditate together, may you take out whatever benefit we created
and share it with your families and with your loved ones and with your
colleagues and with the world at large. May we change the world. Thank you.
