Dharmette: Exploring Emotions

Usually I find mindfulness practice quite interesting. 
There’s so much to notice and to be revealed. One of 
the things I often find interesting is mindfulness of 
emotions. There  are many perspectives through which 
to look at emotions and be present for the m. 
 
One of the guidelines for learning to be mindful of 
emotions is to be able to distinguish between living in 
the emotion, being caught up in the emotion, vers us 
having an emotion but, in a sense, stand ing aside and 
watch ing it and see ing it. Or to be pr esent for it, be 
aware of it, without assuming that you are the emotion. 
Not defining yourself by the emotion. It can be helpful 
sometimes to shift from saying, “I’m angry ”’ to “There’s 
anger here. ” “I’m sad. ” “There’s sadness here. ” “I’m 
afraid, ” versus  “There’s fear here. ” Or “I’m happy. ” 
“There’s happiness here ” – whatever  there might be . 
Often when we define ourselves by the emotion, “I am 
angry, ” and then it becomes much more complicated for 
two reasons.  
 
One is that it’s an abstraction. “I am X ” is an abstract 
thing. It’s very hard to get a handle on an abstraction, to really see it for what it is , but “there’s anger here ” – 
that’s not so abstract. The ‘I’ is the abstract thing.  
 
The second reason why it’s difficult is because that 
abstraction, ‘I’,  it tends to load the emotion with a lot of 
other ideas and associations  and meanings. ‘I’ am not 
supposed to be a person who’s angry. “I’m” supposed to 
be showing off all my happiness. It’s not acceptable for 
‘me’ to be this way. Whereas if it’s just ange r, and you  
separate out the anger, or the happiness, from yourself , 
then it’s easier to see clearly what’s actually happening, 
and not be entangled with it quite as much.  
 
One of the perspectives in exploring  emotions is to look 
at them from the point of view of any motivation that’s 
part of them ? Is there any sense of purpose, anything 
that the emotions are trying to do? If you’re angry, 
there’s often kind of a purpose, or motivation, to 
somehow lash out, pus h away, get away  from what’s 
going on. If you’re in love, there might be desire, the 
motivation to want to be closer to that person in a 
variety of ways. If there is happiness, there might be a 
kind of leaning into it, wanting to have more of it, which 
might be part of that happiness, or that  joy. There might 
a feeling of contentment, and that contentment seems 
to come together with a feeling of wanting to settle back, 
just relax, be present, settle in.   
 
Whatever the emotion might be, it’s interesting to see if there’s a desire or a motivation, that comes along with 
it, because it’s often the desire, the motivation  that is 
one of the hooks . When we get involved in the emotion, 
and it influences us, it has an impact on how we live our 
lives. But if you see the motivation that comes with it , 
then you have much more choice about whether you go 
along with that motivation, or whether you try to free 
yourself from it, or not get hooked by it.   
 
Another thing that’s interesting with mindfulness of 
emotions is to notice how quickly they change. There 
might be an overarching mood, which colors your whole 
day. You just feel like you’re grumpy all day, or irritated 
all day, or frightened  or anxious all day . But emotions 
are not solid. They’re constantly being recreate d and 
reinforced.  
 
Lately, I’ve heard of something  called the 90-second 
rule regarding emotions . Have you heard of this? The 
idea seems to be that if you don’t do anything about a 
strong emotion that’s happened, meaning you don’t get 
involved with it  or re-trigger it, then an emotion do esn’t 
last more than 90 seconds, no matter how intense and 
strong it is. If you say, “Okay I’m feeling grief, ” and  just 
relax and let the grief wash through , that wave of it is 
not going to last more than 90 seconds. It lasts a lot 
longer if we get involved. It seems like it lasts for days 
when we’re entangled with it. “I’m the one who’s 
grieving. I’m upset. This is terrible. I t shouldn’t be  like this. Poor me. This great loss. ” And then we tell 
ourselves a story over and over again  about  the loss we 
have . It can be a very real loss  – not to be made fun of 
or belittled.  
 
But there’s something about getting out of the way  that 
allows things to come . Take the approach with anger  of 
counting to 10 . Partly it’s just getting out of the way . 
Maybe it doesn’t take quite 90 seconds to count to 10 , 
but it’s the same principle . You get out of the way . 
Because emotions are  not fixed, solid things  – they’re 
processes that are moving through us  – if we can get 
out of the way enough to let it wash through, it actually 
passes quite quickly. I don’t know where this 90 second 
rule came from but it’s quite interesting, 90 seconds. 
Can you be patient for 90  seconds?  
 
Another thing that I find interesting is how many 
different emotions can wash through, even if there’s an 
overall mood that lasts  all day. One of the fun places to 
do mindfulness of emotions is driving  – to be sensitive 
to all the subtle shifts  of emotions that go on. Again , you 
might have an overarching mood, and you might be 
blinded by that. That’s all you see. You’re involved with 
the mood, the emotion  – you’re involved with your 
irritation, your anger at what’s going on at work or 
something . It’s eating away  at you , and that’s all you 
think there is. But if you relax a little bit and look around 
for the subtleties of what’s happening, you’ll see that as you’re driving, there are a lot of small little shifts of 
emotions  of different kinds. So you’re driving along, 
happily being irritated, or happily being happy, or 
whatever, and this police car pulls up behind you. If 
you’re sensitive and paying attention, probably you’ll 
notice a little bit of fear, a little concern . “What’s this? A 
cop ca r is not leaving my tail . What’s going on here? ” A 
year ago, in Redwood City, I had a police car pull up 
behind me  and stay close . I made a left turn into a side 
street . It made a left turn. I made a right turn. It just kept 
following me, seemingly, through Re dwood City. I didn’t 
know if he was checking up on me, or doing a computer 
search on my license plate, or if it just happened to be a 
coincidence that we were going to the same place. I 
was a little bit more awake [laughs] . My interests were 
directed in my  rear view mirror much more than they 
normally would be. “What is this? ” 
 
And then you’re on the freeway and some car cuts you 
off, or doesn’t let you in , and you need to get into the 
lane. Sometimes there’s irritation that arise s. Or 
suddenly a car brakes a little bit too fast in front of you , 
and a little bit of fear can happen. Some beautiful car, 
some attractive, lux urious car drives by , and you feel 
this desire, “I’d like that car. ” Or maybe it’s the person 
driving the car. I remember when I was growing up in 
Italy – I guess I was eighteen  – I had really long blonde 
hair, way down to my diaphragm area . There weren’t a 
lot of long -haired guys back then. I remember driving on the freeways in Italy , and every Italian man who drove 
by me would turn around and look [laughs] . And I said, 
“Oh that’s what it’s like for women.  They probably get 
that kind of attention all the time. ” 
 
There  are all these little shi fts that can happen, and I 
find it fascinating to ride the kaleidoscope  – the shifting 
and changing . It might seem inconsequential, but with 
any particular minor little movement of irritation, or fear, 
or desire, or delight, or humor, or whatever, if you’r e not 
careful, it can have an cumulative effect on you over the 
day. A lot of seemingly incidental movements of anxiety 
take their toll . They add up over time, and so it’s not 
surprising that at the end of the day , you’re e xhausted, 
or stressed out, or the anxiety has built. But if you track 
the mood or emotion  as you go along , then one of the 
beautiful qualities of mindfulness is that, if you track it in 
a non -reactive  way, and just let it be there, and you 
don’t get involv ed with it  – you just let it wash through  – 
then it tends not to accumulate, not to leave traces. Th at 
slow, step by step, building of tension, or habit, or 
whatever it might be, tends not to happen as much. It’s 
a nice thing to know how to let the  emotion s wash 
through.  
 
I would recommend that you find some situation where 
you can practice the kaleidoscope approach to 
mindfulness, the kaleidoscope of emotions, whether it’s 
driving, if that’s where you do it, or at work, or someplace  where you have enough quiet, are left al one 
enough, so that you can watch what’s going on. Maybe 
it’s shopping in the supermarket . You  go go down the 
aisles and just notice all the really subtle shifts and 
changes that are going on inside of you. What attracts 
your attention? How do you feel abo ut things? The 
desire, the aversion, the other people there , and how 
you react to them and take them in, and what happens 
to you emotionally when you go down the detergent or 
the household pesticide aisle. I feel a shift in me when I 
go down certain aisles . “Oh I don’t know if I want to be 
in this aisle ” [laughs] . 
 
You might have fun. It could be fun. Hopefully it’s fun. 
Watch your kaleidoscopes go through. That’s what I 
have to say this morning. I hope you enjoy your 
emotions.
