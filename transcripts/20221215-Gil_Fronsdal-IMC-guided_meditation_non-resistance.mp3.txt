Hello everyone and welcome back.
And continuing this theme on the Insight Pentad, Theme of the Week.
And one of the powers of insight is to see things in a new way, and I'd like to suggest a new way as we start this meditation.
We often start with relaxation, and that's still, I think, a very good thing to do.
And that kind of goes along with the Buddhist teachings too, to relax the body, relax the mind.
It's kind of his beginning instructions for meditation.
But another similar movement at the beginning, and throughout meditation, that's also very powerful, is rather than relaxing directly, is to stop resisting.
Stop resisting whatever it is you're bracing yourself against, or holding yourself against, or protecting yourself against in the context of meditation.
So to take a part of the significance of taking a careful posture, upright, dignified posture, or other postures, but the idea is to really take a posture that works well for you, and then to hold it, stay in it.
Don't collapse, don't give into the emotions, the feelings, the beliefs, the desires to do something else with your body.
So it's quite significant to feel all the movements in the body, to move, to shift, to collapse, to pull back.
But more subtly, there is all kinds of ways in which the tension we hold in our body, it can be a resistance, resistance from feeling fully, resistance from holding ourselves against having to feel what's really happening.
Sometimes what motivates us with our desires might not be the desires themselves, but the discomfort that can come with strong desire.
And we're trying to resist that discomfort by maybe acting out, or doing something, or pulling back.
A lot of the resistance is a kind of a tension, but relaxing the body is different than releasing the resistance.
Because even things which are, maybe things you're protecting yourselves in the moment, the feelings, the sensations, the beliefs, to release them, to free them while we're sitting still and upright.
So we're not giving expression to them, we're not acting on them, speaking them, but we are not holding them in check.
And we're allowing some kind of full relaxation of the body that comes from releasing all the resistance we have.
So if this is relevant for you, or understandable for you, and how you are, maybe at this meditation we can begin, or focus on releasing resistance.
And this is one of the characteristics of freedom, the liberation that Buddhism is looking for, is liberation from all tension, including that of resistance.
And then how to live wisely without this embodied physical, emotional, mental resistance that lives in us. That is the great art.
So assuming a upright, dignified posture, or the alternative for you, and gently closing your eyes, and feeling into your body,
feeling the tensions, the holdings in your body, and see if any of it might qualify as resistance,
pulling back from life, protecting ourselves from something. And as you exhale, release resistance.
Release the way that we're physically bracing ourselves, or holding ourselves, pulled back, fending off, avoiding.
Any resistance, release it, and let what's behind their resistance have breathing room, have space, just to be in the simplicity of sitting upright.
And might there be any resistance to be found in your breathing?
And any part of the inhale, maybe the second half, do you feel anything holding the breathing back?
And if so, if it's easy enough, let go of that holding back, let go of resistance.
If it's not easy to let go of, content yourself with feeling the inhale stretching against that resistance.
Any resistance in the exhale, any holding back, maybe at the end of the exhale,
not allowing it to release fully.
Any resistance in the exhale, maybe the second half, do you feel any resistance?
