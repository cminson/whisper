 I might mention that I think it was probably mentioned last time those of you who were here. It's obvious that we are sharing our sitting hall with others or others are sharing their place with us. I don't know which it is, but every December the friends here open their meeting hall here for a bunch of homeless people to come and have a place to stay. They come in at 9 o'clock and they go around to 12 different churches in this area. There's a trailer up in the parking lot and she's noticed it and that transports all the mattresses from one church to the other. It's very nice. So 12 months of the year there's some place where a certain group can go and it's kind of organized. I think you qualify somehow and I don't know how exactly it works. If any of you want to bring on Thursday some food they have a dinner at 9 o'clock when they come. There's a sign up system for it but also if you're inspired you can just bring something. Partly because it gets so complicated out there with all the tables and the food and all. We've moved the Donna baskets inside so the two donation baskets are inside which makes it a little more awkward because it's difficult than to funnel out. But if it's relevant for you the donation baskets are there. I don't talk much about the donation system that we have but it might take a minute for it. Our understanding of the insight meditation movement, the Theravadan Buddhist movement, that comes from Southeast Asia is that in the Buddhist tradition for many thousand to twenty five hundred years the teachings and the opportunities to practice the meditation practice have been offered as freely as possible or freely often. That was my case when I went to Southeast Asia to practice there. It was really remarkable the amount of generosity and the amount of support that we were given there to practice. You can go into a monastery and in the monastery you are given a place to stay, you're given a room, a bed, you're given food, you're given teachings, you're given all the care you need. Usually it's completely for free. The eight months I spent in Burma I felt like I was a guest of the state. Burma is a very poor country and maybe not a guest of the government but a guest of the country. It's a relatively pretty poor country, it's one of the world's poorest countries. Here I was comparatively an extremely privileged person. When I came to the meditation monastery in Burma to stay there it felt like I didn't need anything. I didn't need any money, I didn't need anything at all because everything I needed was provided. The best medical care in Burma came to us in the monastery, to the westerners there, so we didn't have to leave. My filling fell out and a dentist came to the monastery to see me. If we needed clothes we would be given clothes, food, medicine, whatever. We were given the opportunity to practice and what was remarkable in Burma was how so many people there were really inspired by practitioners, by people who were doing a meditation practice. There was a tremendous desire to support anybody who was practicing. As I received all the material support that allowed me to practice there so intensely I had the very strong sense that I wasn't just doing the practice for myself, that I was also doing it in a sense, I was responsible in a sense for those people providing me with support. It actually inspired me in a joyful way to really throw myself into the practice and do it even more thoroughly than I maybe would have otherwise. It was a beautiful system and it was all for free and so many of us who practiced in Asia came back to America and really wanted to continue that tradition here. It just felt really inspired and so we didn't want to charge for the teachings or the opportunities to practice. It's a little bit odd in America to not charge for things. Americans don't understand it so well. One Burmese monk, Youssou Ananda, who lives in Daly City, he was going to come and teach a class for us in September and I suggested he do it on his donation system because that's what we were used to doing and that's when Western monks come and teach for us, that's what we do. He said, oh, but Americans don't know what that means. We should charge. In any case, we got him to do it on the old-fashioned system. It's also a story to tell of... I met once a Vipassana teacher from Australia, from Perth in Australia. He was trying to teach people mindfulness and they could support himself off that or whatever. Very few people came and he wasn't really making it go on it and he was not really supporting himself. He decided to forget this free thing. Let's charge. As soon as he charged, lots of people came. He had more classes, he had like 12 classes a week. Deductory classes is phenomenal. He just couldn't handle it all himself. There's something about money in our cultures which we're kind of confused about it and what it means. I think in Australia, the sense was if you charge for it, there's value to it. If you don't charge, well, then there's no value. So, it is a kind of odd system that we're doing for our culture, but it's an experiment. We've been doing it for about 20 years and it's going quite beautifully. I think I like it a lot. I think it keeps everyone honest and straightforward and it ensures that in some sense that people don't, hopefully the teachers themselves, don't take for granted their support that they get. Someone told me recently that she went to some other temple, I think it was actually a synagogue. And there there was a required dues. So, every Saturday he had to pay. And she comes here and there's nothing required. And she realized one day that she actually gave the same amount whether she went to the synagogue or here. But here, because no one's asking, she felt like she was this joy of generosity. She was really happy for what she was doing. Whereas the synagogue was like, you know, a duty. So, anyway, so that's a system we have here. A system is a donation system, which means that if you feel inclined or feel inspired to support what we do and support me or the teacher, whoever the teacher is who comes here, then there's those two baskets up there. And one basket is for the rent and one basket is for the teacher. And the only way that really allows us to continue doing what we do is by getting supported. But you only get supported by the people who are inspired. So, that's kind of nice. And when I get this wonderful money, you know, and support for myself, through from the basket, I feel it's kind of like sacred money. It's like it's come through a special way. It's come through people's inspired generosity for the support of the practice and for the future. And so, I'll feel then like, oh, this money I want to use carefully. I mean, I don't use money for strange things, but anyway, but, you know, I kind of feel kind of special about the money. Or if I go to a restaurant, sometimes I'll kind of tip the waiter, waitress a little bit more because I feel like it's kind of all this part of this generous system. And I'm the recipient of generosity and it's nice to pass it on. And I mean, going to this yoga class Tuesday nights, I don't know, I said I would only talk for a minute on this. Maybe it's the talk of the evening. I'm going to this yoga class and my wife is pregnant, signed up for the whole class, the whole series. And I signed up, I just do it on a drop-in basis. And my wife got too pregnant to go, so she didn't go last week, this week. But I went. So, I had this, what seems to the instructor and the person who takes care of the registration, little odd way of behaving. And it comes from the fact that I've been in this scene for so long. So, when I come with my side pay each time, and what I do is I come with my money in an envelope. And I hand them the envelope. I don't hand them money. I hand them the envelope with the money inside. And because it feels more respectful, because this is a teacher, a yoga teacher, he's my teacher, and I want to do something, I don't want to just pay him, I want to respectfully make this offering to him. So, I put her in an envelope and I hand him the envelope. I've been trained in Asia that that's a respectable thing to do. And the person in the register, she's Indian, so she kind of like smiles and kind of recognizes somehow that this is something different. And then I came, this week I came to pay at the end of the class, and she noticed my wife hadn't come, who's paid for the whole series. And they asked, and I said, well, she can't come anymore, she's too uncomfortable. And then she said, oh, well, you don't have to pay then, because your wife, you just take your wife's place. And I said, oh, but my intention today was to come and pay. My intention was to come and give this today. So take it. Because you took it for the yoga teacher. So, you know, so I think a little bit differently kind of about money and what it means to support people and what it means to exchange money, partly because I'm in a very unusual economy, an economy of generosity and goodwill. And it's really lovely. Maybe it's a kind of alternative economy that people don't understand out there, where we're there is. And it is an experiment, whether it's going to work. What happens when we go on retreats? You all seem kind of listening, so I guess it's okay to continue. I'm usually very shy to talk about this. So it's kind of like a talk about generosity. So what we do is, if you go on retreats, like overnight retreats, then we do charge. But the fee is only the fee for what it costs to put on the retreat, the cost of renting the facilities, the cost of the food, the cost of transportation sometimes for some of the people who might have to fly in to teachers or to cooks. And the staffing of it, the people on staff, which are the teachers and the cooks, don't get paid from that money. There's no money left over, really. And because the idea is that everybody's offering things freely to staff and the teachers. And so at the end of the retreat, usually there's an envelope to make donations if you're inclined. But if someone's not inclined, there's no requirement. There's one Vipassana tradition, a different one than our own, the Goenka tradition, where I think that someone said Goenka, Do they kind of not allow you to make a donation the first time? No. Well, I mean, the donation that you make, the use for the students that come next time. Yeah. So you explain. It's done at the end. I see I had this idea that the first time you do a retreat with them, you're not allowed to make a donation, but maybe that's not accurate. At the end, they use it for the next session. Yeah. So that's a love. So you're there to result in the generosity of the previous staff. So in that system, it's completely free. There's no use show up and there's no registration, there's no pay for anything. So that's different than our system where we pay for ourselves, at least the food and the lodging. In the Goenka system, it's completely free. You show up. And then at the end, if you're inclined, you can do something. And what happens is the people who might have a lot of means will donate a lot and the people who have very little means will donate very little. And sometimes the people who don't donate very little because they have little means, it's actually a bigger deal for them. It's a bigger sacrifice or whatever. And the people who give lots of money, it's like, you know, there's a lot of wealth here, right? In this valley. And you know, someone puts in, you know, $50, you know, it's like toilet paper for them. And someone else puts in a dollar and it's like, it's a major deal for them. So anyway, the idea is that, you know, it works out and people do what they want to do and what they can do. Do you have any questions about any of that? Should I give a talk on generosity instead of the talk I was going to give? Make it up. It's very interesting to me that the traditional teachings of the Buddha, he described a sequential, a progressive path to the spiritual life, a spiritual path. And a person starts off, usually you start where you are, you start where you happen to be, and then you kind of build the qualities of spiritual life. You build the kind of insights until they get stronger and stronger until you have a kind of liberative awakening experience. And you can imagine perhaps, this is the way Ajahn Amrow described it, you can imagine that, you know, the Buddha is sitting under a tree, which he often did in India, and he would receive anybody who happened to come for teachings or to hang out with him. And there was a completely open system, anybody could come and he could make a wonder in. And there'd be a whole range of types of people who would come. There'd be farmers and there'd be prostitutes and there'd be wealthy merchants and there'd be businessmen and there'd be rulers. And in the scriptures they talk about this huge, the whole cross-section of the culture of India at the time would come visit him. And they have these conversations and some of these conversations are recorded. And some people would be quite well developed intellectually or spiritually, and some people would have almost no background in anything, and they were soldiers or butchers. In Buddhist culture a butcher is considered to be spiritually kind of ignorant, not so well developed because butchery, killing animals is not considered to be very appropriate spiritual livelihood. So he would talk in a talk where people are at, meet them where they were at. And for people who were living unethical lives he would talk about ethics and people who were already living an ethical life and were able to kind of get concentrated, he talked about concentration. He would start where people are at and then he kind of lead them sequentially to the goal of the Buddhist practice which is the experience of liberation. But in this sequential path of spiritual development, what's interesting is that it begins with generosity. The first practice the Buddha teaches, the foundational practice for the Buddhist practice, is the practice of generosity. And we might ask, why is that? I might ask you, why do you think that? Why would the Buddha or why would any spiritual teacher recommend that the first spiritual practice is the foundation for spiritual life is the practice of generosity? Why do you think? Yes, so it has to do with letting go. So there's something about, what is it about letting go that has to do with spirituality, with developing an awakened, compassionate life? Well, the antithesis of that would be clinging. And at whatever level that occurs, there's bound to be an impediment to the liberation to freedom. And the reason partly because the definition of freedom in Buddhism is the state that doesn't cling. So as we learn non-clinging through the act of generosity, we're actually cultivating, strengthening that capacity of non-clinging, which is in some sense the goal of Buddhist practice. That's nice. Yeah. Perhaps because sharing furthers the concept of non-self. That's nice. How so? Well, because by generally spreading good, everything is happier. So generosity furthers the Buddhist idea of no self, or put a little bit differently, like Terry talked about, that part of the problem, part of one of the barriers to a full, awakened and compassionate life is our clinging to a sense of self, or clinging to me and mine, or things that are mine. As long as we're clinging to this is mine, it's very hard to be free. So if you start being generous with the things that you have, and not cling to it so tightly, then you cultivate this experience of no self. And one of the beautiful things about generosity is that it does connect us to other people. So maybe some of you are going to say this, but the fact that it's a spiritual practice, the first spiritual practice you do, is a practice that puts you in relationship to other people. Isn't that nice? So often we think of Buddhists, they're sitting there contemplating their navel by themselves in a cave, and they're kind of withdrawn from the world and asocial, and aren't we? But anyway, the first practice is a practice that actually puts you in relationship to other people. So it teaches a lot about our relationship to other people, the amount of self, the amount of clinging, the amount of posturing, the amount of connection we feel with others, the amount of heartfelt connection. There's a lot that goes on, and I think it's very significant that we begin our spiritual life in a sense, cultivating something which is both good for ourselves, but also good for others, and also establishes a richer connection between us. I think it's very important, I think, to realize that our spiritual practice is not something we do just for ourselves, but we do for the sake of others also. What other things do you think? Why is generosity so listed first? Yes, yes. Is there a sense of having to feel that you're giving out something? Oh, that is a sacrifice. No, this idea of sacrifice is not a Buddhist one. Actually, one of the criteria that Buddha gave for when you should give, be generous, when you should do this generous act, is that the joy of the giver should be greater than the joy of the recipient. If your joy is greater than that of the recipient, then it's a good idea you should give. So rather than being a self-sacrificing thing in a sense, it's actually also a joyful thing. One of the reasons, I think, that it's first, there's many reasons, is that joy is a very important quality for Buddhist spiritual life. So to do things that bring joy actually helps further one's spiritual practice, makes it easier. So you have sacrifice is not so important. However, if we look at the other way, rather than looking at its sacrifice, the other side of that is stinginess. If a person gives but there's stinginess, if there's not this really sense of heartfelt wanting to help or give or be generous, then that doesn't develop these qualities of non-clinging, letting go of generosity of joy. So the person who gives away $50 might not, you know, it might actually be stingy for that person. Whereas someone who gives a dollar, it might be incredibly generous. There's one sutra, one scripture, where there's a wealthy man who is inspired by the Buddha, and he kind of becomes a follower of the Buddha and decides to do this, to be generous to people who are homeless and things like that. But he's stingy. So he chooses the worst food that he can find, that he has in his storerooms, and the worst clothes that are kind of ripped and whatever, whatever he has. But he instructs his attendant to give it away. So as the kind of Buddhist economics works on merit, so the idea was, so it goes on to explain that the wealthy man certainly got some good merit from this. But his attendant who gave it away, and actually he wasn't his in a sense, but he gave much, he gave himself, he was more generous and outgoing, giving away his master's wealth, his master's stingy gifts, he actually developed much more merit. So the quality of the giving, that's important. It's also interesting that the Buddha gave a list of who you should give to. And it starts, the list starts with you should give to your friends and family. And I thought that was, that is also significant. There's a tendency in Buddhism to really honor the place we were at. And so to really take the good qualities we have, like loving ourselves or loving our friends or our family, and starting there and strengthening that, and then expanding beyond that to include other people, to include strangers, include even your enemies. So loving kindness practice is done that way. Kind of you take something and universalize it. You don't deny yourself, you don't deny the kind of sense of love you might have towards others in your close by, but you don't limit it there. Usually the problem is it's limited, you expand it, you universalize it. So same thing with generosity. You start with the people close at hand, the people you might feel close to, and then as a practice you begin universalizing it. So the list starts with family and friends, and then it goes to people in need, people who are poor or homeless or whatever. And then you give to, the third category is you give to spiritual people. You give to, which in ancient India meant, people who are spiritual people in ancient India meant people who had renounced the world and were living entirely, being supported entirely by the donations of people. So they wandered around, did their practice, and were supported for it. Anyway, so again, as I keep saying, I think it's very significant that generosity is the foundation for the Buddhist spiritual life. And it can be for some people a practice in its own right. I had a friend who, because of psychological difficulties, very severe difficulties, wasn't able to continue with her meditation practice anymore. And so she went to her teacher, and a teacher told her that she kind of stopped doing the meditation practice, and rather she should only practice generosity. That should be her practice. And she blossomed in it. She softened, her heart opened, there was more joy, more sense of connection with other people. She got to see there were lots of opportunities to be generous. There's an infinite number of opportunities to be close-hearted. Right? And there's as many opportunities to be generous as there are opportunities to be close-hearted. So she learned it was generous to offer a smile to someone. And sometimes it's a very generous thing to ask someone how they are. It's a very generous thing to, you know, there's all kinds of small things that can be done. It doesn't have to be a major thing. It doesn't have to be things at all. It can be with our presence, our attention. I'm fond, very fond, of, you know, some of you know of words, fond of words. I think words are kind of fascinating, their origins and stuff. But the ways in which we use the word give in English, we say give away in the freeway. You know, someone's kind of wants to get into your lane, you give away. And usually, you know, you say, oh, you know, but you actually, it's not like the word give, right? It means it's actually an opportunity for generosity. You know, you generously allow them to come into your lane. Or you give your attention to someone, you know. So think, every time you hear the word give, give your attention to someone, give up is a good one. I like that a lot because give up, apparently in its origins, meant to offer up as an offering to the altar or something. It's like a sacred offering. So it isn't like surrender originally. Originally, it was to offer up something. So to give up is to offer it. Here, you can have it as an offering. A friend of mine was held up at Knife Point outside the projects in San Francisco at night. And another friend walked by them. And later, they both met inside where they're both going. And the first friend said, oh, you know, you know, I was being held up. And the first, second guy said, I didn't notice. What was going on? Because you guys were in a conversation. Oh, you know, I gave him my wallet and said, you can have my money, but said, you know, actually, I need to get home and I need a couple of dollars just to keep for myself. And so we had this conversation back and forth about how much he could take and how much I needed. And I don't exactly recommend that, you know, always. But he was a Zen priest who had been practicing for years and there's certain presence of mind, a certain sense of generosity, a certain sense of not taking things too personally and not getting angry or upset or afraid, you know, right off the bat. And so he kind of thought, oh, okay, this, you know, I don't know what he thought, but okay, this guy's asking me for it. I'll give it up. I'll offer it up. But, you know, I also need some of it. And, you know, maybe he was really lucky that he found some guy who was reasonable, but it's a great story, isn't it? And Jack Kornfield, he likes to hear, Jack Kornfield says he has a practice of whenever he has a generous thought, he has a practice to act on it, within reason, of course, I guess. But if he has, if he stinks, I like to give it to someone, he then acts on it to at least thinks about it seriously. And I think that's a great practice. And I did that for a while, kind of, for a few days, kind of letting that kind of be a practice or sense. And what surprised me was how seldom I wanted to be generous. I'm not saying that because, you know, I'm confessing I'm a terrible person. You know, I'm not such a great person, but I'm not terrible. But, you know, I'm so, I'm just whoever I am. But it surprised me that it wasn't like I wanted to be generous left and right all the time. So this idea of, you know, of having a practice to act on any act, any motivation, generosity, probably is not going to make you bankrupt. And what's interesting when you take on generosity as a practice, is that you might be generous, you might start giving in situations you don't feel comfortable about giving, or you might feel afraid to give, or you might feel all kinds of questions might arise, all kinds of emotions and feelings might arise. And part of the value of giving as a practice is to bring up all those feelings and thoughts. So you get to look at that, look at it really well, look at how you might be afraid of giving away your money, look at how you want to hold on to things, look at who you decide to give to and who you're not deciding to give to and the questions and fears, you know. And to really to clarify that and look at that in a really deep way, I think is very useful. There's always great stories. And Nagarjuna was a famous Buddhist teacher of the past. And the story of him, you know, the Buddhist monks have these bowls that they do the alms around with, and they're much bigger than this, but they're by this shape, and they kind of walk around, people put food in it or whatever. And because he was a famous teacher, some king had given him a very precious, maybe solid gold or something bowl, which he didn't care for, but then here he had it. And he was sleeping one night out someplace under a tree, and a robber came along and saw this gold bowl. Now, robbers like gold, right? So he was kind of sneaking up to get the gold bowl. And just before he got to it, he stepped on a branch or something and Nagarjuna woke up. And so Nagarjuna realized what was going on, and he picked up the bowl and gave it to him. Yeah, you can have it. And so the robber went off, and then he came back the next morning and said, such an act of generosity just blew me away. I couldn't understand how someone can do it. It really moved me. I've come back to be your disciple, to be your student. This is a nice story. And then there's a story from the Christian tradition that I've read sometimes, Anastasios. It was one of the, maybe the desert fathers in Egypt. And he had a Bible. In the old days, they had to write it up by hand and it was probably beautiful drawings and the margins and beautiful Bible. And it was worth 18 shekels. And one day a wondering person came into the church or the monastery and Anastasios took him in and fed him and let him have the night's sleep. But he saw this rather expensive, fine looking Bible sitting on the shelf. So in the morning when he was leaving, he took it and he went into town, into Cairo, and he went to a used bookstore and said, I'm selling it. Would you like to buy it? And the book dealer said, oh, this looks like a fine, very fine book. But before I agreed to give you some money for it, I want to take it to a friend of mine and ask him what he thinks of it and how much he thinks it's worth. So he took the book to Anastasios and he asked him, Anastasios said, I'm thinking of offering this man 16 shekels for this book. Do you think that's a good deal? Anastasia looked and said, oh, yeah, it's a very good deal. This book is at least worth 18 shekels. And so the book dealer went back to the store and found the thief and he said, oh, I'm happy to give you 16 shekels for it. And the thief said, oh, well, how did you decide that? And well, I went and checked with my friend, Anastasios. And he looked at the book and he thought it was easily worth 16 shekels. And so the thief said, oh, I'm not selling it anymore. And he took the book and went back to Anastasia and said, I'm so sorry. And he was crying and said, please take it back. And he said, no, no, you keep it. So he also stayed and became a student of Anastasios. So great stories of kind of generosity and non-clinging. So what are your thoughts about this? What are your thoughts and understandings about generosity? Or questions? Yeah, Maria. I think it's interesting that you brought up the practice of generosity as opposed to a meditation practice, for example. And that you gave examples of generosity that went to giving people a smile or sharing something or listening to someone. Because I think we tend to think in terms of money, especially as we get very busy with the practice of generosity. Especially as we get very busy. We're very busy and we want to do something for someone. So we give them money. And we really miss part of the value of that generosity, which is the connection with other people and the interaction from which you really do get more than writing down a chapter. Yes, yes. I think we don't tend to think that way. I think it's an important thing to know. It's very generous, to give our attention. It's a generous act. And it's obvious when you look at children. The children thrive when they get attention. And I think we all need attention to some degree. We need attention from ourselves. So when we give attention to our breath, can it be a generous act? It's an act of generosity to yourself to pay attention. And Zen Master Dogen said that, he's talking about how it can be non-monetary kind of generosity. He said, you can even give away the flowers on the mountain. I mean, not that you're going out and picking them all and then giving them to people, but rather you leave them up there, but you say, here, you can have those. Well, you call people's attention to them because they've missed it. Yeah. Yes. I think once the teacher was talking about how Donna can be used as a meditation or mindfulness practice to see what arises in you. What are all the thoughts that go through your mind? What's the emotional undertone? Exactly. So that sense is a practice. So there's two ways of looking at it. You look at it as a practice where you actually help you explore yourself, or you can see it as an expression, a natural expression of a heart of a mind which doesn't cling, which is open and receptive. And it's important sometimes to say that because I think often the feelings and the emotions that arise out of a sensitive heart, an awakened heart, a heart which is kind of more calm and more open than it would be if we're kind of scattered or distracted, there's a lot of emotions that might come up, but it's not always obvious that we should be expressing that or give a channel to it, or a vehicle for it. And it's actually very valuable to give a vehicle or give expression to the emotions, the wholesome emotions and feelings that arise within us as we do a spiritual practice. And I talked about bowing some time ago. And bowing can be a very generous act, I think, to simply... bowing expresses a lot of different things, but one of the things it can express is if you're meeting the other person at a different place, I don't know if it's deeper exactly, but maybe a deeper place than if you meet them and you shake your hands with them. Shaking hands and bowing each have their own place. I wouldn't want to judge one above the other in a sense, but when you... I think bowing is in some ways more generous. It's like you're meeting the... that which is sacred within the other person, you're kind of bowing, you're kind of generously allowing or seeing or acknowledging something really special about that person or completely about that person. You're putting your whole body kind of together, shake your hand, it's kind of like... it's kind of partial, unless you go like this. It's very nice when people shake your hands with both hands. It's kind of... then it feels really generous, like they're really there and it's warm. So I don't know. Question? I just had a comment that I find that being generous in any manner, I always get it back to these goals. And it always... not that I'm looking for that, but it always seems to lighten everything. Yeah, that's beautiful. That's a teaching you find in almost all spiritual traditions, as far as I know. The idea that the gift returns to the giver twice or three times, or simply returns. There was an anthropological study kind of of the Polypinesian islands, where they have gift giving is a big time deal. It used to be, at least before modern times. And they would give tremendous amount of their goods, shells and basketry whatever they made, to the island that was down current from them or down wind from them. And in that island, we do the same thing to the people who are down current from them. So it was all kind of seemed like, you know, away, everybody's going away from you. But if you follow the current or the trade winds or whatever, it made a big circle. So eventually it came back. But it wasn't obvious. It took a long time. And then another story, which I thought was kind of interesting. I don't know quite what to do of this, but a study on generosity. This was the Maoris in New Zealand, where they would be hunters and they go into the forest to hunt. And then they would give part of their hunt to the priests. And the priests would go and take part of that and return it as an offering to the forest. So the question was, why couldn't the hunters have done it themselves? Just taken, you know, gun hunting, cut up the animal and left some of it for the forest. And the argument is by anthropologists is that when you have that kind of one-on-one relationship, it can feel all too easy like it's an exchange. But if you give it, if the priest is intermediary, then it's no longer in exchange with the forest. And it's more of an act of generosity in a sense, and then a caregiving back into the forest. So I don't know exactly, that's about the best I can explain it. But I thought it was a very interesting idea that if you have some way of taking the generosity outside of a direct relationship, and it becomes more, it doesn't become an exchange, it becomes a, maybe has some kind of different meaning. Yes? The generosity part, I think, is sort of a very human failing of giving, but then expecting something in return. And I'm going back to your freeway example, and showing, giving way to somebody to come into the lane, and somewhat pissed off that person doesn't acknowledge that we have given way. And so that the entire act of generosity is now fouled by an expected reaction that didn't happen. And I think we do that many times. Yes. And just sort of not focusing on the act of giving you what's there, not the expected return. Beautiful. That's very beautifully stated. You know, you have the bumper sticker we see these days, it says, practice random acts of kindness. I think the Buddhist version of that is practice secret acts of kindness. Because if it's secret, then you know, you're not concerned, secret or private or whatever, about the exchange. It should really be, again, and also the saying the Buddha said, your joy should be greater than the recipient. Implies that you're really doing it not for anything in return, but really because it's, you're inspired. Yeah? I mean, just come back from a retreat. The best advice, at least at this point, the best advice that I received upon integrating coming back was that someone said, you have to let go of the retreat. And as events and things start to happen, that feels like it's taking the retreat away from you. Just give it away. Just give it away. And I've done that a number of times this week. And it's been, it's been really wonderful. I mean, I don't know if the other people getting anything out of it. So you feel your calm disappearing. And so rather than being upset about all my calm, you know, I had 17 days of retreat and I huffed and puffed and I got some peace finally in my life. I deserve it. Oh, now it's going and terrible. You feel your peace going. Take it. May it be for the benefit of the world like that. Beautiful. So should we give some attention to ourselves or to our breath and with a little sitting? Okay. Okay.
