The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So, last week we had a kind of a question and answer session,
or a question and discussion session, I guess it more was,
and a question was raised that kind of started off the whole topic,
but I never really got to answer the question.
So, I thought I would talk today about, well, I'll read the question,
which is something like, how do I allow people to be who they are
without judging or resenting and thinking they're taking time away from me?
And so what I thought I'd focus on in that question is this topic of judgment,
and judging, because it's often a really predominant thing that our minds do,
is judge, is judge people, and judge ourselves.
So, you know, as I was thinking about this topic and having taught the daily
life practice retreat last week, I didn't have any time to think about this topic.
Last week I was just thinking yesterday, well, what am I going to talk about
tomorrow morning, and I came up with this thought.
So, I had yesterday to think about it.
I thought about it for several hours.
And thinking about it, it was like all these mushrooms, you know,
all these thoughts, it's like, this is a big topic.
And I didn't have a lot of time to organize the mushrooms.
So, this will be a real kind of watercolor kind of a talk.
Not going to be terribly organized.
Well, although I did kind of put a structure on it,
but I thought I would just talk about it and then see what comes up in the room,
and maybe we'll create this talk together.
So, I think first of all, with judgment, you know,
one thing that happens is as we start to meditate and start to pay attention
to what's happening in our minds is that we really begin to see how much we do judge.
It's a really common experience for us.
Only, we may, before we start to meditate, we may not be as aware of that.
You know, so sometimes the way our minds work,
the way we judge things and think about things,
oh, that person's, you know, wearing something that looks really nice on them,
or that person is wearing really worn out shoes.
I wonder why they're, I mean, so, you know, just the way we judge what people wear,
the way they walk, the way they talk, the way they act,
I mean, it's just about endless, and not only do we judge people, we judge places and things,
and organizations.
I mean, somehow it may come back to a person, but, you know,
who decided to put the, you know, the Dharma teacher in that spot in their room?
I mean, why there?
Or, you know, on a retreat, I remember at one point, the first long retreat,
really long retreat I did,
I kept coming up with ways that they should change things to organize the retreat better.
They really should put salt on the table right after the oatmeal
so that I can salt my oatmeal right after,
instead of having to salt it after I've put all the fruit and the yogurt on it.
Many things, many, many things like that, you know, just, we judge endlessly.
But, you know, I didn't particularly recognize that as a judgment when I was on that first retreat.
It was just like, well, this is the way my mind works, you know, it's like,
it's like, of course they should change this, you know.
I refrained myself from writing a note about what they should do,
because we were told not to write notes,
but, you know, I really thought that this was not a judgment, this was the way it should be.
So, you know, we don't necessarily recognize judgments until we really start to look at our minds.
I think, too, with judgments, we can start to recognize them when we start to react to them.
But again, we may not recognize it as a judgment that's happening in our mind.
We may think we're reacting to some actual thing in the environment,
kind of like my reaction around the salt.
It's like, well, of course you should put salt on the table.
I mean, this is like a no-brainer.
But, you know, it was just an idea in my mind that that was the way it should be,
and then I was reacting to that.
So, we do that a lot, I think, that we react to our judgments.
They're based in beliefs, they're based in values often,
they're based in that kind of deeper, less visible structure in our minds.
The beliefs and values aren't things we typically think about,
they're kind of the way we orient to our world.
So, they're less easy to actually see.
And the judgments, too, kind of being a reflection of those beliefs and values,
are less easy to see as judgments until we start reacting to them.
So, that's one of the first places to look when we're working with judgments,
it's just recognizing them, beginning to recognize that this is a judgment.
So, you know, and partly what we may recognize is the reactivity.
That may be the first thing we notice is reactivity.
You know, they shouldn't be doing that.
And that it's not a simple, oh, that's not, they shouldn't be doing that.
There's a sense that somehow it's impacting me that they're doing that.
There's this reactivity, we get averse to the way things,
the way people are doing things.
I mean, even something as simple as a friend wearing, you know,
a funny looking hat to dinner, you know.
It's like, why are they wearing that hat?
You know, that's a really silly looking hat, you know.
It may be, it's not such a neutral thing.
It may be that you feel like somehow it reflects on you that you're sitting
with somebody wearing such a silly looking hat.
So, you know, it often comes back to us.
And I think that's where a lot of judgment actually comes back to.
It's grounded in some notion of self, self and other, me and them, or us and them.
It may be, you know, that we're different from them.
They're doing things that we wouldn't do, or they're doing things that we'd like to do.
You know, the judgments can be either aversive or desiring.
So, the reactivity around judgment can come from the flavor of either greed or aversion,
or delusion, actually, the root being delusion of the separation of self and other.
So, that's one aspect around judgment and looking at judgment in our minds,
beginning to recognize it.
And I think beginning to recognize it through our reactivity, you know,
and then looking back.
Well, actually, I'll get to the looking back in just a moment.
So, recognizing that judging happens in our minds is actually a good thing.
I think when we start to see how much we judge, how endlessly we judge through our mindfulness practice,
we feel like it's bad news.
Sorry?
I did.
Did what?
You said looking for judging is a good thing.
Oh, yes, well, I mean, the recognition of judgment is helpful for us.
So, you know, that's actually a good point, you know, good, bad.
That's a way that we think of judging.
Skillful, unskillful, maybe, is a less judgmental phrase.
But we do, we do it, we do it all the time.
It's helpful, it's really helpful for us to recognize,
now I missed my, I lost my train of thought in your comment, let me think.
Something about why it's helpful.
Oh, I remember, it's that not noticing it, not noticing it as judgment,
is kind of the way we live in a lot of ways.
We see through our values and our beliefs, and we make judgments,
and we don't particularly notice them as judgments until we start looking at our minds.
And when we start to recognize them, we feel like it's bad news.
We feel like it's something we need to get rid of.
But we mostly just need to recognize it, that this is a process.
This is something that happens in our minds.
And in recognizing them, in recognizing this is a judgment,
we can start to notice this kind of underlying filter that we're seeing things through.
And this is very helpful to notice that perhaps what we're reacting to
is not some objective thing in the world, but it's a concept based on a value or a belief.
So the whole structure of judgment, and the next piece I want to talk about is acceptance.
Accepting the fact that our minds do this.
The whole structure of judgment I think is based in a very natural capacity of our minds to compare things.
And this is just what our minds do.
They notice differences between things.
This flower is taller than that flower.
Really simple kinds of comparisons.
This person can do math better than that person can do math,
which may then leap into this person is smarter than that person.
Even though perhaps it's only objectively true that this person perhaps gets better grade on math tests than that person does.
So there are some ways that comparison kind of moves into judgment.
And this is actually a helpful point too, an important point to recognize the distinction between comparing and discriminating and judging.
It wouldn't be so helpful to cut out the entire capacity of judging, of comparing, of our ability to discriminate between things.
So when we're looking at judgment, one of the ways to again begin to explore is to begin to see,
is this, so this may be rooted in some kind of actual comparison,
but is there a value or a belief that's put on top of that comparison, like the smarter one for instance.
Moving from this person gets better grades on math tests than that person.
And then leaping to, well this person is smarter than that person.
There's a value judgment there around tests.
There's a value judgment around math being some demonstrator of intelligence.
It might be that in an essay exam, the other person would get a better grade than this person.
If you leap from this person gets a better grade on a test than that person in a math exam from this person is better than,
smarter than that person, maybe then too, this person is more worthy of my attention than that person,
how it mushrooms from very simple objective information to things that are based on our values and our beliefs.
So learning or beginning to recognize that that kind of comparing,
the simple comparing capacity kind of can mushroom into judgments based not on objective reality,
but on just things that are happening in our minds.
So acceptance.
Recognizing that this process is one that we naturally do,
and then seeing if you can begin to tease apart the values and beliefs from the actual comparison.
And one little trick that Joseph Goldstein talks about in terms of helping us to just accept judgments in our minds.
And this requires that we actually recognize them kind of as they're coming up.
So this may or may not be something that you can do all the time if you don't recognize the judgments until you've already reacted to them.
Judgments are really fast. They're in the realm of thought. They happen and then we react to them.
So we may not be able to kind of catch judgments as they come up, but sometimes we can,
particularly when we're meditating, we can start to catch the thought itself as it comes up.
They shouldn't be doing that. Or, I'm better or worse than they are somehow.
You know, just those thoughts. We might catch those thoughts.
If you can catch the thought of a judgment, Joseph Goldstein suggests adding a true neutral thought onto the end of the sentence.
So that's a really silly hat and the sky is blue.
What that does is, first of all, it kind of calls our attention to the fact that we've judged something.
And then it replaces the little spin, the perhaps aversive spin or greedy spin to that judgment with neutrality.
It inserts neutrality in the mind stream immediately after a judgment.
So some people have found this to be an interesting, and it's also humor.
You know, it's a little humorous if you find yourself saying, and the sky is blue.
It's like, oh yeah, okay, this is kind of pointing out to us, oh, this is a judgment.
And contrasting it with the truth of a true neutral statement.
So recognizing and accepting that we judge.
Recognizing judgments, first of all, just recognizing that this happens and then beginning to accept it.
Once we get to this place of beginning to accept our judgments, then we can start to investigate what's happening here.
We can really start to look at what's underlying them.
I said they happen really fast, and the thoughts are really fleeting.
They happen so fast, sometimes we don't even see them.
So when we can get to a place where we're recognizing them and not resisting so much the fact that the judging is happening,
we can start to actually look at what's underlying them.
We can begin to explore the way that, what is it that we're clinging to?
What is it that we are holding to that we have this judgment?
So, you know, thinking about this yesterday, I thought of a couple of different ways,
different kinds of ways that we, kind of, the judgments would come into being.
And one of the main ways is around what you might call ethical evaluation, right and wrong.
That's wrong, that's right.
So there is, you know, even in Buddhist terms, there's kind of, you know, right and wrong understanding.
I mean, there's a whole no-beliefful path is phrased in terms of right view, right intention, right speech, right mindfulness,
right concentration, right livelihood, right action.
Our Western sensibilities, you know, the Western Dharma teachers have changed it to wise or skillful.
But, you know, this language isn't there, and sometimes, you know, even some of the older translations talk about good and evil.
Yes, as opposed to skillful and unskillful.
So, you know, this notion of right and wrong is very deep in us.
And there are certain aspects that we may all have a kind of a sensibility around, like the precepts, for example,
you know, that it's not a good idea to kill, it's not a good idea to steal, it's not a good idea to lie.
You know, that there may be some kinds of more human-wide ethical criteria, we might say, that we judge people on.
And there is, you know, the need for safety, the need for protection brings in this sense of judging.
You know, if this person is going to be killing people, this is a bad person, we need to, you know, remove this person somehow.
And, you know, so, again, there's this kind of interesting exploration around this kind of judgment where we need to look at discernment.
And there's so, you know, in this kind of objective realm, if there's somebody running rampant, you know, as a mass murderer,
probably not a good idea to have that person in contact with other people.
So, we can look at that from a kind of a more objective point of view.
Without the hostility, the anger, the hatred that would go along with the judgment, this is a bad person.
I hate this person.
This person is confused, perhaps, you know.
So, with right and wrong, I think, particularly, we can get kind of self-righteous and judge from that place of self-righteousness.
And that has some aversion in it, has some greed in it, you know, I'm right, they're wrong.
And a lot of that judgment comes back here to, again, self and other.
I'm right, they're wrong, I'm good, they're bad.
We can look at the situation from the perspective of this is not helpful, this is, we need to take some care here.
Compassion can be our frame as opposed to judgment.
And with judgment, I think, you know, what I am meaning by judgment here is where it is, it does have a tinge,
at least even a small tinge, it may have a large tinge of greed, aversion, or delusion.
So, right and wrong is one area.
And then we come into more kind of personal, or let's move from there to societal kinds of things.
You know, there's societal cultural views that may not be at the realm of kind of the human sense of right and wrong,
but cultural sense of right and wrong.
How close you stand to somebody when you speak, whether you touch them or not, things like that,
that we might judge somebody on meeting somebody from another culture,
or feel uncomfortable if somebody breaks those kind of societal conventions.
We may judge based on societal conventions.
Then coming closer in, we start to judge based on our own, what we like and what we don't like.
Our own personal preferences, we start to judge based on those.
What we judge based on personal concerns, you know, not only what we like and don't like,
but a sense of perhaps whether our sense of self is being acknowledged in a particular situation.
Are we feeling like we're being dismissed and not heard?
Are we feeling like we're being imposed on?
That's what came from the question, feeling like being imposed on,
judging someone for imposing on you for taking time.
So, you know, there's kind of personal concerns in that realm that can lead to judgment.
We may feel personal concerns if we feel like we're being judged.
This is actually a really good one to look at.
Because, you know, when we feel judged, it doesn't feel very good.
We feel misunderstood, we can feel misunderstood, we can feel like they're not seeing the whole picture,
and this is a good one for us to turn around and look at.
If this is how we feel when we're judged, if we feel like we're misunderstood,
like somebody's not seeing the whole picture, perhaps when we're judging somebody else,
we're not seeing the whole picture.
And then there's personal preferences, you know, not even liking and not liking,
but just like what we prefer, we even judge out of that.
So there's all these different layers of...
It's kind of like they're all based in values and beliefs,
but different kind of layers of values and beliefs from the layers of things that are just preferences
to things that feel like they may threaten our identity,
to things that we like and don't like, to the level of societal values
and to the level of kind of human values.
You know, the range is broad where we may judge from.
But some kind of value or belief is operating often under all of these ways that we create judgment.
Now, one thing that's interesting to look at or to think about perhaps is...
So in a lot of these areas, there can be some kind of suffering that happens around the judgment,
or it's around, you know, judging somebody.
It may be that the judgment itself feels painful,
and that's part of what happens as we start to recognize how massively we're judging people.
And we see in ourselves how painful it is to be judged.
We learn, we see that, oh, it must be painful for them to be judged too,
and we see ourselves doing it.
It's like, I'm no better than they are.
And so we then feel bad about ourselves.
We judge ourselves for judging.
I have lost my train of thought again.
This is what happens when you do this kind of mushroom kind of talk.
Oh, I remember.
So there's often some kind of suffering that happens around judgment,
whether it's the suffering of the judging itself,
or a suffering in response to, in reaction to a judgment.
They shouldn't be doing that, and then we get all this aversion that develops
and thinking that they're wrong and that we get averse to how they are behaving
or what they're wearing.
And so the aversion becomes a kind of suffering.
We suffer from the aversion to the judgment,
which is based in an underlying belief.
The stronger the belief, the stronger the suffering.
I think that's a pretty good basic,
basic thing to hold in your mind.
The stronger the suffering, the stronger the belief around the judgment.
The stronger the suffering, the stronger the clinging, certainly.
We're holding to something pretty tightly when we're suffering.
And the more suffering there is to tighter, we're holding on to something.
So in investigating our judgments,
part of the investigation, once we've looked at kind of the reactivity around the judgment,
that's kind of the outer layers of the judgment is looking at how we're reacting.
But once we can accept the fact that we are judging,
and beginning to explore these underlying beliefs, values,
kind of where the judgment is coming out of,
that's part of our exploration.
And this is a little more challenging because the thoughts are so fleeting.
But we can, in seeing a judgment,
the investigation might be just to simply ask yourself the question,
what value is being challenged here?
Or what belief am I holding on to?
And to just kind of open yourself to that question.
Not to think about it.
You may think about it, but I actually find that with this kind of reflection,
it's helpful to just kind of open yourself up
and see if that question produces any ripples through your experience
and kind of maybe automatically produces an answer.
Not something we're trying to find or trying to figure out,
but just kind of what's...
So we're not trying to dig into the middle of the whole thing,
and what's my core belief here?
It's kind of more like, okay, from this place where I am now,
what kind of belief feels like it's right there?
What's right present?
And that may be a one layer down.
It may be just the next layer down that we begin to see,
oh, there's this feeling of insecurity or whatever it is.
So what's my belief here?
I'm feeling threatened.
Something like that.
Or I feel not safe.
Or I feel imposed on.
Or I feel like they should take my concerns into account
when they're asking for my time.
So to kind of just explore the underlying world of judgments,
seeing if you can begin to see what are the beliefs,
values operating in this situation.
Knowing that the different levels,
the kind of level of right and wrong at the human level,
that those maybe tend to form stronger beliefs,
that it is wrong for somebody to kill somebody.
So that that may be a very strong, almost biological value in a way.
So kind of recognizing that the different levels of where the judgments come from
may produce different strengths of judgment.
Now another thing that, I guess I briefly mentioned it,
the place where our judgments can come out of not understanding.
That's another place where we can judge people.
Is when we don't understand the context of what's going on for them,
we can judge people out of context.
And so this is where understanding and communication can help.
Why are you engaging in that?
It's kind of like, what's the underlying motivation from the other person's perspective?
I had an example, I thought of an example of this.
Kind of a simple one.
But now I can't remember it.
So I'm going to stop there for a minute and see what kind of thoughts and comments you have, Jen.
And do use the mics.
Actually based on an example, I was just thinking when you gave that situation where we don't see the whole picture.
And this just happened this morning.
So I have the example right in my mind where I was emailing someone and their response was a little bit harsh.
And thankfully, I've been meditating a long time.
I was like, okay, well, that was interesting.
And then a few minutes later, that same person sent an email saying, you know what, I'm really not feeling well today.
And I'm sorry that that email was like that.
I really should just go back to bed.
And so it was great because there is this whole piece that if they didn't send the email, I wouldn't understand.
Wow, they weren't feeling well.
And so often we don't get that other piece of information.
Right, exactly.
People aren't willing to share it or whatever.
Maybe they're not even aware of it.
And so we think, oh, they're really a rude person.
Yes, exactly.
So I do love that the whole piece about I'm working with judgment lots.
I very much appreciate you talking.
And I like that this guy is blue.
You know, I also doing in terms of seeing the person as a whole person, what I'm doing is let's say I did think they are a rude person.
Then my assignment, if I can remember this, is to say one positive thing about them.
And actually, so it's interesting that it's perhaps I even should, it might be nice to see if I could find a neutral statement instead of going to the positive.
But anyway, to see the whole picture is to say, and they have a really good heart because last week they were just really generous with X, Y, or Z.
Yes, yeah, yeah.
That's a great exercise.
And I think in terms of the judging of another person, if you have at your, in your mind, also something positive about the person, I think that's a great counter.
You know, it's like, oh, that person's really rude.
And they were really kind to me last week.
You know, that kind of thing helps us to remember, okay, there's probably some context going on here.
You know, it can help us to remember that bigger picture.
There may be some, something going on that's making them rude today.
Thank you for sharing that.
I'm glad you could come up with an example, Arthur.
So, last week, last week, I was one of the things I became aware of was how virtually everything, well, I don't know virtually everything I experienced, but so many of my experiences, emotions come up that I think of it.
I don't think about them, I react to them sometimes, rarely, later.
I realize that I was in a certain mood, but I don't remember the emotion that came up.
It happened much too quickly.
It was much too subtle, etc.
And I always miss that piece of things.
And I was just aware of that a lot last week, and actually I was starting to be aware of it the week before the retreat.
And it led me to a thought that something I wondered about, which is related to your conversation here, but it's beyond my understanding.
And some years ago, I tried to read the Abhidhamma, and I couldn't understand it, and eventually I put it down.
But what I could understand, and what I did read, I think clearly, was that everything that comes into our experience, we react to, positive, negative, or neutral.
And so I don't know if that understanding is correct, and I wonder how...
So that's very theoretical, what you're talking about and what I experienced last week are very pragmatic.
But I'm wondering how these things play out.
And so in terms of the word react, I guess I wouldn't quite use the word react, that we react to everything in our experience.
Because the state of equanimity is kind of a state of non-reactivity, but it is a neutral kind of response.
So to some extent, I guess you could say that we respond to everything with either, you know, there is out of everything that we experience, there is a sense of something being either pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
And from that place of pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, that's where reactivity is formed.
So yes, everything in our experience, we have the sense of pleasant, unpleasant, neutral.
That is the Abhidhamma, they do say that, that every experience has this quality of pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
But that itself is simply the given.
The reactivity comes when we like or don't like the pleasant or unpleasant, or we kind of space out around the neutral.
If we can be balanced around pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral, then we wouldn't, we don't have that reactivity.
And that's kind of what the mindfulness brings in, it brings in that balanced perspective.
But I think yes, a lot of the judgments do come out of the basic level of pleasant, unpleasant, neutral.
Like this, we don't like that. So I think there is a connection there.
The whole structure of how reactivity is born in our mind comes from that basic experience of pleasant, unpleasant, neutral.
So I think that's what you're probably referring to, is that every experience has that quality of pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
And the other piece of it, in the Abhidhamma perspective, is that the moments that they're talking about having experience are incredibly short.
They're mind-bogglingly short. They're said to be 17 trillion mind moments in the blink of an eye.
And so the rapidity through which pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, and experience passes through our minds is beyond our capacity to really see every single one of them.
And so we kind of get, I think, an average perhaps.
Over seconds, we get an average of kind of the basic quality of the last five seconds has been pleasant, or the basic tone of the last five seconds has been unpleasant.
So I think from Abhidhamma perspective, we're kind of dealing with things kind of at the level of averages in a way.
Anyone else?
Yeah.
So this talk on judgment was very timely for me, because as I was meditating this morning, a thought came into my head about visiting my sister over the weekend in Sacramento.
And I don't see her very often, but, and I thought, what was it about that visit, that family visit that I didn't feel so good about?
And I remember she opened the front door, and the second she opened the door, I looked at her and thought, oh, she looks so beautiful.
And then I immediately compared it to me and thought, gosh, I feel sort of tired and dowdy.
And then it went on from there.
At lunch, I was staring at her hair, and her father-in-law just passed away, and she was showing this memory board.
And when she was talking about it, I thought, why is she only talking about the furniture in that room?
Why isn't she talking about this man's life?
And so it was just constant judgment, the whole visit on my part.
And I realized we're a year and a half apart.
We were raised in a family where appearances were a huge deal, and we were constantly compared to each other and possibly judged.
And so now we just continue on with it. And when the two of us are alone together, I mean, she's a really wonderful person.
And we, you know, we have deep conversations about our lives, but something about when a group of people is around.
So it's too bad having heard this talk, now I will try to recognize it at the moment that I'm doing it, rather than like four days later.
So I think that will help in maybe adding a neutral thought onto the moment I'm staring at her hair.
Exactly. Partly that thought too, cuts the stream.
It's like we've got this, oh, look how beautiful her hair is, and look how plain mine is, and oh, I wish I had a stylist.
And so the neutral thought kind of begins to also cut the momentum in that direction.
But the other part that's difficult for me, and maybe you have some ideas about this, is I know I'm being judged constantly as well,
and also dismissed, you know, and it's just part of the family dynamic, especially when it's in a larger group.
And so if that's happening to me, I guess just, again, recognizing it, and then adding some neutral thought to it, you know.
Yeah, I mean, partly, you know, the family dynamics are some of the most challenging places to bring mindfulness to.
As one of my friends said, yeah, they know how to push your button, they made those buttons.
So, you know, partly, those buttons are, you know, they're pushing the button of dismissing and judging.
And yet, if you don't react, I mean, if there weren't, if somebody said something that was dismissive to you, if it had no impact on you,
if it didn't bother you, if you didn't have a sense of it, any reactivity whatsoever to that, would it be a problem?
So, the reactivity to it is what we need to look at.
That's, I mean, it's kind of like we're operating our buttons.
We're looking at how those buttons function inside of us.
Yes, the dynamics are very strong.
It's very hard to not have those reactions, and yet, those reactions are internal.
They are under our own mental processes, those reactions.
And so, because of that, I mean, this is actually good news, because of that, there's some possibility of change.
It's possible for us to learn how to not react when somebody says something that sounds dismissive.
It's possible.
So, looking at the reactivity is the way towards that.
I mean, it's the way in that direction to just begin to see, oh, you know, okay, I feel judged.
And how am I feeling?
What is the impact of that?
How do I feel about that?
And, you know, if you could, I mean, I like the idea.
I'd never heard the idea of, okay, hearing what somebody says to you, like, you know, oh, where did you get that jacket at?
The Goodwill?
Or, you know, and then adding to in your own mind, and the sky is blue, you know, might help you to cut the feeling judged
on the inside, you know, you might recognize it.
Oh, that's just a statement.
It's just words.
Yes.
Yeah, so I like that idea.
Nobody's actually ever suggested that.
But, you know, in terms of receiving judgments from outside, can you add a true neutral thought to that?
I think that's a good idea.
Another tricky place around judgment is when we self-judge.
And I'll talk a little bit more, I think, next week about self-judgment and self-negativity in general.
But we often judge ourselves by imagining that others are judging us.
You know, just the way somebody looks at you, you may think they're judging you.
And, you know, maybe they had some gas in their stomach or something.
You may have no idea why they looked at you that way.
You know, maybe they are judging you.
Maybe they're not, you know.
So, you know, noticing when that kind of self-judgment, I remember, I remember on one retreat, this was like so blindingly clear to me.
I found myself judging myself in contrast to other people.
I would see somebody walking, doing walking meditation.
And they were, you know, she was wrapped in a blanket and she was walking very slowly next to a wall.
She looked very, you know, inward.
And my mind created an idea of what her mind state was and how peaceful and calm and quiet and completely concentrated in present she was.
And I compared my own mind state to that, which was kind of all over the place.
And I found myself as a failure.
I can't do this.
I'm no good.
She can do this.
I can't do this.
And, you know, it was complete fabrication in my mind as to what was going on.
And I had to laugh, you know, when I noticed that.
It's like, oh my God, I'm creating.
I'm imagining somebody else's mind state and then comparing myself to that.
It was ludicrous.
So, you know, that's another way that we judge ourselves, you know, that we create comparisons in our own minds and come up either better or worse than.
But isn't it possible, though, if you saw that calm state and all those judgments you made, that perhaps that you do have the capacity for that?
Because if you can see that the other person has it, doesn't that mean that you can also be like?
It's possible that I was seeing something accurate.
I think it's possible.
I mean, I think it's possible through seeing somebody to tell whether they're mindful or not.
You know, I think you can kind of tell.
But I'm saying if you can see someone else's mind, does that mean that you have that same capacity?
Because if you didn't have the ability to see it, then maybe...
I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know, yeah.
Let's see, there was another bit I wanted to...
Ah, here, this is a piece that I do want to get out there.
Sometimes this kind of discussion around, you know, seeing how we react to things, our judgments and things like that,
we can take this as a, okay, all I'm supposed to do with these things is just add a true neutral statement.
I'm not supposed to do anything with them.
And the sky's blue all the time.
But we do need to take action sometimes.
We do need to use that discernment that the kind of judgment is based on.
We sometimes need to decide, okay, you know, there may be a judgment of this person is being rude to take so much time away from me.
You know, time that I don't have, they're talking to me longer than I...
I'm not sure if this was what you were talking about last week, but I'm coming up with something.
So, you know, the kind of the sense of this person is being rude and resenting their rudeness.
There may... So, yes, noticing all of that, but also knowing when it's time to say, you know, I have some other things to do right now.
This is not a good time for me to talk.
You know, so beginning to recognize the distinction and the...
So there's the judgment, there's all the sense of that person's being rude and there's the sense of, yeah, I need to take some action here.
You know, this is not appropriate at this moment for what I need to do.
So we need to take care of ourselves.
We need to, you know, again, look at where is it discernment and wisdom and where is it judgment?
And they're probably both together in the realm of judgment.
They can often be both together in the realm of judgment.
So seeing if you can come back to that and see if you can take action from that place, from the place where there's wisdom,
as opposed to the place from, oh, you're being really rude.
You know, if you take action from the place of wisdom, you may have a kinder way of speaking,
as opposed to a kind of a lashing out way of speaking.
And this is just a simple example, but I really wanted to put that out there
because I don't want you to get the idea that all we do is just look at our judgments
and, you know, try to not react to them and not respond to them.
I mean, there may well be need to respond to take some action.
And I think, you know, this is why we put people who kill people in prison.
You know, we need to separate them from the society, but we also don't have to hate them.
I mean, the causes and conditions of their life, if you had grown up in their causes and conditions, how might it have been for you?
So, you know, recognizing, really recognizing the whole nature of the context of experience can bring a lot of compassion.
And it's eleven o'clock.
So, thank you for participating and contributing to this discussion.
