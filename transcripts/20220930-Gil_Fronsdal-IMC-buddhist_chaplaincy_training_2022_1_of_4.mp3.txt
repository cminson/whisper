 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So a few things. One is about COVID. So we have to all be masked for now. You know, this is a moving event. So it might be that that changes over the course of the program. And which direction it changes, we don't know. But probably it'll get better. And now I feel more comfortable at some point taking the masks off, but we'll see. We're following the protocol here at IMC. I think we're required to do that. We're kind of guests of the IMC. And there's a number of things that protect us. One is hopefully all of you are vaccinated. Second is that wearing these masks and 95 masks are quite protective. We have a lot of air purification going on. In this room here, there are four air purifiers on. There's two of them in the outer hull. And also we have, I don't know if it's on, but it's supposed to be on. Is the fan on? Yeah. Okay. And so the fan is bringing fresh air into the room. So we're getting outside air coming in. And we could also, at some point, if it's warm enough, we can open the doors and, you know, do that too. Or if we have a break, we can open that door and that door just kind of air out the place even more. So I think those, you know, the combination of all those things, I think we're well protected. We also, when we go outside, we can take the masks off, if you'd like. And so what I noticed last year when we started, we did the same thing and masks off outside. Maybe things were different a year ago, but I was kind of a little bit, wow, they're standing close together. And so, I don't know, you know, whatever your comes, it's up to you. You know, it's your, you're responsible for your own thing. What's your outside? And we can eat lunch outside. That's pretty standard for our program. We put up chairs and tables outside and it's a kind of very nice place to sit and have lunch and chat. And I think most of you haven't been here, I think, before, but a few of you have. I think Sage has been here, Conrad has been here, Kristen has been here, Alan has been here. Anybody else? Sharon has been here, yes. So I'm putting them out just because of those who've never been here before. There's a few you can ask in addition to me if, you know, I don't know what you'd ask about how it works here. And then Jennifer will be late. She had surgery for a foot recently. And so she just had the cask go off a few days ago and she can't put weight still on her foot. So it takes things take longer for her to come down from where she is in Santa Rosa. But she'll be here and but when she comes, she'd probably come on some kind of scooter or something, some kind of device that probably the two of you sitting there. If you could just kind of make more room for her so she can make it easy to come in. And so those are the logistics. So any logistical things that would help you feel more comfortable here? Yes. Yeah, we have a break schedule and about mid morning. The usual schedule is have a session, a break, and then a session and lunch. And then the same thing in the afternoon. Sometimes in the afternoon we have two breaks because in the afternoon one of the breaks second, the last break, whenever that is, we are also responsible for cleaning the place up and turning it back into what it was before. And it usually happens somewhat informally. Different people take turns during different times without any any particular request or way. But we have to clean the bathrooms, we have to tidy it up. The kitchen and trash, trash should be taken out, the kitchen tidied up. Sometimes we vacuum the carpet here. So it's not a big thing, but I'll talk more about that at the end of the day. So any other thing that you can think of? Logistical wise, the program ideas will come soon. Okay, welcome for. I said I wouldn't do it, but I can do is I can welcome you wholeheartedly from IMC. I also represent IMC here so IMC welcomes you and IMC is very happy that this program happens here and delighted that you're come here to be part of it. Well, the last thing to say is that we ask you only bring water in here. No food and no other drinks. Okay. So here's the formal welcome. Welcome. You know, on the first day we've been teaching this program together with Jennifer for many years. And but each year I often feel like this is the first day at school, you know, and you look around and you see all these people you don't know. And you sit in a big circle and feel like you're back at school. And in some ways that's how it is. But as I drove down with Kay and I was saying, but then six months later, you know so much about each other and you feel some kind of trust and intimacy. And it's so interesting how that evolves and ripens. So in a moment, we will go around and each of us will just say our name, our pronouns, where you're from, and maybe one or two words or a phrase about just how you're feeling right now. In fact, maybe we should just start with that. Okay, I'll start. The way these mics are designed, they're kind of you hold them horizontally. They take the sound better than that like this. Was that loud enough? Yeah. So let's see, is that louder now? That's good. Someone like to begin and we'll go clockwise from there. Good morning everyone. I'm Conrad, I came in from San Mateo this morning, and I'm feeling elated to be here with everyone. Hi, I'm Alisa. I like they them pronouns. I came from Oakland today. And I'm from Delaware, originally, and I'm feeling interested. Good morning. My name is Kay, I use she her pronouns. I'm currently living in San Francisco, but I'm from the Northeast Connecticut, and I'm feeling, I'm feeling really excited and like a little tense. Hi everyone, I'm Latisa. I am. Oh, I use she her pronouns. I'm coming in from Berkeley, IBS, but I'm from about an hour and a half north of Atlanta, Georgia, and I'm feeling relaxed. Hi, I'm Sharon.

And I'm very excited about starting this and meeting everyone and learning more. Good morning, Alan. He him. I live in West Marin. I've lived in Marin County most of the last 40 years. Curious aroused, edgy and open. I'm Gil and I've lived here in Redwood City for 20 years, moved here after IMC acquired this building here. And and I think 19 of those years we've been doing this chaplaincy program. So this is this is actually the 20th time we're doing it. And so I'm very delighted to be here. I love this program. I love the people who come and getting to know you all is going to be something I look forward to. I'm Paul. He him. I grew up in Ireland. I've lived in I live, I practice and live beside.

I use she her pronouns. I drove over from Stanford this morning and I would say I am over caffeinated, but joyful. Is Jennifer arriving? Yeah. Yeah. OK. Well, she's arriving. Let me tell you, give you a brief outline of the schedule for today and then we'll do a sitting. OK. So welcome meditation and some words from Gil and myself on the Buddhist spiritual care program and practice. And then a discussion we'll have as a large group. Then we'll take a break. And then Jennifer will talk about the history of chaplaincy and how set a context for this program. In particular, the didactic aspect of the skill building aspect of the program. And then Gil will give a presentation on the spiritual formation, how our practice is an integral part of the program and how we will cultivate that together. And then we'll have lunch. And as Gil said, we could do that outdoors if we wish. And then in the afternoon we'll we'll outline the different components of the program. There's a variety of things that will be helpful to know. And it might feel like it's too much information all at once. And that's where you will also it'll be on the Web site and you'll also be introduced to it as we go along. And then towards the end of the afternoon, then we'll do that. Then that will finish with a break and then we'll have what we're calling community formation. I think you all know to bring a shoebox with some mementos and show it tells. And the notion is that it's it's it's a kind of a fun thing to do. It's it's a way to just let other people know we'll do it in small groups. And then each of us will have an opportunity to demonstrate some of the details of who we are and how we got here. So that's the day. And here comes Jennifer. And put that phone in with the Christians that she has. Jennifer, do you want it that high or do you do would you like a lower pedestal to put your foot on. It's OK. We just all introduced ourselves and I wondered if you would like to introduce yourself. My name is Jennifer Block. I've met all of you virtually. It's nice to be with you in person for a moment. I look forward to our time together. I broke my ankle and had surgery. And I'm four weeks from surgery so I'm hoping by the next time I see you I'll be walking. But we'll see. That's all I got for now. OK. We'll have a sitting now and we will each time we come together after a brief welcome. We'll sit for about 15 minutes so you can just make yourself comfortable. And if you want to get a saffron and a cushion to sit on the floor you can do that. Thank you. So just to let yourself be. Just notice how it is to be here what it's evoking. And feel into the mental disposition the physical disposition and any emotions that are coming up. And as you do that. Just to let yourself breathe. Let yourself feel the inhale taking it in. And let yourself feel the exhale. Just releasing into being here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So this is a technique we will use quite a bit, you know. I don't know if you've heard this, I lied before. Talk about it, do it, and then talk about what you did. Here's what we're going to do, here's now we're doing it, and how was it to do it? And it's interesting when it's more amorphous, you know, it's not like, okay, here's a task, you know. It's more like, find your relationship to what was presented, and notice and share what it evokes for you, and then let that sort of sink in. Yeah? And somehow speaking it out loud helps that process. Okay, so we will take a break now for 15 minutes, and there's tea there in the drawers, if you're not familiar with the place, you can just open the drawers and explore, and there's water too, okay. So we'll ring a bell in about a couple of minutes before we start again. Thank you. And if the paper cups that were tea are not on the counter, they're in the cabinets. And you could also write your name on it when you sit in the cup for the day.
