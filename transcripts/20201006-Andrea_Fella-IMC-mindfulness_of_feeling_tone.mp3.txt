We've been exploring the Satipattana Sutta for the last few weeks of this class. 
And this is a transition today. 
We've been speaking of the first foundation of mindfulness for the last weeks, foundation of the body. 
And today we're shifting to the second foundation, the foundation of feeling tone. 
Widna in the Pali, or Vedna. 
It's spelled with a V at the beginning, but often that's pronounced with a slight W sound. 
I think that in the Satipattana Sutta as a whole, the order from one thing to the next, there is a somewhat logical progression in a way. 
The body is often the most obvious aspect of experience, and something of the easiest to begin to be more clearly aware of with mindfulness. 
That we can kind of attune to physical experience and know, oh yeah, I'm aware of that. 
That's probably one of the easiest places to have that sense. 
Yes, I'm aware of physical experience. 
That's harder to do with the mind, at least for me it was. 
And so I think that the progression in the Satipattana Sutta, starting with body to help us become aware in the encouragement at the beginning. 
When breathing in, know that you're breathing in. 
That's like the first instruction almost in the Satipattana Sutta. 
Just breathing in, know that you're breathing in. 
And then becoming aware of postures and when walking, know that you're walking. 
Becoming aware of the sensation level of experience, knowing the hardness and softness, all of that. 
And also in that first foundation, becoming aware of how we relate to the body through reflection. 
Recognizing that we tend to relate to the body as beautiful, perhaps, as something to desire. 
And the Buddha tries to encourage us to, like, well, what is actually is the body? Well, it's all these parts. 
We've got skin, we've got hair, we've got nails and teeth, and any one of those particularly beautiful if you think of it all by itself. 
And so just an encouragement to reflect on the nature of our body as being composed of all these different parts. 
And then a reflection on that our physical body, our body, our beings of the nature to decay and die. 
And so all of that is kind of some of the more obvious connection to connect with both our physical experience and our relationship to our body. 
The second foundation is a kind of a place where we can begin to transition between awareness of our physical experience and our mental experience. 
Every single physical sensation has this feeling tone to it. 
And that feeling tone in the Buddhist understanding is actually a mental construction. 
And I'll get into that in a little bit more in just a bit. 
But it is, you know, so there is the physical sensation and associated with the physical sensation is this quality of his pleasant unpleasant or neutral. 
And so that's a that's a kind of a shift that we can make in our awareness of our physical experience to help us begin to be curious about what's happening in our minds. 
The third foundation is more directly attuning to mental experience attuning to whether there's greed aversion delusion or non greed non aversion non delusion in the mind or whether the mind is stable concentrated or agitated or ease. 
So it's got that flavor. 
And at least in my own experience, learning how to be aware of the mind states, you know, to learn to be clearly aware, yes, now I know that I'm aware of that experience in the mind. 
That was a little harder than being aware of the body got a little more confusing. 
And so I think that the progression offered in the Satipa Tanasuta is a very logical, supportive progression for many of us. 
It's not true for everybody. 
Some people have a very natural capacity to just know, be aware of what's happening in the mind. 
But I think it there's some there's some logic to to the progression. 
So the, the second foundation, recognizing whether experience is pleasant unpleasant or neutral. 
It is a transition point where we begin to, to touch into something that is actually happening in the mind, this, this, this experience of pleasant unpleasant neutral. 
So, just to describe a little bit about that piece right now. 
Every experience that we have, whether it's a body sensation, or a mental experience, a thought, an emotion. 
Physical body sensation, every single experience has this corresponding quality of being pleasant unpleasant or neutral. 
This is an aspect of the experience that the Buddha actually highlighted a lot as being an important place to notice because what tends to happen with this feeling tone. 
What tends to happen with the experience, particularly of pleasant and unpleasant neutral often we don't particularly notice, you know, neutral we can kind of space out around. 
So that often is a relationship to neutral that we just kind of disconnect and lose attention with pleasant and unpleasant. 
Or there tends to be a response a reaction to it when something's pleasant, we almost don't even know it's pleasant consciously before we're already liking it and moving towards it. 
Likewise with unpleasant we, we can very automatically will move away from it. 
And so what we, we tend to do very habitually. 
This is not, it's very human, let's say it's actually very, it's natural for any living being to move towards what's pleasant and move away from what's unpleasant. 
Even a, you know, a single celled creature will move towards food and away from noxious chemicals. 
And so there's this kind of very natural movement in this direction. 
One of the points to in human experience, however, though, is that there is a possibility there is a difference. 
He's pointing to for us, there's a difference between the pleasant unpleasant and the subsequent response, the leaning towards the pushing away, the liking or the not liking. 
The, that that point, that place between pleasant and the response to it is essentially where we wind up in the terrain of creating suffering. 
That habitual movement from pleasant to liking to wanting to needing to holding that habitual movement from unpleasant to not liking to wanting to push away to resisting. 
That's where suffering happens. 
And what he discovered in his own experience is that it is possible in the human mind. 
It may not be possible in the amoeba experience, but it's possible in the human mind to know that something is pleasant. 
And just know that it's pleasant without having that subsequent kind of tumbling into reactivity around it. 
So he pointed to this, this experience a lot in, in many of his teachings, it's highlighted in so many places. 
It's not the only, the only thing that's highlighted in terms of how we can begin to understand our minds kind of wrapping themselves into suffering. 
He also talks about views, he talks about a perception, all kinds of other things as well, but he speaks about this a lot about the feeling tone, and that he says it is not being mindful of the feeling tone as feeling tone. 
Not being aware, oh, this is pleasant feeling, this is unpleasant feeling, that that leap towards reactivity happens. 
And so he really indicates or points out that if we can know just clearly know this is pleasant, this is unpleasant. 
It can almost short circuit that habitual very, very conditioned movement towards reactivity. 
We can know something is unpleasant and have no sense of not liking. 
We can know something's pleasant and just know that it's pleasant. 
There can be, you know, there can be a kind of a discernment that happens around that. 
That's an important thing to recognize. 
So I think sometimes in hearing this, you know, well, gee, if I just know it's unpleasant, you know, why would I take care of myself if I didn't react to it? But there's there can be discernment around pleasant and unpleasant that comes with wisdom. 
So wisdom can respond to pleasant and unpleasant, not so rather than responding or reacting out of greed or aversion. 
What can happen is that there can be a discernment of this unpleasant experiences damaging to the body to the to the being. 
And it's wise, it's compassionate, so out of compassion, it can be it can be useful to move away from that unpleasant experience to change the conditions so that that unpleasant experience stops. 
So for instance, if you if you're cutting yourself with a knife, you know, you're not going to just keep cutting yourself with a knife. 
The the the movement will be, oh, that hurts, you know, that that the body responds with that pleasant unpleasant experience and the the system can respond from compassion as opposed to aversion to say, oh, well, let's not do that, you know, but that that was an accident, you know, let me stop doing that. 
So the the response when there is awareness of pleasant unpleasant neutral experience can come from wisdom rather than the habitual reaction. 
But first we do need to do some work to get familiar with the pleasant unpleasant and what our habitual responses and reactions are. 
And then the guided meditation I suggested, you know, that you might notice if there's a pleasant or unpleasant experience. 
Whether there is also a corresponding reaction to it, kind of a liking or not liking to it and just aware okay well that's there too. 
There's pleasant experience and liking is happening unpleasant experience and not liking is happening. 
It doesn't necessarily stop the not liking but again the mindfulness, the mindfulness helps the mind to begin to recognize actually what the mind begins to recognize there is when there's the unpleasant experience and the not liking. 
The not liking also being an experience has a feeling tone associated with it. 
Not liking tends to be unpleasant. 
And so the unpleasant sensation and the not liking that that unpleasantness of the not liking, they come together. 
It's not a simple additive kind of thing you've got one unpleasant plus one other unpleasant, it seems to be more multiplying that when there's an unpleasant, you know when there's a mental reaction of unpleasant to have not liking that is unpleasant to a physical response of unpleasant. 
It seems to really make it takes the amplification of that unpleasantness up, and then we tend to react even more. 
So this pattern, this dynamic, let's say, this habitual dynamic of wanting to push something away to resist something unpleasant, we can start to see how that creates this feedback loop and adds to the unpleasantness. 
And in the mindfulness, we might see sometimes where the not liking diminishes. 
Maybe, maybe there's the unpleasant sensation and then there's, you know, full blown like hating or resisting and then it's like, Oh, okay. 
Seeing of it allows that to weaken and maybe you even see it just drop it's like, Oh, this is just unpleasant. 
It's not even as unpleasant as I thought it was. 
It really is the physical sensation. 
This is another really useful exploration with feeling tone. 
What is the actual experience. 
And what's the mental response to it, because sometimes our minds like will so habitually react they start screaming with just something very small in the physical realm often. 
And then when we actually see, Well, what is that reactivity happening to. 
We might see, Oh, it's actually not that unpleasant. 
It's just a little bit unpleasant. 
And, and maybe we can start to see that, that the just being with that unpleasantness is a very different experience than having that unpleasantness course with the corresponding reactivity to it. 
This is a very important learning that the Buddha points to over and over again. 
He talked about in in one of his teachings around the feeling tone. 
It's a he uses a similarly. 
It's called the dart suit. 
And he says it's no if somebody if somebody who hasn't got a lot of training in mindfulness experiences a an unpleasant experience. 
I'll read a little section of this. 
First of all, he says that people who are both fully awakened who have, who have no reactivity in their minds who are completely at ease and at peace with what's happening in experience. 
Both those people and people who are untrained will experience pleasant and unpleasant and neutral. 
So right there he is pointing to that unpleasant experience is going to keep happening to us. 
And this is just a part of being a human being, you know, pleasant unpleasant neutral is this flow of pleasant unpleasant neutral. 
This happens to us. 
And yet somebody who doesn't have the training in mindfulness. 
When they experience a painful bodily sensation. 
He says they worry and grieve they lament beat their breast weeping and distraught. 
They thus experienced two kinds of feelings, a bodily feeling and a mental feeling. 
It is as if someone were pierced by a dart. 
And following the first pairing is piercing is hit by a second dart. 
So that person will experience feelings caused by two darts. 
So that's that that you know the unpleasantness of the sensation and then the unpleasantness of the reaction. 
And then he says in the case of someone who is well trained when they are touched by a painful physical feeling. 
They will not worry nor grieve nor lament will not beat their breast nor wheat and nor become distraught. 
What happens when they feel a painful physical feeling. 
They feel a painful physical feeling. 
That's it. 
This person experiences a feeling caused by a single dart rather than the two darts. 
So this exploration is a is a key place as we start to see the how much suffering is added to our system by the reactivity. 
We begin to see that that reactivity is something that our own minds is our own minds are doing to themselves that there's an option there. 
You know that that that dart analogy it's like so there's you know we get hit by darts you know sometimes those those darts happen to us. 
And it's just like the conditions of the world. 
We fall down and there's a pain in the knee and you know it's like that is just a physical condition if that's what happens when the body gets impinged on like that. 
The second dart instead you know the the wording of it was then they're hit by a second dart well what actually happens more like is that we pick up a second dart and stab ourselves with it. 
That's what's going on with the reactivity. 
And so it's optional we don't have to pick up that second dart and yet it is habitually conditioned. 
And so it's very. 
It's very natural in a way that it unfolds that way. 
And it's not necessarily that we can stop picking up that dart but we can at least become aware that we're picking up that dart and that that is something that the mind is doing to itself as it sees that. 
So as as mindfulness starts to see what it's doing what the mind is doing to itself. 
Mindfulness and wisdom begin to kind of recognize oh that doesn't have to be the way it is and it begins to slowly recondition towards just knowing oh that's a painful feeling. 
And I can know that that can just be where it stops. 
So the orientation towards awareness of feeling tone and seeing how the feeling tone tends to kind of habitually move us into reactivity helps the mind to begin to see while the feeling tone may be something that is out of my control. 
You know not something that you know is it's just going to happen in our experience. 
But this reactivity is something that mindfulness and wisdom begin to discern how to essentially recondition our mind to not react to that experience. 
So every experience been primarily talking about physical sensation partly because I think that's an easy place. 
It's probably the easiest place to begin to see the feeling tone. 
It's it's it's it's more obvious to us in a way that the physical sensation has an associated feeling tone. 
Also our mental experience emotions thoughts all have feeling tone also so you know emotion like joy for instance has a pleasant quality. 
An emotion like anger has an unpleasant quality. 
So there's there's feeling tone associated with every single experience sometimes it's neutral so the neutral feeling tone is much less obvious we might think nothing's happening. 
You know there's not a feeling tone there well if it feels like there's not a feeling tone it might be it might be neutral. 
It also might be very subtle pleasant or unpleasant that's that's kind of harder to see. 
So every single experience that happens. 
All of our mental formations all of our thoughts emotions have a feeling tone to them so something like thoughts also have feeling tones with them that that sometimes a thought arises about something that has happened in the past and the the feeling tone essentially is created in association with how we relate to that memory. 
The memory itself might just be like one thing I've noticed is sometimes a thought itself arising before the mind kind of reconstructs the the experience so you know a memory arises it's it's kind of like an image flashes on the screen. 
And the mind kind of remembers everything that was going on and it kind of can create perhaps the emotions the feelings the thoughts you know it kind of creates everything. 
And then there's there's often a feeling tone associated with that so if you remember for instance a an argument that you had with someone. 
You know that the initial what what what we may experience is that that is an unpleasant thought. 
What I've seen in in mostly in longer retreat is that actually you know this was shocking to me actually. 
It was right after the the September 11 attacks that I was sitting one of the three month courses sitting a three month course in IMS and a lot of the images from the video from what I'd seen on television were coming into my mind. 
And you know there was the the the whole emotional tone that was arising with that the the fear the the distress the anxiety the heartbreak of you know what was happening all of that was there. 
And yet at one point what I saw was the arising of the thought before all of that emotional before all of the memories and ideas that were associated with that were constructed. 
It was just the image that I was seeing in the mind and it was neutral. 
And then there was the understanding of what it meant. 
And what was interesting in that moment was that it wasn't so much that all of the reactivity was born what in that moment was born with compassion. 
Because there was the understanding this was what was happening. 
So there there was a response to it out of compassion that you know so there and then there is the understanding of what that image actually represented. 
So the feeling of the the feeling tone of the thought itself the initial thought the initial experience that itself was neutral. 
And then there was you know the understanding that there's the construction that's connected with the understanding of what that thought represents. 
So every experience we have has a feeling tone associated with it. 
And that feeling tone is understood to be mental. 
Now that's probably easier to understand with the mental experiences like for me definitely the anger being an unpleasant quality that's easy to understand as a mental experience. 
It was harder for me to understand how you know the feeling tone in the body was was mental. 
And you know I think partly we can we can recognize that you know certain experiences we have perhaps sometimes they're pleasant or unpleasant depending on the context in which it's happening. 
We might we might begin to notice that that you know the similar kind of sensation might be kind of interpreted as pleasant in one situation or unpleasant in another situation. 
There's actually been studies done about this and I'll say that modern neuro psychology neuroscience actually agrees with the Buddhist assessment that feeling tone is a mental construction. 
So that they did there was a study that really clearly demonstrates this. 
There were two scenarios that participants were exposed to one where there were they either had a moderately painful sensation or no no painful sensation that you know that either no sensation so they were they were told okay you're going to get this moderately painful sensation or the you know it's not going to happen and you know how did they rate that moderately painful sensation and what happened in their brains yes it interpreted as pain. 
You know they they looked in the in the brain waves and yes it was interpreted as pain. 
In the second scenario, they either had the moderately painful sensation or a very painful sensation. 
And they were shown on a screen what they were going to get you know what was the the next sensation coming up so they were kind of prepared for what was going to happen. 
And what happened in this case is that when they got the moderately painful sensation. 
They were told you know okay it's going to be moderate they actually rated that as pleasant. 
And the painful sensation they rated as painful. 
Not only did they say oh yeah that was that was pleasant, but their brains also showed that it registered as pleasant. 
The researchers were a little surprised by this result actually. 
And what their hypothesis was was that essentially the context, the recognition of it's not going to be so bad this time created a mental condition of relief that influenced the experience of that painful sensation. 
So this is this this is you know even with physical sensation. 
What's going on in our minds has a huge effect on how we interpret that experience and so the sensation of pleasant unpleasant or neutral is not in the experience itself. 
There's the sensation that happens in our physical body it's you know the contact with our sense base. 
And then there is the mind kind of based on the context the conditions the views the ideas a whole host of things interprets it as pleasant unpleasant or neutral. 
That's kind of mind blowing I think you know it's kind of kind of amazing to see you know how that works and that you know the brain studies actually actually point that to that as well. 
So let's see. 
I'll actually just speak for a couple more minutes about views I want to leave a little bit of time for some comments and questions. 
This is not the only time we'll talk about feeling tone will continue this conversation. 
So that you know that study that we just talked about is pointing to how the recognition or a condition essentially the condition of knowing you know that in that case they gave them the the warning. 
You know this is going to be moderate this was going to be intensely painful. 
So that created a kind of context in the mind of what was coming. 
So you know that's that's essentially a view in the mind. 
Okay this is not going to be so unpleasant this time. 
And that shaped the quality or the feeling the feeling tone itself. 
I've experienced this kind of thing in my own experience where I see how a view or an idea can really shape the feeling tone. 
One sitting at one point. 
It was late at night I'd gotten up it was you know I was having trouble sleeping so I got up and was sitting in meditation and I heard. 
I heard this kind of scratching sound in the wall. 
I heard this kind of pretty light scratching sound. 
And there was you know kind of the feeling the the the experience was that it was an unpleasant sound was an unpleasant experience. 
And there was a kind of attention in the body I was just noticing all of this. 
And it would stop and you know so I got a bunch of chances because it came and went it seemed to come and go quite a bit during the during the sitting. 
The scratching sound would come and there would be tension and there would be the unpleasant quality of the tension as well as the as the scratching sound so I was just noticing the feeling tone it was really quite an investigation of feeling tone. 
And at one point I noticed a little flash of fear happen when the scratching sound happened. 
And that was clearly an unpleasant experience to know there was a very clear there was the fear and the unpleasantness of the fear. 
And at some point through this whole exploration I began to I noticed that they were also with that fear there were images of like a rat in the wall and like things like that were going on. 
And at some point the mind kind of just really landed having seen all of this just landed of oh it's just the scratching sound. 
And when the mind kind of just knew of that's the scratching sound. 
And there wasn't the, and I didn't make it stop right I didn't make the fear stop I didn't make the, the tension stop. 
It was just through the exploration of being with the sound noticing the tension noticing the fear noticing all that there was a little moment a slight moment in there where there was just the scratching sound. 
And the sound itself was not unpleasant. 
It was just a sound. 
And so I could see that the whole host of ideas about what the sound was had shaped the interpretation of the sound. 
And so I had thought that that scratching sound was was from a dear friend who'd come, you know, come back after a long, you know, scratching I'm home, you know, maybe I would have had a different interpretation but no my mind thought it was a rat so you know it created that that experience of unpleasant. 
This happens all the time, actually, that what we are experiencing is pleasant unpleasant neutral is shaped by views by beliefs. 
So it's really useful this is what I pointed to a little earlier it's really useful to recognize when there is some kind of reactivity because there's such a connection between the mind reacting to something, the experience of pleasant unpleasant or neutral and the mind reacting to it. 
You know, we often will will notice the reactivity. 
And kind of, you know, there, there's a little bit of understanding, you know, okay, there's something happening. 
But what actually is that reactivity reacting to. 
In the case of the, you know, the scratching sound. 
What the mind was actually reacting to was not the sound itself. 
You know, I thought I was reacting to the sound. 
But what the mind was actually reacting to was the idea that the sound meant there was a rat in the wall. 
It was really useful to, to begin to notice what actually. 
So there there's the, there's pleasant unpleasant neutral experience. 
What is the mind actually reacting to, when it has some kind of a version or, or leaning, even even wanting. 
You know, most of the time we are, we are actually wanting or wanting to get rid of something that the mind has created some some idea in the mind, as opposed to actually I mean that's actually all that we can respond to because that's all that we have, you know, we're, we're not, we're not what what our minds create what we know directly what our experience is, is entirely created by our minds. 
And so there's a lot of room for misinterpretation misjudgment. 
And so it's really it's really useful to begin to recognize that the judgments the views the beliefs are what often we are responding to, and to have some discernment about them. 
Those views beliefs, actually useful views and beliefs, are they supportive, are they just purely made up so much I've seen, you know, my views and beliefs are just some idea based on history or, or my conditioning and not really connected to what's actually happening right now. 
So, yeah, let's see what, whether you have some thoughts or questions, let me give you the opportunity to unmute yourselves. 
Okay, so I'd like to continue recording for this part so any comments or questions. 
Yeah, Kate. 
Okay. 
Yep. 
Great. 
No, I just, I noticed in the in the guided meditation that just the I was I was feeling a slightly unpleasant sensation in the body, but just the act of bringing attention to it. 
There was a kind of a pleasantness within that just just just really felt that it's kind of like a kindness kindness to myself just just to kind of say oh yes that does feel just a little bit uncomfortable. 
That's a great realization or recognition, you know, actually I think that's, that's part of how the practice works, you know, the movement of be bringing wise attention to our experience that is something that's kind and so there can be if we're attuned to it, there can be a pleasant quality associated with that. 
That's a wholesome pleasant quality. 
That's actually what's pointed to as a in the Sati Patanasuta and this will get to in some subsequent weeks at points to beginning to notice the difference between what's called unworldly pleasant and unpleasant and neutral and unworldly pleasant unpleasant and neutral. 
And that's a kind of a distinguishing quality of the, the worldly pleasant unpleasant neutral is kind of what's coming in in relationship to our ordinary lives the unworldly pleasant is connected to feeling tones connected to the path of practice. 
So that might be feelings associated with being mindful, and having wisdom and mindfulness arise in our experience and so that brings in a quality and that's that's kind of a wholesome quality. 
That's coming with, you know wholesome quality of kindness and care and attention that brings a pleasant feeling tone as well. 
So yeah, that's that and I think that's part of how the practice begins to progress that there are. 
You know we begin to recognize that there's some pleasant. 
Well there's some pleasant and unpleasant there actually some unpleasant feeling tones that are associated with progress on the path with moving in the direction of, of freedom. 
But a lot of them are also pleasant. 
And so, you know, as we begin to discern and distinguish the difference between those two. 
We learned that the, the feeling tones associated with the path of practice are, you know, they're kind of like a sign or a guide post to us. 
Oh yeah, this is helpful. 
This is this direction is helpful. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, Kate. 
It's a Kate day. 
Kate and Kate. 
So the thing about the, the work being done at your house. 
So the room that I sit in is about 10 feet from a major construction house that's been being constructed for two years. 
So I've had a lot of time to experiment with the unpleasant sounds. 
And I noticed so much. 
I mean, I noticed this a lot anyway that real it's the thoughts that are the killer with them, you know, with all of it because, although for the last month, they've been grinding flagstone. 
And that's like the cut, you know, like like a dentist drill going on for a really long time. 
And that has been very interesting because I have had that at some point I just have had to say I give up and I close the door and I put in earplugs. 
But, but it's always a thought and every morning when, when my partner and I go on our coffee walks, we chat with the guys. 
So often I can turn the, the thought, the reactive thought to it into a it's just the guys they're doing their job, you know, and so I really know that and so I hope we're going to look more at the feeling tone stuff regarding thought. 
Absolutely. 
Yes. 
It also seems like some of the other thing I was thinking about with thoughts is that a thought can happen and it's pleasant. 
And as I watch the thought, I notice it getting more unpleasant, like the complications and then the thought becomes. 
So anyway, I think there's just a lot. 
I love to look at with thoughts. 
There's a lot there with thoughts and and you know it's it is like you know the kind of the construction that comes with it. 
You know it's it's the idea, the idea and the whole like it can happen very quickly. 
You know that the idea comes in and then you know the, the so it's not just a single feeling tone right it's the, it's the image and it's the idea of it shouldn't be happening and it's the, the kind of memory of things like this happening in the past and that gets pulled in. 
So there's a lot of things that get pulled in, and we are experiencing you know the kind of the, the, the building of that. 
And so yeah it's it's very it's very powerful and I think actually, you know the views it's to me it's it's the views are even a deeper kind of foundation on which the tone is built. 
You know, because like it's there's something kind of maybe just very basic, you know some basic idea of they don't have the right to do that to me or something like that. 
It kind of is partly what it's it's shaped on. 
You know and I think to with certain. 
Just a minute here. 
Maybe I'll maybe I'll say a little bit about this. 
You know the the the the sound that you talk about the really the high pitched sound that comes with the you know the drilling, you know some of that is actually I think hard on the eardrum right it's it's it's it's so it's stronger physical unpleasant sensation, and it's not so much the what the sound represents but it's actually it's actually touch sense right you're actually getting, you know, you can actually the eardrums can get ruptured with very certain kinds of sounds and so you know it's it's actually a painful physical sense. 
Sometimes it's not so that's not so much related to what it is or the idea about it it's actually more like you know somebody's actually you know poking you the sound waves are actually poking you. 
And that was why that was a very interesting time when they started doing that it was like, Oh, this is a little different, you know, this was not just me having to go, it's okay it's okay it's just this is what they're doing. 
It was like, No, I think I got to close the door here. 
Yeah, yeah, it's actually becomes physically painful not just the idea of what it is is painful. 
And that's, that's a very interesting thing to notice the difference between is okay so there's a sound and at a certain range of sound. 
You know, it's just vibration of the eardrum, and it's the interpretation of what the sound is. 
Is that some music that I like playing in that range or is that, you know, a guy rolling a wheelbarrow across the lawn, you know, so it's like, you know, so the, the idea that it's music and something you like you know that that that I the thought is what shapes the feeling tone versus the wheelbarrow. 
But, you know, at a certain range, a certain, you know, strength of the sound and a certain frequency, it actually can become physically painful.
