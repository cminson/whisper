 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. There. Ah, so, hello. Good to see you. Good to be with you. In the US, the eve of this holiday, we call Thanksgiving. Giving thanks, giving thanks. And there's so much to say about this holiday, and of course it's complicated and challenging history. Just give a nod to that, acknowledge that. And what I'd like to perhaps bring in tonight for our reflection is this practice of appreciating, appreciating, appreciating, giving thanks, gratitude, or affirming goodness. That's one way we can think of the practice of appreciation, gratitude, affirming goodness, or appreciating. And we can also appreciate what, you know, we often, we often tend to like or appreciate or be grateful for what is good, what is pleasant. But it may not necessarily always be that way. Can we also be, can we open up and appreciate what is, even if it's not pleasant, if it's not, if it doesn't feel good in the moment. So, so just to give you an example, I've just recently been sick with the flu, as I shared earlier, and still recovering. Still you might hear it in my voice a bit. And I want to relate also another practice in the story. Let me just bring in another. Yeah. So, so I want to bring in the theme of, of appreciation, given that in the US, at least, is the week of Thanksgiving. So this holiday of giving thanks, appreciation, turning our minds to it. So I want to bring another theme in. And this is thanks to Christine, one of the regulars at Happy Hour who sent me an email and I think she also sent an email similar email to, to Happy Hour with a local singer songwriter that she likes. And the name of the songwriter is Leah and her channel on YouTube is I Am Leah. And Leah has a lot of songs on gratitude and on love and, and her songs, many of them are like mini Dharma talks. So, so, so one of them that Christine sent and you can look at your mailbox later, please don't do it now, is the song that inspired Christine and I did watch it too. It was quite lovely. So this, this singer songwriter as the song about, about what's called Three, Three Magic Words. And in many ways we talk about this theme, we teach this theme, we practice it together and these three magic words, not surprisingly are, I love you. I love you. And, and the idea here with this practice, which I want to bring in actually and weave in and we practice this actually here. But the idea when you say I love you isn't so much, oh, I, I have romantic love for you and I want you and an attachment and I expect you to love me back. No, that the idea of these three magic words is, is when you open yourself up to appreciating and you can say, you can say, I love you to the sun. I love you. Or the leaves. I love you. Or the blue sky. I love you. Or, or, or anything else that's in your life. Your neighbor. I love you. You know, we may not even know that the person who's challenging for you. I love you. I love you. Yeah, you, you keep expanding my, my edges. You, I love you because I can be more human through you instead of thinking, oh, you know, I'm enlightened perhaps or, or, or whatever I get my heart gets to expand. I love you. So, so hearing the song this I love you song as she sings it, you can check it out later. It's just very sweet. I love you this. I love you that I love you this guy. I love you. The earth. I love you. The tree. I love you. Person who's walking by. I love you. The sense of opening up, opening up, opening your heart up. So I was, this was in my mind today and I was, I was trying it on for size and, and what I invite you to play around with it as we'll explore in a moment is see what happens in your mind. See what happens in your mind when you try it on. So, and some reactions might be actually humorous might be funny when you try it on and see what the reaction is. So, as I was trying it on today, I was outside. I love you blue sky. Yeah, I made my heart actually opened up more to really appreciate that. Wow. It's, it's the fall and it's sunny today. Wow. And the fact that I can be out today I'm not so sick like the past few days I love you sky I love you body. I love you and then, and then my mind turn to the flu virus I love you virus I'm like, Oh, that's funny that's a funny thing to say I love you virus. So humor came out this sense of this stance of holding this relationship. Oh, do I love this virus? Well, I don't exactly love it but, but, you know, it's been a part of me it's been hanging out with my body for a few days so, so it opens up different perspectives. It opens up different perspectives not to always be fixed in the particular way we see things. So for me this particular, you know, the three magic words I love you brought up a sense of humor appreciation kind of releasing the way perhaps I usually relate. So, so, so joining this these three magic words practice with the theme of appreciation and gratitude. This being the week of, quote unquote Thanksgiving is, let's try it on for size and see what happens let's see what arises. Is it more appreciation of something that is might it be a different perspective it might be humor maybe it's resistance and if this resistance it's fine to like no no this thing I, I don't want to open up to it but maybe these three magic words, open our hearts, a little bit of something, and especially with respect to ourselves what if I, what if you say I love you to yourself, and you really mean it, and if resistance arises you, you hang in there with the resistance. Anyway, I've said a lot already, lots of themes, but let's just leave all the words and practice together and see what happens. So let's arrive, let's arrive in our seats. Let's get into our meditation posture. Sitting up with as much integrity, respecting the form. Letting your hands be on our lap. And if you need to lie down, the body needs care in that way that's okay too, but I'm going to assume for the most part that you're sitting up there on a cushion or a chair. Let your feet, your legs are what rooted on the earth. Your spine is straight upright. Letting go of judgments, letting go of thoughts, plans. Not needed right now, not needed. Whatever has happened before you get up to this point, let it go. Let it go, take refuge in the simplicity of this moment. You don't have to figure it out. You don't have to be a good soldier marching on, just be, just be. Do nothing for a moment. Be humble, be simple. Be an earthworm, simple, just simple. Feel the softness of your body. Let your heart relax, your body relax. Nothing to do, to think, to figure out. Be. Be an earthworm. Ah. Release, release, release. Feeling the connection of your body to the earth, your feet, your legs, your sit bones, your hands with your lap. Bring the center of gravity of your awareness down, down, down from your head, down to your body. Let it be in your lower abdomen. Receiving the breath there, just settling for a few breaths. Receiving the breath, receiving the sensations of the body. Thank you. Thank you. Let the breath be calming, soothing, nurturing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Receiving the breath, receiving the breath in the abdomen. This breath, just this breath, gratefully, appreciatively, this life-giving breath. Entirety of the in-breath, entirety of the out-breath, intimate, intimate. So sweet to be intimate with the breath, knowing it, knowing it closely. This breath serves as an antidote to distraction, scatteredness, which is less satisfying so the breath, this gift, this anchor grounding in the body. Thank you, breath. Thank you for your companionship. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Letting your heart be soft, appreciating what we may often take for granted, maybe not if you're having the flu or cold and you're congested and breaths are hard, but you appreciate when there is this breath, maybe even when it's hard that it's still here. Thank you. I love you. Thank you. Thank you. I'd now like to invite you to bring someone for whom your care flows with ease, maybe a child, a pet, someone with whom you have an uncomplicated relationship. Invite them to your mind's eye, to the space of your heart. And as you are sitting with them, you're seeing them, being with them in this moment. See how their presence impacts you. Maybe it brings a sense of ease, relaxation to your body, to your heart. You're just appreciating them. Maybe softly you're whispering, thank you. Thank you for being in my life. Thank you. Thank you. I love you. And again, I love you not so much as romantic love or expectation for reciprocation, but as a way of saying yes to this being, so your heart opening up its doors and saying yes to this being. Appreciating them, caring for them, sharing metta, accepting them, appreciating their lovely qualities. Thank you. I love you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Your heart can love in so many ways. Your body can love so many beings in so many nuanced, different ways. And you now bow to this being in your mind's eye, in your heart, and expand the door, open the door of your heart, and invite someone else. Maybe someone who's a neutral person, or you, maybe you've worked with them as a neutral person, a neighbor, someone who works at a grocery store. And you've interacted and have appreciated for a moment. Thank you. I love you. Try it on for size. Can your heart be undefended, unprotected, sharing its goodness? Sharing its met tides? Its well-wishing, its care, its kindness with strangers? I don't for size, don't have to push it. And maybe now, inviting someone you've had challenges with, but you really know deep in your heart they've helped you expand your heart, your capacity. They've been your teacher. Can you invite them and thank them for the role they've played in your life? Thank you. Thank you. I love you. Let's try it on for size. It's an experiment. I love you. I love you. I love you. Thank you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Thank you. I love you. I love you. Your heart is resisting to be stretched. The resistance, thank you. I love you. Maybe I love you in this case as an acknowledgement, as a softening into. Not the usual ways we think of it. Experiment on your own. Can you love your challenges? As well as what's good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. As we bring this practice to a close. Appreciating yourself. Or having showed up, having done your best. Having practiced. Thank you. I love you. I love you. And let's offer goodness, the goodness of our practice, the merit of our practice to all beings everywhere. They all beings everywhere. Know the limitlessness of their hearts, including ourselves. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free. Thanks everyone. Thanks for your practice. We have time for reflections, if any. Questions, comments, complaints. Raise your zoom hand or type in chat. Lisa. Hello. Hi. I'm Lisa. I'm a student at the University of New York. I'm a student at the University of New York. I have a special to do with you before Thanksgiving. The last year too. And so with this. Towards the end, it was something like about in personality because suddenly it was like, I love you heartbreak. I love you pain. I love you lonely. I, I love you. I love you. And I was like, Hey, you're for my face. You can't be what this is. This human experiences like. Like it was. Not super personal. There was some kind of like space. There. Maybe because I'm not like in the thrills and caught by one of those now. Hmm, that's profound Lisa. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah, so appreciate this, this opening going there, your mind inviting you to love your challenges that become the challenges of the human condition and this, this really an insight into a nata in personality not self arises. Yeah, thank you challenges, whatever name or face you have. Thank you for sharing that. Wonderful, beautiful. Wow. Any other reflections? Yes, please. Thanks, Nikki. Yeah, this is brilliant. I just never ceases to amaze me that just like sitting silently in a chair here on zoom with my eyes closed, you know, some of these practices, what I discovered was that this can require courage, you know, to the invitation was there and I didn't need to take the invitation, but I did and I did it to the neutral person and scrolling through these different people and I was like, wow, that. Yeah, it was an amazing practice. Thank you. Thank you, Jesse. I love how you talk about courage. I completely agree. It takes courage. This practice takes courage, a lot of courage. The invitations are there. And, and yet, you know, sometimes our mind goes, oh, this is too too dangerous or maybe the mind doesn't say that it says, oh, this is too silly. This is too stupid. I don't want to deal with or whatever. It just comes up with the reasons why not to do it. And it takes courage to say, okay, thank you. I hear you, but I'm going to try this on for size and an expanded. And as you were sharing, sounds like it was quite impactful for you in different ways. Like this experiment with these five magic words, not just three, but three, five magic words showed up for you. Yeah. Anything else you want to add or does it feel complete? Yeah, no, exactly. As you said, you know, just those voices are like, oh, this is silly. This doesn't make any sense, but choosing to step beyond that. Exactly. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks, Jesse. Paige, please. Hello. I'm thinking that I have the experience of last week. I'm away from my house and not traveling, but I lived down in Honduras half the year and my house in Portland was burglarized. And so I have the opposite of bounty usually or celebrating bounty and I'm being thankful for the, for, I was going to say the things, but thankful for things for lack of a better word in our life. And this was a devastating, I have a lot of, had a lot of artwork sculptures and pretty much totally cleaned it out and broke whatever's there. So I'm sorry. Yeah, it's, it's, and luckily I had just been on a, on the pass in the pass in a retreat in Mexico a few weeks prior. And so I guess I was kind of like in, in shape to be able to receive such a blow and just say it is what it is and not, and not do that. But it was you know, considerable amount of possessions. I hear and I appreciate that. And, and this might be, I, since there, this is the theme of tonight too. And it might be too soon. So, so this may not be the practice right now for you, Paige, but, but when the time comes, when there, the stability and the equanimity comes of seeing that there is stuff in this world and the stuff there's goodness, beauty, and also they weigh us down. Is there a way to be grateful for, is there a way to see the good? Not right now. This might be too soon, where the ouch might still be too strong, but there always is a way to, to find liberation, to find freedom, to find more ease, especially when things are let go of, even if it's not what you would have chosen. So I'll just offer that for a reflection for you to sit with. I can, I can understand that in theory and think, you know, sometimes people are grateful if they have a, if they have a house burned down and then, and then say, oh, start over. But thank you. Thank you, Paige. Thank you. Yeah. Oh, Rose asks, what are the five magic words? The five magic words is what I kept repeating through the guided meditation. Thank you. I love you. Thank you. I love you. Five magic words. Thank you. I love you. So, so with that, I'd like to invite us to, to engage together in small groups and offering our ears for listening, our hearts in appreciation of each other. And there might be words, there may not be any words in our coming together. And the prompt for tonight is, is there something challenging? Something challenging, perhaps. I mean, you can choose something good, actually something good and something challenging. Let's do it both. Something good that you can say, thank you. I love you. Something challenging that you can say, thank you. I love you. And, and we do a couple of rounds, starting first person who alphabetical order first person will offer something good. They can say, thank you. I love you. Next person, next person. Then the second round would be something challenging. You can expand your heart to, to have that relationship with. And, and what else do I want to say? And then the future rounds could just be just open conversation. So, so with that, I'm going to create the rooms and, and as always, please only speak from your own experience, not, you know, managing the group, just offering a little bit from your own experience and letting other people have their space. And if you want to see paths, that's perfectly fine. You can pass and be kind to each other, be kind to each other. So here we go. The rooms are created and enjoy. Okay. The rooms are closed. Everybody's back. So, and we've got about just a minute for any reflections that might've come from either practice, silent practice or the practicing community, this reflection, these two questions, any reflections? What did you notice? Kim, please. I noticed that with, with the group, with us going around and, and saying, I love you. It normalized it, or I was struggling a little bit with it during the meditation. I could kind of get there, but to have the three of us saying it really normalized, it was like, yeah. This is great. This works. Very nice. Thank you so much, Kim, for, for verbalizing that, for acknowledging that, because that's exactly it. I think when you hear it out loud, other people saying it and being held witness in that, that, um, yeah, that in, in that community, that norm, that normalizing feels like, yeah, once heart can land into it and sort of, sort of in the meditation, like, I don't know, what does that exactly mean? I love you. I don't know. This feels wild. It feels weird, but, oh, yeah. Thank you so much for that. And, and, um, for those of you who are on the mailing, actually, if you're not on the mailing list, get on the mailing list because, uh, uh, Christine already sent a pointer to this, um, uh, person doing the, the, the I love you song and, and, and the way they do it is a little different than when, when, how we did it tonight is they do, and, you know, I love you, Skye. I love you the chair. I love you this. I love you. That's what that can become part of what you practice to. I love you this and might feel silly. It's like, oh, I love you chair. Oh, I love you computer. You let me communicate with my Sangha, you know, I love. So there's a sense of naturalness. I can come here, but, but tonight we did the thank you. I love you, which is the five magic cords practice instead of the three magic cords of just, I love you anyway. All these practices are so profound and can really shake you out of your usual way of, uh, habitual way of, uh, going about the world with, with more meta, with more care, with touching into our humanity. Anyway, thank you so much for practicing, for showing up for, um, yeah, for, for being part of the Sangha. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Thanks everyone.
