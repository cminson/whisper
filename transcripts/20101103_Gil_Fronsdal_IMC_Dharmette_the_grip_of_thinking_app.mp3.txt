Dharmette: The Grip of Thinking

Anybody who does meditation has to  – sooner  or later  – 
become  wise about their thinking. One of the 
consequences of becoming wise, hopefully, is to 
become friendly towards your thinking. To look upon it 
kindly, sympathetically, or compassionately  – as 
opposed to the adversarial relationship  of being upset 
with it, or  angry with it. It’s easy to be upset or aversive 
towards our thinking. One reason is that thinking is a 
force that takes us away from the present moment . And 
so if we want to be present, that seems to be what we’re 
struggling against.   
 
Other reasons are that, sometimes what we’re thinking 
about is not necessarily in our best interests. 
Sometimes our thinking is not particularly  praiseworthy. 
Some people are bothered by what they think. They can 
have a lot of judgements, or anger, or strange fantasies  
– it could be anything. So it’s difficult to contend with 
these inner voices that keep bubbling up. You just want 
to be free of it. Enough of this ! Enough of these kinds of 
messages. So to hear  about being friendly towards it  
may sound like you’re supposed to accept it too much.  
 What it means to me to be friendly towards our thinking  
is to have a kind relationship to it : not to be angry or 
upset. It means not being bothered by it . But it also 
means not being pushed around by our thoughts , and to 
be able to  see a thought as a thought  – to see it clearly 
for what it is.  
 
Part of the challenge around thinking is the way in which 
thinking can often camouflage  itself. Sometimes t hinking 
is built with its own camouflage , so that it can’t be seen. 
It’s like a bla ck hole. The theory of a black hole is that 
black holes have this tremendous gravitational force , so 
any light that goes into the black hole doesn’t come out. 
You can’t see the black hole because you can’t see any 
light coming  out. Thinking can be like a b lack hole. Our 
awareness goes into it, and gets trapped there , and 
doesn’t come out, so we don’t even know we’re 
thinking.  
 
It’s interesting to study the gravitational pull that keeps 
us absorbed in thinking  – the tremendous attraction  that 
we have to thinking. I think i t’s so strong that it qualifies 
as an addiction. Some people  – certainly  not any of you 
[laughs] – but there are some  people in the world for 
whom the way they relate to thinking really qualifies as 
addiction. They’re m ore addicted to that than they are 
any other addiction because they’re so caught up in 
their thinking: focusing  on it, lost in it, involved in it . And 
the question is : Why? What is that force that keeps us so glued to thinking? What is the attraction? What’ s the 
gravitational pull that keeps us so connected? Why are 
we so interested? Why so fascinated with it? Why do we 
give so much authority to the inner voices that bubble 
up? Why do they seem so incredibly important?  
 
I don’t want to answer for any of you . I think that’s really 
a task for you . But if you look into that, just the very 
investigation of it, is doing something radical for your 
mind . Asking the question , “Why am I so attracted to my 
thoughts? ” means that while you are asking that 
question and l ooking into it, you’ve stepped back, and 
you’re doing something very different than how the mind 
normally operates. For many people who don’t have a 
practice, the mind spins along for a lifetime without ever 
being questioned, without ever stepping back and  
looking at the nature at how the mind itself works. Once 
you step back and investigate , “What’s actually going on 
here with my thinking? ” – then it’s a whole different 
ecology really, a whole different ecosystem  or event.  
 
In this practice, we step back in a sense : “What’s really 
happening here? Why am I so interested? What’s the 
attraction that goes on? ” One of the interesting ways of 
exploring that, is to ask, “ What’s the emotion, or the 
feelings, that seem to be intimately connected to that 
intere st, that fascination, that pull we have, to keep 
coming back and thinking and thinking and thinking? ” 
Often there’s an emotional glue that keeps it connected. It’s not uncommon for it to be a sense of insecurity or 
fear, and we’re trying to make ourselves safer . We just  
try to  think ourselves into a safe solution, into the right 
understanding so that  we’ll be safe . So we’re always 
trying to figure things out , or trying to comfort ourselves . 
There’s a tremendous desire to be comfortable, or to 
have pleasure,  which can be very strong . That is the 
glue.  
 
Sometimes the glue has to do with issues of self, pride, 
or conceit , trying to prove or disprove ourselves. 
Conceit can also take the form of trying to put ourselves 
down, and make ourselves be the victim, som eone 
who’s unworthy. Or it can be trying to pump ourselves 
up. How does this sense of self, in trying to create, 
destroy, or negotiate a sense of self -identity, create the 
glue that keeps us constantly engaged with our 
thinking?  
 
To study , “What is the glue? What keeps us going? ” is a 
fascinating exploration. And then to appreciate how 
strong that addiction is . It isn’t just the fact that we’re 
thinking, but it’s the tremendous power of thinking, or 
the pull to the world of thinking, which is separate from 
whatever we’re thinking about. How do we work with 
that pull? How do we not allow ourselves to be pulled in, 
or so addicted to our thinking?  
 
One of the very interesting things to do is to use thinking to overcome the addiction to thinking. The way to d o 
that is, you find yourself thinking about something , and 
you say, in a slightly  emphatic inner voice , “I’m thinking 
about lunch. ” You’re obsessing about lunch. “Right now, 
here’s a person thinking about lunch. This is thinking 
about lunch. ” You say that sentence , and  say it strongly, 
maybe repeatedly, until saying that sentence seems to 
be more  where you are roote d than the actual thought 
you ha d about lunch. If the obsession about lunch is so 
strong, just saying, “Oh thinking. Come back to the 
breath ” doesn’t really work. You have to plant yourself 
with both feet, to take a stand and say, “I’m thinking 
about lunch. That’s what’s really going on ” – a real, 
clear, full, embodied acknowledgement. This is what’s 
happening. Somehow t hat can dislodge the glue, or 
interrupt the gravitational force  that keep s us mired in 
that kind of thinking.  
 
A milder form is simply to use mental noting . So rather 
than say, “I’m thinking about lunch ; this is what thinking 
about lunch is like,” it’s simply  to use a label  like 
“Thinking ; thinking, ” or “Planning; menu planning 
[laughs] .” Or  “Anticipating ; anticipating. ” Sometimes 
that’s enough to dislodge the strong connection.  
 
One of the interesting things around thinking, is that 
many people are trying to s top thinking, to get rid of 
thinking, to quiet thinking, to not be so obsessive about 
their thinking . It’s not th e thinking that is the problem  – it’s the force that keeps us connected to thinking . It’s the 
addiction ; it’s the traction ; it’s the gravitatio nal pull ; it’s 
the way that we’re feeding the thinking. It’s interesting to  
focus  not so much on the content of your thought, but  to 
really try to explore  and feel your way into the 
intermediary between you and the particular thoughts 
that you have  – what  I’m calling the gravitational force, 
the addiction, the power, the glue. Get a sense of what 
it’s like. How strong is it? Sometimes you can feel the 
strength of it, the power of it, as it churns away. 
Sometimes it can actually feel like a force within us that 
really has no content. It’s just a force : sometimes a 
sense of anxiety, or feeling unsettled, or feeling worried.  
 
Sometimes I’ve imagined that an anthropologist from 
Mars comes to visit the Earth . They’re really small, 
these Martians , really, really tiny. They enter into our 
blood stream . They set themselves up  in their field 
office to do their field study in my thinking brain : inside. 
What would th eir field notes be like? They don’t have 
any judgement that this person  is thinking. They’re just 
fascinated, “Wow. This is what it’s like for a human 
being to be thinking, ” and they’re taking down field 
notes. Sometimes I imagine  that I’m my own Martian  
anthropologist [laughs] , and I’m taking field notes that 
help dislodge me from being so identified with the 
thoughts, believing the thoughts, giving them so much 
authority. “This is what it’s like! This is interesting! It’s 
phenomenal. Five billion years of  evolution  has come to this [laughs] : a person thinking about lunch. Wow ! 
Amazing. It’s amazing that somehow in the Universe , 
these creatures have these phenomenally complex 
pattern s of thinking. ”  
 
It’s really a miracle that this should operate. It’s just  as 
much a miracle if it’s a bad thought or a good thought. 
“Wow , look at how this thing operates! ” For the Martian  
anthropologists, it’s all just amazing.  I hope that you can 
learn to be your own anthropologist, to step back and 
see your thinking for what it is, and not invest so much 
authority and meaning in it. Thinking is a beautiful and 
profound thing to do, but it’s also very profound and 
meaningful to have the ability to step away from it, and 
to not be in its grip.  
 
May you be free of the grip of thinkin g! Thank you.
