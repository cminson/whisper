The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So welcome, welcome everybody. What a pleasure it is to practice together.
You know, to have a community that we can practice together, no matter the conditions, right?
And so Nikki and I, and I believe Liz is filling in for Nikki this week.
And we appreciate your making a little extra effort to, as required to get into the Zoom these days.
Hopefully it's not too bothersome.
But maybe I'll use this as a link into what I wanted to talk about today.
And that is a little bit this idea that change, like we made a change to some of the settings for the Zoom meeting.
But change is an inherent part of life.
I'm not saying anything that we don't already know.
That is, and change it, right? It isn't a problem.
It isn't something that, you know, that we have to manage and we have to somehow take care of.
I'm just going to mute a few of you. Just some of you don't realize, but your background noise are, we can hear here.
So I'm just doing this just for the purpose of their recordings so that the future you, when you come back, when you want to listen to this, that audio is a little bit clearer.
So change isn't a problem necessarily until it is.
Right, until we try to control things.
We want things to be a particular way.
Right, we know this.
But we also want to try to control not only our environment, but other people and.
And, you know, explicitly it might show up and when we're doing our love and kindness practice, where we're wishing people safety and happiness and health and ease.
And, but they of course are making their own decisions. Their life is unfolding according to how they spend their time, the decisions they make, the actions they do.
And so there might be a little bit of our, if we're in a relationship with these people that we know them regularly, we might sometimes kind of have this thing, you know, your life would unfold better if it would go, if you would make these types of decisions or something like this but
equanimity.
Equanimity helps us learn to let go of trying to control that's equanimity is a way in which we can have this open heartedness that meta and compassion bring.
It's a way that we can have this impartiality, this spaciousness that's not indifferent, but impartial this way that's kind of this restful, maybe cool, so not agitated and hot, but a little bit more kind of a sitting back a little bit about what's happening.
It's kind of a confused equanimity with disconnection, which I think is where probably all of us at one time or another have this idea that equanimity is about just disconnecting.
It's not.
But we can feel the difference when we're disconnected. Then there's a certain like apathy like about, I don't care, whatever.
It's different than a spacious warm heartedness.
Which has this connection but also that comes out of the love of I trust that things are going to unfold the way that they're going to unfold may not match my preferences may not be the best thing for you, but there's a trust in
things don't happen for magic, but they happen for reasons. I'm not trying to say that there's this big overarching reasons why things happen, but they unfold based on what decisions people make.
Not necessarily on our trying to control them, control other people, but what they do, what they say.
What they think.
So, maybe I'll say a few just a few more words about equanimity. One is one obvious way in which we can develop it is just allowing it to when it naturally arises with our meditation practice.
So equanimity will make a showing. It just, you know, as the, as the mind and the heart really start to settle then kind of like the agitation settles and then there's just more capacity to be with what is and to let go of the controlling.
So equanimity is just allow it to naturally rise and then when it does arise, just to feel into it like, oh yeah, yeah, there's a little more spaciousness ease here.
And the week, this shows up in so many different ways, but it's one of the characteristics I would say is ease.
And what you might cultivate equanimity and this may or may not be part of your meditation practice is to just a little bit of reflection that we know things change.
And just sometimes we need to remind ourselves. Yeah, things change.
Everything is moving vibrating pulsating in a rhythm of some sort right just different timescales, including you know with this ourselves or minds or these things so one is just just to remind ourselves reflection things are changing.
It is a mosaic of all kinds of things right going from one, maybe end of a spectrum to the other end whatever that spectrum might be.
And then the third thing that we can do is what we'll be doing some tonight is to intentionally cultivate equanimity.
It's part of letting kindness practice it's this where we spend a little time softening opening the heart.
And then change the phrases that really emphasize the connection.
The warmth, and not the trying to control, but more the allowing the just noticing and within a warm hearted way.
So we'll do this tonight with loving kindness practice.
So I like to teach equanimity practices to start with a loving kindness where it's easy.
And then relax ease into that, and then open it up to equanimity practice.
So we'll start a little bit with some mindfulness, and then we'll do some loving kindness and then some equanimity.
Okay, so that is an introduction.
Let's do some practice.
Feeling at this moment arriving here arriving to this bodily experience.
Feeling into you.
Maybe feeling the pressure of the chair or pushing against the body.
Feeling the feet on the ground.
Just in the awareness on the sensations of breathing, feeling the stretching, maybe the unstretching, whenever the word for that is relaxing.
Feeling the chest, the belly.
Right now there's nothing else to do.
There's nothing else to be.
We're just here.
The sensations of breathing.
When the mind wanders, it's very gently, simply begin again.
And then to begin our loving kindness practice.
So we'll begin where it's easy, bringing to mind a loveable being.
To mind with whom you have an uncomplicated, warm relationship with.
Perhaps imaginary kittens have these babies, pets.
And bringing this loveable being to mind, connecting with them.
In a warm hearted way.
The support for this warm hearted connection can save these phrases.
May you be safe, may you be happy,
may you be healthy,
may you live with ease.
Thank you.
Thank you.
May you be safe, may you be happy,
may you be healthy, may you live with ease.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just like the loveable being.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May you live with ease.
Thank you.
And then to do some equanimity practice.
This practice can bring to mind somebody that you care about.
And sometimes a little bit bothersome.
Not the most difficult person, but somebody who's a little irksome.
I will offer a few phrases.
You can just choose one.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I care about you and I cannot keep you from difficulties.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Your happiness and unhappiness depend upon your actions,
not upon my wishes for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wish you happiness and unhappiness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Anybody have any comments or questions or something they'd like to share?
Any new ideas?
Yes, Jerry.
Sorry if my camera needs to be cleaned up, I'm a bit fogged here, but anyhow you can get the point.
I guess at the end we were just chatting about how memory can play tricks on us.
And I was thinking about that as just the end because sometimes we tell ourselves a story about, well, this is the way it is.
We want to remember it a certain way and because memory can play tricks on us and I was thinking about my work.
I'm a psychiatrist and I try to help patients get better and then a year later they're telling me, you know, I've always been this way.
They're better.
And I said, well, you know, last year you were feeling suicidal.
No, I wasn't.
And then I get out the forms.
It's, well, who filled out those forms?
What?
That's me?
And I was thinking, my goodness, this is like, I mean, it's just, I don't think they're trying to be deceitful.
I just think that's the way the memory, we construct the picture that they're in when they're feeling good.
They've always felt good when they feel, or maybe it's going to go away, but when they're feeling bad, they always felt bad.
But it's not that like memory is malleable and memory moves around.
So, you know, maybe part of the acceptance we have that the way we're feeling right now, it'll probably change if you wait a minute.
Anyway, that's all.
Thank you. Thank you for sharing that, Jerry, right?
This thinking that it's always this way, or when we're feeling good, we feel like, okay, now finally we're back to normal.
All those decades of not feeling well, or I'm exaggerating, maybe it's not decades, maybe it is.
Somehow that felt like an aberration, some detour, but when we start feeling better, we start feeling like, oh, this is the real me finally or something.
Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Jerry, for highlighting that.
That a human experience, right? This is so much part of what meditation practice is, allows us to see what a range is actually happening in each moment.
It's not all good. It's not all bad. There's an awful lot of neutral stuff happening.
And just to remind ourselves, our tuning to that.
Yeah, thank you.
Okay, well, we're a few seconds before the top of the hour.
Maybe, does anybody have a comment they'd like to make before we end here?
One thing really quick. There were times in the meditation, I wasn't hearing words, but I heard your voice.
And the voice worked.
I'm assuming that was an okay thing.
That was a very okay thing. Oh, God. Hearing your voice instead of hearing mine.
Thank you, Jerry. Thank you.
Okay, well, what a delight it is to all the practice together, and here we are.
So wishing you all a nice rest of the evening, or if you happen to be down under a nice rest of the day.
And if you'd like to unmute and say goodbye, we can say goodbye. So thank you. Thank you. And goodbye.
Thank you, John. Bye.
Bye.
Thank you, Diana.
Thank you.
