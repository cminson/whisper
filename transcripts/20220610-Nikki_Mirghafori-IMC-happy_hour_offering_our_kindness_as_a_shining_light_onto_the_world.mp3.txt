There.
Okay.
Alright, so formally hello and welcome to Happy Hour.
Lovely to be with you, to practice together.
Very much looking forward to our practice together.
Dear Sangha.
So for today's practice,
I'd like to invite us to consider the cultivation of metta,
the planting seeds of kindness, goodwill,
for ourselves, for others,
basically planting these seeds
as the biggest gift, perhaps,
that we can give to the world.
Maybe not the biggest,
maybe I don't want to set it up so big,
but as a gift of our presence,
as a gift we are passing,
we're passing through this Earth.
Our lifetime is a flash
relative to the cosmic timescale.
So, of course, for many of us,
our work in the world is important.
Maybe children, maybe relatives, et cetera.
We all have different ways that we engage
and give our gifts to the world.
What if we also consider
planting the seeds of metta,
offering kindness
in whatever shape or form
it shows up both for ourselves,
this person who is me,
as well as for others, other beings,
as an expression of our gift,
as a big gift that we can give,
not just say the work we do,
maybe the books we write,
the companies we create, whatever it might be,
but how we do it, how these things are done,
how we interact with people,
how we interact with ourselves,
with this person who is us,
whom we are the guardian of,
the only guardian of, really,
the care of this person who is me,
has been entrusted to me.
So, not just what we do,
but how we do it,
actually, the how in the world,
being the bigger gift,
leaving a lasting impression
on people, on loved ones,
on people we know,
on people we don't know.
So, that how,
that gift of generosity,
of kindness towards ourselves and others
to consider that.
I offer that for our reflection,
and for guided meditation,
I will invite us with some invitations
for planting seeds,
and in whatever happens,
if you find that this mind, this body,
is achy, is sleepy, is distracted,
different thoughts arise,
the opposite of meta arises
as long as you have kindness,
as long as you show kindness
towards what is arising,
you are planting seeds of meta.
So, even if,
even if, say, self-judgment arises,
if you're kind, oh, sweetheart,
you're being very judgmental,
you're having a hard time right now,
you're having a hard day, hard evening,
you turn towards that,
even self-judgment,
even if you turn towards it with kindness,
you are planting the seeds of meta,
this how that I'm talking about,
this way of being in the world,
this big gift that,
this legacy that we create,
these reverberations that we create
for ourselves and for others,
through each act of mind.
And in Buddhism, thoughts are considered
actions of the mind,
the six sense doors, the sixth one,
the five or the regular five that we know,
and the sixth one being the mind door,
the thinking,
recreating all the other senses in the mind.
So, I think I've said enough
to set the stage for our practice tonight.
So, with that, I'd like to invite us now
to arrive and settle in our bodies,
you may need to move, to shift,
to sit up straight,
or to lie down, to stand,
see what your body needs,
see what your body needs,
to be able to be still
and rest comfortably for the next 30 minutes
of this guided meditation together.
So, arriving, arriving in this body,
however the body is in this moment,
embracing, welcoming, appreciating
that there is enough health,
enough stability to show up in this moment.
The body might be achy,
tired, it's okay.
Thank you, body.
Thank you for supporting,
supporting this mind, this heart,
this awareness.
Inviting the body to relax,
to soften,
to let go of tightness, tension,
releasing, releasing the forehead,
inviting it to be soft,
releasing the jaw, the face,
the eyes, rest in their socket.
Light your neck, your shoulders,
to release the weight,
the proverbial weight they've been carrying all day.
It's okay, it's okay now.
It's alright sweetheart, it's okay.
Putting down thoughts, concerns.
In this moment, taking refuge,
taking refuge in your heart,
in your intentions, your kind intentions,
for goodness, for gladness,
for happiness for yourself and others,
releasing your back,
your chest, your abdomen.
Let the breath be received in the lower abdomen,
filling this cavity.
Let it feel spacious, let it feel
expansive, your abdomen.
The breath.
Moving and releasing the tension in your sit bones.
In your upper legs,
releasing the weight onto the earth,
the knees, the lower legs and feet,
as if any holding is offered to the earth as a weight,
dropping, dropping the weight of your legs,
your sit bones.
Let the breath move through.
Notice I'm not saying to breathe
because the breath breathes you.
You've been breathing all this time.
No need to make it complicated into a project.
Just let it happen as it has been happening.
Simply notice that the breathing is occurring.
If thoughts arise, it's okay.
No problem.
They will arise.
Noticing thoughts, smilingly.
Oh dear thoughts, I release you with a smile
as if I'm letting a little birdie fly
and taking refuge in my heart.
Not now, please come back later.
You may need to release thoughts smilingly a hundred times.
Do it with kindness to yourself and the thoughts,
planting seeds of kindness.
One bird at a time.
And for the sake of our practice tonight,
let there be an extra dose of kindness.
For whatever the mind notices, if it's the breath,
the abdomen can be received with kindness and appreciation,
graciously.
Fear awareness is holding,
turns to the body sensation, maybe an ache or pain.
Can it massage with your thoughts, with your mind?
Can the sensation be massaged with kindness, with care?
And if a thought or entanglement arises,
maybe you think of a person or a project or something.
Can there be extra kindness, maybe a smile,
maybe a little blessing of metta, friendliness?
Before you release the bird, bird by bird,
whatever arises, kindness towards all these birds that arise,
that land, in your sphere of awareness.
Awareness spacious like the sky,
birds of sensation, birds of thought,
even the breath as a bird.
Smilingly, offering seeds of kindness to the bird.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Especially if there are any challenges in your heart and your mind.
Extra kindness, care, soothing,
offered.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
All the birds are doing their best.
If anything could have been different, it would have been.
And the causes and conditions are like this.
Can we be kind to what is, to whatever is showing up,
just as it is yourself included.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Kindness is also an empowerment.
See if you can notice, feel the empowerment,
the strength of kindness in your heart as a gift.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And in sharing kindness, care, goodwill,
not only is it an empowerment that we feel in our heart,
but it's a gift that in giving we receive ourselves,
the goodness of it.
Radiating, radiating kindness, goodness,
whatever arises in the sphere of awareness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And as we offer kindness, radiating kindness,
opening our heart
to whomever arises, whomever shows up as a guest,
friends, family, neutral people, people we have challenges with.
There are human beings just like me, who want to be happy,
friendly, maybe a smile, neighborliness.
May you be well.
May all of us be well.
See what's easy, whatever comes easy
to your body, to your heart, to your mind, and your body be relaxed and easy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And I'd like to make another invitation, feel free to explore this if it works for you.
If kindness were like light, shimmering light,
as you offered it to the world, to others, to yourself.
Shimmering light that brings goodness, brings sucker, brings care,
whomever it touches, whatever it touches,
whatever it shines upon, whomever, whomever it shines upon,
brings gladness, goodness as an offering as a gift,
cannot attach to outcomes, just an offering, a cultivation of our heart.
Now what if you imagined your whole body drenched in kindness,
shining with this light, this shimmering light, and you offer yourself to the world.
If your judgmental mind gets in the way, oh, I'm not that good, I'm not that kind,
it's okay, let that go for now, we're just exploring.
Imagine, imagine for just a moment that you are the light,
you are the gift of kindness.
You offer yourself up wherever you are needed,
wherever this body, this heart, this mind is needed,
you offer yourself up without hesitation,
you offer your skills, your goodness, your time, your heart, you are the gift.
Let yourself be the gift, you are the gift.
In ways you cannot fathom of ourselves,
making ourselves the gift of kindness, of goodness unto the world.
The light that shines,
the light that shines
without preference, unconditional.
And as we bring this practice period to a close,
whatever rose or did not arise during this practice period,
if there was sleepingness, distractedness present, not a problem.
Offer kindness to whatever rose, offer kindness to yourself.
Trusting that even if there is one moment of kindness, goodness,
that's good enough.
Offering seeds, planting seeds.
Collectively we share, we offer to the world our goodness from this practice.
May all beings everywhere, all beings, may they know their own goodness,
that they are a gift unto the world.
May we all cultivate goodness, wisdom, kindness, and give ourselves and others.
The best gift of all, wisdom and kindness.
Thank you for your practice everyone.
So we have time for reflections, questions, comments for a few minutes,
and you're invited to share what came up for you
if there was an aha moment or a challenge
as a way of giving a gift, offering a gift of your practice to the Sangha.
Often the ways in which we open up can be helpful for others.
Don, please.
Nikki, thanks so much.
Yeah, I had a really rough day and it was nice to be encouraged to be kind to myself
and also the sort of whatever came up was okay.
So I wanted to really thank you.
Thank you, Don. I want to thank you for coming here practicing
and also speaking up and sharing your practice, having had a hard day, a rough day,
which many of us probably can identify with
and bringing kindness to whatever arose, especially with yourself.
Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you, Don.
Any other reflections? You can raise your zoom hand.
I won't see your physical hand because there are too many of us
or you can type in chat. If you type to me privately, I will not read your name.
It will be private. If it's typed to everyone, I will read your name.
Any other reflections? What was this like for you?
Did you try, did anyone try the invitation towards the end to see yourself as a gift onto the world?
How did that go? Was there a moment that actually that practice lit up for you
or was there a lot of judgment? Oh no, not me.
Curious. What happened? Are you willing to share?
It's all good.
Silence is fine too.
I see Claire's hand. Claire.
Thank you, Nikki. That was actually the part of the meditation that I appreciate the most.
It's a practice that I've been observing for a number of years and it was interesting.
I was approached this week by a woman who's roughly in my age range, very accomplished,
but not as accomplished as her friends in her eyes.
I was trying to explain to her that the joy of living came from giving my skills away, not taking.
I couldn't get through to her. I felt so bad because she's very lonely and very unhappy
because she sees herself as a failure.
We're not failures if we give what we've got.
It changes the whole dynamic.
Absolutely. Well said, Claire. Well said.
It's not about getting, it's about giving.
Yes, and we're all, we have so much to give every single one of us.
Our time, our attention, our resources. Thank you, Claire.
Beautifully said. Thank you.
Hopefully. Mark, please.
To my surprise, I was able to get into that final image of just being light and goodness
towards everything and towards everything that I might touch.
And sitting with a meditation of Jack cornfields for the last couple of months,
where he ends up saying you can send out compassion, love and blessings in every direction now.
And that's how I've been starting my day every day for about the last 90 days.
Your image and so on was able to really connect that to me.
I was, I am surprised. That's great. Thank you so much.
Beautiful. Thank you, Mark. I'm just delighted to hear you've been doing this practice with Jack
in the past 90 days and something about tonight's guidance really connected for you
and lit you up, you know.
It was, it was a prepared mind, right? You've been preparing your mind for 90 days
and something happened tonight. Like, oh, things lit up. That's just beautiful.
That's lovely. Yeah, it makes me so happy. Lights me up with joy for you. That's lovely.
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, it's so sweet.
And I see someone who's clapping and it keeps appearing and disappearing.
If you're trying to raise your hand, please try again.
And the raise hand function is, could be under reactions.
Again, I see that. I think it's Hugh. Hugh, are you trying to raise your hand but doing the clap instead?
Yes.
What's up, Hugh?
Thank you. Thank you, Nicky. I had a really good experience with the meditation tonight
when you spoke about that.
We are the life that shines a gift to the world.
It reminded me of a couple of times, I think, it reminded me of, you know, a biological,
a thing called bioaluminescence.
I think I've seen a couple of people who were just overflowing with compassion and kindness
and it seemed to my eyes like they were glowing.
Yeah, yeah, that's exactly right. Yeah, it's a beautiful image.
I appreciate you bringing that in. Yeah, that's sweet.
Bioaluminescence, exactly. Yeah, maybe I'll suggest that next time.
The kind of meditation for those who've seen that.
It's lovely. Thanks, Hugh.
Yeah, that's great.
So the time has come for the invitation as we've been spreading, as we've been shining kindness
in our heart space, in our quiet heart space.
What if we actually open our eyes and be in relationship with others,
with a couple of other human beings who are so are here to cultivate their hearts and kindness.
And so in small groups who will be roughly of size three,
the invitation is to share just one nugget.
If you have five things to say from say the guided meditation, just share one nugget
from your experience. Again, speaking just from your experience.
And then the next person will offer a nugget or will be silent.
They can say pass, just holding kind space for the community as perfectly fine.
And then the next page, this is the next person will say something or will share or will pass.
And then you go round and round a few times until the time, the groups,
which is about eight minutes would be over seven, eight minutes.
And please speak from your own experience, not guiding, asking questions or,
or trying to facilitate the group, just holding close with kindness to yourself, kindness to others.
See what happens having practiced now to show up and share with these amazing sangha.
It's such a beautiful song, really such a beautiful song to show up in this way together.
So, so with that, I'm going to open the rooms, take care of yourselves, take care of each other.
Here we go.
Back everyone. And we've got just about a minute for any reflections that might have come up from connecting in groups.
So, anyone?
Last words, I see smiles, as usual, coming back from the room.
Okay, I don't see any hands. I do see Debra's words in chat. The song lyrics, lyrics came to me during the meditation.
This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine. Great.
May you all let your light shine onto the world. Yeah.
Thank you all. Thank you for your practice for coming together, for cultivating this, this practice for your own sake, for the sake of others.
And may we all let our, our light of kindness shine onto the world.
May all beings be well, may all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thank you.
