 Good morning or good day and welcome to the Insight Meditation Center as a location that is spread around the globe. So it's wonderful to be here. And one of the wonderful, wondrous experiences that some of us can have is have the occasion to be in a natural environment that brings us a sense of wonder. Sometimes it's looking into the night sky and the stars, maybe the full moon. Maybe it's looking at a sunset or a sunrise, if we're up early. Maybe it's a particular tree that maybe it's leafed out in springtime and it just seems wondrous and fresh and alive. Maybe it's the weather that's something about it, even sometimes with great storms. It's kind of a wondrous show of the natural world. And it's easy to be distracted from that. It's easy to be involved in our preoccupations, our concerns, and some of them are quite important. And of course we're concerned. And I saw on the chat, I forget exactly the name, I apologize for someone who said their son is in surgery and Janelle, and I wish your son well and you well. And of course you're concerned about your son. And in some ways it's as natural as the weather and the sunset, the sunrise, and leafing out of a tree. And of course this is what a parent would, thoughts and concerns and hearts would be about in a situation like that. It itself is a natural phenomenon. But we get sometimes pulled into it and maybe naturally so that as well. But then we don't necessarily see the naturalness of it, the amazing working of the natural world that's been going on for long before there are human beings on this planet. And to most of who we are is the product of amazing shaping by the environment of this planet as it evolved as well. All amazing. And to sit in this amazement or this wonder or to sit in a sense of the naturalness of it all, that rather than seeing things as good or bad or pure or impure or special versus everything else which is not special, conceit of me being better or worse than anything, there's something about sitting in meditation and appreciating the naturalness of it all. Naturalness of our thoughts and our feelings, our body, breathing, that can be quite profound and quite liberating just here. And so there's a tendency, there's an orientation in early Buddhist meditation to this day to really see this body as a natural phenomenon and to see below the layers that we tend to be preoccupied by, the layers of our hair. How many of us can write a biography or a biography of our hair? All the different ways our hair has been over a lifetime and concerns with it and expenses that we've spent around hair and concerns with it. Or our skin, such a painful and kind of consuming concern of human beings, unfortunately, beauty and all kinds of things, racism, the teeth and the eyes and all kinds of things that make us self-conscious. But then to see the naturalness of it drop in deeper, deeper into the body and greater intimacy here in this body. And the more intimate we become, the more we tend to not see it or feel it so much in terms of me, myself and mine in self-conscious ways, but perhaps it becomes more of a place of naturalness where there's a freedom from the limited view of self and me and what's in it for me or how it is. But rather this naturalness that we are a continuation of an unfolding and evolution of all this millions of years on this planet. So to sit this way, part of the mindfulness of the body, this kind of intimacy, so to maybe with the naturalness of this wonderful connection between the mind and the body, with our mind we can enter the body with attention and make adjustments in the posture to make our body more suitable for being present and here alert. Amazing that this connection between the mind and the body is here. An amazing natural thing that we can awaken awareness in the body, we can direct awareness into the body and to do so and appreciate this body that's breathing, a rhythm of breathing that's as natural as the rhythm of the waves lapping up and down across the sandy shore. And to be aware of this rhythm of breathing, a rhythm we share with so many breathing animals. It's just a naturalness of it all. And if you are self-conscious it's possible to step away from it and recognize that too is a natural thing. We're built to have this capacity and the environment sometimes evokes it, but still stepping back and appreciating the simplicity and naturalness of it all. Taking a few long, slow deep breaths and those deep inhales, feeling and sensing intimacy with more of your body. Here now. Letting the breathing return to normal. And perhaps there's a way that the experience of the body breathing can pull you into an intimacy with the naturalness of this body. An intimacy where we trust the body itself to breathe for the heart to beat, for the blood to flow. Relaxing into this body, relaxing the face, the shoulders, the arm, belly. And becoming aware of how the body experiences itself. Then wherever it feels most grounding and settling for you into the body, maybe supports a quieting of the mind. Let your intimacy of attention be in that part of the body. And breathe maybe with that part of the body through that part. And perhaps the naturalness of the body of breathing, sensing through the body can support you and help you to let go of thinking or quiet your thinking. So there's more space and allowance and trusting of the body's awareness of itself. The body's awareness of breathing, deep appreciation of the naturalness. We are one more expression of the vast world of nature that we live in, that we're part of. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. As we come to the end of this meditation, it's possible to consider that in this body of ours flows our life, flows our lived life, flows what animates us and motivates us. And that at any given moment, this river of life within us can take one of three tributaries, one of three different forks in the river. And if we flow through life blindly, then we take the fork maybe that has a strongest current. But if we are attentive and aware, see perhaps we can naturally, easily of course, take the river that's most beneficial, most nourishing or supportive. One river is that that has in it degrees of hostility or greed, aversion, clinging. And now there is one that's just neutral about everything. No greed, no hostility, no aversion, no attachment, just okay, everything's just kind of allowed to go in an interested way. And the third stream, natural stream lives in us as well, is that of goodwill, love, kindness, a simple, ordinary, natural caringness for the welfare and happiness of ourselves and of others, a tenderness of caring. And if you can see these three streams inside of you, maybe you don't have to be pulled by the strongest current. But you can allow yourself to float in the current of kindness and love and care, generosity, the wholesome current. And if that is at all available as the end of this sitting, even as a hint intimation of that wholesome river, you might end this sitting with words of dedication, words of aspiration that this meditation supports the wholesome and the desire for the welfare and happiness of all beings. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you.
