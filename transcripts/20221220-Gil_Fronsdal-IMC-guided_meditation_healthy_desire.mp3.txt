Hello everyone, and I feel a little slow to speak.
I think I'm a little bit just happy to be here with you in this way and somehow more focused on that happiness than speaking.
But speak I will.
There's a difference between being mindful and having the desire to be mindful.
And in many people who learn about Buddhism, and it may be in a simplistic way,
will believe that there's something wrong with having desires.
And this is not the teachings of the Buddha.
He said that there's, to paraphrase him, there's something wrong, something painful about craving, about thirsting, grasping.
Certain kinds of desire which carry with them, inherent in them, is pain, stress.
But desire doesn't have to have that.
Desires can flow through the mind, through the heart, like a small cloud floating in the sky,
with no pressure, no just kind of floating through.
Desires can be quite easy to have.
And there are desires that arise out of our goodness, out of wisdom, out of care, compassion, out of compassion itself as a kind of a desire.
And so in the difference between being mindful and desiring to be mindful is a useful distinction.
If it helps us to appreciate our desire to be mindful, the wish, the aspiration, the wanting to be mindful,
and to find a way to want to be mindful, that is, this is my language, which maybe you translated for yourself,
but which is delightful to have, delightful desire, maybe inspired desire, maybe a loving desire,
that has no expectation in it, no pressure in it, no requirement, no should, no admonition.
And it's just kind of like, of course, this is a good thing.
And so if we can find that kind of desire, someone asks Chanda, yes that's the Pali word, C-H-A-N-D-A,
and if we can find that kind of desire, maybe it can support being mindful.
It can be a gentle, like there used to be water mills, water wheels,
that as the current of the river passes through the wheel, it turns the wheel for the mill to grind flour.
And maybe the Chanda, maybe the desire can be the current that keeps the mindfulness engaged or present,
turning, flowing, moving, active.
So in this sitting, maybe after settling in, I'll ask you to explore the nature of a desire to be mindful
and see if that can support the practice.
So establishing a posture for meditation
and then allowing the eyes to close themselves if they want to.
Whether the eyes are open or closed, see if you can relax the gaze of the eyes,
any engagement with the eyes to see, tension,
and to take a few long, gentle deep breaths with the inhale to get a full embodied connection to yourself,
the connection to as much of your body as the deep in breath reaches.
And maybe as you exhale, long exhale,
let it be like all the weight of your body settles into the bottom of your belly,
and from there is supported.
And letting your breathing return to normal.
And for the next three or four breaths, to feel wherever there might be tension in your body, tightness,
and in the exhale, soften around it, relax.
And then take a couple of breaths to relax the thinking muscle,
any tension, tightness associated with thinking.
And then take a few moments to feel your whole body or a wide experience of your body
in whatever way is easy for you.
Feeling your body so it can be a reference point
or a deeper connection to your inner life.
And then see if you can find within you a relaxed desire,
the one that is wells up from within rather than a thought that carries with it you should.
A desire which is maybe kind of an inspiration from within of the goodness of a possibility
of being present, aware and mindful here and now.
Maybe a desire to be aware of the aliveness of this moment,
knowing that whatever is occurring in the present, whether it's pleasant or unpleasant,
is a manifestation of your life right now, being alive right now,
and desiring to be present for it, to be mindful.
Because mindfulness itself, being conscious,
is a primary characteristic of being alive and awake.
It's a wondrous thing to be aware.
And a gentle, loving, inspired desire, yes, to awareness.
A desire that is so simple that it's just a simple yes.
This is good. This is what I like.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Letting there be a gentle, ongoing desire that is like the wind pushing a sailboat through the water,
where mindfulness is the bow that meets the water moment by moment.
As the boat moves through time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
If you find yourself swept away in thinking,
because of the wonderful desire to be mindful,
when you come back, there can be a delight in following through on that desire,
that coming back to mindfulness is a happy fulfillment of a simple desire.
And you can enjoy that fulfillment however weak it might be.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And as we come to the end of this sitting,
many people don't study the art of desiring.
Desires can come from a place of within of creativity,
non-craving desires that have no need within them,
just a simple open goodness.
This would be a nice idea.
This would be good.
A desire which can inspire action,
can inspire change,
but doesn't assert itself, doesn't push for change.
And there can be then a desire for the well-being of others
that comes from this place of creativity and simplicity.
As a form of art, perhaps it comes from a kind of grace and
non-neediness, non-obligation,
from a place within where it just seems like this is a really good idea
that others will be well.
It's a desire which feels good to have,
nourishing, supportive to you to have this desire.
There's so little pressure or sense of lack or sense of inadequacy
that goes with it.
It's the opposite.
It's a desire that comes from a sense of being content here, settled.
And from such a desire, wishing, expressing the wish
in simple words in the quiet of your own mind,
you might repeat these words that I say,
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.
And may your peaceful desire for the welfare of others
be nourishing for you.
Thank you.
