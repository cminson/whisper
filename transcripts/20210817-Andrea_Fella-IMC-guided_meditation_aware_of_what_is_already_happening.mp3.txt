 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Exploring the possibility of being with yourself. Not so much as a separate observer looking at yourself, but just being with experience. And perhaps encouraging or exploring the possibility of allowing whatever is happening in this moment, whatever there is a being with. Exploring the possibility of allowing whatever is happening, whatever you can be with, whatever there is this being with connected to. That is already happening, already here, already present. And aligning with or recognizing clearly what is here, what is already happening. This is part of the purpose of mindfulness and wisdom. Mindfulness, recognizing what is here. Wisdom, recognizing the nature of that experience to be arising in the present moment, already happening. And wisdom also recognizing that what is already happening, we can't go back and change. Just meeting it, meeting what is already here with a kind, allowing awareness. And perhaps it may seem a little bit like a paradox, but that allowing attention, that awareness that just lets it be as it is. Tends to allow reactive, difficult states of mind to move in the direction of letting go. And allowing beautiful or wholesome qualities of mind like patience and ease, peace, supports their nourishment. So if there is something challenging happening, when we can meet it with just, oh, this is what's happening. The mind feels tight, the body tense. When there is a difficulty or challenging experience happening, when we can align ourselves and recognize, oh, this is what's happening, in this moment, already happening. That can create the conditions for in the subsequent moments, for there to be some more spaciousness, some more ease, some more peace, with that experience. Being with what is already here. What is already here in this moment has been shaped by conditions from the past, shaped by the experience of how we're meeting it in the present moment. And the shaping of our moments to come, shaped by how we relate to the experience with an allowing attitude of mind, a curious exploration. What's happening in this moment? What is this happening that's already here? That shapes the direction towards more ease, more spaciousness. And there is a trust that needs to be cultivated, a trust in that simple capacity of allowing awareness, that it does move in the direction, shape the direction of more ease, peace, and happiness. Because often it's not an immediate feedback, it is one that is gradual, shaped over time. And yet at times there can be an immediate feedback as we recognize, oh, what's happening is the mind is confused, and there's an experience of okayness with that instead of being caught by the confusion. And right there, the trust, the confidence in this simple exploration of being with experience. We gain some understanding of its value, the value of this really simple practice. Aware of what's happening, aware of what's already happening. Thank you.
