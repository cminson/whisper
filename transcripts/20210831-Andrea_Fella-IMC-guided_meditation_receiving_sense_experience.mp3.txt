 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. It's often helpful to remember for meditation that relaxation is such a support as our body relaxes as we perhaps consciously scan through the body. And explore areas to relax, areas that might be tension, where tension might be held. And seeing if there can be a softening, a releasing, a relaxing in those areas. As we do that, as our body relaxes, the very natural connection between the body and mind, and the mind begins to relax as the body relaxes. As the mind relaxes, there's a feedback and it helps to further relax the body times. And also as the mind relaxes. And there's a letting go of worries, concerns, mental tension, mental holding, mental compression. There's a letting go of that. Very naturally, our system, our organism does what it does, which is to receive senses. Our bodies, the sense bases will receive information and we'll know it. This is the function of our human system to receive information from the world through our senses and to recognize, to know, to understand, to relate to that experience. And so as the mind relaxes and lets go of worries, concerns, tensions, our system can do its work very naturally, receiving sense experience, knowing sense experience. And so we'll start with some relaxation, allowing the body to relax. Perhaps exploring in a systematic way through the head and face, seeing if there can be a softening in the head and the face, muscles around the forehead, around the eyes, the jaw. Relaxing the neck and shoulders area we often hold tension. Softening the arms, the hands. Perhaps there can be a relaxation around the chest and upper back, maybe taking a deeper breath, which can support a relaxation of this area as the muscles stretch and then can release and relax on the exhale. Relaxing across the stomach and abdomen, the middle and lower back, the hips, the legs, the feet. And then sometimes I find it helpful to return again and explore relaxing the face. So often the habitual holding returns as we're exploring different areas. And just after having relaxed the body as much as is available, return again and relax, see if there can be a little more relaxation of face. See, perhaps, does that affect your quality of mind, that relaxation of face, exploring that feedback loop, mind and body. Sometimes the mental experience, my experience in relaxing the face, the mental release, the mental relaxation can be felt through the body too. Not only is there a sense of relaxation and release in the thoughts and the compression or the holding, but it can also be felt through the core of the body sometimes. Softening more deeply inside the throat, perhaps you might feel that. Maybe the inside of the throat can relax. Maybe the heart, the stomach, the intestines can relax. And again, perhaps there might be a sense of a little bit more ease or more relaxation of mind, a little less holding, a little less tension, a little less push-pull. Maybe the mind can relax too. Perhaps exploring that, as Gil sometimes suggests, as if the brain were a muscle, maybe the brain can relax. From this, whatever relaxation is available. Allowing the attention to just begin to, rather than scanning through the body and exploring relaxation or where tension is held, just letting go of directing the attention and begin to receive the sense experience of the body. How is the body felt? Perhaps the contact points of feet, of hands, hips, the back, if you're sitting in a chair. Perhaps the contact or touch of your clothes on your skin or the air, the temperature. And recognizing, realizing that this receiving of this information of the body, we don't have to do that. It's happening already. And the mind can be available to recognize this is the experience of the body. How is the body felt? Maybe the movement of the breath. Maybe a vibratory energy, a sense of pulsing, tingling vibration throughout the body. Maybe temperature, coolness or warmth. There's no need particularly in this exploration to direct the attention, but settle back and to see. Allow the body to receive and notice what's obvious there. The sense base of the body, the sense of the skin and the touch, the feeling through the body. While receiving that experience, at times you might also recognize or the attention might also take in at times the experience of hearing, another sense experience that our system knows how to process. Well, this time I've been speaking, that hearing process has been happening quite automatically. And now becoming more conscious or aware, hearing is happening. Receiving, remember we don't have to do the hearing. It happens. It's receiving sound, the sound of my voice in speaking and then in the silence between the words. Sounds in your environment. Sounds and silence both experienced through the ear. Receiving that sense. Relax, allowing the body and mind to do their natural processes. And do what they do, naturally, simply. Body receiving, sense experience, ear receiving sound. If your eyes are, you may also at times notice with the eyes closed it's less obvious. But sometimes there can be lights or colors or changes of light that come through the eye door. But no need to do that. If your eyes are open, you might notice seeing happens automatically. You might relax and just allow the processes of body and mind to do their work, do their thing. Receiving sense experience, sound, perhaps smell if there are smells around or tastes are probably not so predominant. Just receiving this body sitting. And you might, as you explore being with the experience, that the body is both creating and recognizing that some experiences we like and other experiences we don't like. There may be some resistance or a contraction with some experience. A sensation that's a little bit unpleasant, mind pulling away, a sound that feels jarring, not liking aversion to that sound. Or perhaps a sound that is pleasant and interesting and the mind leaning towards it. What is that trying to figure it out? This is the activity of the mind. That also can be recognized. You don't have to try to stop the liking or not liking the aversion or the leaning towards, but recognizing it. Oh, liking is happening. Resistance is happening. Not recognizing something going on in the mind. Another what is called a sense base in Buddhist understanding. But keep it simple. Just receive the experience of what's happening. Recognizing the body as it's showing up. And being curious about whether there's any resistance or leaning towards sensations connected with body. Or maybe there is a calm, an okayness, a balance of mind. Relax. And receive this experience of body. And also being open to receive how the mind relates to the body.
