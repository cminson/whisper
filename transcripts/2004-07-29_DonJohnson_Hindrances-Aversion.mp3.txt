 First, how many people were not here last week? Just happened to drop in because it was Thursday. OK, good. So that's fine. So we're going to review a little bit about what these hindrances are and everything. And we'll do this every week just so that each talk is kind of self-contained. So the hindrances are a group of five kind of mental conditions that pop up all the time for yogis. And they're called hindrances because they keep us from meditating. They show up in a lot of other places too, but that's where they got their name. When the Buddha was describing what yogis do, kind of their meditative life, they observe the precepts, etc. Then they sit down and they get rid of these hindrances. And the hindrances are sensual desire, aversion, sloth and torpor that's being tired and not trying, restlessness and remorse, just being all fidgety and worrying about something else, and then doubt. But when people talk about the hindrances, it can cover a lot of ground. You can talk about the hindrances as, OK, I'm sitting here and I'm really, really angry, which is my topic tonight. Or you can say, study the same phenomena in daily life. It's like, boy, what do I do to keep from blowing my top? Or how do I control that? Or, very interestingly, you can use anger as a subject of meditation. And what's the difference is that when anger is a hindrance, it has control of you. You're not thinking about anything except the anger. Your mind's not clear. But when you can settle down enough, kind of turn down the volume knob on it, then you can be kind of in the middle of anger, but still aware that you're in the middle of anger. And you can watch what's going on. So one is like being in a boat in a hurricane, just being tossed around. You're not knowing what's going on. Another one is looking at the high winds coming up and saying, oh, I wonder what happens if I move the sails. So that's kind of so we'll talk about all of those tonight. And I should mention that as I was thinking about this talk, I was reading this book, which is so it's very much influenced by this book by Daniel Goleman's Destructive Emotions. If you don't know Daniel Goleman, he's a longtime Vipassana guy. He's kind of a closet Vipassana guy. He's mostly a guy's PhD in psychology from Harvard, taught at Harvard. He's a columnist in the New York Times, two time Pulitzer Prize nominee. He's written several books and he's now an academic psychologist again. But for his doctoral research from Harvard, he went to went to India to study meditation and as a phenomena. And he also ended up sitting. So when Joseph Goldstein was the first Westerner to sit with Menindra G. and Boudgaya, Daniel Coleman was the second. So he knows what he's talking about. And it's a really interesting book. This is Daniel Goleman and three or four other guys getting together and sitting down, talking with the Dalai Lama for a week about Western psychology, Western neuroanatomy and all of that. And it's in comparison, the differences and similarities with with Buddhist meditation. Anyway, that'll pop up tonight. So there's a couple of ways to look at the hindrances. One way is you can look at them as a taxonomy of ways not to be present. So greed, sensual desire and aversion in all its forms. And it can be fear. It can be just fidgety. I just don't want to sit here. It can be anger, anything. So where you're something where you're grabbing onto something and pushing it, pulling it to you or something you're grabbing onto something and pushing it away. Those basically have the quality of you're fixated on something, but in a way that doesn't let you see what's going on clearly. And it's not clear. You know, there's a point where the emotion has you rather than you have the emotion. And that's when they're their hindrances and then sloth and torpor and restlessness and doubt. It's kind of when you're undershooting and overshooting the object of meditation. And they both have bodily and mental components. That's why they're two words. So sloth and torpor, you're tired and you don't feel like trying. And it's kind of like you can't really you can't mention you can't pay attention. Anything is it's just you're going to sleep, restlessness and remorse. You're you're planning for the future. You just can't get settled kind of overshooting. And then there's doubt, which is it's not just, yeah, I wonder if I can sit till the bell rings. This is I don't think I should sit at all. This doesn't make any difference. My future happiness doesn't depend on my actions, at least in the way these guys say it might be time. Actions in terms of getting a raise or something. But but the doubting the whole the whole Darmic process, we don't even try. So that's one way of looking at it. Another way is kind of like the Buddha's five most wanted or the Yogi's five most wanted. I remember when I was a kid, I used to go in the post office every once in a while and they'd have the FBI's 10 most wanted. And you'd have these pictures, you know, guys, their eyes too close together and five days a beard or an artist sketch, you know, because nobody really seen them. And they would, you know, they would describe what these folks did. What was their crime? Molly, their larceny or bank robbery or forging checks or whatever. And the modus operandi. Oh, always rob banks in small town on Friday afternoon or praise on, you know, swindles little old ladies out of money. That kind of thing. Well, and the idea was that if a million people saw those things, one or two might actually find find one of those guys. Well, the hindrances are kind of like that, but with some major differences. We're all going to see all five. We're all going to see the hindrances all the time, or at least they're going to be present for us quite often. The problem is they're sitting right in front of us and we don't know it. And so it's not more than just looking at a mugshot. We have to find some way to familiarize yourself with the hindrances and what they look like to us because they might look different to me than they do to you. And so that's that theme kind of getting to know the hindrances keeps on keeps on popping up. There's a good story about it, but I want to tell one about myself first. When I was a kid, the family would go to church, my two brothers and I would sit with my mom up in the pews. And one Sunday a month, my dad was sitting back as an usher and he would sit in the back because people come in late and have to give him a program or take the collection or something. So I wouldn't see my dad for an entire hour. But I could tell immediately when he coughed. I mean, the room would be full of people, be fidgeting or wrestling or people, whatever. But when my dad coughed, I knew immediately it was my dad. There's no doubt. And plus, I knew a whole lot more than just his cough. I knew what it looked like. I knew how he hugged me, etc. Well, yeah, sure. Of course. I mean, you lived with him, right? But I've lived with anger for far longer than I lived in my father's house. And I'm constantly surprised when I see it. I mean, on one hand, it's very familiar. And on the other hand, it always looks like something else. And that's where the kind of the modus operandi of the hindrances come in. They use disguises, they're marvelous storytellers and mimics, and they work in teams. So I may be facing anger, but I don't see it as anger. I see it as this fascinating story about one of my favorite characters. It's me. And I can listen to stories about myself all day, especially when there's an emotional charge in there. But I won't see it for what it is. I'll see it for the story of my life or why I had to leave this job or whatever. It's always got some story, and I'll see it for the story and not for the fundamental aspect of grabbing onto something. It's kind of like grabbing onto a tar baby, who's got who, grabbing onto something and being so latched up in your mind, being so agitated by what you're watching that you're not really watching it, even though you're in its grip. So there's a story about the Buddha. On the night when he was enlightened, the Buddha got visited by Mara, who's the Buddhist devil figure. Except he's a god, but he's a really deluded god. He thinks that everybody ought to stay in samsara, the wheel of death and rebirth. And he's doing his best to keep people there. And he tried to do that with the Buddha. And he went up and tempted him with the hindrances, some of them anyway. For a sensual desire, he called forth his three daughters and had him do a nice dance. Wouldn't you rather stay around for this? For doubt. There's a picture. You often see the Buddha sitting like this with one hand over his knee, just touching the ground. That's when the Buddha, when Mara tempted the Buddha with doubt, he says, who are you to be enlightened? And the Buddha just put his finger down, touched the earth, called forth the earth as his witness. And rain showers or something like that, called the earth as his witness. And basically, I think that's about when the Mara went away, at least for the night. So that's why we see this picture of the Buddha with his finger touching the ground. But Mara didn't go away entirely. He kept on sneaking up on the Buddha. So the Buddha would be teaching in a group like this, or 500 people, and looking back and seeing Mara. He'd say, Mara, I see you, and Mara would just take off. So what happened is the Buddha could catch Mara in a crowd of 500 people. That's Mara. And that would be enough. Seeing him would be enough at the Buddha stage. Now, for us, just seeing what's going on and recognizing it, that would be a great trick too. And part of what we need to do is just learn how to do that so that we recognize what's going on. So what we would like to do is get to the point where we can recognize the hindrances, or at least our favorite ones, like we see a good friend in a crowd out at the mall, and you see somebody. You can tell how they walk. That's Jamie. I know, Jamie. But it's a long way before we do that for the hindrances because of their ability to mask themselves and turn themselves into something else. The Tibetan word for meditation is really translated as familiarization. So when Tibetans are meditating, they're familiarizing themselves with their mind, and that's tricks and what the hindrances look like, or those things. And that's kind of partly what we do. If we go and we try and work with anger when it's just raging away, if you go to some theme park or something and have these batting cages, and they can dial it and throw a ball at 100 miles an hour, 90 miles or 85 miles an hour, well, if I stepped in on one of those batting cages, I wouldn't do anything. So I'm kind of at the wiffle ball stage for a lot of these things. You put the wiffle ball up in a stick and try and learn how to swing the bat straight. And that's fine. That's, you know, if that's where we are with a particular difficulty on any given day, that's you start where you are. That's what we need to do. You learn how to swing the balls of the bat straight, then you work with a moving ball, et cetera. So if we learn how to deal with aversion, say we're starting to fidget or something like that, maybe you try and sit with it. And you say, yeah, that was optional. I really didn't have to do that. In fact, I could kind of see the urge to fidget, come. And wasn't that was kind of cool. I could see it come. And then you work with that. And then maybe I was driving in as I was driving in tonight. I saw a guy was going to pull out of a parking lot ahead of me in the highway. No, you don't. I just don't want to be saying, you know, beam, you know, raise at him or something like that. But it happened kind of in stages. I could see the bodily sensation come up. And then this and then I caught it before the story started to kick in. You know, the self justification is like, I'm on my way. I was here before you, et cetera, et cetera. And, you know, if I get once I get into that stage and the story starts kicking in, I don't tell myself stories. I'm not interested in. So I always have good stories and I can I can repeat them all night. I've worked these things out over years. So I saw before the story started to kick in. And I said, I thought, you know, this this doesn't really feel that good. So you start to start to. That's part of the familiarization. You start to pick it apart and say, oh, this is made of pieces. And if you catch it early and off before the self gratification, before the gratification comes in, you notice that maybe you. Maybe maybe that anger is not like much all that fun. And instead of getting involved in being all important on your way to give a talk and all that, you know, that's really kind of childish. You know, he pulls in there and you would have still gotten there at the time. Maybe he's maybe I shouldn't shouldn't do that so often. I think it's Ruth Dennison has a phrase. It's just self-knowledge is self-understanding is never good news. It's maybe overstated, but sometimes you just have to develop self-acceptance to along along with it. So working with the hindrances covers a lot of territory. As I mentioned before, the hindrances are properly the hindrances proper. The in the most restricted sense of aversion being on the cushion. It brings us right into the right effort. It's one of the eightfold. It's one of the eight steps of the eightfold path. And there are four right efforts and those have to do with things that are with mental states that have not yet arisen and ones that have. And it sounds really simple. I mean, it's like, oh, yeah, sure. But when you start picking it apart, it makes sense. So the four are starting with positive states. If you have a positive state, mental state like equanimity or loving kindness or whatever, or just plain concentration, how do you keep it going? If you don't have one, how do you how do you cook one up? Then for the negative mental states, if you don't have a negative mental state like anger or fear or something like that, what do you do to keep it from happening? And most important for the versions for aversion as a hindrance when it's really got in, it's really got you on the pillow. What happens if you if you have an unskillful mental state like anger? How do you get rid of it? The Buddha gave several different different tips here. One of these. One of these is then with his teeth clenched in his tongue, pressed against the roof of his mouth, he should beat down, constrain and crush his mind with awareness. Fortunately, that's number five. And we can start with number one and two. That's that's that's that's for advanced students. Numbers one and one and two are trying to replace the unskillful feeling with a positive one or contemplating the the drawbacks of that unskillful feeling. So if I if I'm having a really hard time with a memory of a certain interaction with a certain person, I can try and do metaphor that person, try and understand, just extend loving kindness to him. Or maybe I do something a little more psychological, like trying to understand that he's got his problems too without getting into the pity for him. But just if I can do something to kind of take away my story and include some of his, maybe I can drain off some of the anger or if it doesn't really or if I'm just in the state of anger. And that doesn't work. And maybe these guys are really, really hard to extend loving kindness to. Maybe you can just just just just reflect on the on the states and on the drawbacks of of being angry. It's ruining your day. It's just detracting from your meditation. It's ruining your judgment. Whatever. And those that shows up in in in daily life, daily life as well. Excuse me while I read my notes here. Yes. So it's often in daily life that morality or seal it, as we call it, and and also psychology overlap. And that can be a lot of the techniques that we learn in as we sit here kind of overlap and reinforce a lot of the kind of the psychology or the psychology or the pop psychology that we all know about. And that's fine because we all come to practice because we suffer. I mean, none of us are really here because maybe if somebody's here for curiosity. But if you're you know, we mostly come here because we suffer. And a lot of our suffering can be helped by by psychological means. And I'll I'm not a psychologist, but by maybe by giving ourselves a better story about something or noticing how we keep on repeating the same thing and keep on creating the same state for us and replacing it with something else. That's fine. You start where you are. And if that's what you need, just so you can start and sit so you can start meditating more. That's fine. My first several years of retreats were spent rewriting my career and lots of things. Oh, if only this had gone different. And I had I had many wonderful lifetimes that I just never got to. But I spent. And I just had to go through that. I don't think it was particularly a Dharma exercise. It happened to be in a setting with people that were very supportive of me and had their act together and could help me. And then we have the hindrances of the objects of of meditation. And if we can, as I mentioned before, if we get enough ability here on the cushion while things are fairly, fairly controlled situation, we can look at things in there, follow them from the junior league to the farm teams. Maybe by the time they get to the big leagues, we're able to able to handle them in big life. I'm trying to see. I can't see the clock out there. So is it OK? Never mind. So I'd like to get my. So when is a version with a small way of version with a big A? That's that's one of the things I want to get into and talk a little bit about it. Pardon. Great. Thanks. So so the question is, when is a version with a small a version with a big A? Because there's some of the terms that we use colloquially aren't exactly don't map exactly on to the the Buddhist vocabulary. So it's what a lot of us think of as a version or just plain the hindrances are things we think of as something is a is a destructive emotion. Kind of if it interrupts our personal happiness or our interpersonal relationships. So anger is anger for a lot of us is a problem because it gets in the way of our effectiveness at work or our relationship. Or we just feel lousy after we blow our top or something like that. The in the Buddhist understanding, at least as the Dalai Lama was talking about it in here, that's really not not the not the point. For for the Dalai Lama, it anger anger is a problem because it causes it keeps us from seeing clearly and it upsets our mind. So for a lot of us, we want to get rid of just enough anger so I can get get to get the job done or get along with the guy in the next desk or whatever. But in the the Buddhist scheme of things, anger, even in its most subtle, subtle manifestation, if that is keeping us from seeing things clearly or unsettling the mind, it's a problem. That's why it's one of the last things to go away. I think that you have to be an arhat before it goes goes away completely. You can do things along the way and get pretty calm and mellow, but before it goes away and completely or all the way to the end of the path. So I want to contrast a couple of statements. This knee pain is killing me. That's attributed to Don Johnson. The second one is this body should be regarded as impermanent, as painful, a boil, a dart, a calamity and affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as void, as not self. And that's the Buddha. Now, what's what's the difference between them? They both look like there's all this is his body is just a problem. Well, the Buddha, the Buddha's understanding was a lot more sophisticated than mine. He saw through all of the all of the stories I would tell about myself, all the eye making. When I say it's killing me, well, I've got a definite opinion about me and about what should happen. And about somewhere in there is some idea about my my about about permanence and some stories about suffering that it really shouldn't be really shouldn't be here. So when I'm doing that, that kind of aversion, I'm not seeing I'm not seeing Dukkah. I'm not seeing Anicha and I'm not seeing Inatta. I'm not seeing I'm not seeing suffering or unsatisfactoriness. I'm not seeing impermanence and I'm not seeing the fact that there's no permanent self inside of this seemingly consistent and perpetuating cloud of thoughts and chemicals and stuff. And then this this then there's another another thing we can talk about is when is so if not all aversions, not all aversions are really versions with a capital A. What about anger is as righteous anger, helpful anger? I mean, this comes up a lot when you talk about anger and get reading. People say, no, wait a second. I need anger. There's so much wrong in the world today. I mean, there's pick your topic. Right. This is, you know, if I weren't angry, I couldn't get anything done. I mean, I need this. The anger would be I'll get rid of most of it, but I got to keep some of it because I'm not a monk. I'm a householder. I'm politically active or whatever. Well, what you have there, I mean, maybe anger acts like an early warning system or radar or something. It says, well, gee, when the when my forehead feels hot and flush like this, something's important. I should pay attention to it. But if you say if you use anger to guide your actions, I'd say anger. When you're angry is one of the worst times to make a make an important decision because you're going to be making it. I mean, you may have picked your issue well, but you've probably also picture your your action poorly. So what about these wrathful deities? You see, you know, the repentance have there's there's one statue, one statue I've seen of a like a Japanese bodhisattva, Fudo or something. He's staying with a sword like this. He's got his tongue out and flames coming out. He's a bodhisattva with a sword and he's angry. What's the story? Well, at his level, he's got some of the physical effects of anger and he's got the determination and incisiveness from the single singleness of mind. But he doesn't have the delusion and he doesn't have the unsettled mind. So that's I think there's something maybe maybe there are parts of anger that are useful as an early warning system or a story that comes up a lot is a mother running to catch a kid before he steps into traffic and shaking him or something like that. Well, she was pretty clear about what was going on. And in that case, it was appropriate, but it wasn't like being angry at the neighbors. So I threw that in. Let's see. I think I've already mentioned this, that kind of in the secular West, we describe a destructive emotion as having a bad effect on relationships or our feelings, whereas a more donic sense would be a clouds our vision. And there's also what's the goal of the process. I think that a lot for a lot of a lot of the secular goals, it's to be normal. And what Freud, Freud, for Freud, the goal of a lot of these processes that look like we're understanding ourselves was just normal neuroses. But for the before our practice, it's a complete elimination of destructive emotions, even if you're going to slow, even if we have to go through these first stages first. So here's a quote from this book. One of these authors, one of the guys in the seminar said, in the Western perspective, being normal is fine. From a Buddhist perspective, being normal means that you're right, that you're now ready to practice the Dharma. So I've seen the important one, I wrote a town. I'd like to start referring more, a little more directly to the book now and mention another name. Another one of the guys, another one of the guys in the book is Paul Ekman. And he's a senior research psychologist at the University of California, San Francisco. He's been studying emotions for 40 years. Maybe some of you have seen books or articles or something about his work with facial expressions. And he goes way back, way back. And he was one of the people at this at the seminar. And he was invited to the seminar because he was, you know, at least sympathetic to hearing what the Dalai Lama had to say. But he was invited primarily because of his scholastic work as understanding emotions, in this case destructive emotions. And he had a schema. He said there were like three different stages in an emotion. One was assessment, like, um, you know, like that guy cut in front of me, that jerk. Another one was impulse. I had to tell him about it. I had to go up and confront him with his, you know, his failure as a human being. And another one was the actual action was doing it. And later in the book, there's a fourth stage. It kind of sneaks in. And that's perception. Other people put it in. Paul Ekman did. So there's there's perception, assessment or cognition, if you want. There's intention and then there's action. And so I'd like to do is work backward through the series and look at a couple of different ways to do it. And we'll just just talk about anger and meditation and some things that came up came up in this book. So on the. The stage between impulse and action. So for us, there's no here's I want to read this from Paul Ekman. So more than 40 years ago, when I was a psych psychotherapist, my teacher said to me, your goal is for your students, your patients to increase the time between impulse and action. If they have spread that time, this is what they will have gained. What the dollar lama is talking about in terms of he said with the dollar lama is talking about increasing the appraising time before the impulse. It says I can't read my own writing, but the whole. See one forty four. I read it from here. What is holiness is talking about is increasing the appraising time before the impulse. It is not the time from impulse to action, but from appraising to impulse. This is an extraordinary and very important difference. So I think for Paul Ekman is a big thing. But if we look at our own practice, we kind of that kind of comes with the territory. We start we we start to do that. First, the I'm getting ahead of myself, the impulse to action part. If we're looking looking there, that's where right speech, right action, right livelihood come in. Mindfulness and clear comprehension comes in there. There's clear comprehension is actually a. It's not just a nice phrase. It's actually in the commentary is actually blown out into a list of four four things. So clear, concrete, sampan, Jana Jana is full awareness of what first the purpose of one's action. It is if if I, you know, I was in a phone call last night and I was upset this guy. I was calling him up as a local politician and I was trying to explain the situation to him. And he just kind of blew me off. It was a complex. Write me a one page document and get it to me and all that. I just I had all kinds of thoughts about how if I could write this a one page document that explained it all, he wouldn't need to be in office. But I didn't say that this my I was pretty clear about my purpose was I needed his vote rather than his approval. So just a little bit there. I mean, it sounds simple, but I skipped that step a lot. And I go to my I've got one of my stories. My storehouse is a righteous action that clears away all confusion. And, you know, it never happens that way. But I keep on trying. So another one is our intentions pure. They mixed. And I might ask yourself that sometimes. Sometimes that takes a little esteem out of your emotions. Another thing is the suitability of one's actions. It's not the end justifies the means. Sometimes the best thing you do is just be quiet. If you can't do anything good, you just be quiet. Another one I look at it and it helps me is am I trying something that I can't expect to work? Maybe I'm maybe I'm just setting myself to be matter because something doesn't fail. It's an old some old pattern I'm replaying and it just doesn't doesn't work. So is that suitable? Clear comprehension of the object of meditation might be a breath. It might be your body. This sometimes is paying attention to your body, especially when you're talking. If you just pay attention to clues in your body, it helps a bit. It helps a lot. I often recognize it too late. You know, I've just said something I really shouldn't have. And I realize I have a temperature of my jaws, tensed or my shoulders are up. But you can if whatever works for you, if that helps. And then the last one is clear comprehension of reality. And this is the Buddha's kept on reminding his disciples. He says, this is not me. This is not mine. This is not who I am. It sounds like, yeah, sure. Right. It's really easy to say that now. But when you get out, well, the more you try it, the more more it makes sense. So try it out and some simple things and say, well, yeah, OK, maybe I can let that one go. I might not be, you know, really into no self or something like that. But I know that that makes enough sense. It worked on something smaller. I'll try it on something bigger. And this might work for you. So those are the kind of the where we talk about going from impulse to action. And those are some of the tools we have that the Buddha gave us. Then there's going from assessment to impulse from. From, you know, making it from kind of making a decision that we like something or we don't like something. And then then actually deciding that we need to do something about it. And kind of a tool there is is contemplation of the body or contemplation of feelings, actually. Veda, Veda nupasana. And it sounds really simple when the Buddha talks about it. He asks us to talk about noticing whether something is pleasant, unplugged or neither pleasant or unpleasant. But there's a lot there because I mean, try it. When I try it, I look at something and I don't get just plain pleasant, unpleasant and neutral. I get that with a story. You know, like I have a special relationship with my dentist. I've put at least one of his kids through college and. And, you know, a little little tooth, little tooth pain will flare up and it's never just a sensation of heat or pressure. I mean, it's always a story with it always. But the Buddha kept on going, no, keep on trying. Keep on trying. Look back at the assessment, the primitive cognition without the story. So we can we can try that. And every once in a while we'll get we'll get a little closer to it. Sometimes this happens with. I think knee pain is a great kind of laboratory for for working with things. It's not it doesn't help because, you know, if you have knee pain, you're going to gain merit and it's no it's it's. It's training pain. You know, if it's if it's really going to damage, you don't do it. But if it's like, oh, I can try this for a little bit longer, you get you can get to the place where you you can truly see the difference between pain and suffering. I mean, you'll be you can see the pain is clear as day, but it's somebody else's pain. I mean, not indifferent to it, but not identified with it either. So you can kind of kind of get peas apart that that that, you know, the what for most of us is kind of like a one one stop emotion kind of thing. And you know, this there are options here. There is more flexibility here. There are pieces that are moving parts in here. I can take this apart. Some of them I don't have to have at least some of the time. But once you see something like that, even if you see it once or once in a while, you say, oh, yeah, that I never knew it could be like that. I've heard about it, but I see it now. And then that makes it starts making a difference. On the other hand, and probably this is because I'm trying to figure out why I'm trying to figure out why one hand, some of the psychological methods seem so valuable and fit in so well. And on the other hand, why they seem like they're kind of the dominant. My dominant practice kind of pulls me off into another direction. And I mean, I've needed every bit of help I got. And I've seen things. For example, if we make up a story here, let's say you have a problem with somebody at work. And this guy, you don't know why this guy really bothers you and you just can't get along with him and you have to because he's your boss or whatever. And then or maybe in a relationship, whatever. Then some then you realize that this guy reminds you of Jimmy Schindelbeck from sixth grade. And, you know, he just and when you lost the spelling bee because you misspelled tomato and he never let you forget it. And that little sneer off the junior high in this guy looks just like that. Well, there may be something freeing there, right? And we've had that I make it make up other stories about. But there's that one there. And it's all not great. I just figured this out. But what happened was a version just went off off the stage, changed clothes and came back. You know, there's our version to our boss just turned into a version for Jimmy Schindelbeck. It may be my there may be something something freed up in there. But we thought we thought that this new form of aversion was a major insight. It's just a version. I mean, it may help us a lot. We may get along with our boss, which is not to be not not to be downplayed. But it's it's not it's not a fundamental, the fundamental revisioning of of how we think that that I think this practice offers us. And now we're last card here. Perception to assessment. Remember, I said that there were this perception to assessment to impulse into action. And in the book here, Paul Ekman, who's no slouch, been thinking about this for a long time. He didn't really think that we could get the time down between assessment and impulse. He thought that was too short for people to see. Now there's another one in here. The difference between perception and assessment or perception and cognition. And this comes in later in the book when the when some of the presenters are guys from University of Wisconsin that have like 10 million dollars of sophisticated hardware and software for doing. EGs and they can not some EGs. They just measure the surface of the scalp. Some more probes can get down to three dimensionally. And then depending on the hardware and software, it's what's the time resolution. So the story goes that then in here they're talking. One of the presenters is talking to the dollar and Amund says, you know, we have things done at 200 milliseconds, which is two tenths of a second. And we can see the difference between, you know, when we show somebody a face, people who are in a bad, a bad mood that day react differently than people who are in a good mood. Is a face or something, I don't know, but they could see and maybe the face didn't mean anything to him, but it was just that there's a lot, a lot of the reaction were dependent on the person's emotions, their mood or their temperament. So the Dalai Lama said, I wonder, is there something that happened, say, maybe at 100 milliseconds that that's the same from person to person? And then another guy raises his hands, says, yeah, in my lab, we can see down to 70 to 100 milliseconds and there's something happening there in the brain stem. That's not the cortex of the front. Something happening in the brain stem around a tenth of a second or less. It seems to be the same from person to person. What it seems to be is just cognition is just, you know, with no value added. It's just a plain thing. And the Dalai Lama says, that's it. That's it. And if you've read some of the things or heard some of the more complicated explanations of the suitors, that's what the Buddha is talking to me. He breaks things down. He talks about it. There's the mind moments and all that. What they're starting to see, what they're what they're starting to recognize in the lab is what the Buddha and the Dalai Lama and Gil and everybody else has been talking about. There's a place that we can get to with our own minds. We can see in our own minds how we construct the world around us. We can see, you know, we can see the thoughts form and blossom and go away. We can see things on a level that's below philosophy or ideology or our personalities or stories or culture. It's down. It's down where the building blocks of being conscious are. And the Buddha points us at that. And this practice helps us get there by looking at knee pain or by paying attention and see if we can notice the impulse to move before we move, whether it's sitting here and walking meditation, by noticing that the thought we had when somebody is going to pull ahead of us isn't just one thing, but it's made up of parts. And it's easier for me to deal with things if I can deal with the parts. So the practice offers those things to us. And whether it's aversion or fear or greed, any of the other any of the other mental states we have to work through, we can use the same tools for all of them. That is the great thing is we don't have to change tools depending on what the job is because the tools we've got this all work for everything. And the more we use them, the better they get. So that's about what I wanted to say. I can't really see the time. Do we have time for questions or to sit? Oh, OK. We're talking about perception here. I'm sitting close to the clock. I can't see the clock. OK. This this meeting with the Dalai Lama is one of a series has been going on for about 10, 10 or 15 years. And if you're interested in that, you can pick up that. And there's there's books on most of them. Some of them are on cosmology and the Buddha. Some are Buddhism. Some are on compassion and altruism, etc. Yeah, please. You may have already addressed this a little bit, but it's trying to improve how one deals with anger. There's lengthening time between perception and assessment in these different areas. What would be a good place for a beginner to start, either based on the high impact area or the place where somebody knew this might be likely to change what is going on? What would the high impact area would affect? Well, not the wrong action. Yeah. Kind of the way this works, at least my experience is it kind of sneaks up on you. You don't just. Whatever luck I've had with anger didn't necessarily mean, OK, I'm going to work on anger. It might have been I have to work with boredom or I have to work with knee pain or whatever, because you don't really get to choose what comes up. And that's the only thing you can really work with. And it may be, you know, it may be that you really feel pressed for time in the morning. You know, so we'll notice that if that's it. You say, no, I can't really sit 20 minutes this morning. I really have to get up because it's really more important to get out. Well, just how does that feel in your body or notice, notice the thought when it comes up just. You know, that's the only thing you can work with. And also, don't be surprised if things start to seem like they're getting worse because they say, gee, I didn't realize there's I'm angrier or whatever this that this thing I must be doing it backwards. Now, what's happening is that was there all the time. You're just kind of tuning into it. So give yourself some slack for that. And there's always there's kind of like a little shuffle between self understanding and self awareness. And when the self understanding pulls ahead a little too far ahead of the self awareness, you get one of those. I'm doing it wrong or what a jerk I am. And then you get the other one and person gets some self understanding. And then it'll catch up. So it goes like that. So just the practice works. I don't know how, but it does. And if you do your best with what whatever is there for you at the time, it'll just give it a chance. It'll make a difference. Please. Oh, yeah. I think I was talking about is that when we say anger, we may have we may think of clench our fist and turning beet red and stuff. But it can be any form, any form of aversion might not necessarily be anger, although I did use that word, I think. You may think, you know, I can't get too subtle because I'm not. So but but I may I may think, for example, we've got some political figures that some people are just just just to think are just just a real problem. And they have there's there's no problem. I mean, they get really mad about it. You know, what make all kinds of judgments? I think, well, I don't get there. I don't I don't say how arrogant this particular man is or how but how incredibly stupid this one is. But, you know, I've got it. But just I have I'm one size down. I said, oh, that that poor guy, you know, and it's still judgment and aversion or whatever, even though I don't show it at the same level that maybe somebody else does. And then there's somebody else another size down for me. Don's still stuck in judgment. You know, and then somebody else is saying, you too. You know, so it's like an onion just keeps on going. But it's like that. And the good thing is, once you solve one, once you think you solve one thing, you get something else to work on. Is that close to an answer? OK. Please. I was really interested in the software because our culture is such a lot of culture. Have violent video games. Yeah. Why was in school? We have violence in the workplace. All over the place. And it's it's really, you know, I mean, it is difficult to sit on a cushion and, you know, do it out with yourself. You know, you're dealing with those issues that you have in yourself. Then interaction in the world. I mean, there's all kinds of anger. If it comes to you through racial slurs or ageism, such as all these. I don't know. This is both anger. I mean, it's present and something's raised all around us. It's such a challenge to try to walk through the world, especially here. For me, I feel like I mean, I guess everywhere is relevant. And I think it's just. It's for surrounded by it. We could be good in the blockbuster video store and look at what's available. And it's like, wow, you know, it's murder. Right. Right. Right. And I don't know. I mean, it's a culture that we have and take myself into the workplace. I am probably at peace. I guess there's a harmony, probably that's contagious. But some people will just bully you and packet you until you stand up for yourself. Yeah. And how do you do that? Yeah. I suppose, for example, children have to deal with this. Right. This level. Yeah. Let me see if I can. So far, what I've so far, what I've understood is that and this isn't exactly what you're saying, but so far, what I've understood is that if I try and make this. You know, the society, the systems problem or their problem or something like that, I'm losing a chance to work on it because I really can't do a whole lot about these other things to the extent that something's going on with society. It's I'm part of it and I'm feeding it. And that doesn't mean to be. Oh, apathetic or not do anything. Yeah. A year ago, I spent a lot of time lobbying the Board of Supervisors about a certain resolution. We wanted them to pass. I felt really about the Patriot Act and I felt very strong about this. But I noticed that when my my own feelings about this took over and clouded my judgment or my relations with other people as strongly as I felt about it. What I really had to feel what I really had to feel more strongly about was my own equilibrium, my own ability to get along with these other people in this organization, all grassroots organizations that is functional. How do you deal with that? Sitting down with a supervisor and trying to lobby him without lecturing him and all that. That's what I had. I had to work on that. You know, there are probably more scopeful, you know, better things around to do. But that was the only thing I could do. I mean, that's kind of where I am right now. I really don't know what to do about the kids. I've never I'm not a parent. Sorry, I don't don't have an answer. But all the problems. I was thinking of a story. Somebody was, you know, moving into this practice and he had all these great ideas and wanted to talk to people about how they could change their lives if they just practiced like this or whatever. And soon found out that she was more interested in talking about that. He or he was more interested in talking about things than were his or her friends. So he just cooled it and just continued the practice. And over time, you know, this people said, well, hey, you know, you're you took that a lot better than I would have thought you did. Thought you would have something like this that kind of showed up in the relationships and maybe every once in a while it deserved a remark. And the way this person kind of netted it out is, you know, my friends like me a lot more when I was a Buddha than when I was a Buddhist. And I think that's that's kind of the way I look at the look at things. I know people are into there's a lot of people doing great things and engage Buddhism. But there's you don't necessarily need an analysis of the world based on dependent origination to get a petition signed or anything like that. It has a lot to do with your own your own equilibrium, your own own ability to bounce back from this appointment. One of the big issues is how do you how do you be active? How can you be active in something that you know can only turn out bad or worse? I mean, there's no there's no improvement like population or ecology or something like that. Those aren't going to get better for a long, long time. How do you how do you give yourself over to that and still be hopeful and active and not get worn out and bitter? And I just I think you have to just get used to looking at things and even things that are bad. Like knee pain is not like, oh, hey, I've looked at it. Good. I can go away now. No, I may stay there. You may look at that for for a long time. And someday it won't stop. I don't know. I I. Sometimes you just don't know and you got to do the best you like the first question. What do you do? How do I address this problem over here? Well, I don't know. But if you're answering, you want to get off the pillow. Maybe that's where you start. You know, it's not a very satisfying answer, but it's the only one I have or know how to make it work. Have you read any of those studies that bring these groups of content to these wild neighborhoods? And it's around the time. And yeah, yeah, maybe that's how it works. Yeah. Well, yeah, there's I mean, there's something I believe that and maybe we just do that one on one or something like that. I know that getting together in a group like this with other people, I feel better in a group where I feel better and healed and empowered. If I'm working, spend some time working with people that kind of have this stuff together, even if it means that we're together to work on something where things are everything is screwed up. We can talk more later, I think, but it's nine. I think we think the evening's over. Thank you very much.
