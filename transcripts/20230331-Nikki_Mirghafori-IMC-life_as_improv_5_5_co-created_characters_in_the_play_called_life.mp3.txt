 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Hello friends and greetings. Greetings to you. So we are continuing the theme of improv of the Dharma, the Dharma of improv this week. And in our practice I just asked you if you would like to put some words to what came up after the guided meditation. And I'll bring some of them into the space. Beautiful lightness, inspired, gratitude and grace, deeply peaceful, lightness, compassion, native wisdom, radiant, shining, sense of humor, love it. Shake it till you make it. It's great. Actually I would say fake it till you become it. I think that's the way I like to rephrase that. Thank you for that. A lightness, joyous, gratitude, infused with puta nature. Beautiful. Always a beginner. Thank you so much. So many beautiful reflections. Beautiful. Creative. Yes. Yeah. We can have a lot of creativity in our practice. There are so many doorways to the temple. So many doorways and sense of humor is one of them. And sometimes when we enter the path of practice we think, okay, it's got to be serious. Actually humor can be a great support, great support. This lightness of heart, this awakening is just too serious for us to have no humor about it. So, beautiful. Thank you so much. So, as I mentioned briefly, many themes, but the one for today is this idea of, again, from the Dharmic sense, from the Dharmic perspective, as I mentioned, there is a sense of lightness of impermanence, the shifting, changing nature of ourselves, our thoughts, our bodies, our personalities, our reactions, the co-creation in a particular environment with particular people. We show up differently. And that impermanence leads to one perspective, one way to experience anatta, in personality. It's co-created. There's this such lightness about it. It can be co-created in a different way. This person we are, this sense of self is created, is created from so many causes and conditions, so many causes and conditions, which is actually one way to understand emptiness. Everything is co-dependently arising, our personality, how we are reacting. If I say personality, it feels a little fixed, but the way we are showing up in a particular moment, our reactions, are such co-creations of the environment and previous experience and so many different factors. And our thoughts are our perspective, of course, our view that this is fixed, this is who I am, this is the way I am, this is how I relate. And the Buddha has invited us to really see these characteristics of existence, these marks of existence, that yes, it is co-created. Nothing is... Our personality, our self is co-created, is co-dependently arising in each and every moment. So why don't we support a more kind, a more wise co-creation? We can support it. Of course we can. We're part of one of these causes and conditions. So from the perspective of improv, actually, the perspective of improv, you are taking on these characters when you're playing a scene, when you're playing with other players. You're taking on a character. And the character keeps shifting and changing and moving and you take a character in one scene, in one game, in another character, in another... And what I've discovered, and actually many people have discovered this, is that you take on a different character, different aspects of your personality, different aspects of your perception, different aspects of your behaviour. All of these become unleashed. You're not as fixed as you realize. There's so much more degrees of freedom. And in fact, simply taking the physicality of another being, another person, can shift your state of mind. I had a practitioner, a yogi, some years ago on a retreat, on a silent retreat. And what they shared with me was so interesting and insightful. They said that at first, maybe for some time, they had felt annoyed by people. They had felt annoyed by, oh, this person who's walking so slowly, or that person who's like this and that person, just kind of their mind, this judgmental mind was just frustrated with people. And then what they decided, they made a decision, okay, what if actually they had an observation, what if there's something about their physicality that's actually making them be in a world in a particular way? So what they did, the decision they made was to take on the physicality of different people that at first they were annoyed by. So perhaps there was an older person, so there's a younger person. Or the older person, maybe the fact that they're actually, you know, they're maybe hunched over a little bit, walking slowly. And this younger person tried that. They tried walking more slowly, with perhaps less certainty in their steps. And what they shared was that every body posture that they took, every character they entered, there are different ways that they saw the world. There are different ways that they became, and their heart opened to compassion for the beings at whom they were annoyed at first. Because they entered their character, their world, through their body, through their physicality. And in fact, as an improv performer, as an improv player, one of the exercises that you take on different physicalities to enter different characters through their physicality, but of course you can enter them in so many different ways. Both to open our hearts to compassion, to kindness, to insight, as well as what we tried, for example, what we tried with the guided meditation was a different version of a practice that's called Buddha Nusati. Buddha Nusati is reflection on the beautiful qualities of the Buddha, reflection on the Buddha, recollecting the Buddha Nusati, recollecting, remembering Buddha Nusati, remembering the Buddha. So there are ways that this practice can traditionally be practiced when you think about, you conjure up the beautiful qualities of the Buddha. Wise, gosh, yes, wise, wise, or generous, generous, generous, peaceful, yes, all knowing, knowing of all worlds, so recollecting your minds. And then when you practice it, actually, I've practiced recollections of the Buddha a lot, and I love this practice. So if you're feeling upset or unhappy or depressed, oh my goodness, due to recollections of the Buddha, it just inspires, it just infuses your heart with light and bliss and your inner Buddha becomes alive. And that's what I was inviting you to, to basically doing this practice of recollections, the Buddha Nusati recollections of the qualities of the Buddha in this creative way, in this creative way of the Buddha entering and actually, oh, infusing this quality. Oh yes, the Buddha, the oh yes, how would they be right now? How would they sit? How would they pay attention? Oh yes, the Buddha. So, and I was practicing along with you, and there was just such a sense of really shining, shining this light, this brilliant light of goodness, of the Buddha that oh yes, it's here too, it's here too, trust that it's here too. We all have it, of course, we have it, of course. Sometimes it might feel more covered or we have to listen more closely to uncover it, but it's always here, it's always here. So, so there are a lot of different ideas and concepts that are brought in, but basically, it, the, as the theme for today, our personality, the way we are, the way we take ourselves to be, is so flexible, is co-created, anatta. It is impersonal, it is co-created, it is an aspect of emptiness, co-dependently arisen, and we can play around with skillful means, skillful means of recollecting the qualities of the Buddha, beautiful qualities of the Buddha, letting it nourish us, infuse us. So basically, we're playing the Buddha character, right? In improv terms, it would be we're playing the Buddha, as someone said, we're faking it until we become it. Of course, please, let's all fake it until we become it, because that's how it happens. What would the Buddha do? You know, if you have decisions today, the rest of the day, what would the Buddha do? What would this person do? What would, you know, this favorite teacher, I saw someone mention Ajahn Brahm in the chat, who actually, there's a lot of humor in his teachings, very, very funny, funny person, funny guy. So, yeah, what would Ajahn Brahm do in this case? Yeah, so, so bringing this, this creativity that we have, we have so many tools and skills on the path to awakening, so many tools. And, and another one, as I mentioned, you can enter other people's worlds, other physicality, see the world from their perspective. It's really empathy, it's empathy and compassion. So, so this improv, this playfulness of taking on different characters, maybe you decide after this, this sit, you go around, maybe your day or part of your day as some character, some, you know, as the Buddha, as one of your favorite teachers, as whoever you are. Or, so be creative, be creative today, play around with, maybe I'm going to go around as a happy person, as the happy Buddha. I'm just going to go around and make my breakfast or make my lunch or interact with my friends or as the happy Buddha, or as the wise Buddha, as the compassionate Buddha, as the generous Buddha. So, so thank you all. Thank you for your practice this whole week. This has been fun, exploring this. And, yeah, it's it's been a delight to share all of this with you. Thank you for your enthusiasm, for your practice, your heart, your Buddha natures coming to the fore, playing in this way. So, so be well, see you on the path. Come to happy hour, if you want more, more of this. Maybe I'll do something similar to this tonight at happy hour, but come to happy hour, we'll see you on the path in different, in different ways. Yeah, see you on the path. Take good care. Be well, dear friends. Much love, all blessings. It's been a delight. Take good care. Bye. Thank you.
