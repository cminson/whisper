The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Welcome to IMC. Can you hear me okay?
Yeah, okay, good.
So welcome to our half-day retreat.
My name is Dawn Neal. I'm a long-time practitioner,
and I've been teaching for a while, more than 10 years now.
And I just want to start by giving a warm welcome to anyone who's new,
and mentioning a few logistics to orient you.
So after I finish talking, I'll give some logistics and some brief practice notes, instructions.
And then we'll do a walking period, a sitting period.
During the walking and the first part of the sitting, there are some sign-up practice discussions available.
The sign-up sheet is on the Dona box right by the front door where you walked in, if you're interested.
So where you would go is to go out the front door and turn left
and come around the building to the other side of this wall here.
We're offering them outside. I'm offering them outside today.
They're 12 to 15 minutes long apiece.
There are three bathrooms in the back, if anyone needs that.
There's also water and water and tea to make tea.
You're welcome to enjoy either of those out on the front porch or around.
Let's see what else.
At the end of the day, we'll have a short temple cleaning
and the option to stay for tea or to eat lunch with the rest of it.
If you brought lunch, that'll be out in the parking lot.
We'll set up tables and chairs out there.
Everyone's warmly welcome to stay.
And Bupal here is our manager.
During the next couple of hours, if you have any logistical questions,
please just go up and talk to him.
Anything else, Bupal, that I forgot in logistic?
I just remembered one other thing.
Our neighbors prefer you do not do walking meditation in their parking lots.
So please feel free to do walking meditation in our little parking lot
right out the side here or on the sidewalks or on the pebbles out front.
Ask that you remain aware and don't block the flow of normal progress
of Redwood City on a Wednesday morning.
So if someone's pulling out of their driveway, it's okay to go full speed.
Okay.
I'll start by offering some practice notes.
So the invitation in this next couple of hours
is to really let yourself sink in, settle in, relax.
Allow this time to support a calm, clear presence.
And perhaps a couple of images might support that.
Take more of them.
Imagine yourself walking on a path just for the enjoyment of the walking.
Beautiful day, clear sky.
You come to a mountain lake,
comfortable spot to sit right by the lake under the shade of a tree.
And you can imagine sitting there,
settling in, lowering yourself into this cool mountain lake,
just like you might settle yourself into your body.
Let's see the clear sky above and allow the mind, the heart to open
to a broader awareness.
So settling into the body, comfortable, easy,
below all the surface chop or winds of the day, the thinking
and allowing the mind, the heart to let anything and everything flow through
all kinds of weather.
Staying simple, settled back like the sky,
touched by any of it, no need to pick it up.
So enjoy your walking, enjoy your sitting.
I have 45 minutes for walking now. Thank you.
