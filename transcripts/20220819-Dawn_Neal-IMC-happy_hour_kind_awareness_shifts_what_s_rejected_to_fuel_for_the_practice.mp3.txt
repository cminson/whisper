 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome everybody, welcome. Welcome to Happy Hour. Nice to see you. Those of you that I can see, hello. You have a moment maybe put in the chat or you can name your name and where you're zooming in from. Make sure we come up on the New York. Yes, okay. So warm welcome. Can you hear me okay? Yes, great. All right. Fuzzall from Chicagoland, welcome. Any other geographies? Hello from Burlingame. Hi, Marianne. Any others? Fred and Oakland, hi. Welcome. So most of you already know me. Oh, hi, Jonathan. Hey, from Calgary, Alberta. Welcome. Canada is represented and Marie Christine from Sydney, Australia. Welcome. Fantastic. Good to see all of you. So we are already a couple minutes past six, so I'm going to minimize the chat and start talking about what I was going to talk about for a few reflections tonight. So friends, I've been inspired recently by stories of the Buddha and the range of people that he met and talked to over his long life and many, many years of teaching, 40 plus years of teaching, wandering around ancient India. And he spoke, intervened with, talked to all kinds of people, kings and queens, consorts, arrogant philosophers, homeless folks. I'm hearing it's hard to hear me. Please, is anyone else finding it hard to hear me because I checked. Okay, I'm getting a bunch of thumbs up. So the person who said that, please adjust your volume. Okay, great. All right, I'm going to start over here. So the Buddha taught all kinds of people in ancient India. He kind of without prejudice interacted with nobility, kings, queens, like very wealthy benefactors, but also lepers and consorts, even Angulimala, the famous mass murderer, all of those he offered teachings to in the course of his long, long teaching career. And one of the people that he offered teachings to really kind of inspires me, many of them do, but I'm going to talk about her in particular. There was this homeless kind of raving woman wandering around a certain province of India, and she was kind of mostly naked and 30 and covered in mud and just spouting off nonsense. And the local villagers would throw dirt and rocks and clods of things at her to get her to go away. But the Buddha happened upon her one day, going towards that village to give teachings. And instead of rejecting her, he met her with his full attention, loving attention, and looked her in the eye and he said with deep compassion, woman, come to your senses. Come to your senses. And she did. And she ended up joining his order or gaining as a nun. The commentaries talk about the backstory of this woman. She had been through just almost unimaginable tragedy. She lost her home, her husband, her children, her parents and her ancestral home, all within the space of a couple of days. And that is what drove her mad. Nonetheless, after ordaining and sitting with all that grief, all that loss, all that difficulty, she eventually became deeply respected. One of the foremost practitioners in ethics and wisdom and eventually a highly regarded teacher of other nuns. Her name was Papa Chara. And those of you who have frequented the IMC YouTube channel probably saw her statue for a while at IMC. She replaced the Buddha for some months. So, so, Papa Chara. And there are two, to my knowledge, two poems in the Terry Gata, the enlightened verses of the elder nuns that are devoted to her in the ancient texts. One is very commonly read. I'm not going to read that one. I'm going to read a poem based on this Terry Gata verse, First Free Women. This is written, spoken by one of her students. It's entitled Papa Chara's Thirty Nuns. Farmers take grain from the earth, from branches, from the trees. They crack open one with the other and take what's left to feed their families. You all are like unripe grain. Take time to grow. Then leave the ground behind and let your tusks be stripped away. I promise, less is more. So, Papa Chara pulled us. So, we sat on the ground like unripe grain. We gave ourselves to the path. And the path broke us apart. What we feared most is now seen for what it is. True peace. True freedom. All that broke apart was the darkness that we had for so long been calling our world. True peace. Freedom. Freedom. So, how we relate to experience is what transforms the heart and mind. That same kind, compassionate attention the Buddha gave about Papa Chara when she was crazed out of her senses. That brought her to the path and just like that, the attention we give to this heart, this mind, even the lunatic condenses, the life denying portions. That which is rejected within. All of that can become fuel for the path of freedom when held in loving kind awareness. I'm not suggesting we condone. Or buy into that which is rejected whether it be an idea of a person or persons, or some dark unhealthy tendency or unwanted part of ourselves. What I'm instead suggesting is that being held being met with the moment of mindfulness, kindness, compassionate awareness, what Ajahn Brahm calls kindfulness, can transform even those tendencies into fuel. Fuel for awakening, fuel for greater freedom, compassion, love. So the invitation tonight, should you want to accept it, as we practice metta and compassion, is if it happens that something arises in your heart and mind that seems unwelcome to meet it. Meet it with compassion, kindness, at least acknowledge it in awareness. Allow that, allow that to become fuel for practice, for the path of awakening. So good people with that said, we're going to transition to the meditation portion of the evening program. For now, I'm going to turn off the ability to unmute in case we get more people coming in who are accidentally unmuted. And that will keep the container a little bit quieter, calmer. Now the encouragement is also to turn off anything that might disturb you, whether it's a cell phone or another device, or even the alert functions on what you're zooming in from. And then find a comfortable posture, balancing relaxation and alertness. Standing, sitting, lying down, it's all good. If you're comfortable allowing your eyes to close, mind will be closed, so I won't be seeing your chats. Just open them now and then to check in on the time. I'm settling in to this body, this mind, this heart, exactly as it is. This moment. Nothing left out. Inviting. Inviting any sounds, wanted or unwanted. Any sensations. The overall quality of this heart and mind, this being in this moment, all of it to be known and acknowledged, seen and aware of. And doing any moments of mindfulness, little mini rituals perhaps that bring your heart, mind and body into alignment. Perhaps taking two or three deep breaths. Allowing tension to escape, softening. Inviting the body to relax. Forehead, cheeks and lips. Drops the neck and shoulders. Acknowledging what's there. And inviting, inviting any relaxation, softening around. Checking in with the torso, chest, belly, back, arms and hands. May this body relax. Feeling the support under this body. Found the support of the earth beneath whatever surface you are resting on right now. Bringing the hips, buttocks, legs, ankles and feet, the whole body towards. The senses, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, push of air and skin. Now breathing. And including too, the general sense of the heart and mind in this moment. Allowing the heart and mind to settle in any anchor of attention, comfortable for you. What about the breathing, full body awareness, hearing, or just a general sense of now, opening to alignment. Settling. Inviting kindness, compassion. To be the intention for how the heart and mind, mind, full awareness, meet experience. Each breath, each sensation, each moment of distraction and recitals. Next. There is the heart, mind, settle in this moment. With whatever is allowing it all. The invitation is to bring into the foreground the experience of the heart, the heart qualities. Be an embodied sense of those qualities of the whole body. Kindness, compassion, tenderness, gratitude. For many of us it's also helpful to tune into the torso, especially the area on the center of the chest and heart. Perhaps imagining breathing through this area. We're just tuning into the sensations there, attuning. Attuning to intentions of kindness and compassion. Allowing, well-wishing. On each in-breath, noticing what's present, just as it is. If it feels right for your practice, on each out-breath, generating a sense of well-wishing. Radiating through this body, this heart, outwards. It's fine to just have a generally radiating out-breath, rippling perhaps like water, glowing like wind. And where it's helpful, you can bring a particular other being to mind. Somebody easy. A cute or beloved animal, good friend, someone who makes your heart light up, even a child. Nothing complicated. You can imagine them nearby. You can imagine a figure, religious figure, spiritual figure, benefactor, pretty far away, even mythical. Feeling perhaps a sense of their presence, or imagining the concept of word of them. More visualizing. It's okay to be playful, imaginative. Noticing. How does this heart respond to this other one? It helps you to allow a smile to come to your lips, perhaps to place a hand on the heart. Sending well-wishes, and if appropriate, imagining them received and sent back. Radiating out. Good gesture of care, good will, appreciation. It's helpful to focus these intentions. Kindness, appreciation, care, compassion, the words. We're welcome to do so. We'll offer a few simple phrases, once or twice. Please adapt them to your own language and words. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be free. May you be safe. Happy. Healthy. Free. Feeling the resonance of any words or phrases chosen. Shorter phrases or single words build stability and momentum. Just allowing silence within tension. Offering the gesture of kindness, care, outwards, maybe on the out-breath. Maybe on the in-breath. Maybe on the out-breath. Maybe on the out-breath. Time to time checking in with the heart and mind. Refreshing the awareness. Feel supportive to continue offering kindness, care, appreciation, and passion. Another one, please do. And another invitation is to open the field of Kindness to all corners of this body, heart, and mind. All that arises within it. Perhaps other people or beings in your life, ideas of them arising. Or perhaps other processes of mind, impulses of the heart arising. Meeting those with awareness is an act of kindness. Allowing, including and noticing, appreciating any tiny thread of kindness, compassion, even intention towards it. Appreciating that. Happy. Safe. Healthy. Free. Simple. You can imagine yourself beyond this other one, the beloved or easy being. Sending intentions of kindness to everything that arises. Persons, ideas, thoughts, emotions, everything. Kindness towards what arises in the sensation. What is heard, what is felt, what is known. Appreciation for the knowing. Knowing the intentions of kindness to ripple through the body, heart and mind. Saturating, fulfilling experience. What is heard, what is known. What is heard, what is known. What is known. What is known. What is known. What is known. What is known. What is known. In the last moments of this meditation, the invitation is to let go of any particular person or being, objective focus, if one remains. And allow the intentions of kindness and compassion themselves. Those intentions to be the object of the attention for a moment. Appreciating the beauty of these intentions. Offering appreciation to this heart and this mind. No matter how it works, doesn't matter, the intentions or what's cultivated. Appreciating. And stepping back, allowing everything just to flow through awareness. Like clouds float through sky, like birds fly through weather coming and going. Noticing the awareness, just like the sky that holds everything. Is there any way to get that? Friends, before we break silence, while you're still in meditative space, the invitation is to continue meditation for just a moment or two, offering kind, compassionate, caring wishes to all of your fellow meditators here in this Zoom room. If you want to turn your video on, it's kind of fun to scroll through and offer kindness to others, knowing as long as you're offering it, that you are the recipient of these kind of wishes from your fellow practitioners here in this room. Thank you for your practice here. So, we have a few minutes here if anyone wants to offer a reflection, comment, question, and do it in the chat or raise your Zoom hand and speak. It's up to you. Silence is also fine. You're welcome to the person who put thank you in the chat. So, what are you offering tonight? You're offering everything, you feel everything to be included in the realm of practice, in the realm of kindness. Not only by mind but by seeing your emotions, are you offering to some habitual inner energy that just kind of carries you out a large their?) like seeing them, seeing them is good news, right? If you're not seeing it, it's running up. Knowing that, knowing that to be part of experience. So, to return to the poem for a moment. So Atatrara told us, what we feared most is now seen for what it is. True peace, freedom, all that broke apart was the darkness we had for so long and calling on the light. Wow, it would have to be in the light of awareness. Or, not to belittle darkness, anything unseen can become a fertile womb for awakening once it emerges into love, kindness, awareness, anything. So, last call for questions, comments, complaints before I invite those of you who wish to join breakout rooms. Anybody? Yeah, spread hi. Hi, thank you. I just found this very difficult tonight, and in a way that I usually don't. And what I found was just a lot of resentment arising that I really didn't want to feel, and that really runs counter to my self-image. And there it was, there's no way around it. And I just stayed with that for most of the time. And the only way it budged was when you suggested that, if I understood it correctly, that we try to stay with whatever we're feeling to them and offer kindness to our experience, even if it's not the experience we want at all. And in doing that, I definitely found a shift in the experience where it wasn't so repugnant. And I didn't really understand it very well, but I could sense something else happening. I can see that there's something there that could be pursued in some way. But there's something very powerful about saying, about welcoming what's not wanted. Thank you very much for your honesty and your sharing. And it's not going to pretend that's not an easy practice. It's not an easy practice to do. I'm wondering what you make of, when you offer the kindness towards the feeling itself, do you have any sense at all of just an embodied sense as you're talking of why it might have shifted? Well, the embodied sense was certainly that I was moving out of thoughts and fantasy and back in my solar plexus. I was in the largest part of my body, and I felt more at home with that and not at war with myself, with my thoughts not warring with my whatever else they might be warring with, but not being attacked by fantasy and thinking. Beautiful. Beautiful. So instead of being at war with and contention with a thought that it sounds like our counter to your self identity, like how you like to see yourself and how you just want to see yourself frankly, right? Like don't like to identify as being present. I'm going to use language of dropping to the sensations underneath and putting that in air quotes, but into the body and meeting directly what was happening rather than the mind's concoctions about it. It sounds like that shifted something for you. Yeah, it did. Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. And that has been in my own experience, a really powerful way to shift, especially any kind of story and resentment are often story. You know, there's a story there usually to meet the feeling itself with a love without feeding the story. And by love, I mean complete attention. So that just can be as simple as resting attention in the solar plexus or in the body. That's a form of loving attention too, right? That drops to it to another level. And Pima Shodran often writes about rather than meeting the story of an emotion to drop to the sensation of an emotion. And that can be a very, very powerful shifting process over and over again, because most of us, it'll come back until embodied wisdom eventually disintegrates it somehow. Thank you very much. Thank you, Fred. Thank you very much. So the invitation, if you care to accept it, is to join a breakout room. And you talk about amongst yourselves, what feeds your ability to be kind to the unwelcome or just what feeds this practice for you? Share your wisdom with each other. And if you don't want to join a breakout room, you can just stay in here with your video off and we join at the end. That's fine. I will turn my video off. So enjoy. And I will redistribute you if any of you get stuck along. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome back, everyone. We have just two or three minutes. Any comments about that process for yourselves? Puts of wisdom you'd like to share? Final reflections? Can be in the chat or you can say it once time. I just appreciate Fred sharing because it really helped me understand the message tonight. And it was just a beautiful practice. So thank you. Thank you, Jean. Thank you. Any others? Grateful Mary talking about gratitude. Gratitude to the teachings and to the sangha. Yes, Diana. I just want to say I too really learned from Fred's sharing because those things happen to me and I'm not often able to understand what really happened. So I heard that with you and with Fred. And I learned in my group a lot tonight as well some really interesting and useful things. So thank you very much, everyone. Would you care to share maybe one thing you learned in your group? Well, I talked about myself, which was that I came to there were three or four things. But why I came to this practice, I must have met and radiating and the rippling and all I must have needed it. And I think it's the Dharma working in me that brought me to I mean, there are many aspects of practice, but this particular one seems to answer something in the heart. So beautiful. Thank you. Thank you again, Fred, for your sharing. It's very fruitful, clearly for many people. To thank you all for your practice and your wisdom. And just very briefly say, may the benefits of this practice ripple out from these hearts, these minds, these relationships, this practice out to all of the lives we touch and all of the lives they touch rippling outwards may all beings be free. May all beings be happy. May all beings be aware. Thank you, everyone. Have a good night. Thank you kindly. Thank you. Thank you.
