 In its Buddhist context, spiritual practice, or Buddhist spiritual practice, the core of spiritual practice is often called the middle way. And originally the Buddha called it the middle way, the middle path, the middle way. He said it was the balance or the middle way between indulging oneself, and he called it sensual pleasures, indulging oneself in all kinds of worldly pleasures. And the word is indulging, not just simply enjoying them. So that's on one side, and the other side was asceticism, self-mortification, denial. And that both were extremes, and he actually taught a middle way between those two extremes. The middle way is also used for describing many other, the balance between many other kind of polar opposites in practice. An idea of balance is a very important one in practice. What we need to do is try to find a balance. And many people live reactive lives, and so they, when we're reactive, it's often like a pendulum that swings from one side to the other. And we react a certain way, and we want the opposite, as opposed to trying to find the balance in the middle. So I know that's often the case with people who are under a lot of stress or tension, is that they often then will recoil from that or retreat from that, and then just kind of become couch potatoes and sit in front of the television or something. And it is in a kind of way relieving some of the pressure or attention. But partly it's kind of swinging to the other side of a pendulum, which has a swing back later on. Because if you just kind of numb out or just kind of, you're relaxing comes from just kind of slouching or slumping in a couch, then the really deep inner release and relaxation, which is possible, often doesn't have a chance to happen. Often it's kind of a numb, kind of disconnected kind of relaxation that might happen to some people. Or simply we don't allow ourselves to go as far as we can, and we don't allow ourselves to see really what's happening for us. It's kind of reactive or pulling away from who we really are, trying to find some relief, as opposed to really seeing what's really happening right now. And then because it's kind of an avoidance and kind of a relief seeking, then the wisdom and understanding of our lives is not there. And often the pendulum swings right back and we get tense again the next day. And many people swing back and forth that way. And the idea in practice is to find a balance between many different inner factors, the spiritual factors or psychological factors. And traditionally in mindfulness practice, each practitioner is supposed to kind of be able to have a sense of the grammar or the structure of meditation to know how to find their own balance. It's not just simply a matter of bringing mindfulness to their experience, but also paying attention to particular qualities of our experience to see if they're in balance, or if they're imbalanced and if they can be corrected. So it requires a little bit of effort, a little bit of consideration of powers of observation to notice what's happening to us as we sit. And traditionally there are five elements that get balanced. Before I talked about those five, actually I would tell you about, there's two very simple ones that sometimes talked about. And that is the sinking mind and the rising mind. The sinking mind is the mind that's getting dull, sleepy, cloudy. The rising mind is a mind that gets increasingly agitated, restless, energetic. And we can watch, you can actually track and you're sitting, the mind kind of goes up and down a little bit. If we start getting calm, some people with calm, the mind will start getting sleepy and the mind will start getting dull. Sometimes you might actually fall asleep. Or if we're resisting something, we really don't want to pay attention to what's happening. Sometimes that'll take the form of the mind going dull or numb. The mind kind of sinks, it gets heavy and cloudy and sticky and all this. The rising mind is, you know, something's happening, we don't like it, then we get apprehensive, we get all worked up about it. Say, oh no, and the mind goes up. We start thinking about all kinds of things and get lost in kind of energetic kind of thinking or preoccupation. And the idea is to find a balance, there's been a lookout for this. Is the mind getting too energized or is the mind getting anything too little energy? Then can I find that balance between rising and sinking mind? Kind of like if I continue the scuba diving kind of analogy. If you've been scuba diving, you know, you have to kind of just have just the right amount of buoyancy in the water. You know, if you're 10, 15, 20 feet under the water, you have just the right buoyancy to kind of float along its one elevation. And if you're too heavy or too light, then you sink, right? Or float. And so you use the least amount of effort when you're scuba diving. If you have just the right buoyancy, it carries you along just effortlessly. You don't make any effort to keep yourself up or down. So same thing with meditation practice. If you can find the balance, then it requires actually the least amount of effort to move ahead and practice. So it might take some effort to find the balance, but once we have a balance, it kind of coast along. So then there's a list of five. The five is called the five faculties and they're usually called five faculties because they're the five potentials. Each of us have these faculties and these potentials that can be developed. And as they get developed and their name changes and they become the five powers, the five strengths each was developed and becomes strengths we have within us. And these are faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. And these are kind of like the grammar of meditation or the structure of meditation practice syntax, something like that. And classically, a meditation teacher, when they're listening, a bipassana teacher listening to practitioners report about their meditation practice, they're listening to see how these five factors are balanced. And so if they're not balanced properly, then they'll make some suggestions and try to bring them into balance. But it's also possible for each practitioner to get a sense for themselves, observe for themselves how these factors are working in their life and see, you know, can I bring some balance here? An interesting thing about balance is that two opposing forces can be balanced. I said two weights can be balanced. I say this way, if there's two very light weights and you're balancing them on a scale, they can balance beautifully. And if you have two really, really heavy balance stones and put them on the scale, then it still can balance, right? So the balance doesn't necessarily mean that the minimum amount of energy you need, a minimum amount of concentration, but rather it means that as the energy gets stronger in practice, it has to be matched with this equal strength of concentration. Make sense? When faith gets strong, you don't have to get rid of faith, but rather you have to strengthen the wisdom factor. So you have, so they, so actually, with time, they get stronger and stronger and stronger rather than just kind of evening out to nothing. So faith, so in the way this works, it's kind of like a pyramid, I suppose. And on either side, each or either end, there's wisdom, there's faith and wisdom. And they are the, they're the two factors that get balanced with each other. And then closer to the middle, there's energy and concentration and those two balance each other. And then in the middle, there's mindfulness. And actually it says mindfulness doesn't need anything to balance it. That mindfulness is called the great balancer. It's a, in fact, the more mindfulness you bring, the function of mindfulness is by itself often is to help bring balance on the other factors. So some people tend to be kind of purists, especially on intensive retreats. People meditate all day and say, all you need to do is just keep focusing on that mindfulness and the other four will find their own balance. But in fact, more pragmatically, often we have to kind of focus on the other other four and see where is the balance has to come. So faith is often, often we begin with faith in this list and faith is a very important word and very important concept in practice. And it probably the English word faith doesn't exactly do justice to the Buddhist word, sada. And I say that initially, so that some, many people in the West have some trouble with the word faith because of associations they have with their own religious tradition or some tradition they've encountered. And you had to believe things under blind faith or you had to kind of, some kind of blind obedience to the faith or you had to kind of blind belief or agreement to accrete. The idea of faith in Buddhism is a quite wide range of meanings. From the point of view, it's interesting that the etymology of the word, if you go back to ancient India, way before the time of the Buddha and ancient Vedic Sanskrit, it seems that the etymology of the word, the original meaning, the word sada meant hospitality. And that kind of has to do with hospitality you gave the gods. So faith and gods, you know, it's kind of, so, but they do have hospitality I like. And so something about faith that allows us to be a host, to be open, to be receptive, to be willing to be, to be attentive to what our experience is. A host is someone who's carefully attentive to what's to their guest. So something about faith, which I like, which is kind of being a good host to our life, to our experience. Faith also has a meaning of confidence. And that can mean confidence in oneself, which many people need to have. Confidence that they can practice, that it's worthwhile for them to practice. Has some confidence that it's okay that it's to have joyful experience in meditations, to have great openings and releases in their practice. There's some people who feel they're not worthy, or they don't, it's not that they can't do that. That's for the great yogis and Himalayas, not for me. And so they hold themselves back. They have no confidence in themselves, that spiritual depths are accessible to them. So certainly it means confidence in oneself. It also means hopefully some confidence in the practice, and maybe some confidence in the teachings. Maybe some confidence in the teachers who exemplify hopefully the practice. And confidence again also doesn't mean blind faith or obedience. It means almost like inspiration, like, oh yeah, this is something I can trust. It's trustworthy. At least it's trustworthy enough that I'm going to really give it a try. And it's not such a strange concept because there's a tremendous amount of trust that runs our society. Without trust, our society would fall apart. And for example, if you go to Stanford Extension and take a class there, there's some, you have some modicum of trust that Stanford University has found a competent instructor who's going to guide you through the intricacies of whatever you're going to study. And you don't really know, and the instructor tells you to buy this expensive book, and he has some trust that this book is worth getting because a hundred dollars is a lot for a textbook. So okay, well, and you do it partly maybe because you're obedient, but partly because you have some sense of trust. Oh yeah, I'm willing to pay this money for this class and go sit in this class and listen to this person because I have some trust that Stanford wouldn't just, you know, get any old, you know, person to teach, but rather someone who's somewhat qualified. And you know, sometimes a trust is hopefully warranted and sometimes maybe a little bit disappointed, but there is a level of trust. You're willing to try it out, give it the benefit of the doubt. So the same kind of idea goes in place with Dharma practice, with spiritual practice, that there's enough trust in the teaching, the teachers, the practice that okay, I'll try it out. Let's see what it's like. And hopefully this person knows what they're doing, you know, and, and, you know, he's been doing it here in Palo Alto for 10 years. You know, people are still coming. So probably he knows a little bit of something enough that I can give him some trust. So I'll come and sit, you know, and check it out and see, come and check it out. So take some trust. You could be at home watching Al Gore tonight. So some trust that what's happening here has some worth, some worth. So I'm kind of making light of it, but actually, it's actually a very important principle that it's really helpful to find some level of confidence and trust and faith in the practice and the teachings so that we can really apply ourselves to it and maybe stretch ourselves, extend ourselves into some place that we wouldn't necessarily go to on our own. Spiritual practice, spiritual practice always entails going across a threshold of fear. There's always some level of fear that'll come up up when you do spiritual practice. And some people it's sooner, some people it's later, but sooner or later fear will, and sometimes some people it's a big thing and some people it's not so big, but fear is always a threshold that people don't have to face. And what is it that helps us get across a threshold of fear? We'll step the other side of fear and see what's there. And there's many things, but one of the primary things is some degree of faith or trust or inspiration, that it's okay to do that step across. And then again, it's kind of tricky then because well, how do you know that it's, you know, trust doesn't necessarily mean you know. There's also quotes called verified trust. That's when you step across that threshold and then you know it was okay, then it's been verified. You come and do the practice for a while and you get benefits from practicing and say, oh, I first came to the sitting group about a trust that maybe there was something useful here. And in fact, I tried it out and now I know there's something useful in this practice. And so now the faith has been verified and it's called verified faith. So some degree of faith and trust is very important. Faith and trust also has a connotation of inspiration, of some kind of, it was a close connected to our idea of aspiration, what we aspire for, to have some sense of what's possible to aspire for, what's possibility of a human being in terms of freedom, in terms of compassion, in terms of love, in terms of connectedness with others, in terms of not being defended, living without fear or hostility. Some aspiration for that, that is fueled and supported by inspiration. And inspiration is a really important ingredient and without inspiration, sometimes things can get really difficult and very dry and it's a very difficult to stay in ongoing spiritual practice. And sometimes it's worthwhile considering what is it that inspires me? How can I maybe rev up my inspiration a little bit? And maybe reading a Dharma book for some people, it's enough to get them inspired. Some people, they go on retreats and the retreats are, you know, it's like getting a great big boost of inspiration and boost through, mostly through verified faith. You kind of do the practice and see how powerful it is. There's many different ways of getting inspiration and some people will do it daily. In our traditions in Southeast Asia, the beginning of every meditation session is often done making a little offering to a Buddha statue, reflecting on the qualities of a Buddha, reflecting on one's own good deeds and good intentions, and spending some time doing love and kindness meditation. All those ways partly to inspire us to rouse the faith and the confidence then when we switch to the mindfulness practice, we have some strength to find faith that carries us along. So on the opposite side of faith, there is wisdom and wisdom is what many people associate Buddhism with, wisdom tradition. A lot of the people who come to the Vipassana practice in the West are tend to be people who read a lot. One of the primary doors to practice here in the West is books. And so kind of wisdom, understanding, insight, intellectual knowledge plays a very important part for people. And wisdom is certainly a very, very important part of Buddhism. Wisdom entails reflection, investigation, trying to see what can I really know for myself here, what can I learn for myself, what are the patterns of my mind or my heart, what are the patterns of interconnectedness with myself and the world around me, what are the really deep truths that are universal. Not just simply the insight into my own particular psychology and my own story, which a lot of people in our circles are seeking, but to go beyond that, what is really the universal experiences, what's the universal truths that if we understand them, they kind of unlock the key for many of the personal aspects of our life. They kind of change the perspective for understanding it. To see very deeply into, in a wise way, into the truth of impermanence and change. To see very deeply into the truth of non-identification, not identifying, not taking something as self-image or self-concepts and this is me and I'm going to defend it at all costs, or I'm going to hold on to it, or I'm going to hold it at bay and push it away. And to look very deeply into the truth of suffering. Buddhism in some sense is one big meditation on suffering, to help us become free of suffering until they're happily, but to see something really true about suffering, about the unsatisfactory aspects of life, so that we can live wisely. We can live with a greater sense of interconnectedness with people and a greater sense of compassion, so we can live from our deepest values and inspirations, so we can have some wise discernment, some of the things that we can do to help us become free of discernment about what the various messages we get from our society, about what the society tells us is important versus what our heart says is really important. So faith and wisdom though need to be balanced. Both of them can be developed and it's possible to find out, you know, to look and say, well how's my faith? You know, maybe it's zero. Maybe you're a good Protestant and so maybe you have a very good faith, that's all you have. Or maybe you're a good Protestant and you don't believe in faith and you just kind of believe in wisdom, you know, just let's just study Buddhism, study and have more and more understanding. videos are supposed to be balanced, faith and wisdom, and if faith is imbalanced then it can be actually, there's too much faith that can be actually be problematic. It lends itself to blind faith, it lends itself to sometimes to a very strong emotional connection to the practice, that lends itself to a lot of swings and rudes, swings of disappointment and acceleration and all kinds of, you know, sinking mind and rising mind. If it's all about wisdom and knowledge and book learning and lists that Buddhism has so many of or just seeing impermanence in and of itself or seeing wisdom, seeing suffering in and of itself without any faith, then it can be very dry sometimes. It can be very aloof and very disconnected to the people around us. I remember when I first started practicing first years of practice, I had some faith, I had some wisdom, but the wisdom wasn't very well balanced and so one of the ways it played itself out was that I would, my wisdom would see how other people were cut up in certain stories and games, mental games and games of self-identification and I could see it, I had the wisdom to see it, but I didn't want to, I just kind of stayed aloof from it. If I had more faith and more inspiration, which is kind of more a heartfelt kind of connection, I think there would have been much more of a compassion for those people, I wouldn't have kept myself so dry and aloof. Practice can seem very dry if all it is is wisdom, but wisdom. Faith I feel is something which is embodied. The idea of being a host means that the whole body becomes a host for our experience. Inspiration, aspiration is something embodied. Faith is something we embody with our body and that's why I think it's so important, the particular posture you take when you sit and meditate. So the posture you take is a posture which allows for a greater embodiment of the practice or to let the body be a container for the practice, let the body be something the practice can work on. Taking a good upright posture, a posture which helps us to be open, to open the heart, to open the body to our experience. As you know when we protect ourselves sometimes we protect ourselves physically, we hunch over and kind of like this. Sometimes sitting in a chair or sitting in a sofa we kind of do a little bit of the same. We might feel relaxed, we might not feel particularly protected, but it actually limits the possibilities of opening that we can do and to sit upright as best we can. And so the chest is a little bit more open and has a potential for opening as we breathe. It's a very very effective and important aspect of meditation practice. It gives a channel for our faith to move. Our faith needs to have channels to move through us and if it doesn't then it causes problems, it gets bottled up. So to have a channel for it, sometimes a physical channel so it can move through us. A physical ability to be open, to let the trust be expressed. Here I am, you know this is a trustful posture to sit this way, posture to sit this way, open. I've worked on people's meditation postures sometimes and happened in this last retreat where someone had been sitting for years like this and she came and complained about a little back pain, a little lower part of back and I went over and adjusted her posture and had her sit up like this and it set, she came back a couple days later and said you changed my life. It was really dramatic for her and she felt so much more open. She didn't know she was closed. She wasn't particularly closed but she felt suddenly so more open and so much more confidence in life by being able to sit upright and straight this way. It also allows the body to relax in a more realistic way, a more deeper way. When the spine is upright and alert, if that's possible for you, that actually allows the shoulders to release and the shoulder blades to go down the back much more easier and the shoulder blades go down the back and the shoulders release. It also again begins to open up this area at the front of the chest which is a nice thing to do. So, undefended. To have so much trust and confidence you can be open to the world in an undefended way. Sometimes you might feel your faith is too great. You feel the swings of elation and disappointment or whatever or blind faith which sometimes leads to a sense of trouble, certain Buddhist circles, when perhaps the faith has been, it's all about faith. I've known situations where people rely too much on a teacher. The only real momentum for their practice was they had tremendous faith in a particular teacher and so they put all their eggs, all their devotion, all their motivation and practice arose out of that faith through that one particular teacher. And then there was a betrayal, some kind of ethical transgression perhaps or maybe not so dramatic as that. And then suddenly the person kind of was, everything was taken away from them. The person had no personal wisdom or understanding to balance their faith and their trust. And if the wisdom is there then there's the wisdom to see clearly what's going on, is the wisdom to see where we have to look when we feel disappointed or betrayed, how we need to kind of handle great difficulties and problems in our life. This is a function of wisdom. So these two can be balanced and both of them can be strengthened. Hopefully with time both of them get stronger and stronger. There's a greater faith that arises, a greater confidence, a greater inspiration, aspiration, but also a greater wisdom that develops through practice. The other two factors closer to the middle are energy and concentration. And energy is effort, engagement. Concentration is stability, focus, continuity of practice through time. And these two are very important. And they're important kind of at the macro level. For example, there has to be some engagement in spiritual practice, otherwise nothing will happen. You have to put yourself, you have to show up, you have to show up on your seat and sit. You have to, you know, spiritual practice is not magic. Some people have this magical thinking about spiritual practice. They kind of have this idea, well, if I just put myself through the motions then something's supposed to happen. I'm supposed to be transformed by the Dharma or something. But we have to apply something. We have to engage and bring something of ourselves to the practice. And again, the posture again expresses that so well. Sometimes again people who kind of just want to receive and want to just kind of relax and practice and not do anything and just kind of, you know, that's often expressed in the posture. The posture they slump, for example. They lean back into a chair and just like for the chair do all the work holding themselves up. But to take a posture which is balanced and upright takes some effort, some energy. And some people who are very tired or stressed don't want to do any more effort. They want to just kind of slump. But in the long term you're better off doing this kind of effort because this kind of effort is renewing. Slumping in a couch is not as renewing as sitting upright. And what we want is renewing energy, not just simply, you know, kind of the kind of relief that comes from unwinding. So to engage ourselves, to bring energy, to bring effort into the practice. So on the macro level it means simply, for example, sitting every day. And sitting every day and doing it in the continuous way, day after day. Concentration has to do with continuity. Effort is bring yourself to do it and concentration is to do it day after day. If you sit for one day and then don't practice for a week and then sit for another day and then don't practice it for two weeks, that's certainly better than not sitting at all. But there's no chance for building of a momentum. And if you say every day, then there's a momentum that begins building. It's kind of like the strength that comes. It's kind of like, you know, not any more mysterious than going to the gym to exercise. You know, if you lift weights perhaps. And if you go lift weights one day for a little while, and then you come back two weeks later and lift them for a little while, and come back three months later and lift them for a little while, you know, you can't really expect that you're kind of building strength that way. But if you come to the gym every day or every couple of days and just kind of have a regular routine you do, then the strength builds with time. So same thing with daily sitting practice. There has to be continuity through time. It depends on the engagement to do it. And then the continuity through time. So that's at the macro level. And that's also true at all kinds of more micro levels. The balance between effort and concentration or continuity. One of the things I found a little bit odd when I initially encountered Buddhist meditation in Southeast Asia is that calm and concentration are considered basically synonymous. And I didn't really think of it that way because I thought maybe concentration, I took it to be hyper-energized, calm, or whatever. But anyway, in Buddhism calm and concentration are considered synonymous. So that means that as we get more concentrated, if that's all that's happening, people tend to get calmer and calmer. And then eventually the mind will get dull, the mind will sink, and you might fall asleep. And certainly experience if you do meditation long enough, you probably have that experience of the mind getting dull and sleepy if you're getting calmer and calmer. And it can be very seductive to follow the path of calm because calm is very pleasant, calm is often a relief, and calm is very soothing. And so people often in meditation are chasing after being soothed or chasing after calm or pleasantness. And that's what I found. And so you start to, some calm begins to settle in, and people lean into it in a sense and kind of go with it, oh yeah, I'm doing it, the practice right now. And then people relax their vigilance, their alertness, and the mind begins wandering off in the daydreams or the mind begins to fall asleep. When that kind of imbalance occurs, then it's very important to bring energy back into the practice and to bring more engagement. And again, one of the beauties about this upright posture, sitting upright and alert, it tends to express a balanced energy. This is not supposed to be a tense posture where you have too much energy, but it's also not a posture of too little energy. There's some proper balance of energy that comes from this kind of posture. If there's too much calm, you need to bring more energy. And probably if you're finding yourself excessive calm in meditation, you're falling asleep, you probably can discern that because your posture is probably getting too slump, kind of lean forward or something. And some people will find that just simply sitting up again can bring energy, the necessary energy back. Sometimes more vigorous mental noting, kind of greater alertness in the mind, kind of investigating more carefully what your experience is, bringing a greater strength and noticing what's happening in present moment will bring more alertness and kind of balance, excessive concentration, excessive calm that might set in. Energy can be too much. We can get restless, we can get kind of agitated, we can get kind of too energized. And then the mind tends to spin off a lot. The body tends to get a little bit tense or restless in itself. And so it's very important that our effort and our engagement isn't too strong either. People who strive a lot sometimes have too much energy. And so sometimes if there's a lot of energy for whatever reason, a lot of agitation, a lot of restlessness, then we need to focus on developing more calm to bring the balance. And one of the ways to developing calm is to do a pure concentration practice. Maybe very simply come back to your breathing and do a very simple mindfulness on your breathing. But as simple as you can, just resting with the breath, letting the breath maybe even soothe you a little bit, kind of just hanging out there moment, breath after breath, breath after breath. And that kind of continuous focus on the breath, for most people, tends to create some calm, tends to bring some a little more calm, ease, or tends to lower the excessive energy that might occur. Sometimes if we're too sleepy or too calm or too dull, maybe sitting practice isn't what your meditation practice should be. But rather you should do walking meditation. For a long time, I always began every sitting practice with a period of walking meditation. And it was actually for what period of my practice? It was like, was it kind of inconceivable that I would just sit down cold and just meditate? I would always kind of do my walking practice first, back and forth. You would build energy, a good kind of good feeling of energy, and build concentration, both of them. And I'd sit down and I have very good energy and very good concentration when I sat. So if I get too slow, but especially if you're really sleepy, do walking meditation for a while. And maybe some of you don't know how, haven't gotten instructions in that. But it's a very wonderful practice. So to ask, to observe and ask the question, you know, how's the balance between energy and concentration at this particular time? And do I need to kind of modify some of them a little bit? Do I need to try to develop a little more concentration here? So I'm continually stay with each breath unwaverly. Do I need to bring more energy into the system? Do I need to apply myself more? The final piece in the middle is mindfulness. And mindfulness is said to be the great balancer. And mindfulness doesn't need something else to balance it. It's said, you can't have too much mindfulness, which is a great relief. So you can just kind of plug away. And mindfulness is a very simple act of recognizing what our experience is in the present moment. It's a noticing, it's a noticing practice, not analyzing, not reflecting about it, not evaluating our experience, but rather just very rarely, very simply, almost like your mind is a mirror. Oh, knowing that let there be some knowing of what's happening in the present moment. Recognizing now I'm breathing in, now I'm breathing out. When I breathe in, knowing there's experience of pressure and expansion. When I breathe out, when I exhale, knowing there's release of the body, there's relaxing, there's movement back into the chest to the abdomen. To recognize actually what's going on moment by moment. To know what's happening to you in the present moment. And as many of you know, it's not so easy to do that because the past and the future seem much more interesting to us, or our fantasies. So a lot of mindfulness practice is about training ourselves to just arrive in the present moment. And sometimes it takes a lot of faith and inspiration to feel that's valuable to do. For some people it's inconceivable that why would anybody ever want to be in the present moment? And for some people it's very frightening to be in the present moment. So it takes a certain amount of faith for some people, a lot of faith, to really entrust themselves to the present moment. And then once we're in the present moment, mindfulness is simply recognizing what are experiences in the present moment. I like to call it a noticing practice. Because it's kind of an unsexy term. Mindfulness has gotten kind of popular. There's always, you know, it's kind of a mindfulness movement all across the country. And you know, it's books on mindfulness and mindfulness this and mindfulness that. And so it's kind of hip maybe, a trendy thing to do, right? But you know, so people ask you, what do you do? I do mindfulness. Oh great, I read that book, you know, or didn't I hear that? Bill Moyer, you know, he's talking about mindfulness. Oh yeah. But if you tell your friends you do a noticing practice, then you don't get any credit. And that's good. Maybe it's good to do a kind of practice that doesn't get much credit from anyone. Just notice. I just notice what's going on. And part of the beauty of mindfulness is that, and part of it, I think it's real power, is that mindfulness in and of itself does not evaluate the experience it's mindful of. It doesn't judge it as good or bad, right or wrong, better or worse. It just simply sees experience as it is in this moment. And for some people, it's phenomenally liberating to begin strengthening that capacity of who they are, that capacity to see experience without evaluating it. Many of us are in constant evaluation of something. How does this relate to me and my concerns? How does this relate to my values? You know, what's right and wrong and all these things. But to stop that incessant kind of evaluation is a relief. And to realize we can have an experience of ourselves, experience of life that is not evaluated, that is not judged right or wrong. To have a taste, for some people, to have a simple taste of a few moments where they existed, without any notion of right or wrong, or success or failure, or praise or blame coming into play. That can be if moments of verified faith, that can really show us a potential possibility that can become more and more part of our life all the time. So faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom, the grammar of meditation practice. I was wondering what the Buddhist philosophy is to dealing with fear in moments when you're noticing it. What do you do with it? You don't have to necessarily evaluate it, but you know it's there. Well, Buddhism is not a... First of all, Buddhism is not a substitute to common sense. So if there's good cause to be afraid, then maybe you should act. But in our culture especially, there's a lot of people who have a lot of fear, a lot of anxiety, that has nothing to do with what's happening in the present moment. In the present moment, there is nothing to be afraid of. And sometimes, for some people, simply learning to pay attention to the present moment, and realizing that actually in the present moment, the present moment is safe, that there's no threat in the present moment, can be a great antidote to their fear. I know it's very important for me, something similar to that, but I realize a lot of things I worried about were in the future. So that was one thing to realize. But then I realized, I noticed, that the future often didn't happen the way I was worried it was going to happen, and that it was a waste of energy to worry. And that was actually very helpful for me. So to learn something about the power of the present moment can give us a very different perspective on our fear. So part of Buddhist training then is to learn to recognize what is happening right now. Then one of the, part of the training of mindfulness is to learn how to look at fear directly. So we stopped, and we actually, the Buddha said that when he practiced before he was enlightened, and fear arose for him, he would always stop and pay attention to it. So his bumper sticker says, you know, I stopped for fear. And there's a lot of things we can learn as we stop for fear, as we start paying attention to it, and not turn away from it, or not act on it. One of the things we can learn is our relationship to fear. And a very important part of mindfulness practice in Buddhist teaching is to pay attention to our relationship to our experience. And we can certainly pay attention to our relationship to fear. There might be resistance, there might be fear of fear, there might be horror of fear, there might be many kind of, all kinds of relationships to fear that are actually complicating it, and actually keeping us really seeing clearly. One of the ways to develop more presence with fear, really see it, and lay less caught up in it, in the details of it, is to experience it as an embodied experience, to feel it in the body. I had a friend of mine, for example, a story I like to tell, who was sitting a long retreat, and he started having a lot of fear during the retreat. And he tried various ways of coping with it, none of them really helped, his fear got worse. And then one day he decided just to feel the fear as something in his body. And he felt it as tightness in his chest. And as soon as he brought his attention to the tightness in the chest, he discovered he had the capacity of being present for his fear without getting reactive to it, without getting spun out by it. So finding a way of grounding ourselves in the body around the fear, for some people, is very, very helpful. In addition, some people will talk about letting the body be the container of fear. So rather than the mind and trying to fix it and worry about it to be the container, let the body be the container, which requires again being in the present moment, and then just feeling it and opening to it and allowing it to be there. One of the fundamental principles of mindfulness practice, you know, if it's okay with common sense, is to let our emotional experiences be there fully, not to resist it, but also not to act on it. And then letting it be there fully, beginning to investigate it. As we investigate it and get to know it better, as we learn to let it be there and feel it and let it be in our body and not be reactive to it and just let it be there, for some people that itself is very liberating. And we talk sometimes in Buddhism that fearlessness which is often a goal of Buddhist practice doesn't mean being without fear, it means no longer being controlled by fear. So fear might still arise, but we're not, you know, caught by it. But we also can sometimes begin seeing more deeply into the fear and sometimes see the causes of the fear. And some of the causes of the fear, once we see them, we see, well, this is not really worth it. Some people are deeply afraid because of their self-image. They're afraid what it's going to do to their self-image self-identity. They're afraid the self-identity is going to be liberated or something. But if you can really see the attachment we have to our self-identity, we might see that that's actually not needed or it may be somewhat artificial. And so sometimes that can kind of pull the rug from underneath the fear, if you can go underneath to the roots of the fear. Is it all helpful? You have, you want to ask something more specific? Um, well, the generica is helpful. I'll be mindful about it. Yes. Sometimes when we're sitting on the whole time we'll have thought after thought, notice, notice, notice them. Very, very active. And then in another sitting I'll sit. Timeless forever. And then another time I'll sit and everything will seem very calm. I will not have noticed the time going by at all. Because we'll just, I will have no sense of time at all. And I'm wondering if there's something about those two experiences. Is there something I can learn about balance that's involved in those two different experiences? Well, I don't know either. I don't know exactly. The, first I'll say this though, that we expect change, we expect our meditation practice to vary from day to day. And that we don't want to get in, because of this talk, we don't want to get into the kind of mode where we're constantly tinkering and manipulating and saying, well, this isn't just quite right now and I'm going to, you know, in measuring every sitting with the last one and saying the last one had better energy and this one has more faith and which one should I balance? And we expect that there's tremendous variation over the weeks and months and days in our sittings. And a very important element of meditation practice is learn to be great, be gracious, be patient to however it is. So there are days where it's, you'll be very restless, then the practice is just be mindful and present for restlessness and not try to make it go away, just, okay, here I am restless. And it's really mindful of that. It's not a evaluative way. Learn how not to react to restlessness with aversion or impatience, just, oh, restless. And other days when they're completely blissed out, serene, you know, and timeless presence, seems like it's, you know, you've finally arrived in the enlightenment of the Buddha. And you don't make any conclusions. You say, oh, this is nice and pleasant, open, present, and this is the way it is now as opposed to, okay, I got it. We latch it on, we get a button we wear and make sure all our friends realize what we've attained. And just, you know, just something else that we're mindful of, a patient of, we continue our noticing practice in the middle of all that. So it's a very important principle is that we just learn how to be present for what's actually happening. But there is a place also where we can go in there, investigate a little bit more, and what's actually happening here, what's going on. And that actually is mostly a matter of you being more observant and observing the cause and effect relationships of your day. For example, if you find yourself very restless in a lot of thoughts, you might review a little bit what your day was like, if you or the last couple of days, maybe there's good cause for you to be restless. Maybe, maybe you've been kind of really harried running around trying to do 10,000 things at once. And when you sit down, the mind's going to be harried still. The mind doesn't just stop cold, you know, the mind carries with it the momentum of how we've been acting through a day. And so sometimes just a matter of recognizing, oh, there's a lot of momentum here. And I just have to kind of accept this and allow it to kind of unwind. Sometimes it might, you might notice that the times when your mind is very busy, that there's very little concentration. And maybe what you can try to do then is to bring more concentration to bear. And then just try to be very diligent and stay with the breath. Kind of imagine there's a, like you're fishing and you have a fishing pole and a line, and you've caught that fish. It's a big fish, really big fish, you know, and the fish is your breath. And your awareness is the line between your mind and the breath. And you always want to keep that fishing line taut. Because sometimes the fish kind of swims closer to the boat. I don't fish, but I've been told this. I never done this, but I've been told when the fish comes close to the boat, you have to keep the line tight so the bit doesn't get loose in the mouth. So called bit. Look, I don't know the fish. And then if, and then with this strong, big fish pulls you away, you have to let go so that line doesn't break. But you want to keep it always taut. So, so if your mind is really restless and you really want to develop concentration, imagine that you're, your mind is a fishing line. You caught the fish of your breath. You know, this fish in your breath. And the breath goes in and out and you just stay, keep that line taut. Just stay really present, not letting any slack going in. That might work, or it might just make you tense. And then if the wonderful experience of kind of a pretty great calm and peace sets in, then you want to be a little bit attentive to that. Be a little bit, little bit suspicious that this is very good, but I've been told this often leads to dullness. So we keep a little bit of, you know, we take a little bit of extra alerts and make sure the mind doesn't sink. Oh, it's beginning to sink. Okay. Bring myself up. It's being the sink more attentive. Being a sink. Okay. A little more effort here. A little more posture. Nancy. What's the, I don't know enough about fishing to know that. Okay. Well, it's lead sinkers. Yeah. Literally tied onto that line as well. To keep it taut. Sometimes. And then, and then walk out. What are they called? Those floats. Well, just use the image then. I mean, sure. So as you imagine, there's a sinker down here. You know, and you're sticking out of the sinker or whatever the float, you know, imagine you're a float in top of the waves and the waves of your breath. And you're just going to kind of let that you're going to be the float that stays right there in each way, going up, whatever. Anyway. Yes. As you were talking about these five faculties, I was remembering the five hindrances. Three of them are remembered seem to correspond, seem to hinder. Each of three of these faculties, it's small, hinders energy, restlessness hinders concentration and doubt hinders faith. What are the other two? And what they did because they probably hinder wisdom and mindfulness. I have this vague idea that I've heard or read somewhere. People making that correlation, but I don't remember it and I haven't given it much thought, but we can maybe go through it and make it up. So you're a great start. I thought so. So faith correlates with doubt and energy correlates with sloth and mindfulness correlates with, but certainly energy correlates with restless concentration, correlates with restlessness and wisdom correlates with. But what's left is desire and aversion, right? So, so, so desire and aversion to mindfulness is that a mindfulness is then to everything. So. Yes, please. One of the things I've noticed is that practice is some changes, which is a good thing. But in terms of balance, often when whenever a problem would arise in my life, you know, at work or a family thing, I would often react or act right away, right out of the emotion, whether it was anger or desire, whatever. And then after I acted, I would often have created more of a mess, you know, that I would then obsess about. And in the obsessing, I would often act again and create even more of a mess. And then if I stopped acting, my brain would then spin it into the future and worry about the past and consider new actions to clean up the previous actions. Have you thought about meditation? Yeah, I was thinking about it. It might be a good idea. But anyway, what I've noticed now is that with a little more balance, I don't act right away. And then when I do act, I feel like I act. I try to think of it as like acting quickly and assertively when I feel like I need to, and then letting go of the result. And, you know, in realizing, you know, that people are not always going to, you know, things are not going to be my way, the world doesn't center around me. And so if I, if something at work, I don't think is right, I'll say, I don't think this is right. I don't think we should be doing it this way. And that's a really wonderful change. And I can only do that because I have a little more balance. Part of this used to be, you know, the hindrances of desire and aversion, you know, sometimes I desire things to go a certain way. And if I desired so much, I identify with it, that I would somehow, I won't be okay unless it goes this way. You know, anyway, it's not really a question. It's not a question, but it's a great report. It sounds like you're getting some very, very significant and important benefits of the mindfulness. I think it sounds, I make it sound better than reality. Well, in that case, just keep it up and it'll get better. Grow into that, grow into your description. Let's take a minute to sit just before we go. So . Next week I won't be here for Thursday. Instead, Carolyn Dilly will come and give a talk. And I'll be here again in two weeks. So thank you all very much for this evening.
