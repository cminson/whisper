The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Okay, great.
So, again, welcome. Welcome to yourself.
Welcome to this moment of being present,
being human and being alive.
So, the topic of this week,
Vedana, as I mentioned,
translated as
feeling tone,
as valence, as
hedonic tone.
It's a very important teaching in Buddhism.
And I would say that
it's a very perceptive teaching. It's a very perceptive teaching
about how being human,
how being human operates, how our perceptions
operate, how being in the world operates.
And there is so much to discuss about it. So, I'm delighted
to be sharing the next five days
exploring this. We could take more time to explore it.
So, let's
let me start by saying that
in the four foundations of mindfulness
teachings, in the Satipattana Sutra,
the four foundations are translated as the four establishments
of mindfulness teaching,
which is very basic. It's one of the most important teachings.
It's where many of the teachings,
many of the instructions are pulled out of.
The four foundations, the first
foundation is the body.
There are six different ways in the Sutra,
in the Satipattana Sutra, to explore the body,
breathing, posture activities, etc.
The second foundation of
mindfulness is Vedana.
And then the third one, just to complete the list,
the third one being mind, ordinary states of mind,
higher states of mind, and the fourth one being
dhammas, or mental objects translated as hindrances, etc.
It's aggregate, sense-fears, awakening factors, noble truth. There's a lot
in the last one.
But Vedana, feeling-tone, this seemingly
simple teaching, it seems like a very, very simple teaching.
It's the shortest Satipattana,
it's the shortest foundation. If you read the whole Sutra,
this section is the shortest. Interesting.
And it seems seemingly the most simple.
And yet, it is profound.
It's so profound that it has its own foundation, right?
It hasn't been tucked in with the body, or the mind, or with the other
foundations. It's a whole tata, it has a whole
foundation, all of this teaching, all to itself. It's that
important. And just to
say, the Buddha in
Anapana Samyutta, the Buddha compares the four Satipattanas,
the four foundations, to four chariots
coming from four directions, and each
scattering a heap of dust at the
intersection. And you can think of the heap of dust
at the intersection as the
delusions, greed, hatred, and delusions.
So each of these four foundations, if you write them
alone, it will take you all
the way to awakening. And yet,
even though each is effective on its own, together,
it's the most effective, practicing all of them together, which is why
for example, we don't just practice breathing
and body, mindfulness of the body and breathing, we also
practice mindfulness of mind, and
being aware of hindrances, etc., etc.
as many of you have been covering with Gail over the weeks.
So, Vedana, feeling tone
also is a very important one, and practicing it
alone, it is said, can take you all the way
and also practicing it together with others, especially.
So, this is
one place where this profound teaching of Vedana
feeling tone shows up, and it shows up in other places
too, but today we'll spend time with this one
as an introduction. So, just to share with
you how it shows up
in the Satipatana Sutta,
and how, and reading from the Sutta translated
by Bhikkhu Analyo, this translation,
and how practitioners does one
in regard to feeling tone
abide contemplating feeling tone.
I'm changing some words, because the word here
use these feelings, but Vedana doesn't
exactly mean feelings, because to our
for us, the word feelings is a little overloaded,
we confuse it with emotions, it's too
complicated, feelings, we think feelings, you know, it's too
hard to break into song, or I break into song.
Whereas feeling tone is so basic, pleasant,
unpleasant, neither pleasant nor unpleasant.
It's very, very simple.
It's a foundational teaching,
just to finish reading this, I'll say it all more in a moment.
So, and how, actually I'll use the word Vedana
because it's okay with you, Vedana, because the word itself
I think really captures whereas feelings, or hedonic tone,
or aloo, there they come around it,
but that's a definition. Perception of pleasant,
unpleasant, neither unpleasant nor unpleasant,
or neutral, we call it. So, to read this paragraph
from the first Satipatana, and how practitioners
does one, in regard to Vedana,
abide contemplating Vedana. Here
when feeling a pleasant Vedana,
one knows, I feel a pleasant
Vedana. When feeling an unpleasant
Vedana, one knows, I feel
an unpleasant Vedana. When feeling
a neutral Vedana, one knows, I feel
a neutral Vedana.
So, this feeling tone, Vedana,
again, it's not emotions, it's not
feelings, it's so much simpler, it's just this
valence associated with every moment
of perception, that every moment of perception
has feeling tone associated
with it. It's actually quite profound
when you start practicing with this,
and when your mind becomes used to noticing
it, for example, throughout the day, you'll
notice how everything that shows up in
your sphere of experience is perceived either as
pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. In fact,
a lot of times
we don't, well, most of the time, well,
if we're not really trained, we don't even notice the pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral
with, and we're all the way into reactivity.
I don't like it, make it go away, or I want more of this
and we never ever notice the beginnings,
we never ever notice that, ooh, subtle
the pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral that was
associated, that the mind
perceives the object to be. And again, when I talk about object
it's sensations, so just as you're sitting
whatever sensation shows up,
maybe it's the breath, maybe it's the sensation of your bottom
on the chair of the cushion, just pause for a moment,
pleasant, unpleasant, or
either, just becoming aware.
And my invitation is, I actually will
say one more thing before I give the invitation for today,
as I'd like to invite you to get your mind swimming
and no disinvading us so that the next few days we can
add more layers to it. But I'll add
one more thing, a couple more things. One is
that as a
basic building block of experience
there's even maybe something similar
in single-celled
organisms where all they do is
kind of notice and move towards or move away
from external
stimuli. And to think of even
single-celled
organisms, they have this very basic,
they have this basic like, oh pleasant, moving towards, a one pleasant, moving
away from. Except that, except that for
us, human beings, we're so much more complicated. And it's
not just about survival and our noticing pleasant, unpleasant,
but there's so many associations. Really
our perception, our
perspective, as you will see in your own
exploration, our perspective shapes how we perceive
something to be pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
Our perception, our perspective
really shapes and forms it in addition to many other things.
So as I trust where you will notice this
week, Vedana, this feeling tone is not inherent in the object.
It's not that a particular sound
is pleasant or unpleasant. My perception makes it so.
But anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself.
So the last thing I want to say
before the invitation is there are two different types
of Vedana mentioned
in the Satipattana Sutta. One is
translated by different translators differently.
Bhikkhu Bodhi translates it as worldly
and unwordly, worldly and unwordly. And the wordly
basically is the feeling tones of
sense of the
six-body, six doors, the six doors.
And the
unwordly is, so basically
these are really being, be clear. So there are
three wordly and three unwordly. So the wordly
is also translated by other
translators, by actually Gil likes to translate it as
of the flesh. So kind of what you
sense physically in your experience, pleasant, unpleasant, neutral,
sounds are pleasant or unpleasant, or thoughts,
especially thoughts, notice thoughts are pleasant, unpleasant, neutral.
So that's the wordly, or of the flesh,
or what I prefer is hedonic. So the hedonic
category, there are three. And then there is the unwordly
with Bhikkhu Bodhi's translation, or not of the flesh
with Gil's translation. And how I like to relate to it is the
Udamanic, Udamanic, which relates
to these internal states. So when you sit
and you practice, so these are born from within,
kind of born of the mind, not of the experiences.
So when you're sitting and you're in meditation and there's a sense of
delight, calm arises,
pleasant Vedana, that
is that category, the category of unwordly,
not of the flesh, Udamanic. It's kind of what arises
in meditation. The question always comes up, okay,
the pleasant we know, there's plenty of pleasant in meditation. What's the unpleasant?
And the sutta says that has to do with
the wanting to practice, but not being able to not having
the circumstances. That's the frustrated desire
for practice can give rise to
unpleasant, unworldly, or Udamanic
Vedana. Anyway,
I think there was more there, but I'll just leave it at that. I don't want to go
to overtime. Okay, so
so dear ones,
so my invitation for today
is to notice
Vedana. Again, not make it forceful, but as you're going through
today and you are
thinking about something,
okay, is this thought, what's the valence of it?
Is it pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral? Oh, unpleasant.
I'm not wondering why I'm feeling so tight. You can start to see
all these valences, all these feeling tones
everywhere in your field of experience and you'll start to
notice more and more things about it, I bet, today. So that's
the invitation. Again, not go out and look for it, but just
be curious about it as it
comes to you to notice that every experience,
every experience as we talk more about
has Vedana affiliated with it. It's
astounding when you start to see it. It's both
fun and wild and eye-opening. So
oh, and here's an invitation also. If you
start to notice things and you start to have things that
you've never noticed before and you'd like to share them, you're welcome
to share them. You can send me an email
if you wish through my website
which is nickymergafori.com on the contact
page. You can send me an email address. You can send me an email
if you wish to share your observations today and
tomorrow I will share a handful with the Sangha because the chat
is a little unwieldy for me to keep track of in real time tomorrow.
But if you'd like to share a few
if something, an observation
comes up for you that you'd like to share with the Sangha today, like, wow, I
didn't notice, then that'd be lovely.
Let's practice together. I so look forward to spending
this week together, dear ones. So
blessings, blessings to all of you.
Wishing you freedom,
goodness, and
ease. Take good care.
Thank you.
