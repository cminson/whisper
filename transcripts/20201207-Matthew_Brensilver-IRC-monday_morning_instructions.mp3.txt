I'll say a few words before guiding a sit and yeah, you can just take it in in whatever
way.
It fits right into the guided sit, but just before joining the call, I was having the
sense of that meditation is it's so many things.
There's so many ways that goodness accrues on this path.
So meditation is a way of deeply resting, of taking refuge, of letting go of vigilance,
finding shelter.
It is a way of understanding ourselves, our personalities, our habits, more and more deeply.
It is a cultivation of many different aspects of the heart, these very beautiful qualities
of the heart that can be obscured by our entanglement with dukkha, with suffering.
And meditation is a clarification.
It helps us actually clarify, meaning have a higher resolution picture of our inner life.
It helps us distinguish between this most fundamental distinction on this path between
suffering and freedom, suffering in the absence of suffering.
It helps us distinguish between pleasure and satisfaction.
There's so much that we learn that we can learn about experience.
Meditation helps us develop steadiness, samadhi, concentration, the gathering, the unification
of the mind, the kind of healing relief that comes with that.
Meditation also shows us what we're obsessed with.
And so we plant that flag at the breath or the body or sound or somewhere.
There's some kind of meditation anchor often, and then we get to see all the places we venture
out to look for safety or security or pleasure.
It is a path of letting go.
It shows us how to let go, what's left in the wake of letting go.
Meditation is a path of habituating to the compulsive forces of dukkha within us.
The ways in which we are compelled by the forces of suffering, by greed, hatred, delusion.
And meditation exposes our heart to all of that such that we become desensitized to them.
Their impelling force does not act on our heart in the same way.
We are, in other words, less intimidated by the forces of suffering within us and don't
act out their dictates in the same way.
Meditation is an exploration of what it feels like to be a person, to be me, to have an
identity.
Meditation is simply the practice of renunciation, of discipline, developing tolerance, nothing
more than that.
Meditation is an encounter with our mortality and the changingness, the inevitability of
loss.
Meditation is a way of practicing freedom, literally practicing it, as one might practice
a jump shot in basketball, or practicing freedom, experimenting.
So meditation is all of these things and more.
And in considering that, then the question arose for me, how on earth do I guide this
sit?
The answer to that is I don't know, but much of the goodness of what I'm charting out here
unfolds no matter what technique we're practicing.
And we don't have to do all of this ourselves.
We don't have to do this to our experience.
We just do the practice with our full heart, with our sincerity.
And the goodness accrues on its own.
Maybe let time be our ally, as one of my teachers says.
So finding a way of posture that feels sustainable, maybe you're already there.
Maybe there's a subtle adjustment that feels right.
we settle into stillness and quiet.
Let me just look, what are the connotations of silence for you right now, how does it
feel to settle in?
What inside you feels free and what is bracing?
What's yourought feeling at the moment?
Or your sleep?
And what?
Whatever can be relaxed.
The area around the eye is your jaw.
Letting your whole face be soft.
We're so identified with our face.
But it's just another part of the body that can be relaxed.
Let your shoulders just hang loosely.
Hang loosely.
Bring some love to your belly.
The tension, self-consciousness, just let it drain down.
Just soften your belly.
Letting your whole face be soft.
Letting your whole face be soft.
Letting your whole face be soft.
Letting your whole face be soft.
These subtle currents of clinging that kind of sneak in the back door.
We relax something and then clinging sneaks in.
We're not trying to banish all tension. Whatever tension remains, just allow it to remain.
But to let go is to make a kind of peace with the imperfection of the moment.
From the basis of that truce.
We can practice.
We can practice.
We can practice.
We can practice.
We can practice.
We can practice.
We can practice.
Admit this relaxation, this surrender, this willingness to feel this truce with the human condition.
We feel our body.
The buzzing and the blooming, the collapsing of sensations,
the field of body sensations.
For these minutes we hold that field in awareness.
Sometimes it seems like the field of sensation arises within the space of awareness.
Sometimes it seems like we pour the awareness into the sensations.
We're constantly maintaining intimacy with the field of sensations.

Within the field of body sensations, sometimes the sensations of breathing become prominent.
The enlivening effect of the inhale.
The ripple of soothing sensation on the exhale.
Often skillful to find a place to anchor the attention.
Maybe the sensations at the mouth or nostrils, the rise and fall of your belly.
Maybe you anchor the attention on the whole body, the sensations of breathing detectable across the whole body.
We just gently offer our attention, not as a kind of transaction.
We just offer up our attention.
With that attention, we express our care for our life.

We make our heart mind available to the sensations of breathing, the basic aliveness, this moment.
