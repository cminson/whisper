I'll offer just a very few words to support settling in, starting by taking in how you are in this moment, just opening to how the body is, without judgment, without resistance, without holding on to anything. 
Just how are you? How's the body? How's the mind? And seeing if there can be just an allowing of how you are. 
Sometimes as we become aware of what's already happening, we've not been fully aware of it and we become aware of it. 
Sometimes there can be a little bit of a shift or some space connected with what's here, if it's a little bit of a struggle, and if it's something lovely or uplifting, sometimes it can brighten the mind to actually become aware of it. 
So just taking in how you are and noticing if being aware of it, with an allowing stance, has an effect. 
Then recognizing that we are sitting here and connecting to the present moment with intention, remembering that it can be really helpful to see if there can be some relaxation of body, relaxation of mind. 
Maybe scanning through the body and just checking in. 
Or might there be tension? Can it be softened? Can it be relaxed? Sometimes we can consciously relax parts of the body when we notice there's tension. 
And sometimes we can kind of just play with this too, seeing if there can be in this light, gentle scanning through the body when there's an acknowledgement of a place that may be a little tense. 
There's some tension. 
And what happens as that tension is met with that gentle awareness? Sometimes bringing that kind of soft, friendly attention can allow there to be a releasing, not a releasing that we're consciously doing, but when that happens because the tension is held, it's not resisted, it's not squeezed on, it's just known. 
Sometimes that kind of awareness can very naturally create the conditions for releasing that tension. 
Not always, just exploring that possibility. 
And then ask the body and mind maybe have a little more relaxation. 
Opening to whatever is obvious, whatever is most naturally known, whatever, is naturally already aware of perhaps having the stance of receiving experience rather than choosing what to attend to, settling back and seeing what wants to be known, what wants to be seen, what wants to be attended to. 
Receiving experience. 
Sometimes what wants to be known or what's already, most easily known is something very specific, a particular body sensation or sound, the mood or a thought. 
And sometimes what is kind of most wanting to be known is something more vague, a sense of being or ease or agitation perhaps, not a specific precise experience but much more of a diffuse experience. 
Knowing that kind of diffuse experience is much easier when the mind is more relaxed, receptive. 
It's hard to pin it down. 
And for some of you it may be more natural or easeful rather than stepping back and being out of the driver's seat, just receiving. 
For some of you it may feel more easeful to pick something simple like the breath or the body and allow the attention to kind of land there and if that feels more easeful for you, please explore that landing with that area of experience. 
And then maybe you can explore receiving that experience, receiving the breath or receiving the body. 
In our mindfulness practice we are opening to this present moment's experience and there's so much happening in the present moment. 
It's fine to pick a particular section of the present moment experience and it's fine to open and just receive from a broader field of attention. 
In this particular case we are exploring, being aware of being alive in this moment. 
Exploring being aware of the only thing we can ever be aware of. 
What's happening right now?.
