The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

I want to talk this morning with you about a philosophy of emptiness and a practice of attention.
For those of you when I do see some familiar faces who were at the workshop yesterday,
as I said, I hope going over some of the same ground, not exactly the same,
will be helpful and reinforce it rather than tedious, but we shall see.
If we start with emptiness, just the bare word, what does it mean to us?
And I'm sure all of us would have answers, many of which will be different.
I think particularly with the English, the word in English,
our first thought is kind of a lack, an existential angst.
What is interesting I think is how we respond to that perceived lack.
And that I think is where a philosophy of emptiness comes in.
A philosophy of emptiness is very far, I think, from lack.
We find philosophies of emptiness really start with Taoism and Buddhism
with a non-dual approach to life which starts from the intertwining of being and non-being
of emptiness and fullness in a way that I think our Western philosophies lack.
I think in the West we have always had philosophies of presence
in which absence, which emptiness just denotes lack.
Someone yesterday gave me a wonderful question which was,
was there a link between the kind of existential lack of a needing something
and the emptiness, a philosophy of emptiness that I was talking about
and she came up with her own wonderful answer which was that the distinction lay in the existence
or the non-existence of connection because if emptiness is a part of fullness
there is connection, there is interconnection with everything that is
in which case emptiness becomes suchness, in the lack of that connection there is isolation.
So it was a wonderful answer which I'm profoundly grateful to.
You know, I think emptiness, just the word is probably problematic
because it does denote lack to us.
The word in Sanskrit, sunyata, which is the basis of a philosophy of emptiness
denotes hollowness as of a seed so it also carries ideas of potential within it
which I think our word lacks.
Sometimes I think openness is a nicer word than emptiness
but emptiness is the one that's always been translated so there we are.
I have just come from many years floating around in emptiness I guess
having just finished a book called the philosophy of emptiness.
And it's very strange but the origin of the book began in some ways one of the emptiest places
not very far from the Grand Canyon, in a very deserted cafe on a Sunday
in a deserted sort of mall plaza in the sort of high desert country of the Navajo Nation.
I picked up a Wi-Fi cafe which was why I was there.
I picked up an email from a friend in England who had passed on to me a request from a publisher
saying did he know of anyone who might be interested in writing a book on a philosophy of emptiness.
It was a very strange email to get in those circumstances but having been accused years earlier
by the supervisor of my doctoral thesis of an obsession with emptiness
it felt like a sort of call I couldn't refuse.
And again two nights before the drive out into this amazing space somewhere near Lake Powell
I've been in Las Vegas which it possibly seems to me sort of man's greatest monument
to the avoidance and fear of emptiness.
A sort of oasis of noise and light and neon and crowds and streaming waters
in what would and perhaps otherwise should be a geographic emptiness.
And the night sky that in the desert revealed against the darkness more and brighter stars
than I think I've ever seen in my life and a milky way that really illuminated its name
in Vegas had been absolutely invisible behind the neon and the headlamps, Las Vegas or the desert.
I think it's really too neat a kind of metaphor for the different responses to emptiness
but I think you know where I'm going.
You know on the one hand emptiness is a lack to be filled quickly with distraction.
On the other feeling this kind of horror and the vacuity of mindless agitation
to see the potential of space for clearing the mind and by paying careful attention
discovering the complexity and the beauty that exists in desert clarity.
I found two amazing quotes from contemporary writers which I want to read to you
because they express these sort of paradoxical aspects of the desert.
This is the first.
Increasingly however it is the sunscorched emptiness of the desert
a place that is once pre and post historic that exerts a hold on us.
Don de Lilo described the desert as a container for emptiness
and in a world stripped of transcendental values we are drawn increasingly into that vacuum
and from the other perspective.
But desert space is always a listener.
It's only voice acquired so unbroken it hushes you thereby making you fit to enter in.
How delicious to listen and be no one at all
and no one brimful and emptiness who has become what there is.
Perhaps tellingly the first quotation is out of a metropolitan Londoner.
The second that of one who spent days in solitary exploration of uninhabited regions.
I think those who live in the desert or the wilderness
and play close attention to the surroundings of which they consider themselves a part
those who live close to the land see emptiness differently from us in the urbanized west.
The Native American Luther Standing Bear once said there is no such thing as emptiness in the world
and similarly a testimonial from the world view of the co-ucon of northern Alaska
declares there is no emptiness in the forest, no inward solitude.
Such philosophy arises directly I believe from attentive experience
and it's probably helpful if it's of natural land.
Later on much of the writing of the book was carried out a little bit north of here in California
in winter in a hillside garden that often on winter mornings looked out into nothing but mist.
It often seems suitably like living within a Chinese scroll ink painting
and I think this is perhaps a better metaphor for as I said the first Las Vegas or the desert is too neat
and as I discovered through the writing the process of emptiness and fullness is more complicated
more a misty intertwining than an either or.
Emptiness is form, form is emptiness.
For while the word emptiness as I've said would seem to point to lack
philosophy of emptiness points to something different to another emptiness
that is empty of essence, definition, limit, necessity but not empty of existence.
It is an emptiness that is both potential and reality
and leads us I think back to our experience indefinable, un-totalizable, unfolding.
For I think it's helpful to think of emptiness not as a nest, not as a verb, not as a noun
and it has nothing to do with nothing but rather to think of it as a verb as an emptying out.
It is an experience I believe of the infinite movement of things
of world-worlding, undefinable, beyond expectation, beyond position, definition, privilege
but not nothing.
I think it is a different and alternative way of seeing an understanding
and I think it has a contemporary importance and relevance which I shall come back to
but I want to return a little to Buddhist teachings and Buddhist understandings of emptiness
and I'm going to go quite quickly here but early Buddhism speaks mostly of the emptiness of the self.
We have the three marks of existence, impermanence, suffering, views of self
and I think we could almost say that the suffering expressed in the first truth of the Buddha
which we are asked to know thoroughly is the ordinary existential feeling of lack.
So much of our suffering comes from feelings of lack.
It is to be known.
And as expressed in the second truth is our ignorant misperception of the world around a core of self
and a desire for permanence which is to be rejected.
And then the possibility of liberation and the path to it are the potential
and the path of a philosophy of emptiness which is to be embraced.
It is the philosophy, the wisdom, the mindfulness, the attention that both lets us see the emptiness of things
and lets us understand them and live better in that knowledge.
So early Buddhism gives us lots of models of the self, all of which are models of interdependence.
Central I think is the model of dependent arising which in its very earliest and easiest and simplest form
is when this exists that comes to be, when this goes out of being, that goes out of being.
But it is a model of interdependence and all the models we get of self,
all those endless models of 3s and 5s and 6s and 9s and 12s that sort of can drive you mad
are all to desolidify the self, to help us to see it as a process of selfing,
a process of becoming rather than a solid self.
I think suffering both from the dharmic perspective and from a psychotherapeutic one
comes when we identify with a very solid sense of self which doesn't allow us to change,
which rubs up against the impermanence of the world.
There's a lovely story I got out of some psychotherapy book which said that,
it may have been a dharma book but someone, a practitioner was saying,
he had problems with not self, the idea of not self and his little child said,
but daddy, if I had a solid self, how would I ever grow up?
Out of the mouths of children, etc.
Later on in the Mahayana, this emphasis on not self of early Buddhism
expands into the not self of all phenomena.
Again, it is not non-existence.
The other side of the coin, if you think of emptiness as a coin with one side is emptiness,
the other side is dependent origination, the interdependence of all things.
Things are empty.
They are empty of essence, of permanence, of singularity
because they are dependent upon causes and conditions,
because of the interdependence of parts and holes,
because of designation put onto them by language, by custom.
So, some quite deep philosophical texts of the Mahayana
talk about emptiness in terms of, or essence in terms of its unfindability.
And if early Buddhism and the Buddha's first sermon
offered us a path the middle way between complete renunciation and luxury,
the middle way of the Mahayana makes a path between eternalism,
things exist eternally and absolutely, and nihilism, nothing exists,
a non-dual middle path.
There are different interpretations of emptiness.
I'm not going to go into that there, but there is the very Madhyamika,
the emptiness of emptiness, a self-emptying concept,
where we get Nagarjuna's admonition how the emptiness is a snake
and is dangerous, and to mishandle a snake will bite you
as mishandling the concept of emptiness.
And indeed, emptiness like everything else in that other
central Buddhist teaching may be grasped.
And if we grasp it, that is an error.
But then there is another understanding of emptiness
which becomes very like the understanding of original mind
that is more positive.
And I think came out of teachings of people who thought
had deep meditative experience and felt that the Madhyamika
exposition of emptiness was possibly a little bit too intellectual
or a bit too empty for some people
and they wanted to give people a more positive teaching.
So there are some teachings which you will find in various schools
of other schools of Tibetan Buddhism and in Far Eastern Buddhism
that give a slightly more positive spin on it.
So I think that's probably all I'm going to say
of the Buddhist philosophy of emptiness,
which is by far the most central.
If you Google a philosophy of emptiness,
you will actually come across millions of answers.
I plowed my way through about the first 15 pages
and I would say 99% of them refer to Buddhism.
The other locus for a philosophy of emptiness is of course Taoism
which then went on and deeply influenced Far Eastern forms of Buddhism.
And there I would say in a way it's not quite as,
it's more poetic I think, more foundational
and it's not been worked out as well as all the later commentators
and the Indians and the Tibetans did with the Buddhist philosophy of emptiness.
You will find traces, and this was really exciting for me
that I didn't know they exist,
but there were traces of emptiness in the Greeks,
in Hellenistic Greeks from Heraclitus,
in Pre-Socratics, in Stoics, Epicurean,
and particularly Peronian skeptic philosophy.
All sorts of exciting things about emptiness
that really you would have thought were Buddhist.
But then in the West with the rise of Christianity
and the Greek philosophies that were taken on board wholesale in the West
were those that kind of sat reasonably with Christianity
and we have philosophies of presence,
philosophies of the law of the excluded middle
or rather a logic of the law of the excluded middle
and you lose any, I would say, resonance of emptiness in Western writing
except for a few traces in Christian mystics.
There is a difference in there is usually a God or a Godhead
at the back supporting their understanding of emptiness
and there are some wonderful poetic writings in some of the mystics
that sing of emptiness.
And then I think you get some of the romantic poets
also in talking of the sublime,
but really historically the West has taken the path of philosophies of presence
to which the alternative is only absence.
So in the beginning of the modern period and into the post-modern
when the certainties,
sorry,
not much better on this here, I think it's glasses and hair,
when the certainties began to break down
there's not a lot of place for philosophies of presence to go
but absence and emptiness as lack.
And we see so many of the certainties of earlier times being challenged.
Nietzsche proclaimed the death of God, evolution,
attacked creationism.
We have indeterminacy, we have the unconscious.
So many, all many, many, many certainties over the years
were chipped away at.
So in philosophy we see the breakdown of systems.
You see a turn towards existence rather than essence.
Phenomenology tries to return philosophy to the lived world.
We see deconstruction.
We see dependence, how much of what we believe is dependent on language and on custom.
Science has particularly chipped away at the certainties.
Indeterminacy, uncertainty, quanta, black holes, string theory,
all present us with a world that is absolutely very far from that of our daily experience.
Even though we know of this, we still live almost according to the old certainties.
And it's difficult.
Someone once gave me a lovely example of a table, a quantum physicist writing on a table.
She knows the table is full of holes and space and particles doing all sorts of strange things
which cannot be described but you still use it to write upon.
But it chips away.
And the field of the arts, the artists are those I think who articulate change before the rest of us.
They've always been those who help us to see the world anew.
And in all the arts you see the breakdown of forms, you know, cubism, abstract art, conceptualism.
Art came out of the frame.
Theatre came out of behind the proscenium arch.
The audience, more and more these days, is invited to be included in the experience.
You know, I just want to give you two quintessential examples.
And they both link with John Cage.
One is his amazing piece of non-music, you know, 4 minutes 33 at which he had an audience sit in silence.
As someone came and opened the piano and sat there.
Because, of course, silence is not silence.
Silence is full of sound.
And he was inspired by the white paintings of Robert Rauschenberg,
of which he described them as airports for shadows and particle.
Every time you pass them, the light is different, you see it differently.
The white is different, you pick up something you hadn't seen before.
So I think the Western response to the lack of presence is absence.
And ideas of emptiness, I think, can offer us an alternate path and be really helpful.
There is a lovely synologist, a French writer called François Julien,
who talks of Western philosophy as having this either-or, this logic of either-or, of absence or presence,
in contra-distinction to which he talks about the Chinese logic of the breath, the in-breath and the out-breath.
One leads on to, implies the other.
It's not an either-or.
And I think this helps us to give us a path, a way to walk forwards within uncertainty.
So the philosophy of emptiness needs, I think, a practice of attention.
And that practice in the beginning shows us how ourselves and all phenomena actually exist, compounded, constructed, processual,
and then how best to live with such knowledge.
We know now of experience dependent neuroplasticity of our brains,
and what we constantly, consistently pay attention to becomes instantiated in our brains.
If then we are creatures of habit, I think it behoves us to choose our habits carefully.
And I think practices of attention are central to revision, to pay attention to what is not obvious,
to space rather than form, to silence around sound, to process rather than substance
and attention to the process of attention itself, not just to its content, to being not doing,
which is, of course, what you've all been doing here this morning.
And I think the need for this is shown by the incredible popularity of mindfulness in so many different spheres of life now.
So I just want to say that I discovered in a dialogue between two philosophers,
an American Richard Rorty and an Italian Gianni Vattimo, on the future of religion.
I came across this.
There are no facts, only interpretations.
The end of the meta-narratives is not the unveiling of a true state of affairs in which the meta-narratives no longer are.
It is, on the contrary, a process of which, given that we are fully immersed in it and cannot regard it from outside,
we are called upon to grasp a guiding thread that we can use in order to project the further development
that is to remain inside it as interpreters rather than objective recorders of facts.
I think emptiness may be a valuable guiding thread.
In the words of Stephen Batchelor, who may have spoken to you here, I think,
he speaks of the emptiness of necessity and the embrace of contingency.
Understanding and exposing the emptiness of foundations and of substance, solid substance,
yet allied to the practice of attention, illuminating interdependent reality.
I think this may encourage presentation rather than representation
and guiding us back to enhanced experience, embodied, embedded, and connected.
So thank you very much.
If anyone has any questions and would like to discuss that,
I think there's sort of a tiny bit of time remaining.
Thank you for the talk.
I really enjoyed that and gave me lots to think about.
Near the end, you had a list of things that we should pay attention to,
process versus products, I think, being instead of doing.
Could you repeat the rest of them?
I think I said something about the space around form, the silence around sound,
and then it was process rather than substance.
Attention to attention itself rather than always its content.
I think our education fills us with content, but rarely spends time on attention itself.
I said in the workshop yesterday that there was a wonderful exhibition in London
a couple of summers ago that was called Invisible Art of the Unseen.
It was full of emptiness.
It was wonderful.
It was after I'd finished my book, but I think I'd put in a little bit about it.
In it, the curator had written a paper about it in which he said wonderfully,
said this show is a challenge to the complacency of the scene.
I thought this was such a wonderful phrase.
I think emptiness is a challenge to the complacency of the scene, of the hard, of the obvious.
I think we all fall and our culture helps us to fall into that complacency.
If you look at a Chinese painting, the space is as often as important as the marks.
You look at a haiku, one twiddly little three lines around space,
and it has the space, the experience space as well as just that on the page.
I think it's the non-obvious.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Can you hear me?
It's just coming through.
Is this on?
That's right. You have to hold it very close.
I think you kind of approached this toward the end of your talk,
but I think often about the potential of emptiness.
That's how I kind of feel that it's a potential, which is kind of like potency.
It's a powerful idea.
It's there ready to suck in whatever you need.
I think you're absolutely right.
I really hope my book is a challenge to the idea of emptiness as lack
and to see emptiness as fullness.
It was interesting.
When I began, I asked some of my friends,
hey, what does emptiness mean to you?
One of my friends said something to be filled,
which I think is often a fairly normal response.
Then I asked two friends who are artists,
one a sculptor, one a painter, and they both came.
Oh, it's space to create.
It's space to think in.
As I say, it's often artists who pick up things and articulate them before us.
I mean, I was delighted, but I agree with you entirely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This is a big question and just answer it in whatever way you like.
How do you apply these concepts to psychotherapy?
I'm sure it's a huge realm, but pick out a few things if you don't mind.
It's a huge one.
I fear that in psychotherapy what you usually meet is the emptiness of lack.
Now, interestingly, the lady's question that I talked about earlier in the workshop yesterday,
she was a psychotherapist and said how she was meeting the lack as loss
as something necessary, and she came up with that wonderful thing
about the link between the two being connection or lack of connection.
How do you work with it in psychotherapy?
I think you work with through attention.
And I think, I'm not sure this is a very good answer,
but you are trying to help as a therapist, you're trying to help the client become,
expand their awareness and see the patterns of reaction
and try to open up a little space to see that they need not always follow the same pattern,
but you're always working on that little chink of opening up more choice
so you have a response rather than a reaction, so you're working in awareness.
I think you have the emptiness, or maybe it's something that the therapist,
I would like to think holds within them that feeling of potential,
that emptiness of necessity, that feeling of connection,
and they may hold that in that space, which is a safe space for the client, the patient, to come
and bring all the stuff they can't bring somewhere else, so there's an emptiness there that is welcoming.
I think that's probably the very heart of therapeutic work.
And I think sometimes it is the job of the therapist, or maybe always, to hold that potential,
to hold the feeling for the client that you are not just that,
for someone who is stuck in the misery and in the lack, I know you are more than that.
Maybe you can't see it at this moment, so okay, it's my job to hold it for you,
and to work together is for me to hand that back to you.
That's really, I think, all I can say. Thank you.
So you just answered this guy's question.
You talked to two different people and asked them to describe emptiness,
and one of them said it's something to be filled,
and the other one said it's something to create things in.
That sounded like the same answer to me twice,
and you presented it as if they were profoundly different.
Really good. That's a really good thing.
Yeah, you got me.
Thank you.
You're right.
Judgment. It's interesting.
I was thinking, thoughts coming in as I was sitting.
Yeah, judgment.
If I were in Las Vegas or the desert, should I say that?
It's exposing my judgment of Las Vegas, you know?
And I think that's the same judgment I brought to that one.
Because I think we live in a culture that encourages us to fill all emptiness
with consumer, with consumption, and silence, you know, oh my God,
I must have the radio on.
Silence. It's often evasion.
So I think evasion is the answer, and you're right, that answer wasn't.
And I was judging my friend in a way that was not nice, so thank you.
But I did see it as a, yeah, it shows my thing, you know, creation is good,
other consumption is bad.
I'll work on that one, but thank you.
That was not the answer.
So what did you expect?
You can tell me after. Sorry, maybe.
It's not a question. I'm just remembering that there was a quote from a Native American
who said, the white man is afraid of silence.
I just want to share that.
Thank you. I think that's a wonderful thing to end on, and I think it's profoundly true.
Thank you all very much.
