 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodorma.org. You're arriving with yourself remembering just the simple remembering of connecting to being in this place at this time. I often will take a few moments to just kind of let myself, almost like a feeling of gathering, let the mind and body collect together the simple sense of sitting and knowing that I'm sitting, breathing and knowing that I'm breathing. Not trying to force a staying or holding on to any particular experience, but just a gentle allowing the mind and body to remember to come together. I find this supported by relaxation. This also can be helpful as a way to begin. Just checking in and seeing if the body, the physical body is holding tension and allowing it to soften and relax if there is tension. You could do this systematically through scanning through the body. Or perhaps just holding the body more generally and perhaps just dropping in the intention or the request. Maybe the body can relax and see what happens. Maybe the body can relax. Maybe the mind can relax. Maybe the mind can soften around worries or concerns, a feeling of tension or tightness in the mind often connected with worries and concerns. Maybe the mind can relax, just setting aside for now or reason concerns. Perhaps reminding ourselves, reminding yourself that this practice of connecting with yourself here and now is a great support for navigating life, navigating worries and concerns. And so let it give yourself that opportunity, that gift to take this time to connect with how you are in this moment. That's the next piece I often find useful at the beginning of a practice is to having kind of landed with myself to check in. What's up? How am I in this moment? In a broad sense. And seeing if there can be an allowing, the holding of how you are. Where you are. Perhaps acknowledging that, oh, I'm like this right now. Tired, sleepy, frustrated, calm, whatever it is. Just what's here. There's no need to hold on to any particular experience. Just having acknowledged how you are, it's useful to have that recognition or understanding of kind of the background of how you are and to have a sense of feeling into that. If you haven't had that connection, it's very easy for that to kind of begin to pull us out of mindfulness. So with that kind of sense of this is how I am, you can open to just whatever feels most obvious or clear in your experience. Maybe something connected with how you are, but it also could be a sound or another body sensation. Also allowing how you are and also aware that there are other things that the attention recognizes that the attention knows. And some of you may find it more restful or simpler at the moment to recognize how you are and connect with some particular area of experience like the breathing. Or perhaps a sense of the whole body sitting here or maybe the experience of hearing. And connecting gently to that, but not trying to avoid or push away that broader sense of how you are, like understanding, yes, there's breathing and this feeling. Or these body sensations and this sense of how I am. It can sometimes be useful to have a sense of foreground and background of experience where perhaps whatever is most obvious is the foreground or the attention to the breath is the foreground of experience. But there's also the connection with this broader sense of how you are in the background. So no need to try to really hold onto the background, but also just a gentle, not trying to push it away either, so a gentle allowing. So panel members. You Mind will drift off into thought into thinking at some point And at some point also the attention will return Mindfulness will return in that moment See if you can be curious about What it feels like to have mindfulness come back It's that sense of Illumination of experience Kind of like a light comes on in a room and we can now see the things in the room Mindfulness returning allows us to see what's happening to feel what's happening So kind of a curiosity or an interest in that Experience of awareness Just gently We will become aware of something with that might be thinking might be hearing a body sensation And so there's the awareness and there's the what we're aware of I'm just recognizing that And then also I think useful checking in how you are again in this broader way Acknowledging what's here And that's useful to do after the mind has wandered especially if it's wandered into something kind of active or charged because That can shape how we are Can change behind the scenes without our noticing that things have changed That kind of background sense of how we are So noticing that And then reconnecting to just this simple practice of being with our experience Moment after moment You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You
