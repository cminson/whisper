 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning and a good day, everyone. I'm here a little early to just test out the sound and see how the sound to you. I see some chat messages for those who are here a little early. Thank you. So for those of you who can hear me, if you don't mind, just let me know. Thank you, Rick. Good. I appreciate it. Okay. I've been doing some sound and maneuvering yesterday and hopefully they'll stay good for today. Good morning, everybody. It is so nice to see the chats on our YouTube channel here. And so if there is any issue in the middle of our session with the sound, please don't hesitate to let me know. I will keep an eye on the chat also. And hopefully you all remember to speak a little louder. My voice does drop when we meditate. Thank you. Thank you. Very nice. And I have a sense that kind of imagining myself in the IMC meditation hall or the outside community hall and kind of greetings to you all. And to you all from everywhere. This is quite something. And for those of you who like to begin with your meditation and feel free to just allow yourself to arrive, take a few moments and then we'll begin in just a few minutes. Just like those people who come to IMC often, some people come early, find their cushions and cheers and sit down and some would offer greetings to others. Enjoying the company. And so it's very nice. Imagine yourself being in this way, meeting with others. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hello everyone. Welcome you all for our 7am Pacific time meditation and a little format. So we'll begin momentarily. So I do hear that someone is still pointing out my sound may still be a little, I will try to speak a little louder today is being conscious of it. It may still have somewhat of a high ceiling so it may have a little bit of actually effect here. Good morning everyone. My name is Ian, Ian Chen, so I'll be offering meditation and Dharma today. So began again with this arriving sequence that I shared about yesterday. The arriving sequence that I learned from Dana Di Poma to Ari Sala and Philip Moffitt. And so arriving sequence contains three components arriving, arriving here and now, and making ourselves available. We avail ourselves to this moment, and then aligning aligning with a wholesome intention. And so this is what we will do. See if there's any other thing I can do on my end about the sound of how we began. My microphone is actually right in front of my computer, I tried a few different microphones yesterday. None of them seem to work as well as the computer microphone so see if there's a little more that I can do here. Yeah, for some people, the sound seems to be okay and for others to sound seem to have a little challenge here. Okay, so thank you. Thank you for your. Yeah, thank you for letting me know. Okay. All right, I think we're going to begin just as is. And I'll be mindful about my sound. And so today, we'll go over this arriving sequence again. And to familiar ourselves with this sequence as we began the meditation. And then today I'll incorporate an additional element of our practice and that is the air or the wind element in our meditation. So, so let's begin. Arriving. Arriving home home to this body. Arriving here and now. I'm offering an image of arriving home. And then letting go and putting down the bags maybe you were carrying the plans, projects, memory, preoccupations. If for now, we can put them away. Feeling the connection of your body with the ground. Beating your feet, legs, contacting the ground. Maybe a few long deep breath to let yourself arrive as you breathe out. Momentarily, we avail ourselves to this moment. A sense of availability, maybe that a mindfulness is a present here. Nothing dramatic. A sense of being available. Receiving the sitting posture. The breath sound of my voice. The sense of availability. It's incompatible with demanding certain experiences. That opening and receiving whatever arise. Maybe we go back to arriving process again. Gathering ourselves. Center ourselves right here. Maybe there is a physical felt sense of alignment. From where we sit. Alignment of the pelvic area, the spine, neck and head. Maybe there is a sense of alignment, inner alignment of the heart, mind and our body. Align with our aspirations. Maybe wholesome qualities. Maybe align with inner integrity. And the word integrity has the felt sense of coming together. Everything included. Nothing gets pushed out. Taking a few long deep breaths. Resting into this moment. With a sense of deeper registration. Deeper connection. We turn our attention to our physicality of the body. Pelvic bones supported by the ground. Making ourselves available to the felt sense of the earth element. The earthy body resting on earth. The earth element is hard, heavy. You may feel the weight of the body settling down, downwards. You may feel the earth element with a quality of stability. All moving. However earth element manifests itself, we receive as is. Letting go of big ideas, conceptualization of what earth element is. The body knows. The body is an organ of perception. Letting go of trying to figure it out from the head. Resting in the felt sense of earth element. You may feel some sense of stillness, stability, or any hint of it. You may feel some sense of stillness, stability, or any hint of it. Resting in the stillness of the earth element in this body. Moving like big pillars of an ancient temple. Moving like big pillars of an ancient temple. In the forefront of our experience. Stability. We'll invite the felt sense of the air element, the wind element. Maybe you feel the movement of the breath. Letting stillness drop in the background. Turn your attention to the movement of the breath. Maybe movement of the belly rising and falling. Your expansion and contraction of the torso. Maybe vibrations in the body moved by the wind element. Feeling Gregg's screech of light as it durables. being available to the felt sense of moving wind. Moving wind. Wide range of the movements in the body. With the steadiness and stillness of the earth element in the background. Maybe the winged element feels quite alive. Vital. Life giving breath. Being available to the air element in this body. Letting go of the trying to figure it out. Just available however this is for you. With the steadiness and stillness of the earth element. you you you you you you you wherever you are see if you can make yourself available to the sense of contentment ease relaxation maybe that's felt in the body maybe there is some felt sense with the earth element resting on earth or the ease of the breath kind of a contentment that is independent of our experiences the experience of the pleasant unpleasant can be contact with that not leaning in to grasp or pushing away the instructions to his son Raghula. Meditate like a wind. When you meditate like a wind, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind. Suppose the wind were to blow on both cling and uncling things. Like feces, your hands spit past and blood. The wind is not horrified, repelled and disgusted because of this. In the same way meditate like the wind. When you meditate like a wind, pleasant and unpleasant contact will not occupy your mind.
