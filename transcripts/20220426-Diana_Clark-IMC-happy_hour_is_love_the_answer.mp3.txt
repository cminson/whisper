The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Okay, so a really warm welcome again, everybody. It's nice to see what a wonderful thing it is, right, that people come together to practice.
And recently I stumbled upon this, I guess maybe it's two sentences that somebody said that has really got me thinking and I thought I would share it with you all.
And it's kind of an interesting way to think about practice or think about our lives.
And that is the sentences are love is the answer.
Probably we've heard this before. But the second part is the question is unimportant.
And I thought, oh, that's kind of a different way, right? I tend to think like, okay, this question is so important, I need to find the answer and kind of figure it out and solve it and everything's going to be better as soon as the answer to this question is known or something.
But the answer, the question is unimportant. Love is the answer.
So just reflecting on how sometimes asking questions is very helpful and supportive and useful helps us to of course gain more clarity helps us to maybe highlight where there's confusion or doubt or whatever it might be.
Maybe it can be a big support for us to investigate what is our experience, especially if we're are filled with doubt in order to have a little something to help us feel some more comfort.
So the questions about the teachings about our experience about teachers, all these kinds of things. And there's a way that sometimes getting lost in the questions is a way in which we can be relying on this idea that everything is just a matter of cognition it's
a matter of the intellect it's just a matter of knowing the answers acquiring enough knowledge.
And then there'll be freedom then there will be happiness, or having enough understanding.
And sometimes we use questions as to give primacy to, if I want to use this language I would say maybe to the head, maybe sometimes at the sacrifice of the heart maybe disconnecting from the heart and thinking that.
There's some thought that I have for some saying that somebody else has or something like that is going to be the answer.
It's true, right, but many of the answers are that way. And there's some answers that are not that great. There's a kind of a deeper knowing a dropping into resonance a feeling that's difficult to point to difficult to describe.
But often we feel it when something feels true or correct.
So there's a way in which questions can be an integral part and really a important part of our path of practice. And there's a way in which questions, if we rely on them solely or rely on what the asking questions is pointing to, that is that there will be an easy, clear, satisfactory answer.
Whereas this idea that love is the answer.
What is love?
Right, what is love?
It's often something that we know that we sense that we feel into that we have a resonance with.
I heard this expression earlier and I've been thinking about this one as well.
They were pointing to a different type of knowing and somebody said, it's as if you are the bell, and then something happens that's the clapper, and then kind of you as the bell there's a certain resonance, there's a certain beautiful tone that happens.
So I'm just bringing this up because I want to make room in our experience for both for both the intellectual cognitive analytical side, but as well as the intuitive sensing resonating side of experience.
I would say our life, our practice unfolds best when we include both.
And to recognize that sometimes we tend to prioritize the analytical and that which is easy to explain with words because, I mean, we've probably been reworded our professional lives or educational experience like nice, clear answers.
And that's what we're used to.
But I want to make room for answers that maybe aren't so clear, not so easy to describe.
A different way of knowing.
Without making either of these ways wrong.
Without dismissing one, prioritizing the other, but can we make room for both?
Love is the answer.
The question is unimportant.
So that's just one way I think that person was Jeff Foster, who said that he was pointing to, I believe he was pointing to tuning into our internal experience and not always be looking for analytical answers.
I'm trained as a PhD scientist, right, so I've spent my time looking for analytical answers and have found joy and a lot of satisfaction with that.
But that's not the entirety of the human experience.
Part of why we have a meditation practice is to help us tune into the rest of our experience, I would say.
Because the mind and the heart start to settle down, get a little bit more quiet or just a little bit more settled doesn't have to be completely settled.
Then we can notice things that we can't notice if we're just trying to think our way to all the answers.
Sometimes getting quite allows us to feel our way to some of the answers.
And with that as an introduction.
Let's do some meditation practice.
We'll do a little bit of mindfulness just to get settled and then we'll do some loving kindness practice.
This practice is, in some ways, is a practice of tuning into what is resonating because I did what is love and I'm suggesting that it's a feeling often with loving kindness practice we tune into that experience just so that it becomes more familiar.
We becomes more readily available.
Okay, after all those words, and maybe we'll just settle down into the experience of this moment.
That's the bodily experience in this moment.
Feeling into the bodily experience, recognizing the pressure against the body where it's sitting or lying down or whatever posture you're in.
Maybe there's some tension, some tightness in the body.
Can that tension or tightness just be there? Do we have to make it be a problem?
Can we allow it to be there?
Maybe feeling into the inner sense, the quality of the mood or emotions, quality of the mental state.
That's our experience right now.
The same attitude as if it could be there, as if we're allowing it to be there.
And when the mind gets lost in thinking, just very simply, gently begin again.
Turning into the experience of this moment.
And then to begin our loving kindness practice.
Find somebody who it's easy, uncomplicated, simple, straightforward to love, to have warm feelings towards, to have respect, goodwill.
This might be somebody you know, it might be an imaginary, kittens, puppies, babies.
It might be somebody that you don't have a relationship with, but they've touched your life with their writings or their teachings or something like this.
It's really helpful to choose somebody with which you have an uncomplicated relationship.
Connect with this person, with this being, I should say.
It might be that there's just a feeling of warmth, a sense of openness, sense of delight.
Or it might not be.
Maybe you're connecting, but it feels a little bit mechanical.
You can define however your experience is.
And then to support our cultivation of loving kindness.
You can repeat these phrases that give an opportunity in the heart and mind to continually come back to this intention of loving kindness, this warm heartedness.
But the lovable being in mind can repeat these phrases.
May you be saved.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
Tuning into this well wishing we have for this lovable being.
I feel like to be having goodwill for another.
Thank you.
May you be saved.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
Love is the answer.
A question is unimportant.
Does that feel like if love is the answer?
Then to extend our loving kindness for ourselves.
May I be saved.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
What if these questions about am I lovable is unimportant?
Love is the answer.
What if these questions we have about ourselves?
What if it turns out that love is the answer?
Towards that experience, that type of knowing, that type of feeling into.
And letting the questions just be soft in the background.
May I be saved.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be saved.
May I be blessed.
May I be blessed.
For someone we don't know.
Somebody we don't have a relationship with.
May I be blessed.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
If we choose an individual that we don't know,
can we require a little bit more effort?
Can we use the foundation of the warmheartedness we cultivated earlier
to support that effort to love and kindness for somebody we don't know?
Because love is the answer.
And the questions are unimportant.
Thank you.
May I be blessed.
May I be blessed.
May I be blessed.
May I be blessed.
May I be blessed.
And then to do some equanimity practice.
For this practice bringing to mind somebody that you care about,
you have a relationship with,
and they're a little bit irksome, a little bit bothersome sometimes.
Not the most difficult person in your life,
just somebody who's a little bit annoying sometimes.
Bringing this person to mind.
We can say this phrase,
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I know I've heard this before, maybe it was in some love songs or something.
This idea that we often are privileging our analytical questions and those types of answers,
here the invitation is to choose a different way of answering love. Love is the answer.
Pointing to be something a little bit different than a neat and tidy analytical concise answer.
Pointing to something, maybe something else, or something in addition,
without negating the importance of questions.
Pointing to, we don't always have to rely on them, rely on the expectations of having clear answers to questions.
Okay, so it can be helpful to talk about some of these ideas with others.
I'd like to put you into some breakout rooms.
I don't have an opportunity to talk about this idea of what I've been pointing to you and this whole idea.
Well, maybe that I'm saying the questions are unimportant.
Maybe you feel like, wait, no, no, no, the questions are the most important.
Or maybe you're having this idea that love is the answer, maybe just feels to Polly Ann at Yish.
The point is, we don't all have to agree, we don't all have to have the exact same ideas.
But it's helpful to talk about these things or to be in the, to share space with those who are willing and ready to explore these ideas.
So in these small groups that intention is not for you to inform and educate and convince others.
It's more for a space to be created in which you can behave or show up in a way that's with loving kindness.
So to bring a loving kindness out of some meditation practice and into something that we actually do.
And to allow yourself to be influenced by what you heard.
You already know the ideas that you have perhaps, but allow yourself to hear some new ideas.
So without some spaciousness and some warmth here or some, what other people have said.
And if it's helpful, you can go in the order of alphabetical order and that is to do a spiral.
So the first person just says one comment, one idea, and then it goes to the second person.
They say one idea goes to the third person.
They say one idea, and then it comes back around to the first person.
And now having heard other things, they might have something new to say.
So that is an introduction. Here we go.
Okay, so welcome back. Welcome back.
Anybody have some comments or questions? How was that in the small group to talk about love is the answer?
Questions are unimportant.
Yes, Neil.
First of all, this was lovely. Thank you.
You know, and I mean, I was, I've been cranky for the last two days.
I almost walked out before a small group. I'm so glad I didn't.
So, so thank you, groupies.
So we talked about, you know, the difficulties of doing this, you know, for, you know, you know, difficult people, people, you know, you know, right, people, I frequently refer to them as those idiots, you know,
and I'm just, you know, it was just, it was just an interesting conversation, you know, talking about how, you know, even if they don't deserve it, right, which is like dubious, but even if they don't deserve it, you know, you deserve it to respond with love.
You know, right, right, because not responding with love always comes with a price tag.
I like what you're saying, that you deserve it. It's about treating our own hearts, our own minds, right.
I don't know if doing loving kindness towards anybody makes other people behave differently. I don't know.
I know some Dharma teachers will say that, but, you know, I don't know, but we are the purpose of our doing this is to cultivate our own hearts and minds exactly as you're pointing to.
Yeah, I see. Do you have a, this idea about the question being unimportant? Do you have a, does that fit into this or not?
Right, I mean, you know, I mean, that's how come, you know, how do you respond to annoying people or difficult people, you know, right, how do you respond to yourself at every opportunity?
Right, it's not even, you know, it's not even so easy to always respond to yourself with love. And it seems much more obvious that it's appropriate under those circumstances.
Yeah, yeah.
And some of these questions that we have, maybe they, maybe there aren't clear answers.
There are no answers.
So then, then, you know, what do we do if we're kind of waiting for that answer?
Or it's searching and searching and searching for the answer.
What's it like to not have that answer? Yeah.
Trudy is waving. Yes, Trudy.
You're muted, Trudy.
There we go. Yeah.
Oh, I just said, maybe having the answer is overrated.
Thank you, Trudy.
That's such a nice way I spent how many words talking about this and you just have this one sentence having the answer is overrated. I love it.
Thank you, Trudy. I love this.
That's great.
Okay, well, wishing you all a wonderful rest of your evening. What a, what a pleasure it is to practice together and to, you know, explore these things together.
So thank you. Thank you all for your practice. And if you'd like, you can unmute and we'll say goodbye.
And thank you.
Thank you, everyone.
Thanks, Diana.
Hi, Teran.
Good night.
Bye, Catherine. Bye, Trudy.
