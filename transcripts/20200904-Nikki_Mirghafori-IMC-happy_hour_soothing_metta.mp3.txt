The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Okay, great.
Welcome everyone.
Good afternoon, good evening, good morning,
wherever you are in the world right now
and joining us.
So for this moment's practice together
for this happy hour,
I thought about
doing a nourishing metta.
A metta is always nourishing, but to
really putting the emphasis today on the instructions
on nourishing our bodies, our hearts, our minds
and with that
in mind, I would be doing perhaps a bit
longer, the silence would be longer
so that we can really settle in and take
time at the beginning. We always do, but maybe even
more so, to really settle in with the body and
with the breath. Just a sense of nourishing with the emphasis
and the nourishment of being with the body and the breath.
So
the practice might seem like it's always the same, we bring ourselves
or somebody else in mind and cultivate goodness, wishing well
and the nuances could be slightly different
and the nuances are really perhaps
tuning into, if it's available, how nourishing, how
rejuvenating,
how, what is source,
what is source of healing,
that's the word I'm looking for, source of healing for the
body and mind, this practice of metta can be
here and now, right here, right now.
And it doesn't have to be difficult, I've heard from some students in the past
that they only felt that metta is
working when they're landing or connecting some challenging
emotions and really giving themselves a metta or somebody else and it doesn't have to be that
way, it can be gentle, it can be like a cool
calming breeze
or when you're hot, if you jump
into a cool spring of water that just really
nourishes your body, so it can just be gentle, it can be nourishing.
So that's the emphasis
we're going to have and if that's available
today, great, and if it's not,
that's perfectly fine too. A lot of times we don't
have choice as to what arises, maybe challenges arise
and you need to be with them, with compassion, with self-compassion, so
those are the invitations and of course whatever
arises in your practice, as long
as you turn to it with kindness, then you're
doing this practice right, it's about cultivating kindness.
So cultivating kindness, goodwill, friendliness
ease, with respect to whatever comes up, even if it's
a crowd of sorrows that visit you during
this practice, instead of having a conflictual
relationship, go away, I'm trying to have easy metta.
That doesn't quite work, that makes it conflictual, that makes it harder,
so if challenges arise, ah, can you be kind
to the challenges to yourself for having those challenges, if the mind
is distracted, and all over the place, instead of trying to
get away from it in order to have a meditation
embrace the
distracted buddha, this moment the distracted buddha
sitting and practicing, oh hello dear, this is what it's like right now,
ah, may you be safe, may you be happy, may you be
well, so having kindness and ease with whatever is
arising. So with that, as our setup
I would like to invite you to get into
your meditation posture, let's begin. So if you need
to move, to shift, ah,
moving from a chair to a cushion, or if you need to lie
down, see what your body needs,
ah,
landing in this moment,
landing
in the
sensation of the body.
...
...
...
...
...
And noticing if there is any fatigue or any tension, any pain, any lack of comfort anywhere
in the body and opening to it, embracing it, not turning away, allowing awareness to knowing
to be this comforting, healing salve that is applied that turns towards any area of the
body that is tight or hurting or tense.
I invite you to be your inner Dharma coach and starting with your face, with your forehead
and jaw, and moving piece by piece, down throughout your body, bringing gentle kind
attention, awareness to all parts of your body, with this healing salve that is the
awareness on your own in silence.
Let's begin together.
Thank you.
Inviting each and every part of the body to relax and soften systematically starting
from your head, your face, down to neck and shoulders, arms, chest, abdomen, sit bones,
legs and feet in your own time staying with whatever part of the body needs more attention.
In your time, no rush.
In your time, no rush.
In your time, no rush.
In your time, no rush.
In your time, no rush.
In your time, no rush.
Inviting your whole body.
To receive the breath and to feel soothed.
As if this healing sound, healing sound is gently being rubbed all over your body.
This healing sound that is awareness.
Awareness of all parts of the body inside.
To receive the breath and to feel soothed.
To receive the breath and to feel soothed.
This healing sound being your awareness, your kind awareness.
Kindly aware of the whole body internally, externally.
The breath moving through.
Relaxing, releasing, healing.
One breath at a time.
As if the awareness mixed with the breath at this magical healing power.
This kind awareness to heal.
To rejuvenate.
To transform.
To rejuvenate.
To rejuvenate.
Checking in with the body, allowing it to be relaxed, inviting it to be soft.
Any tension has crept in.
Relaxing, letting go of the next breath.
Now imagining as if the breath was moving in and out of the heart center, the center of the chest.
Your heart is on the left, the heart center, proverbial heart center in the middle of your chest.
Imagine your breath is being breathed through the center of your chest.
Imagine the breath as it's breathed through the heart center.
It's also healing the heart.
This healing, calming, soothing.
This capacity of the breath moving through the heart center.
This awareness now in the middle of your chest with the breath.
This kind awareness, meta, entwined, intertwined with awareness.
Healing, soothing, soothing self for your heart.
Especially if there have been challenges.
Not to get into them in this moment, but just to hold yourself, hold your own heart.
As the breath moves in and out.
The breath bringing more healing, soothing, comfort and care.
And then spreading throughout the body.
Especially if any parts of the body need care and attention.
So you can decide your heart, your emotions need more care, more meta.
Keep your focus there, or if your body needs more care, more soothing.
Keep your awareness, your kind awareness, more in the body.
Maybe shared so that the in breath, the attention is at the heart center.
Then it spreads through the body, this healing, feeling, healing energy.
Then at the exhale again, it exits through the heart center.
You decide what's best for you.
If too confusing, just stay.
The breath in the chest, calming, soothing your heart.
With each breath, stay there.
Stay there.
Stay there.
Stay there.
Stay there.
Stay there.
Stay there.
Stay there.
Stay there.
Stay there.
Stay there.
With each breath that's received, allowing a sense of care, comfort, soothing, healing,
to be received in your heart and in your whole body.
Stay there.
Stay there.
Stay there.
Stay there.
Stay there.
And if you notice stories, thoughts are rising, not a problem.
Instead of having a sense of conflict with them, can you relax some more?
Can you relax your body?
Become aware of the thinking pattern, the thoughts, the plans, the stories,
the kindness with kind eyes as if you were gazing onto them with kindness.
It's okay. It's okay.
And inviting the thoughts to rest and be a part of your practice,
to receive kindness and care and soothing.
Kind awareness, loving awareness, non-conflictual relationship with the thoughts
and thinking. It's like this right now. It's okay.
If we're not in conflict with what arises,
it can be easy.
There can be ease in our practice.
Be aware, but without conflict.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You're relishing, relishing, enjoying, taking delight in the momentum of silence,
the healing, breath, intertwined with loving awareness.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
And for the last moments of this practice,
letting there be a sense of appreciation for yourself, regardless of the outcome.
Whatever rose or did not arise, if the mind was distracted, sleepy, it's all okay.
You've tried, you've sat.
You're offering deep appreciation for yourself without attachment or outcome.
Appreciation.
Try maybe even putting a palm in our heart center,
which we've been working with this practice period,
and just connecting with yourself and appreciating yourself,
that is you that has showed up, showed up to practice.
Whatever came up is not your responsibility.
Connecting with the goodness within you,
with your intention.
Thank you for your practice.
I'd like to invite all of us if you'd like to share
any reflections, you can either type them in chat and changing the settings
so that you can chat with everyone if you wish,
or to unmute yourself, and I'll start, get us started
by saying that for me, what's coming up with this practice period
is a sense of calm and deep nourishment,
the silence and the goodwill, the care, the comfort, the soothing,
intertwined with awareness and with the breath.
And the silence, the momentum of that can have,
can build up to this nourishing sense of the body, the mind.
Feeling held, that's what's coming up for me right now.
So thank you.
Ruth offers, Ruth from Pacifica offers, nourishing Mehta,
antidote to my heart's grief felt today.
Thank you, Ruth.
Thank you for sharing that.
Ruth offers, thank you, Nikki, I'm so happy I found the Sangha.
You always put me at ease, thank you.
Thank you, Tom, for your practice, for showing up.
You show up, you do all the work.
I serve and the community serves as the doula
to support the practice that arises.
So thank you for showing up.
We have also some greetings and thank yous on YouTube.
Yeah, thank you all.
Bill offers, had anxious thoughts intrude,
wasn't okay with them and couldn't make myself okay.
Maybe next time we'll be better.
Yeah, no problem, Bill.
I appreciate sharing that.
So when you say couldn't make myself okay,
there are two ways to interpret that.
I'm interpreting that.
To make yourself okay, couldn't make myself okay,
couldn't make the anxiousness go away,
or couldn't be okay with the anxiousness.
So making the anxiety go away, that can be hard.
It can be conflictual, so I wouldn't recommend that.
But the invitation would be to try to be okay,
bring kindness, relax the body,
invite kindness, this kind awareness of the anxiety
as if you're holding it with your practice.
So that's the invitation I would have for you, Bill,
and for everyone else if anxiety arises next time.
So if you want to say anything about that,
Bill, you're welcome, or I can move on to the next comment.
Okay, I take that as a pass, Bill.
Yeah, and also Vera offers,
it has been a sublime experience
that has connected me with the goodness of beings.
Thanks, Nikki, you're so welcome, Vera.
That's one, that's beautiful, this sublime experience
that has connected you with the goodness of beings.
Beautiful, yeah.
Holly offers, feeling everyone meditating together
helps me access Metta.
Oh, beautiful Holly, that makes me so happy.
That's the power of the Sangha,
really the power of the Sangha practicing with others,
really showing up in this way.
Yay, yay, yeah.
Louise offers, thanks for today,
can focus better than last week.
Oh, great, beautiful.
If there is more focus, great.
If there's less focus, great.
So it's all okay, it's all okay.
If we can make, befriend whatever is happening,
whatever is happening,
that is where a sense of freedom comes up.
Ilka offers, many thoughts had monkey mind today.
Thank you for holding space.
Beautiful, thanks for sharing that, Ilka.
It's monkey mind, yeah, can we have turn
as I was inviting you,
and this would be the invitation for all your practice
when say you're sitting
and there are a lot of intruding thoughts.
One option is, or thoughts, or anxiety, or monkey mind,
or lack of focus, whatever your wording is.
One reaction is to try to make it go away, go away, go away.
You're messing up my meditation.
Mary Christy says, I had an entire zoo in my head.
Okay, great, all the animals, that's cute.
Okay, whether you have an entire zoo,
not just a monkey mind.
As they arise, one invitation is to become aware of it
with kindness, not with like, go away,
I'm trying to meditate here.
Because if you say, go away zoo, go away monkey mind,
go away anxiety, I'm trying to cultivate meta.
Well, there is no meta in it.
You know, there is conflict, right?
There's a conflict your relationship, it's subtle.
That's really what I like to invite you to become attuned,
to become sensitive to.
The nature of mind for whatever reason,
because of all the causes and conditions of your life,
happens to be in this moment, it's a zoo,
or it's a monkey mind, or it's anxiety.
It has to be this way.
If it could be any other way, it would have been.
Whatever has happened in your life today, last week,
in the world, all of this is building up to this moment.
So adding more insult to injury,
isn't a way to cultivate meta.
Even though the mind, that would be the first to go to.
So instead, my invitation is,
as you practice on your own,
until the next time we meet on Monday,
is to, when the zoo arises,
when all of this arises,
to, ah, first of all, relax the body.
Number one, relax the body.
Relax the body.
Number two, turn your awareness.
Become aware of it with kindness.
Like, oh, here you are.
Hello zoo, hello monkey, hello anxiety.
Ah, I see you.
And invite it to become a part of your meditation,
as you are becoming, as you are aware with kindness,
of your breath, of your body, become aware of this.
The chances are it might relax,
and if it doesn't,
then there is no conflictual relationship.
It's more of a spacious, you're sitting with the zoo.
You can have freedom with the zoo.
The idea of this Buddhist meditation
isn't to completely shut out,
shut out all distractions and be quiet and no thoughts.
That's not the idea. That might happen great.
It may not happen great.
But the idea is to have freedom
in the midst of whatever is arising,
so that these thoughts, the anxiety, the zoo,
doesn't, um, doesn't become painful.
It doesn't become dukkha, suffering.
Paul offers sitting with the zoo.
Yep, sitting with the zoo.
Yes, I like that.
Nikki says,
I'm not sure if my earlier message was sent.
I didn't see an earlier message from you, Nikki,
but sometimes I deal with strong indecision,
and it's hard to put it aside.
Even for small decisions, I have difficulty,
and this can come up in meditation,
knowing that I have future decisions to make.
Ah, I see.
So for the meditation specifically,
Nikki, especially if other folks
have this coming up for them,
the invitation is, um,
as Albert Einstein said,
we can't solve our problems
with the same mind that created them.
So the same mind that has created this indecision
is that one cannot make the decision,
well, how should I put it?
The invitation to the middle of the practice
is to say not now and put them aside.
And with decisions, be with your practice,
not trying to make decisions in the middle of practice,
trusting that when, if you,
when you're being with awareness,
with kindness, with your breath,
something shifts, something opens up
that you can better attend to the decisions afterwards.
So that is my invitation for you
to ever so gently tell them not now,
again, not conflictually,
but ever so gently tell this particular animal,
thank you for visiting, come here,
sit next to me, but not now.
So I'd like to, so there's more,
let's see, yeah, let,
I'll let that be for now, Nikki,
for you to, to, to, to sit with that
and explore that as you are practicing
to invite them to sit.
And then one last comment,
I'll pull in from you two from Melanie,
I feel more grounded and more present, wonderful.
Happy to hear that.
So let's shift, shift, yeah,
into our group practice,
time is running short.
So the invitation for tonight's
small sangha into small groups practice,
the invitation to show up with ease,
to show up with ease,
not trying to show up as in any particular way
or smart or interesting
or any particular way, just showing up
as showing up with ease and see what shows up,
showing up with ease,
showing up with kindness and care
for yourself and for others.
And let yourself be surprised,
maybe no words come up,
maybe you just sit with these other two
wonderful, lovely practitioners in silence
and, and share care for each other.
So let's see what comes up.
Okay.
So I'm going to create the groups now
and if it's not,
today is not the time for you to be in groups,
no judgment, it's all good.
See what is right for you.
Okay.
So here we go and creating the rooms
and about to open them.
Okay.
All right, here we go.
Okay.
Welcome back everyone.
We have a minute for reflections
or comments about how the practice
with others was
and you're welcome to unmute yourself
or put it in chat,
especially if you haven't spoken
before you're welcome.
So have a minute.
Go.
Don't be shy.
What came up for you?
Hmm.
Kim offers it was lovely.
Oh, that's nice Kim.
Holly offers so nice to connect
with people while in lockdown.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you Holly.
It is nice.
What else?
Any other reflections?
And you can unmute yourself
if anybody's moved to.
The longer I do this,
the more I like these small groups.
I used to hate them in the beginning.
You know,
and I only stuck with them because you like,
you and Diana like seem to think they were important.
But now they're always too short.
Beautiful.
Thank you, Neil.
That just sounds like a fantastic.
I want to quote you.
I want to,
I want to coach you in the future.
The participant who just stuck,
who stuck with them,
hated them stuck with them because the,
and I kept bringing them out of the lagoon here
as a monster.
And now they're too short.
They're wonderful.
I love that.
Thank you so much for sharing that.
Yeah.
They are wonderful.
And yeah, as, yeah,
they're very powerful.
And I want to echo Neil's comment because,
even though tonight was very short,
you know,
I was in a room with Victoria and Holly and it was just,
so just really pleasant just to connect with someone
and just talk to them and whether it was that recovery
or the temperature or things like that was really wonderful.
So I really, I like Neil.
I think at first I was like,
but now I love them.
Thank you.
Thanks.
It's great.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, everyone.
This is great.
Maybe next time,
because what happens is what we noticed,
Diane and I,
and also all other teachers will notice when we announce groups,
the count keeps dropping on zoom.
You know,
people just drop like groups.
So next time,
maybe before I do groups,
I'll invite one of you to say something about groups.
And there's research, by the way,
about doing small groups and this kind of interaction
that people tend to not like them.
And then they actually enjoy them when they stay in them.
So, yeah, beautiful.
Two last comments from one from Yuka.
It's a pleasure to share love.
Thank you for your great love.
This is a very beautiful world.
Thank you, Yuka.
Thank you for your beautiful words.
And your beautiful love that you share with others
in very poetic language.
Thank you.
And Kathleen,
so appreciative of what and who are here.
Thanks, Nikki.
This hour has meaning.
Thank you, Kathleen.
Thank you so much for showing up every time.
You're regular.
Thank you for being a backbone of happy hours.
So, with all of that, I want to thank you all for your practice,
for showing up and, yeah, for caring for yourselves,
for each other,
and for all whose lives you touch directly and indirectly.
May all beings be well.
May all beings be free, including us.
Thank you and have a wonderful weekend.
See you on Monday.
Bye.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bye.
Thank you.
Thank you.
