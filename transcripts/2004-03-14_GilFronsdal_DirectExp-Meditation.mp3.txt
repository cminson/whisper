 As part of this morning's meditation, I'd like to offer you a guided meditation. It's a guided meditation in direct experience. I might mention to begin with that the doorway to the Dharma, the doorway to freedom in the Buddhist tradition, is through our direct experience. And we'll begin someplace very simple by bringing your attention to your hands and feeling your hands closely. Not so much like you're watching your hands but discovering how your hands experience themselves. The palm of the hand. The back of the hands. And in feeling the hands, do you feel temperature, warmth or coolness? Do you feel vibration, pulsing, pressure? The contact of your hands against some other part of your body. Do your hands tend to become more sensitive or alive as you bring attention to them? Or the opposite? With your eyes closed, do you feel the boundaries of your hands as sharp or the boundaries of the hands diffuse? The sensations of your hands, are they in flux? Are they moving? Changing? Vibrating? The direct experience of your hands right now could be called the living present. Your lived experience, that's what you're living in the present time. And then can you move your attention up into your arms? How do your arms experience themselves? The lived experience that's in your arms. And in feeling the lived experience of your arms. Can you keep it very simple? So it's primarily just the sensations, putting aside your judgments or thoughts or ideas of the experience. Just taking in the sensations of your arms. And moving the attention up into the shoulders. The direct lived experience that is being expressed right now in your shoulders. To be alive right now is to have sensations, to have awareness. When you're dead, your body will not feel anything. Now that you're alive, can you feel the lived experience of your shoulders? Feeling to be very simple, not for or against the sensations. Feeling the sensations in their own right. And then letting the attention reside in your torso. Feeling the living experience of being in a torso. Chest, ribcage, belly. Feeling the sensations there appear whatever way they want. Coming aware of how life expresses itself as sensations in the torso. There may be comfortable, there may be uncomfortable sensations. It's the simple act of awareness. The knowing of the sensations is quite a miracle. Feeling the vitality, the livingness that manifests in the torso as sensations. Sensations of movement as the body breathes. The sensations of weight, lightness and weight of pressure. Sensations they appear in the torso. Sensations of vitality. The expression of vitality in your torso. Vibration, pulsing, aliveness, the direct experience. And then moving the attention into the legs. Feeling the direct living experience that's available right now in your legs. Almost like a practice of revelation. Feeling the sensations reveal themselves unto themselves. And down into the feet. noticing how the feet experience themselves. And then becoming sensitive now to the area of the head. Feeling the physical sensations. Being as simple as you can. Like awareness is a simple sponge that receives or soaks up the sensations of your head without being for or against them. Needing them to be any different. Feeling the aliveness, the vitality of your face. Whether they're comfortable or uncomfortable sensations, it doesn't matter here. Staying with the simplicity of vitality, the aliveness, the sensations that show you that you're alive. Pulsing, vibrating, all the variety of sensations. Now take in the totality of your body. The direct experience, the lived experience of being in a body right now. The global experience of vitality, aliveness. The direct experience of life. In and of itself is quite simple. So whatever reveals itself, the sensations, the pulsing, the vitality. There may be secondary reactions and judgments and ideas, but the direct experience is very simple. A little bit longer. Please stay in your body with the direct experience of how the body experiences itself. And now become aware of what you're feeling, your mood or your emotional state, however subtle or large it might be. And spend a few minutes feeling the sensations, the living sensations that somehow are manifesting that feeling or emotion. How it is in the body to feel as you do. Being very simple, if possible, allowing, giving permission for the emotion to be there. So that you can tune into how the body experiences the emotion. Notice if there's any reactivity. You're entering into a relationship with what's happening in the present. Liking, disliking, judging. Being for or against. And then feel the lived experience, the direct experience of your reactivity and its simplicity. And then feel the Life expresses itself in thoughts as well. Can you become aware of the lived experience of thinking? The experience of how the thinking mind experiences itself. Our direct experience is also experienced as sounds. Can you let awareness feel the simplicity of sounds in the present moment? Can you feel the simplicity of sounds in the present moment? Can you feel the simplicity of sounds in the present moment? It is sometimes said that it is possible to have a direct experience of space, of stillness. Can you relax and softly become aware of the space of stillness around you by sensing your way into it? Not by looking, finding awareness. Tune into space for stillness. Can you feel the simplicity of sounds in the present moment? And then awareness can be aware of itself. Life is expressed in the capacity to be conscious, to be aware, to know. Which is kind of difficult, but can you get a direct sense of awareness, the lived experience of consciousness? Awareness is that which allows us to know our experience, to be aware of it. Letting awareness be aware of anything it wants, but tuning into the quality of awareness itself. And then the final place of studying direct experience is in feeling, sensing the direct experience of peace, the livingness, the aliveness of peace. Is there some aspect of your present moment experience that allows you to open to the experience of peace that's here? Is there some aspect of your present moment experience that allows you to open to the experience of peace?
