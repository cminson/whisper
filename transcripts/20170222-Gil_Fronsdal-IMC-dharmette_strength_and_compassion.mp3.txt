Dharmette: Strength and Compassion  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

What ’s on my mind is to tell you a few stories from the 
Buddhist tradition . They’re stories about how we can be 
in the world, the complicated world.  
 
The first  is about a famous king , the first emperor of 
India, King Ashoka . He conquered and united much of 
India  during his time,  but was considered to be very 
cruel  in his conquests . The battles were quite bloody . 
There was one famous battle , where  the records say 
100,000 people were killed . The day after this battle , the 
king walked through the battlefield, surveying the 
carnage. I imagine it wa s pretty gruesome to see . And 
then walking through  the field was a Buddhist  monastic , 
who was steadily , calmly , and peacefully passing  
through it all . The contrast between this car nage and 
the monastic was quite strong . The king saw s omeone 
who could be independent, not pulled into the world of 
the violence, not caught up in it, not afraid of it, not 
angry with it, not distressed about it  – but clearly in the 
middle of it, upright, and calm . Walking in the middle of 
this situation is a powerful image . It was powerful for 
Ashoka  because he stopped the monastic , and asked to 
receive  their teachings . And the teachings he received converted the king from his violent ways to essentially 
become  a non-violent ruler of his country . And the 
conquests ceased. Buddhist monastic s had a certain 
strength  of presence . I don ’t think of the m as being 
weak in their calm , but rather  having  strength and 
dignity  – being upright in the middle of everything .  
 
The other story is not exactly a story, but a rule that 
monastics have . Buddhism is often associated with 
being non -violent, and  yet there is an exception to this . 
If a monastic is being attacked , then for the purpose  of 
escaping  (this is the language used:  “the purpose of 
escaping ”), the monastic can strike out. So, if someone 
comes at you with a knife, you ’re allowed to hit  away the 
attacker ’s arm. If someone grabs you by the throat , you 
can knock away their arm. But you ’re not allowed to 
attack them first. You ’re not allowed to hit them, except  
as a way of escaping danger . Then , you ’re allowed to 
strike out, to be violent in that situation . But there ’s a 
cavea t, or a requirement : you can do this only if you 
have mettā in your heart  – only if you have kindness for 
the person  attacking you . You’re not doing it out of hate 
or hostility, but you are taking care of yourself. So here 
again there is this idea of being upright, strong, capable, 
and at the same time being soft and kind in the heart  – 
but also , very clearly and definitely , knowing that you 
need to  care of yourself : “This is what I need to do .” 
 
The third story is one of a monk  who was sick with dysentery . The sad story is that the other comrades  in 
the monastery were not taking care of th is person. You 
have to realize  that sometimes when people become 
monks and nuns , they really need  to become monks 
and nuns. They have things they need to learn 
[laughing]. Rather than thinking the monks and nuns are 
actually fully enlightened and are the perfect 
embodiment of Buddhism, sometimes they ’re the 
people who least  embody what Buddhism is about, and 
that’s why they become monastics : to learn something. 
That’s how I explain this story  that the monks and nuns 
weren ’t taking care of this monk  who had dysentery, 
leaving him lying in his own excrement.  
 
The Buddha heard about this, and with his disciple 
Ananda , went  right up to this  sick monk, and the two of 
them got water and towels and cleaned th e monk up . 
The Buddha then  gathered all the monks and nuns 
together in the monastery and said to them , “Here in th e 
monastery, you have no fathers and mothers to take 
care of you, you only have each other .” Then he 
continued , “Those of you who want to take care of me 
as the teacher, you should take care of those who are 
sick.” In India, where tak ing care of the guru is  one of 
the highest spiritual things that you can do, it ’s a pretty 
big deal to say that taking care of the sick is like taking 
care of the guru.  So here is an  image of the Buddha , 
dignified and upright, went right into the place where the 
monk was sick, got water , and clean ed him.   
To me, the se three stories point to a way of being in the 
world . The third one is nice , and I wanted to save it for 
last for its example of  compassion and caring . But 
sometimes  we spend too much time emphasizing  
compassion and care, and some people actually 
become weak in the process. Some people  think they ’re 
supposed to care and give themselves over to whatever 
is going on, rather than stand ing up and be ing upright . 
They feel they  have to be soft and gentle , thinking,  “I 
don’t count. I have to be compassionate ,” or something 
like that. Being compassionate is a really great thing to 
do in the world, but you can do it with strength, being 
upright and dignified.  
 
Sometimes we have to take care of ourselves. And it ’s 
kind of dramatic, this idea of striking out. Sometimes we 
have to establish firm boundaries  with famil y and other 
people. But the rule is  to do it with loving kindness. You 
can still take care of yourself. You know  the importance 
of firm boundaries  – and this is how it is now.   
 
Sometimes we ’re in a world of carnage . We’re in a 
world that ’s really horrible to be in . It’s not making it 
pretty , or making it different from what it is . But it is 
possible to be in the middle of it , and to not be part of 
the carnage or the wars . To not be a part of all this , but 
to have an upright, balanced , dignified way of being  – a 
strong way of being  that also allows us to have calm and peacefulness . This  can be very helpful for the world 
around us , just  as it was in ancient  India . It just 
happened that this monastic  walked through the 
battle field at the time when the emperor  was most 
vulnerable , and receptive  to expressions of peace.  
 
Part of this practice of mindfulness  that we do  is to help 
us to become soft in our minds. I talked earlier today 
about developing softness , and  having  relaxed qualities 
inside . But that ’s not the whole story. It ’s also  about  
developing strength , and being able to hold yourself  
upright . This idea , literally and metaphorically , of being 
able to be upright in the midst of whatever goes on, 
means that we don’t cower ; we don ’t collapse ; we don’t 
run away . But also we don ’t attack ; we don ’t strain ; we 
don’t push forward . Instead,  we hold a certain balance 
where we ’re rooted in oursel ves. We’re rooted where 
we are standing. There ’s confidence and strength  in 
that. And then in that confidence and strength, there  can 
be calm . There ca n be peacefulness . There can be 
freedom  – the radical freedom  that the Buddh a points 
at. Th is radical freedom – a deep letting go  – doesn ’t 
require that we  lose our strength . It doesn ’t require us to 
become pushovers , or wa shed over, or drowned by 
everything  that goes on around us  – but there is a kind 
of uprightness in the midst of everything.  
 
So I hope that , as you do th is practice, you remember 
that this is part of it also . It’s possible to practice mindfulness  while being upright,  having  a certain 
strength of character  – a strength of being rooted in 
yourself. And perhaps mindfulness is more effective and 
powerful when it’s a reference point for you  – your own 
personal strength, your own personal  sense of being 
grounded and upright wherever  you go.  
 
So that was what on m y mind, in my hear t today . 
Hopefully it resonated  well enough with what ’s in your 
heart and mind.
