 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome. This is the first class in the Eightfold Path program. We had an orientation last month. I think many of you were here. You can't hear me? Okay. A little louder. Let's see if we don't get feedback. How's that? Is that better? Is that better? Still louder. Still wanting it louder? No? It's okay. And also there's hearing assistant devices. Okay. I can hear a little bit of an echo, so I think it's pretty loud. Many of you were here last month for the orientation. Who was not? Who missed the orientation? One, two, three, four, five. Okay. So actually, remind me, I have a handout for you from last that I can give to you, each of you, that answers a lot of the questions that we discussed. Were you able to listen to the recording from the class? If you didn't, you did. Yes, yes, you didn't. If you want, you can. And also I can give you the handout. Find me on the break. If you have questions, feel free to ask. There's also an email address that you can write to if you don't get your answers today. Okay. Great. So I think just to say a few words about IMC itself. To me, it's quite, if you don't know about IMC and its history, it's really moving to me. IMC exists because of the Sangha and the generosity of the Sangha. The Sangha raised funds to buy this building so that this center can exist. Everything here exists on volunteer and Dhanana. So there's no paid staff of any kind. Everything, sound system, email, newsletters, cleaning, absolutely everything is done by volunteers. So welcome to the Sangha and the invitation is to be a part of the Sangha if you so choose. Membership is by choice. There isn't really anything more formal than that. And it's your coming that makes the Sangha. So thank you for being here, for keeping the Dharma going, the sharing of the Dharma. Couple other things are that it is important for you to take care of yourselves today whenever you're here. There's three bathrooms back that way. There's water. If you need to stretch or move, please take care of yourselves. Do what you need to do to take care of your bodies and your hearts. So I'm Tanya Weiser and one of the many teachers in the PATH program. And I guess another thing to know about me is I'm in a four year teacher training program with Gil Fronstall and Andrea Fella. I've been a part of IMC since about 2006. Been through many, many programs here. Dharma Mentor Training Program, Local Dharma Leader Training Program, Dedicated Practitioner Program and others. So it's been a great journey and I'm what I'll call an IMC baby. My Dharma is IMC Dharma. So that's my introduction. And I have Chris and Sandra with me. Hello. My name is Sandra Asanoudia. I'm also an IMC baby. Everything that I've learned about the Dharma, it's been here at IMC. Different trainings, classes, everything has been here. I'm also teaching Dharma in Spanish. So if you know of anybody that is interested, we have a Spanish Sangha every Tuesday, 730. I'm also a compassion cultivation teacher, certified teacher. And yeah, very, very happy to be here with you, sharing with you, learning with you and from you. So yeah, thank you. I'm Chris Clifford. Are we doing something about these? We meant to ask if it's all right if we take ours off so that we can be better heard and seen. We all feel pretty safe. I at least have been on retreat for three weeks in an isolation tank. Yeah, so probably a lot of you have seen emails from me about this program. It's lovely to see you all in person. I've been involved with this program for 10 years or so and with IMC since the 90s sometime. I'd say I'm a Western Insight baby. I've associated myself with various centers around the country at different times, but this is my home. So I've been through a lot of programs here. And you know, I love this one. I'm so happy to see you all. It's so moving what people get out of this who do it and people come back and do it again. And it's really, really lovely. So thank you. Yeah, so we're here at Right View. So, Sandra, who's introducing Right View today? She's going to get us ready for Right View with a meditation. All right. Okay, good. I could look at my schedule and then I would know these things. Thank you. Thank you. Can you hear me okay? Thank you. So before we start this, it's always nice to ground and to kind of arrive. But before we start, I'm going to invite you to move your body in whatever way you need to move. Like really just trying to let your body tell you how you want to move and just loosening the shoulders. You back, your hands, your fingers, your toes, just like, ah, invite yourself to be here, to loosen up a little bit. We usually come with worries and I mean, making the transition from the street to here. So like, okay, let it, let it, it's going to be there. It's not going anywhere. But it can be in the back of the mind just for the time that we're going to be here together. You can let that go a little bit. Just, okay, go back. Go to the back. I'll pick you up when I leave. And invite you to take a couple of deep, intentional breaths, inhaling by the nose, filling up the lungs, taking the air to the belly and ah, exhaling by the mouth. An invitation to, or nervous system to calm, to soften, to relax. And closing the eyes or lowering the gaze, finding your normal breathing. Noticing the points of contact of your body with the floor, the feet on the floor. The contact with the chair, your legs, your back against the chair, the cushion. Noticing sometimes that tendency that we have to have holding on our legs as if we were going to go and do something. So there's really no place to go right now. We can soften, release any holding. Noticing the belly and the chest and softening. And paying a little attention to the middle of your body, the diaphragm. Notice what's there. We have so many emotions expressed in this part of our body. Just notice what you see, what you feel. And there's nothing to change or fix. It's just becoming aware of what's happening. If there's tension, stress, ease. Shifting the attention to the shoulders, allowing them to fall away from the ears. Becoming more aware of the weight of the arms and softening the hands. Shifting the attention to the head. Making any adjustment so there's no tension on the neck or the shoulders. And softening the forehead and the muscles around the eyes, the lips, the jaw. Receiving the inhale and softening, releasing, holding with the exhale. Notice what's in your mind. Perhaps remembering what brought you here. Noticing if the mind is also relaxed or one thought after another. Going back in the past, forward in the future and only noticing. Again, there's nothing to fix, nothing to change or validate. Just becoming aware. Shifting the attention to the shoulders. Expanding the awareness to the whole body. Let it rest wherever in your body makes sense to you. Sensations of breathing. Perhaps the feet or the hands. The attention, resting the mind, softening the body. When you find that the mind is distracted, miles and miles away from here, perhaps, just bring the attention back to that part of your body. Then rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. I invite you again to notice how you feel in the body. How you feel the mind without searching for anything in particular. For maybe something you wanted to see there, but just notice what is there right now. Rest. I also invite you to listen to the bell. From the first moment you can perceive the sound until it ends. Every time the bell sounds like with curiosity, opening the ears, opening the mind. The bell is ringing. Thank you, Sandra. That's lovely. Very nice. Welcome. I don't know your name, but you just came in. Just want to let you know there is a handout at the front little table. And you can put a name pack on any time, but just so you know to get those things. All right. So we're launching with Wise View, also referred to as Right View. I'll probably switch the language and you'll see it written differently, talked about differently. So I'll just start with those words. So maybe it's helpful to think about, you know, if you want to look at the ocean and you're on the top of a mountain, the Right View is to look to the west, right? If you're on the west coast, you want to look toward the west. So you're looking the right way. Another way to think about Right View is the right tool for a nail is a hammer, not a screwdriver, right? So it's not as in it's like for the purpose, for the purpose that's needed. And that's why also you can use the word Wise. It's like it's wise to use a hammer with a nail, right? Much more wise than trying to use a screwdriver, you know, with a nail. Right sometimes is also referenced as helpful, wholesome, or beautiful, but like in accordance for what is correct for a particular situation or thing. And so this is the, you know, taught as the first path factor, but it's not like there's a beginning and end of the path. And it's not like all the path factors actually don't come together in each path factor. So we start here, it helps us like orienting toward the right direction. The idea is it's helpful way to put this particular view on to, you know, sort of start to understand or experience from this perspective that we'll be discussing Chris and I today. And you all in your breakout groups. And it's not like you're going to study it today and get it right forever. Your understanding of it will deepen over time. It will change. It will broaden, you know, and as you do another path factor, actually it can very easily open you up to new perspectives on Wise View. Right. So just know it's a dynamic process. It's not singular. We're not just building blocks. It's much more expansive than that. And it's a really nice place to come back to. OK, how am I looking at this? What's my perspective here? How am I approaching? What view do I have here? What perspectives? Am I using the right tool? So the the there's kind of two parts to Wise View and I'm going to talk about the first part. And Chris will talk about the second part. The first part is really rooted in the Four Noble Truths. Understanding and having the perspective of the Four Noble Truths. So the Four Noble Truths are first there is dukkha. And dukkha is a word that's frequently translated as suffering. It's the most common. But actually all the trends, there are many translations that range from subtle disease to excruciating suffering. So it's a huge continuum. Huge continuum. So it's nice to use the word dukkha because it is a different language and it doesn't have the same associations that suffering is. But again, it's well, I know I move around between the language and what I'm referencing. So the second noble truth is the cause of dukkha, which is clinging. And I'll talk about that and what are some of the roots of clinging today. The third noble truth is the cessation of dukkha when it ends. And the fourth is the Eightfold Path, the way that leads to the end of suffering. So the Buddha presented these sort of like a doctor would present his understanding of a condition and then the cure for the condition. So it's a dynamic kind of framework that we can bring to our experience over and over again. The second part of Wise View, just to drop it in there, and Chris will go into this, has a lot to do with the condition nature of experience. It's complex and she'll talk more about that. So let's start with the first noble truth. Yeah, there is suffering. So there's a quote from the Buddha in Maja Manakaya. I teach dukkha and the end of dukkha. Pretty clear statement. Emphatic statement, in fact, by the Buddha. And it places the ending of dukkha at the center of everything he teaches. It's a primary purpose, primary orientation for us on this path. And for those of us on the path, it's very important we become very intimate with our understanding and recognizing our experience of dukkha. It's suggesting that we interpret, in fact, our life through the experience and activities and understanding the presence and the absence of dukkha. It's a huge source of feedback for us, the presence and the absence. So I'll give you my personal simile. You know, if you're driving on like Highway 1 along the beach, they have on the side of the road, they have what's called rumble strips. Anybody know what rumble strips are? There's a divot in the pavement. Ever drive on those divots? It's pretty a shocking experience. It can be very loud, very bumpy. And we can drive on them and we can have a sense of irritation even come up in response because it's so abrupt. It's quite intense. And then we might go, oh, yeah, okay, now I'm going to have a wise view about these rumble strips. They're here because I wasn't paying attention to where I was going. And if I didn't have that rumble strip to wake me up, I could have driven off the road or off the path. So in the same way, Dukkha is like the rumble strips and it can be subtle and it can be intense and we can be unhappy about having it. But we want to remember it's actually there to guide us. So then we start to have a whole different relationship with the experience of suffering if we see it in this way. So this is the Buddha, his first sermon, his first talk, was a, Gil calls it a celebration of the Four Noble Truths. Rooted, truth rooted in Dukkha and the end of Dukkha. Just to say how important, I can't say it enough, the presence and the absence of Dukkha is your guide. And we all have our own inner feedback systems, our own sensitivities, our own triggers and things that will cause Dukkha. So these Four Noble Truths are not meant to be truths in the sense of, you know, creeds or something you have to believe. It's not about believing or thinking. It's a pointing to direct experience. It's to be known. It's to be experienced. And as we build this combination of mindfulness and having these experiences, we grow wisdom. And so as that wisdom grows, instead of having to use effort like willpower effort to stop ourselves from doing something that we know is causing harm, we actually start to grow a wisdom that isn't about willpower. It's a wisdom that is like, just like you know a knife will cut you and you don't want to be cut, you do not get your fingers in the way. Or just like you know the stove is hot and you don't want to touch it. So there's a shift away from this idea, again these ideas of dictatorship or things that we have to do toward an embodied understanding of wisdom that guides us, that makes sense that we're in connection with. So the second normal truth is about clinging. The cause of suffering is clinging. So a lot of things generate clinging. Pretty much anything can generate clinging. It's what we want. It's our dreams, our fears. You know it's our preferences. It's our views and opinions. Like there's so much the sense of who we are. All of these things that we cling to, the way the chairs are supposed to feel or the way we're just everything. How loud, how quiet, you know we can cling to anything. We have opinions about it. And sometimes it's really easy to let go. Sometimes it's so simple and clean, it's like this hurts, it's like the knife cutting my finger, I don't want to do it and I drop it. No problem. Other times it's a little more confusing, a little more complicated because of our attachments. And I'll talk about the roots of clinging to help you. Sometimes when you find that it's hard to let go or you think you let go and you find you keep going back and back to the same place. You might want to look into these roots to look more deeply at what is holding you in the grip. So these attachments can be surface, simple, direct, easy to let go of and they can have deeper roots. So the idea, the goal is that maybe there's a plant and that we pull the whole plant, all the roots out, not just the leaves. So sometimes when something's got deeply rooted attachments, it's easy to pluck the leaves off but leave the plant and it will just come back. So this is the idea of those roots, right, that we want to unroot them if possible. So the four types of clinging, the first one is called sensual pleasure. Now that's huge and believe me, you're going to have it. It's everything like security, like the comfort of your clothes, right? It's just a sensual pleasure, wanting to be comfortable and it's sex and it's ice cream and it's, you know, buying too much, shopping too much and playing too many games and having to have the perfect new this and that and everything else. And so again, it's this continuum and it's not a problem to enjoy your life, right? It's not a problem to have pleasure. We're not monastics. We have not renounced sex. I don't, or, you know, a home or comfort. So we can get tangled up in this one and it's important to pay attention to really, it's the clinging that's the problem. It's when we're clinging to, oh no, I really want that thing. And so then we get annoyed with somebody and angry because they got the thing that we wanted because we're clinging to that thing. And it brought up irritation and judgment and jealousy. Make sense? Okay. I only saw nods. Yes. I should look again. Did I see any nods? No. Okay. All right. Okay. So the second way we cling, the second route of clinging is our opinions. And this is broad again. It's the ideas or beliefs and many of these were, were kind of like given to us inherited. We inherited them. Many of them we probably wish we did not have. There's many of them that are so unhelpful, so harmful that have to do with our culture or society or our family or our third grade teacher. Right. Who told us we can't do art. You know, it's, it's, it's, they come from everywhere and they, we ingest them because we don't know any better. They become ours internalized over time. So one of the big jobs is starting to kind of understand when those opinions, ideas, beliefs, views are operating. Cause they're hard to see. We're wearing glasses. We're looking through the glasses and we don't know how the glasses are distorting our perceptions. But they are. They make us see things differently than the way they truly are. They make us see people differently than the way they really are. They make us see ourselves differently than the way we really are. So they, these views, these beliefs, these opinions, these ideas can be very hurtful. And so we go back. This is where you can sort of, what's a wise view? We can ask ourselves that we can sort of think about the four noble truths and help ourselves reorient. What direction am I looking? Am I, am I, am I looking toward the ocean? You know, expect, am I looking toward the desert, but expecting to see the ocean? Okay. So the third route is clinging to religious practices, spiritual practice and to virtue. Some of us get very caught up in being a good Buddhist. Have a lot of attachment to the rights and rituals and the ways things are supposed to go. And it's the clinging to these things again that causes the suffering. So it's not that there's a problem with rituals or virtue. It's incredibly important, actually, virtue or ethics. But when we cling, when we cling and we grip and we create suffering for ourselves or other around it, it's not helpful. The fourth route is clinging to ourself, clinging to a sense of self or an identity, how we want to be seen, who we think we are, how we don't want to be seen, but this way that we have this idea of ourself and we identify with our thoughts. Oh, I have this thought, so I think it's me. So these are the four routes. And when you're not sure, well, when clinging, letting go of clinging is easy. Great. When the clinging you think you've let go, but it keeps coming back, maybe take some time to think about the roots, the roots for the clinging, kind of exploring this. All right. I need to time check myself to see. I'm past time. So thankfully, I think I said the most important pieces and there's a lot more to say and you'll get to read. And now we'll move into practice group discussions with. Do you want this? OK, so we're going to do some breakout sessions, three to four people. But before we do that, I would like to if you have the handout, you can read it to just going to go very quickly over our agreements so we can have a safe place. We feel comfortable sharing, sharing our experience and listening to others. OK, so confidentiality, what we say here stays here. So that means that we don't go outside telling people what we heard with names and things like that. And also, you don't go behind a person and say, oh, about what you just shared. So just be very respectful of each other and use common sense. Obviously, there's always conversations that can happen between two people. Just make sure that is OK. Just stay very attuned to what's happening. So any responses are very invitation and share from your personal experience. We all read books. We hear podcasts, listen to talks. So when we share and share from what has happened to you, something that you had felt yourself know what such and such said. But really stay with your own experience. Speak with kindness and be thoughtful. Pay attention to the comments that you make. So there's a list in there in the handout. So comments about identity, cultural, racial, political, geographic, able bodies, sexual orientation, gender identity, age. I mean, you know. When you share, don't go too much into the details, but just kind of the headline of it. So we all have time to talk. Yeah. And then practice mindful speaking and listening. So while you speak in, know what you're saying. Be very aware that you are talking. Maybe slow down a little bit so you have some time to be aware of what's coming out of your mind. And use the pauses when something just doesn't feel right. Just make a pause. Speak softly. It's easier really to stay mindful when we don't speak too loud. But make sure that others can understand what you're saying. And also notice what's happening within you when you speak. Like, do you feel any agitation? Like, get very connected to your body. What's happening? Is there the emotions? What is it that's happening when I share, when I speak? Can you know what you're going to say before you say it? And also, are you aware of the motivation that takes you to say what you're saying? So be connected to yourself. And listening, be present for others. It's so easy to get caught in what is it that I'm going to say next. So just drop it and listen. And when it's your turn to talk, just listen and see what pops up. Sometimes what comes out of our mind, what they're sharing that we do, is not what we anticipated. Like, something that we hear just opens up something. Make something bubble up in ourselves. Allow that to happen. Notice when you listen how it impacts you. Like, stay balanced and notice what's happening in your body. Okay. So I'm going to read the question first and then we'll make the group. I have a moment to think about the question. So... Oh, okay. Sure. So I'm going to read it and yeah, sure. So I'm going to read the question first. So what might happen if you decide to stop whatever you're doing when you notice suffering? I think Tanya introduces to the four noble truths about Dukkha. How clinging is the source of Dukkha and also becoming aware that there's Dukkha. If we totally ignore it, if we don't pay attention to it, there's no way we can do something about it. Do you want to add something else? Okay. Okay. Sharon has a question. Could you read the question? Sure. So what might happen if you decide to stop whatever you're doing when you notice suffering? I just let's take a few seconds to let that question in. Okay. So we're going to make groups of three or four people. So if you want to look around you for this first time. So how was that? How was sharing and how was listening to that question? What came up for you? What do you notice? I think what was most effective for me when you repeated the question was I started to consider because you didn't specify whether it was suffering in ourselves or others. And I started to look at that relationship in myself as far as how I respond to suffering within myself versus how I respond to suffering in others. And I saw that it was a quite different response as far as more compassion is outward versus inward. And that was something for me to really think about. Thank you. Which one if you don't mind, I ask you, which one is easier to notice? It's definitely easier to notice in others. I mean, I'm empathic. So I really can pick up on people's energies. And there's also just an immediate compassion that I start to feel when I can see someone suffering. I'm also not one to try to jump in and fix it versus myself. That's what I want to do. I want to fix it. I want to change it. I want to judge it. It's so much easier for me to give compassion when it's when I'm able to have seen it in others. Well, we started off with sort of treating the question pretty conceptually and maybe. But then we had sort of a volatile moment and all of a sudden things really flipped to opportunity to practice. So I think we're all very grateful for that. Speaking of the assumption for other people. But it was pretty powerful. Oh, thinking about Gil's talk the other day of being on the surfboard that didn't last long. Or we got back on it. I don't know. Thank you. Can I just clarify. So I just want to see if this is my understanding is right. So you guys were talking. You were maybe from a more intellectual perspective about the idea of stopping for suffering. And then you recognize suffering happening in the space and you stopped. Is that right. Yeah. Without without revealing. Yeah. We just stopped. We got it tuned with what's going on. I think all of us did. And then you know with the disagreement and then we thought of a solution and did it. And that's that's you know, we practiced it. I'm very happy for that. Oh, sweet. Thank you for sharing that vulnerable. You know that's a vulnerable thing to share. And like you guys went right to work in your group. Sounds like it was a relief for all of you. Thank you. Any other comments. Yeah. Something I echo. I'll start with by echoing that it started conceptually first. And I think among all our group numbers we started noticing ourselves trying to fill the time. And then in taking what we're saying and then judging and filtering that and related to that is the appreciation of being able to come together in the space with the intention of being mindful about our speech and our interaction and getting that safety and being seen and heard. So it was really nice to have that experience. Thanks everybody here. I have chills. Thank you for sharing. It's really beautiful. Anybody else notice that they start thinking too much about the question and then allowing yourself to feel the question is that something like that that happened. What changes when you shift from the concepts to the felt experience. Would you like to share something about it. It's slightly a different thing that I'm responding to. But what I noticed is when I listened to another I was really more in my body and listening to them and connecting with what was going on with them. And when I spoke it wasn't as easy for me to connect with myself. So I need to stop and do it. Thank you. Thank you. I had a problem in that I do a lot of things to prevent me from suffering. And so the question flips like what what happens when you stop those behaviors and then I really suffer. And you know I want the way I stop it is resuming that very powerful behaviors that are so skillful. So my journey is to stomach that suffering. Go thinking that since we're little we don't show our suffering. We get something that we stop recognizing because oftentimes when we feel the suffering we think there's something wrong with us because everybody else is OK. There's something wrong with me sometimes. It's not socially accepted that we talk about our suffering. And changing that view it takes it takes work. It's not easy to do. And there's nothing we all suffer. If we could see in the heart of everybody here our heart will break. We share that suffering is something of our common humanity. So that's a view that maybe we need to start challenging. Yes sometimes and sometimes we don't see suffering because of habits or with total ignorant about them. But a lot of it has to do with maybe the way we raised or where we leave or where we supposed to endure. We supposed to be resilient. I mean with the best intention about resilience here great to cultivate resilience but it doesn't mean that I'm not suffering. I'm suffering. Yeah. Thank you. Okay one more. Again we'll shift. Well I'm in the midst of going through and preparing the high holiday and to shoot us and during the holiday. There is a chauffeur blast whereas there is a complete whereas is that one sound long sound is complete and then there is a broken sound and there's a really a lot of broken sound and coming back to whole. Part of it is like when you have a suffering is like there's a lot of brokenness and I might be shattered completely with the major suffering. However even with the suffering I can still be a complete whole person and coming back even in the worst of shatteredness complete shatteredness and putting your life back together into one. I think that's what makes me think about suffering. You can still go through it and be whole. So I want to do. Thank you. I wanted to explore a little more. We're just getting to the third noble truth which is the truth of the cessation of suffering and we want to weave in looking at that with the other aspect of right view that Tanya mentioned which is the view of karma or conditioning comma and what we've been touching on this just now in this sharing and in some of what Sandra was saying that that a lot of this practice is getting a feel for what is what is meant by Dukkha and what is meant by the cessation of Dukkha and what you know what is it that ceases. I think a lot of us might have unrealistic notions of when we start this practice that you know difficulty is going to cease or pain is going to cease or you know loss is going to obviously it doesn't mean that. So looking more and more deeply and subtly at what what is the conditioning that what is suffering what is that moment of contracting around some experience that's actually making it worse and instead of giving you just a little bit of space around it or a little bit of different perspective on it. So you know we can see in in beginning to stop and become aware that suffering is happening to be able to notice to be able to accept it like we were just saying to say OK just to recognize yes this is the experience of suffering gives that recognition is a little bit of space around it because that part of your mind that can recognize this is just enough out of it just eyes a little bit out of the swamp to say OK this is the human experience of suffering and if we don't go right to the blaming of you know ourselves and others like this should not be happening or there's something wrong with me or there's something you know we have to fix this with an urgent sense of urgency but allowing that feeling to be there. That's the beginning of allowing a little more internal ease that gives a different perspective and allows maybe some qualities of heart and mind that we've never experienced before a little bit of room to begin to emerge and to be the story that Bernadette told about being completely shattered and yet something you know something deep in us is pulling us along and wants us to be whole and is whole and is part of the whole and will gradually begin to emerge the less intense pressure that this should not be happening this can't be happening we have to fix this the less we can put that pressure on it right away so one thing we can start to do is appreciate moments of not suffering so when we talk about suffering so when we talk about when I first heard the Four Noble Truths the cessation of suffering I thought of it as a thing out there that would eventually happen to me you know the cessation of suffering rather than looking moment to moment at little moments when suffering was not happening so I on my first retreat this was thirty years ago I had this intense opportunity this is this is not a story that I've been I had what's called a Vipassana romance which is your honor retreat and you you know you don't see anything but people's hairstyle and socks or something but you know you manage to decide that's the one and work up a whole thing around it and so I was doing that my first retreat and it was you know it was calling my attention all the time where is that person and I was just it was calling my attention all the time where is that person is that person watching me and my watching that person and it became so tedious and then one morning I went for a walk up the hill and it was one of these beautiful blue mornings and jet trails and somehow maybe it was walking but I got up the hill and it was not there the whole and it was so clear that that that suffering around that clinging and contracting and wanting and imagining and just having my attention pulled where it was not there that I was just it was not really fruitful for it to go to have that stop it was a real feeling of cessation of suffering and it was clear to me this is not suffering you know but it didn't last I went back down the hill there was the person in and in and you know but it was so clear it was so clear the contrast you know that it helped me understand the second noble truth of our story the third noble truth it was like a real training in what might be meant by craving cause of suffering and you know that's the on the positive side and then there's also of course you know real difficulty so I just there's a beautiful passage here I want to read from Resma Manakam who's a author of a book called My Grandmother's Hands you know and he's a black American he's been through a lot and he has this to say about the difference between dirty pain and clean pain he says the paths of avoidance blame and denial are paved with dirty pain when people respond from their most wounded parts and choose dirty pain they only create more of it both for themselves and for other people clean pain is about choosing integrity over fear it's about letting go what is familiar but harmful finding the best parts of yourself and making a leap with no guarantee of safety or praise when you come out the other side of this process you will experience more than just relief your body will feel more settled and present there will be a little more freedom in it and more room to move you will experience a sense of flow you will experience a sense of flow you will also have grown up a notch you have to stand in your integrity accept the discomfort and move forward into the unknown. So this this idea of that pain is going to happen and how do we meet pain grief loss we're not we don't want to not grieve when we lose someone we love you know clean grieving is very much a part of life and and wise clean strong action in the name of justice and all sorts of things is very much a part of what we're doing so we're not we're not. Imagining some life that doesn't have difficulty and stress and strain and we're looking at in microscopic detail what are we doing with our minds in the moment that make this better or worse. And one thing I found very helpful is to is this challenge of having compassion I mean something he says here it's like finding the best parts of yourself that's true and that's what we're doing. And so how to how I find this parts language somewhat helpful so how to how to have compassion for that part of us that was has been so wounded and doesn't know what to do and yet also be the one who has the compassion the one who had the part of us that has the bigger vision that's maybe not a part it's it's the most important part of us. It's it's the blooming of the hole that can hold the parts that have been wounded so this balancing of not totally identifying with one part I find a lot of suffering comes from the clash of I should but I can't or I don't want to or I shouldn't but I want to and I seem to have to and those kind of clashes and we wind up just identifying with one part and the other and going back and forth and fueling both and creating this huge inner inner conflict so it's very helpful to sort out okay there's something in me that wants this and something in me that doesn't want this and just seeing that okay those are forces that are clashing with each other and slowly dialing down the temperature on these internal conflicts so that we have the spaciousness to hold all the reactivity that comes up within us. You know sometimes we can start to look at we can start to look at moments how are we how are we adding too much tension and you know big by noticing suffering you start to notice how you do things like just simple things like driving and you know planning your day how what's the grip you know I'm often driving like that like that's going to help you know or when you're thinking about your when you're thinking about a task you know taking the whole thing on as one like thinking out three years in one moment of how you're going to do something or you have a task like caring for someone you know you can take that one bite at a time you can think like I have a job right now where I kind of take care of the kitchen oversee the kitchen at the retreat center if I get into thinking I'm going to have to do this forever no one else wants to do this. I have to do this forever I can get quite stressed about it and thinking I don't want to do this but when I think no actually I enjoy actually cooking this dish and I enjoy cooking that dish and it's no big deal to order these groceries. No big deal to make that phone call if I just keep doing it one little step at a time it's not so bad so these habits of making big deals making mountains out of molehills you know it's such a social I don't know convention of ours to be busy all the time and to kind of glorify being busy and we wind up telling ourselves the same story so I'm so busy I'm so busy but if you took the time that you were doing some of those things and stopped slow down just one thing at a time all these are ways that I'm sure you've all heard of that begin to chip away at the internal experience of stress and bodily tension and when we're stressed and having a lot of bodily tension then the slightest little thing you know hits the wrong place and seems bigger than it is and so it all builds on itself. So there's that. So fundamentally I think right view is this move of noticing that you can you can look within and you can stop as Tanya said and start sensing and feeling what's going on with you right now and what beliefs are in place what can you just say okay this is a moment where I don't know this is the experience of not knowing. This is the experience of anxiety and not knowing what's going to happen in the future. So you know as you begin to build up the muscle of beginning to notice then after that thing you were worried about you're still here you know you got through something that maybe wasn't perfect but you've gotten through by this time in your life you've gotten through a lot of stuff that was seemed like a big deal and maybe it was but now it's over. So gradually you build up some confidence and trust in being able to to do these things. Where am I supposed to stop now probably. Okay good. So I just want to mention the class another classical aspect of right view is the three three areas of experience three aspects of experience that we're encouraged to attune to the help. And the first one of those is the the fact of change the fact of inconstancy the fact that things are beginning and ending and starting all the time. So just tuning into that finding finding how much we tend to believe and cling to our concepts of things that it will always be like this or that it will never when you hear yourself using words like always are never you know they always do that. I will never do that something like that you can notice that this is this is making a world in your own mind that's based on ideas and then expecting it to stay that way. So the more you can begin to attune it also just helps all these anything permanent is in your head. It's an idea and so the more you can relax into the moment to moment okay stepping touching walking you know brushing your teeth it begins to break down the solidity of your view of a particular situation. So coming into the body the body is a constantly moving tingling shifting the breath you know so many ways that you can begin to notice the flow of experience outside of the cookie cutter molds that our thoughts put on it. And then we're always shocked that it's not that way or we are trying so hard to force it to be that way. Right so we begin to find a kind of stability and awareness that can know no change know what's happening but not expect you know that there are concepts are going to going to do this. And then the second thing we've talked a lot about is actually attuning to Dukas so noticing the rumble strips experience noticing you know real suffering really strong suffering when you're in it noticing what that is. And then the third thing is to begin to notice how you're using how the sense of self is playing into what's going on so taking things you could say taking things less personally begin to notice the grip and the role of self. So I just one little story I had on another retreat I was having a lot of back pain and I was trying to sit through it and I decided to pretend that I was holding this pain for someone else someone who was finally getting a break and they were going to sleep because I was holding this pain for them for a while. And something really shifted and that became easier and I thought you know it was a way of just playing with what is it to hold something as mine what does that add to it and what is not mine add to it you know and that began a long exploration for me of what is what is what is this extra clinging of mine. And you know the whole area of what people think of me the amount of effort that we put into maintaining our self image images that other people have of us you know it's a lot of work in exactly those areas where it isn't quite true. Or when when we feel like we're acting in a way that we don't want to be seen so you know the more we begin to get our get forgiveness for ourselves compassion for those parts of us that act on wisely and and we do act from integrity the more the deeper a sense of okayness we have with ourselves as we are and the less we need to keep taking ourselves out and looking at it and worrying about it you know as a something how's it being seen it just is it's just how we are. And we're in the flow and we're and we have this integrity so I'll just end briefly I didn't get to the fourth noble truth but that's what the whole course is about the eightfold path so. Just in with something Stephen bachelor says who's a Buddhist writer I like Nirvana is that space within ourselves that's not determined by our impulses habits reactivity and so on and that allows the possibility of another way of life which is called the eightfold path. So clearing that space within all of us that isn't completely conditioned and determine the unconditioned is another word for me Bona you know not conditioned by all every bad thing that's ever happened to us or our addiction to every good thing that's ever happened to us. But you know we're not we're not conditioned by those things we just you know are and that allows this wisdom to flower. So I think we're both doing about half our talks today but anyway. Sandra back over to you. Thank you. So we're going to do another breakout group session. You can take the. Oh yes. I think you can give me better when you took off. Yeah. So again I'm going to read the question first. Can you think of a time when shifting your perspective your thinking or your attitude towards some situation has given you more ease with it. Even if the circumstances didn't change. I think it was a lot to what Chris. Sure. Yeah. I'll read it again. Yes. Can you think of a time when shifting your perspective your thinking or your attitude towards some situation has given you more ease with it. Even if the circumstances didn't change. When I was reading the questions they came to me. For example you're waiting in line there's a long line for something and somebody cuts the line. It's not fun especially if you've been waiting for a while. But if you change your attitude towards that you're tired you've been here like 30 minutes and that person just cut into the line like that shouldn't be later somebody here to control the situation what's going on. They say OK maybe if I look at the situation in a different way I mean it's still going to be waiting for another 30 minutes maybe. But it changes the way you are maybe you'll be have a more peaceful 30 minutes if you just look at that I mean it's it doesn't make it right. But you're switching to shifting your perspective. And just when I did sometimes all those attitudes all those reactions that we have are learned or they became a habit there's no real logic to them. It's just the way these conventions so when we can take a step back and go maybe it doesn't need it's not nice but it doesn't need to give me so much grief. So yeah so let's make groups of again three or four people maybe you can switch it up and find other other groups and we're going to go again 10 minutes. Hello everyone. I really liked both of the breakout groups and it's just it's so interesting hearing everybody's life and approach to things and and just being able to to listen because that's been my thing. I often expect my sister to listen to all of my problems or my therapist to listen and I like let me let me take a step back and I think this I think that in itself will allow me to not have such a congealed sense of self as Kirsten or as I was informed in another thing. But I didn't understand that until I was able to just be present and just hear instead of there or back there or wanting to be elsewhere which was really nice and I had just this simple not trying to craft whatever I'm speaking trying to say or think about what other people are going to think about what I'm going to say. It's just it's just really it was just as Chris had noted it's kind of oh this is kind of like not suffering and I'm just being here right now. So thank you so much. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. It's so nice when we can relax and just be there. Isn't it that we need to prove anything or show off or anything. It's just fantastic. Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. And I think something I really appreciated in our group was person was saying how uncomfortable it was to have a boss like correct and be so picky little little tiny things but that in fact that that pickiness made the person's job that made them their skill better even though I didn't enjoy it or didn't like it. To be able to step back and have that perspective and also realize that the person being so picky is probably having suffering himself or themselves and that that was helpful to. So I like that. I've allowed myself to learn patience speaking of being a line from other people in my life. So if and don't laugh my dog. Right. So you know if I need to take her or these other friends if I need a time frame you don't do it or if somebody has a point of view that is not yours and I can think about it and I they're taking. You know just I have to be patient with them if they're not on my wavelength and it's been really helpful. I'm not a patient person and it's been really helpful to just be able to step back and say I don't control everything. And sometimes I just have to go with it. And I love the dog. So it doesn't make you feel what's different when you're easier. Okay. Less frenetic. Just life is, you know, so what. And if I have to be somewhere then I make sure that I can do that without being frenetic or without or try the best I can. Anyway. Anything else. Maybe I'll just say I think. Crystal looted to this I think but it's very easy to not notice the end of suffering. And. It's actually incredibly important. And you know it's it's very nourishing to receive those gifts really actively receive them. I get an astounding awareness for me today was you know I I knew the four. Noble truths and then this I was really hoping for the promise of sensation of suffering and Chris's realization that it's her statement that it's not necessarily that suffering is going to end for me but that there will be some cycles of the end of suffering. So like a wave you know that the suffering may be here and then the wave ends and I can feel that sensation of that suffering and so that was a real kind of aha for me. Thank you. I may add that we constantly accommodating is like driving with a GPS and you start finding close straight so recalculating recalculating you all the time recalculating what is it that you're going to do isn't it. That's that's what it is. But is how is our attitude towards. How am I going to take that. So in that sense I mean life is going to continue happening. There's nothing we can do about it. We cannot control it. Control is an illusion but we can switch our attitude. We can shift the way we look at things the way we relate to things. Instead of endlessly wanting it to be different to just take it for what it is. So in that sense there's a little bit of the end of suffering. It's a daily thing. Is it is a daily thing. It's minute by minute that you experience the end of suffering. Thank you. And it does. I mean I don't want to be. So overly pessimistic about some pretty radical change that's possible you know because if you see like you were describing these waves over and over and if we really start to tune in to those moments of the ending of them. Something starts to take them less seriously. You know when the wave comes up to be able to say OK this is the way of the suffering. So that part of you that's able to see that grows and get stronger and stronger and the experience can get less. So you know it's something is learning you know not to take up things that it would have taken up before. And so you know some. Something short of the complete end of suffering for me personally but I wouldn't want to go back you know 20 years ago to the things I used to let myself get involved in and worry about and take up you know so changes definitely gradual but possible. Yeah. It's funny I was just talking about it. I'm learning to sail. It's heck of a lot of work. You get bruised and depending on the name of a small thing you both you capsize and but you write the boat you you pull you push you you might be having your own just internal struggle or you might be with the crew and the skipper. There is a roughness and there is a ties and there is current and everything. But main thing is you can be bruised all the way which it is right now all my legs. You can be hurt. You can be you know you know sliding doing whatever you need to do to get this boat going. And if you capsize you write the boat and it's very similar to life. You keep going no matter how much you bruised no matter how much you're hurt you no matter how much you fall down you write your boat you write your life and just keep going and go and go. And that's part of a suffering. You just keep going. And we can just also know that you can expand if you have other questions comments you know about you're about to launch your first month of the emails and readings and listening to the talk so we can certainly keep talking about what we've been talking about. But I just want you to know it's also space for the other comments or questions. I'm taking on you know spoke of like the joy of non toothache and I had a root canal and then like for like about 24 hours I realized the joy of non toothache and it really brought home like how normal life is you know like like just enjoy that. If just if you don't have a toothache metaphorically enjoy that. Yeah I have a question regarding right view of long standing and recurring suffering I guess and patterns. Sometimes when I try to investigate it seems I mean it's just so ingrained it's like this is just what it is. It's like looking for cracks in a huge wall or something. I'm just wondering if you have any advice on how to approach and how to view it. Thank you. Well one thing that comes to mind is the wall metaphor and it's a little bit related to the toothache thing but just see if you can catch moments when it's not happening. I don't know if your perception is that it's 24 seven happening or is it certain situations that it usually happens in or you know just beginning to notice that it's a thing that arises circumstantially due to conditions you know due to our conditioning due to things that happen that they're due to other people's conditioning situations arise. And just catching the beginning and catching the ending might help begin to penetrate the metaphor that it's a solid wall. You know so that's one thing to work with. I get so much mileage out of working with the body and noticing where in what it what is your body doing when that situation starts to happen. What you know can you feel a contraction of a certain sort and enough is that makes any sense to you. Kind of noticing if you can catch it as a movement you know or as an area of tightness then there are other times when you can work with kind of reclaiming that space in your body and noticing that movement and if it's a movement something and you can learn to not necessarily make that movement. It can be a very gradual process. Those are some thoughts. I'll just add that there's a difference sometimes we're looking when we're trying to work with suffering and a pattern of suffering. Our mind is very addicted to looking at the story instead of at the experience and there's a difference between the story and the suffering. That makes sense Kevin. So a lot of times also what we're you know there's the story and then there's the suffering and then what is the hitch. Where is the root of that clinging. I don't want it to be this way for example. Right. Like I don't like this. So here's the thing. Here's the ouch and in between is I don't like this and I don't like this is what needs our attention. We're trying to look through. I don't like this at the thing but we're this. I don't like this is filtering. So it makes sense. Am I explaining it clearly. So we really have to work with ourselves to get very clear. Where is the clinging. What is it. You know how can I look at that part. Not the big whole shebang but that clinging a hitch. So is the I don't like this the second arrow. So the first arrow is the external thing causing a suffering or provoking or whatever. And then also. So you're nodding your head. Yeah. OK. So then related to that. I christian yet the resume quote. So is the dirty suffering. Also the second arrow and then clean suffering would be the first arrow. Yeah. OK. Yeah. Yes Alex. We can. There's a simile. And the suit does where the Buddha is talking to monks about suffering. And he says now monk if I shoot you with an arrow. Will that hurt. Yes. Right. And then he says now if I shoot you with a second arrow. Will that hurt more. We have two arrows. It hurts more right. And then a third arrow and a fourth arrow. And so he's saying we don't need to add to the first level of suffering. We add all these other arrows in the form of judging ourselves not wanting things to be the way they are thinking they should be different wanting to control what we cannot control. Like for example Gil has this great very simple story. He's a Dharma teacher walking out the building stubs his toe. That's the first arrow. It hurts the second arrow is what if somebody saw me. I'm a Dharma teacher. Third arrow is oh my God I can't come back here. Right. I can't. How can I show up. I'm a fraud. Fourth arrow is I better go see if there's video footage to see if anybody was watching me. You know like we just go on and on and on. Yeah. Got it. I think you know fundamentally these all of this is this deep belief that our well being depends on the world being a certain way. You know and we're just what we're trying to find through this practice is sources of well being that transcend whatever is happening because stuff happens. It's going to keep happening. And what you know so we're finding we're finding our reactivity to these things and also we're letting little moments like like the little endings of suffering to inform us of what it is to be internally OK even though you know they might do that again or that's still happening or you know wars are going on and so forth. It's still there's a fundamental relationship to life that begins to shift that's bigger than all these little things. Just putting that out. I do. We're running a little behind. Yeah let's just just come into our meditation posture for a moment here. Just check in with yourself how are you how has this day affected you. How are you right now. Let that be just as it is just knowing knowing and sensing right now it's like this. May all the good energy that has developed through our practice today through talking with each other and looking within at your relationship to these questions may all that energy be dedicated to the welfare and happiness. The awakening of all beings everywhere. Thank you guys so much for being here and if anybody needed the handouts from last time come see me before you go. We look forward to seeing you here next month. Enjoy your study and practice and emails and mentor meetings. So boy have a good time.
