 All right, so you can just tell the lady that you know we're recording. And welcome again to happy hour. My name is Dawn Neil, I've subbed here a number of times, and it's lovely to be back with you. And tonight, I'm going to jump right in. I just have a few reflections to offer about metta loving kindness as a form of non hostility to experience. So what do I mean by that I mean, it is. Hang on one second here. I'm going to ask you to mute yourself if you're not already muted. I'm hearing some sound coming in. So metta as a non hostility to experience metta loving kindness and the ancient suttas discourses of the Buddha has a cognates of a Vera or non hatred and non hostility, even non anger. So they're often used as synonyms in the poly cannon. And I find this helpful when considering loving kindness practice and helpful in a few ways. First, in the Buddha's teachings in the Samyutta Nikaya for example, there's a story of the Buddha interacting with this man named as a Rajadha, the reviler, and this was a man who was well known for going around to different spiritual teachers or other leaders, and insulting them just insult after insult. That was kind of his thing. And so one day, Brad Baja, the reviler comes to the Buddha and just start keeping him with a verbal abuse and argument and angry words. And the Buddha just sits there calmly. Eventually the man runs out of steam. And the Buddha looks up at him and very calmly says, Tell me, sir, do you have friends or family that come over occasionally to your house. And he says, Yes, of course I do. And the Buddha then said, do they occasionally bring meals or snacks or something like that? He goes, Yes, yes. He said, Well, what would happen if they brought you a meal and you chose not to take it. And the man says, Well, it would still belong to them. And the Buddha looks at him and said, Exactly. I am not partaking of your anger, your animosity. So it still belongs to you. This is a teaching right and not picking things up. You don't have to pick up the energy, the emotion coming through us or coming to us. So that's one way the Buddha taught of addressing feelings of hostility or anger, whether they're coming up in our own hearts or whether they're coming at us in our lives is not to get entangled, not to get involved. A second way is one that my beloved Tai Chi teacher used to teach us. And that is when something is running at you or someone is running at you to very kindly, lovingly, almost with a welcoming gesture, step aside and invite it to move on through. Right. So it just invites the energy to keep going. Doesn't push against it, but invites it to use its own momentum. And then a third way of addressing anger, hostility, even grief, any of the really strong, unpleasant emotions is meeting it with love, kindness and compassion for whatever is underneath whatever is present and whatever is underneath. And that one, many of you may have heard this story, Aikido master Terry Dobson writes about this. He talks about being a young man in Japan and Tokyo and riding the subway home one day and onto the train stumbles this giant laborer, very drunk man and he just starts hurling insults at everyone in the train and really starting to kind of make this just. And this young American, a master is still in training, but he is just he is ready to be sort of fight the good fight, right? He stands up and he kind of appeals to the guy kind of waves him over and the guy is ready for a fight. They're both ready for a fight. And before they can fight this tiny little 75 year old Japanese man interrupts them and calls the drunk laborer over to him with this friendly, loving voice and just starts engaging him in conversation. And within minutes, he has the man crying and sitting next to him with his head on his shoulder because he finds the grief beneath the anger, the despair beneath the anger and hostility. So disarming can happen in all kinds of ways, non contention. So those are a few thoughts for your reflection as we go into our meditation. I'm going to put us on all on mute except for me now, and I'm going to temporarily cause no one to be able to mute or otherwise interact, at least until the meditation is over just to keep the container really kind of quiet in case we have people arriving. So, by two to sit back, take a couple of deep breaths. Just engage a little bit with the screen if that feels right to you. Be helpful with starting out by just seeing where the body is where your body is. Noticing any energy in your body. Acknowledging any thoughts or feelings roaming around the body. The heart, the mind. And then start by taking a few long slow deep breaths, maybe two thirds full. Don't try to strain your lungs, but allowing your belly, allowing your ribs to invite more air in. Allowing your body to soften. Allowing the focus to be on this body sitting or lying, whatever posture it's in, into tuning to the breath or physicality or sound. Whatever anchors your attention to this moment. And setting the intention, perhaps the determination, of non-contention with your experience for these few minutes of meditation together. Allowing, softening into the breath, the moment. Noticing sensations. Meeting what is. Allowing the heart, the mind, the body to settle on this breath. Allowing the focus to be on this moment. If you notice the mind wandering, take a moment to appreciate the returning of awareness by being as gentle and kind as possible to whatever is arising in experience. And then as you continue to attune to sensations, breathing or sound. Allowing your attention to coalesce, to gather. At the center of your chest, your core, your heart center. Especially noticing any sensations of breathing in and out there. Perhaps warmth or cool. Rising or falling. Noticing too, the feeling in the heart center, the emotional quality, whatever's there right now. It's all okay. Perhaps imagining as if you could breathe through your chest, in and out of the heart. Even in and out of the back, on the other side of the heart. Massaging, softening. Inviting gentleness with whatever is. Inviting the energy of whatever's here to flow through. Not picking it up. Not pushing it away, but allowing. And if this feels natural, nourishing, feel free to stay here with this. Practice of non-contention, gentleness with what is. And if it feels useful, perhaps bringing in an image or felt sense of someone or some being, real or sacred, human or animal. But someone, some presence that simply makes your heart smile. Just allowing a sense of this other one to fill your heart and mind. Imagining, making contact with them in some way. A gesture. A word. By seeing. Just a felt sense of presence with you, near you. Noticing any changes in your heart. Perhaps a sense of warmth, appreciation, friendliness, affection. And allowing that to be there. Perhaps breathing it out towards this other one on the out breath. If it's helpful to focus these kind, warm intentions. Perhaps using words or phrases. May you be safe. Be happy. Be healthy. Be peaceful. Easeful. Free. Repeating these words, neither of singular intentions. That be healthy, peaceful, easeful, free. Any of those intentions. Or using your own words, your own language. Perhaps one breath for one phrase or word at a time. Offering kindness. Easeful. Perhaps imagining the breath bearing these words and intentions. Rippling through your own body on its way out to this other one. Rippling through your own heart and mind. Perhaps receiving any sense of goodness, kindness. Warm through friendliness that arises. Or perhaps receiving from this other one. Noticing sensations. Sensations of offering kindness. Or sensations of breathing. Say. Happy. Healthy. Peaceful. Free. Now if you're focused on this other one. Allowing the attention to lens outward. Backward a little as if taking a step back and inviting in. Inviting in this heart and mind. Yourself. To join in the good wishes, the receiving of the good wishes with this other one. May we be safe. Happy. Healthy. May we be peaceful. Free. Free. Allowing a sense of kindness. And welcoming. Allowing through all of your heart and mind and body. Allowing the image or felt sense of this other one to fade to the background. Allowing the sense of kindness. Welcoming to suffuse all parts of this heart and mind. All that arises. Meeting it. Of love, kindness. Or perhaps stepping aside to allow it to move through. Or simply not picking up anything. Flow with the metta in and out. All through the body and heart. All right. And sharing with words or phrases if it's still supportive. Or perhaps allowing a silent sense of luminous friendliness, kindness. Or simply pervade, spread in all directions within and through this being beyond. Allowing, allowing, flowing with what arises. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. And evoke a sense of imagination shining perhaps, metta shining like a star. Perhaps a fusing through the space around you like a gentle rolling fog. Going as near or as far. This feels right. And today. Welcoming all that arises in the mind and heart. At least allowing no fight, no contention. And again, renewing that intention for others. We all be safe. All beings be happy. He is full and free of harm and causing harm. Competing the words that feel true or right for your heart to aspire to. Or just radiating silently, allowing, allowing that to. Be happy. And now in the last moment of this meditation, letting go of any intention to generate anything, to make anything. Just basking in this moment, this breath, allowing whatever rises and passes to flow through. Just basking being with. Thank you all for your practice. I'm going to allow you to unmute. Let me just a moment here. I just want to invite any, any of you who feel like it to say or to put in the chat. Any responses, any sense of what that evokes, anything you want to share with the group. Hi. I'll break the silence. I liked how you just kind of had a sit with Neda, you know, as opposed to saying all the loving kindness affirmations which can be nice too but that was kind of new for me. Just kind of sitting with Neda that whole time and kind of breathing that in. That was helpful. Different people have different relationships to the phrases. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's good to learn to do a little bit about. Did you notice a difference for yourself. Yeah, yeah, I could kind of just feel my body, listening up, you know, and kind of struggling with some stuff right now so just letting go and breathing and just kind of allowing that made it to come in, you know, like, beautiful, beautiful I'm glad that it came in. Making space for made a, you know, as opposed to all this other stuff in life. That's kind of what I makes me think of. Great. Yeah. It is a beautiful offering and it's also. Wow, what a difference it is from some of the other stuff we have going on in our minds right now. Yeah. Sometimes my mind would stray and then I come back, you know, and Thank you. Thanks. Any other comments. I had a question. Yes. Hi, Anthony. I just wanted to, first of all say it was very soothing, you know, it's very meditation, and I had a question regarding the meta living kindness. Would you consider it more along, some mata some mata, or the pass in a. That is a great question, Anthony. So the short answer is, it depends on how you're practicing it. So I have experienced it as both at different times in my own practice my kind of intensive introduction to meta was in Burma on a two month intensive retreat and that was kind of designed to build concentration. And that's a very beautiful thing. Shama to serenity concentration as you were saying, even when it's being used as a Shama to practice. Many people find I certainly did that there's a certain amount of mindfulness that has to be cultivated, just in order to cultivate the Shama to the serenity, because at minimum we have to be able to recognize as Leanne was saying when she was with the meta and when something else was there right like that in itself is already sati mindfulness. So, there's always some of both. And the way I led that meditation I tried to incorporate some of both for whoever was in the room. When it's more of a person a practice in my own experience, it is when it's a little bit more of that wordless meta, and it generates a field of the kindness or benevolence or non contention that makes anything that isn't meta stand out in very sharp relief. And that becomes its own practice it can work with any of the Brahma the horrors any of the heart qualities that way. And I'm curious for you have you found it more one or the other. Yeah, I think for me it's a. Yeah, like you said both, but I would have to say the majority of some matter. Okay, beautiful. Yeah, yeah, different seasons for the practice right depending on where we're, where we are in our own practices. Thank you. You're welcome. So I am going to send you all off, those of you who are willing to stay around and I encourage you to stay around and to breakout rooms. Some people it's their favorite part of this evening and other people leave every time. So, no judgment, either way. But I'm going to give you about six seven minutes. So, just the invitation to talk about perhaps what the meta practice was for you tonight or what it's been in your practice overall. And if you want to pick up on the theme of non contention, letting things move through invitation is to do that to see in a little while. Thank you. And more coming back in. I just wanted to ask you for a moment or two if anyone has the wish to share about things that came up for you in the conversation ideas, comments, bits of wisdom insights complaints. So I know from being in these breakout rooms that people actually talk in them. And it's always this mystery even when I'm a participant, why nobody wants to talk about it afterwards. Sometimes. Okay. Any last thoughts before we part ways friends. It's always nice when you're here, I appreciate you doing this. Just, you know, thank you. This lovely meditation. Thank you. Great to see everyone. Thank you. Thanks for your practice. May all beings benefit. I love what you think.
