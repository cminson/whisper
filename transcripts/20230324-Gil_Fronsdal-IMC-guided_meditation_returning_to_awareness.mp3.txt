 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. The Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California So warm greetings to all of you. And as part of this wonderful community of ours, of 7 a.m. meditators and the one who does the most speaking, maybe I can represent all of you and offer that welcome on behalf of all of you. So we're all welcoming each other and have a sense of being included by the whole community. So thank you for being here. And I want to start with an analogy. Say that you're going to go do some exercise, maybe go to the gym, and you really enjoy exercising. You need to exercise. There's a physical kind of thing you're trying to heal from or something. And so you're determined and motivated and everything is good. You go there and as you're going into the gym, you're thinking about, yeah, just see other people working out. This is good to work out. It's a certain vitality and engagement. This is really a healthy thing for people. You think about a friend of yours who really needs to work out, maybe for many reasons. And so you're thinking about your friend, you care about your friend, you have compassion for your friend, and you want to help your friend. And so you walk by a little lobby part of the gym and there's some magazines. And maybe there's a magazine, big headlines, working out and health or something, just like what you're concerned for your friend. So you pick up the magazine and you go sit on maybe a little couch on the back wall of the gym. You hear people working out. And for the hour you had to work out, you read this magazine, another magazine, and all caring for you to think about your friend. And then your hour is up and then you realize, wait a minute, I didn't exercise at all. I spent the whole time thinking about my friend. I could have worked out. I need to work out. And I could have done the reading magazine or looked into it later. In fact, I didn't really learn that much by looking at these magazines. So I give this analogy for coming to meditate. We're here to meditate, kind of a mental working out, if you may. And if you start thinking, have compassionate thoughts for people who are challenged and you start thinking about how to help them and do things for them. And you spend the whole meditation in this kind of planning mind, discursive mind, thinking about them. In a sense, maybe for that meditation session, you're not meditating at all. You're not doing it for the practice. You're doing, thinking about a friend. In the context of meditation, of course you might think about a friend who's suffering and of course you might think about how to help them or do something for them. But in the context of meditation, the most significant way to respond to the suffering of the world that we experience and feel is actually not to use meditation as a time to plan and think about what to do. Rather, if to really prepare ourselves for doing and acting later, the powerful thing is to act in a certain way. And that is to go back, recognize what's happening to you, recognize concerns, recognize the feelings that are there, recognize the impulse, the aspiration to help. These are all good. And then, fold it all back in to your workout, to your practice. And these steps we've been doing this week around compassion are a great series of steps to do. To fold it back into your practice. Come back and just rest in awareness, being aware of how you're feeling. Be aware of the sensations in the body of the compassion, the care, the concern you have for your friend and what it feels like in your body to have a desire to do something. Just be aware of what's happening for you. As you're aware, become attuned to yourself. Find harmony with yourself. And to go ahead long into planning and thinking about the friend is actually a way of losing touch with oneself. Meditation is a way of being profoundly in touch with oneself here and to be attuned to this person. And if you're suffering, attune to your suffering. If you're not suffering, being attuned to the sensations and feeling, what's happening. Appreciate. Appreciate yourself. Appreciate what's happening. Respect it deeply. But don't give in to it. Don't fall into it. Don't spin out with it. And then here have an aspiration. Maybe the aspiration is, in fact, to care for the suffering of oneself and for others. And then in meditation you can do it again and again. And so you're actually building repeated cycles. You're actually building the kind of foundation that allows compassion to grow. That allows, that sets the ground for cleaner and greater, simpler, straightforward compassion to be there for later. If you go ahead long into, I need to fix the problem, I need to help the problem, I need to do something and start planning it. At times that's useful, but not when you're working out in the gym. Then you want to sit deeply and come back, do the cycle again and again, to purify, to clarify, to simplify how it is for you. So that we're freeing ourselves from the distractions of discursive thinking about it. We're freeing ourselves from looking at the magazines rather than doing the exercise. And by doing the exercise something strengthens inside of us. Then later we'll give birth to a greater capacity for compassion and greater capacity for how to act. So to assume your meditation posture and gently close your eyes and to, without anything else, begin your meditation. And if the occasion is right for it, go through the first four As of the five As of this week. Cultivate awareness, attunement, appreciation, aspiration. And maybe in meditation the aspiration is to be present, be here. The aspiration is to keep cultivating greater awareness of the present moment, greater attunement to the present moment, greater appreciation of the present moment, and letting the aspiration to do so be simpler, clearer, more harmonious, more supportive of going through this process again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If you're thinking, if you're reading the magazine, begin the cycle of aware, attuned, appreciative, and aspiring to be here and present, not lost in thought. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And if while meditating you have any suffering, stress, tension about something, offer yourself these five steps. Be aware in a deep way. Attune yourself in a useful way. Appreciate yourself in a supportive way. Have the wish, the aspiration, that you be free of the suffering. And then act, and the act we do in meditation is to do the first four again, go through the cycle. Just keep deepening with it, expanding it, quieting the mind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then as we come to the end of this meditation, to appreciate that meditation is a time to be inward, inward focus to our own experience here and now, and to maybe do it so deeply, so fully, that we are turned inside out so that there is a deeper sensitivity and availability to the world. And to let now the attention go out into the world, aware of the joys and sorrows that are so extensive in the world, to be attuned to certain kind of harmony of heart with all the joys and sorrows, to never forget, to appreciate and respect all people in the world. And to allow the heart's aspiration to bubble up, the heart's aspiration to care for suffering wherever it's encountered. And when we encounter it in the world around us, to aspire that suffering comes to an end. And then action, may each of us aspire to do at least small actions to make this day a better day for others. May each of us alleviate, lighten the suffering of others through even the smallest acts, smiles, checking in, how are you, offering a small gift, being aware, attuned, and appreciative of others. That itself is a gift that alleviates suffering. It doesn't have to be more complicated. And if you know if nothing else is relevant, your act to support the world is to go back to being aware, attuned, and appreciative. The benefits of doing so will spread out into the world. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you.
