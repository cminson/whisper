 of this period. Doing just that, getting that sense of being settled and relaxed. And one can take a few moments and literally actively bring relaxation to the body, to the mind. And sometimes it can be helpful even just to use imagery. Whatever it takes for you to get that sense of letting go, relaxing all the muscles of the body, and yet being alert. So if that's warm water or cool water, imagine yourself in it. Or if it's just space or some image of floating, that can work too. Or perhaps you can recall your last massage and just get that sense of that all over relaxation of the physical form. If there are places that are tight, you can turn to them and just by bringing the awareness to that part of the body, you'll notice that there's a release. The muscles will just relax. The awareness is enough. So this relaxation is critical to the meditation practice. How are you going to receive what goes on with the body? How are you going to receive what goes on with the mind? There isn't some semblance of physical acceptance as sort of expressed in the relaxed posture. Then all we'll do is contract around things that arise. So it's very important to take time at the beginning of each sitting and many times throughout the day. Just breathe and relax. Everything is much easier from a relaxed posture. You'll find that the capacity to cultivate this will serve you well, especially when dealing with difficult states of mind. If we aren't relaxed, we just get completely consumed by these. The effort has to be to relate to them from a much more spacious place than this contracted clinging and holding. So the idea, if you can get a sense of it, is to just get so relaxed that all of space is filled by your very being. And so there's nothing that you can't receive. Resting in awareness. Awareness doesn't care what arises. Awareness just receives it all the same. So it's not critical when we're caught in difficult states. It's not ecstatic or elated when we're caught in very pleasant states. It's all the same. And that's the state of mind that we want to cultivate. So relaxation is very important. Settle back and relax and receive. And then of course attend. Pay attention. These are the rudiments of the meditation practice. Everything that we need to know, everything that we need to see, every way that we need to relate, comes out of our capacity to relax, receive, attend. So just cultivating this throughout this practice period. Anytime you notice that you're tightening or not attending, just to recognize that that moment of noticing that means you're already back. You're already attending. Just soften and keep paying attention.
