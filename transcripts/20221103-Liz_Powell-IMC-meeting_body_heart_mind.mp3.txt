 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good evening, everybody. Or morning, afternoon, wherever you are. I'm very happy to see all of you. Welcome. For some of you, it's late in the evening. Yeah. So this evening, just giving people time to arrive, but I'll share that I've been spending the last, some time in the last hour watching the snowfall where I live. And it's one of my favorite things to do. Besides being out walking in it. And I've had one of those days that actually is really good for reflection, for saying meta phrases and compassion phrases and just extending those to all that's happening in my life and in my heart. So I thought we'd start right into the meditation this evening and do a longer than usual meditation. And I'll give some guidance or some ways that we might reflect. But just starting right off the bat and allowing yourself to find some way of sitting that's supportive for what your bodily energy and mental energy needs right now. Maybe taking some breaths, long breaths, deep breaths, normal breaths, whatever supports you. To settle in and notice how you are right in this moment. Sometimes we're bringing a couple of aspects of ourselves to each meditation. There are all the conditions that have led up to this moment of being how we are in this body, heart and mind. And there's the way it's showing itself right in this moment. Sometimes that can be very pronounced and obvious. And other times what we're noticing in the body, the heart, the mind is subtle. It might be quiet or even sometimes feel more like just being aware, being spacious. Whatever it is that you're noticing right now, allowing yourself to appreciate with kindness, with compassion, that that's how things are in this moment, how things have come to be in this moment. And as long as awareness is meeting it, awareness does not have any preference or any judgment about what is happening. Mindfulness welcomes it all. It can be helpful to spend some time aware of the body, the breath, and whatever is present in the body right now. The body might be in a state of health or illness. It might be feel strong or weak or anywhere in the range of those things. May this body that has been working so hard for us today and every day that we've been alive, may this body feel the compassion, the care, the appreciation. May conditions for healing and for as much health as is currently available to it, may those conditions be present for the body, may this body heal, may this body heal cared for and comforted. Perhaps extending some appreciation to whatever level of energy is showing itself right now in the body. The body may have very strong surge of energy or active energy or anywhere along the range to a very quiet, very low energy, and yet just enough that we can be present in the body, be with it, appreciate the hard work that it's doing. May this body be safe and free from harm. Thank you. Appreciating the possibility of safety just in this practice of awareness, this being with the body in whatever state it's in. There's some safety of the mind and the mindfulness supporting the body's current condition. Letting the attention take in any way that feeling is being expressed in the body. There are all the nerves and blood vessels, veins, arteries, all the sensory aspects of the body. Feeling its own aliveness. And there's also the way that pleasant, unpleasant, and neither pleasant nor unpleasant experiences may be currently felt in the body. Allowing awareness to appreciate that level of the life of the body and heart, mind as well. May awareness receive feeling in the body with kindness and with care. Whatever feeling is present, may we hold it with kindness and appreciation. The capacity to be mindful, even of the unpleasant, is compassion. Compassion for experience, to be aware of it. And sometimes sensation in the body or feeling the body might be so subtle that it doesn't feel like we're feeling anything. There's just a sense of availability, awareness. Appreciating that with kindness, appreciating the compassion of the awareness and the body simply being quietly available to us. There's a phrase of kindness or compassion that would apply to your particular situation in terms of your body. The feeling in your body, the state of health. Feel free to send those kind, compassionate wishes to this body. May this body be in whatever you'd like to wish it. May I be kind to any limitations this body has. And may I be grateful for any strengths it has. Thank you. If there's a specific emotion or set of emotions being felt, allowing awareness to take those in with kindness, with appreciation, that mindfulness knows the full range of human emotion. May I be present with these emotions, with kindness, with appreciation, with compassion. Thank you. And may I be present with these emotions, with respect to the mind of their particular emotions that are surfacing, that really want extra attention and care from you. May I be of support to those feelings in this moment. May I hold these vulnerable feelings with care or any other statement of appreciation or compassion that's right for you. Thank you. And again, appreciating that even if any emotion is very subtle or simply one of calm and spaciousness, appreciating the availability of mindfulness to notice that very open, very spacious feeling. Or if the emotion is quite powerful and in some way there's some tightness around it, appreciating the capacity of mindfulness to be present with that. Care for it. Thank you. Appreciating and taking in any state of mind that is present, qualities of mind. The mind might be alert. It might be foggy. It might be tired. It could be quite focused or distracted. The mind could be expansive. Or it might be contracted. Whatever the overall state of mind, allowing awareness to appreciate its presence, know it, and extend some appreciation for it, kindness towards it, or compassion. May these states of mind enter and flow, arise and pass an awareness with some equanimity, some compassion. This is the nature of mind. May this mind be present with all its arising and passings, with compassion, with some equanimity. If the mind is very active with thoughts, allowing yourself to step back and simply be aware that the mind is very active right now, not a problem. May I have compassion for the thinking mind. May I be kind towards this thinking mind. And allowing yourself to send any kind wish or compassionate wish that might be supportive for this particular mind in this particular moment. Thank you. And for the remainder of this meditation, taking as much time as any aspect of you, body, heart, mind, needs or is arising, allowing and saying whatever phrases are most supportive. May this heart, mind, body be well and healthy. May it be free of harm and may it be safe. May it be happy. May it be free of suffering. And any other creative phrases you wish to extend to yourself this evening. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Something I find fascinating is I happen to love Dharma talks and I love ones that are especially cram packed with information. I also really love reading and being very active every day. But there's also this place where allowing yourself to simply be present with what's arising in this heart, mind and body is a huge part of practice. It's so important. And as a culture, I would say we tend not to give ourselves very much space and time for that. So there's a great value in simply allowing space and time for what wants to be seen right now and for the process of coming back again and again to whatever is showing up and also to saying whatever kinds of phrases of kindness, compassion and support are needed that particular day, that particular moment. So also want to say it's amazing what you can observe during one meditation session. So from the beginning of this session until now, I can feel my body coming down with a cold. It's wild sometimes what shows up. So what I'd like to give you time for now, of course, is having plenty of time to spend with one another in small groups. And in these groups, it's so precious to be able to be heard and to spend time listening deeply to one another without any particular agenda or any need to comment or say anything to each other, but accept what you want to share of your own experience. And the other thing I want to say about this is, you know, I've said if you find yourself alone in a breakout room, I will find you and put you in another room. But it's good too if other people happen to leave early. Feel free to come back to the main room and let me know and I'll put you in one of the rooms that are still going. So with that, I'm going to create these rooms and you'll have 15 minutes to share with one another and then come back after that. So enjoy the time with each other. Thank you.
