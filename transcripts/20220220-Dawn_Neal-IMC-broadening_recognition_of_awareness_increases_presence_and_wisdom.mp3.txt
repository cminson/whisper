The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So welcome everyone. Morning.
So I'm going to start this talk with a story. This is from the kind of fables, the myths of early
Buddhism called the Jataka Tales. And it is the story, it's sort of a story within a story.
There's the Buddha, who is in a retreat with several very senior monks. And during the retreat,
four or five of them experienced full awakening. And before he comes to speak with them after
they break the silence, they're talking. And each of them was doing a different practice. So some
were meditating on the four elements that some of you have heard about. Others are practicing
with breathing or different aspects of their experience, like their senses, eyes, ears,
nose, taste. And their experiences of awakening are different. And they're confused by this. And
they ask him when he comes, and he tells them this story, that in the distant past, the king of
Varanasi had four princes. And in conversation with these princes, a certain sort of very unusual
tree came up. And it was like a kinsuka tree in Pali, but that would roughly translate as a
what do you call it tree, right? Okay, so it's kind of goofy, whatever it is. And he describes it a
little bit to them, and they're all fascinated by the idea of seeing this tree. But, you know,
princes are busy. And, you know, even though they didn't have iPhones, they had full schedules.
So one at a time, at different times, the charioteer took them to this distant forest to see
this tree. And eventually, maybe six months later, a year later, they're in conversation again,
and this tree comes up. And each of them describe how they saw the tree. And one says, well, it was
kind of like a charred stump with just these little green specks on it, little buds. And the
other goes, no, no, no, we saw something different. We saw a tree with flame-like leaves all over it.
And yet another one said, well, no, I saw a brown tree with big wonpy fruit. And then the last one
was like, no, this was like a shrub with these gorgeous flowers all over it. And the king just
sort of looks at the princes and said, why didn't any of you ask the charioteer about what kind of
conditions were at play around this tree? That's the same tree. It's in different seasons with
different amounts of water. And I like this story because what the Buddha is pointing to by telling
it to his monks is there are all these different kinds of ways that awakening can show up and that
practice shows up. And the experience can look different, depending on how we're practicing the
big awakening, but also the little awakenings of awareness too, right? So tonight, I'm going to talk
about one of these methods, one of these practices, or today this morning, I'm going to talk about one
of these methods, which is recognizing the many, many different forms that mindfulness,
mindful awareness, or awareness can take, I'm using those terms synonymously. So this is what the
Buddha calls the third foundation of mindfulness and kind of shading into the fourth. That's not
familiar to you, you don't have to track it, but it's quality of our minds and quality of how
we relate to what's in them, basically. And just like the watchma call it tree, awareness can show
it very differently, depending on the different conditions. And depending on what's being observed,
whether it's breath or sound, or emotion, can feel different. It's kind of like old landscape
painters understood this very well, like the quality of light happening in a day. You don't
notice it as much if it's just a cloudless sky, right? But if there's clouds, trees, rocks, houses,
fields, the quality of light becomes apparent through what it strikes. The same is true of
awareness and what we're aware of. So part of broadening and maturing awareness practice,
mindfulness practice, is recognizing all of these different forms that awareness can take. And I'm
going to describe them as different experiences, but but in reality, they all shade into each other,
they all overlap, they're like a continuum even. And they're all good. I'm going to go through them
progressively, but there's no need to rank them because any complete moment of mindfulness is an
opening and a possibility into waking up. So broadly, in the next few minutes, I'm going to
describe mindful awareness as the tree with the buds, with the weeds, with the flowers and with
the fruit. And then I'm going to talk for a few minutes about the forest. So moment to moment
mindfulness is like those little buds on that tree. One breath at a time, one sensation at a time,
noticing each one and its particularity as it comes up and as it goes away. Most of us begin
to notice this process when we first start sitting meditation, and it can feel a little bit like
labor to bring the mind back to it, right? We can also notice another example of this is
sensations, which broadly might be, you know, back pain, for example, like a spot in my back. But
when I really look closely, it's all these scintillating little star like sensations coming
and going, and there's not actually a border around it. But just moving in and out, coming and
going. Sometimes with moment to moment mindfulness, little bursts of many moments in a row will happen.
This sometimes happens when sitting, right? It feels like it's going usefully flowing. That's a
certain kind of momentum. And there's another kind of momentum to which you may have noticed,
which is throughout your day, or maybe innocent, a little bit of awareness will just pop in without
you doing anything at all. Just arises. Another form of this, like, simple level of mindfulness
is something I call wholehearted presence or openhearted presence. And this is where everything
is more of a wash. It's the completeness. It's just the sense of being present here now. So
there's not any particular object of attention. Rather, there is just a sense of being here.
And in daily life, this can manifest as attuning mindfulness when there's more going on,
rather than trying to track, for example, I'm not going to try to track my breathing when
I'm driving, right? I'm focused on driving. It can also mean noticing, like for example,
when I am walking with a friend, just, oh, here I am walking with my friend. It's being
present at the very simplest level. It's also the capacity to simply be with whatever is
going on. Right? So if intense emotion is arising for me, being with that, just being
with it. So there's a way of lensing in and out between these two different forms of moment
to moment awareness. I remember, like, I had set a long, long retreat, actually two long
retreats, one at IMS in Massachusetts and the second one in Burma. And when I got back,
my awareness was attuned to all the little changes in each moment, very subtle. Well,
shortly after that, I started volunteering as a hospital chaplain. I felt like I'd been,
I was a violin that had been thrown into a frenzy dance floor. It was just like, and
it's because I hadn't yet learned to pull back, open the lens of awareness and just
take in the whole wash of what was happening. And as soon as that happened, it felt quite
useful. So there's this focusing in and pulling outwards. Sometimes this simple meeting of
mindfulness as it is, can just feel like a brightening, or perhaps like a gong striking.
Just richer flavors and food. And moments of clarity can arise inside of this kind of
like shooting stars when we get those meteor showers. I went up to a look of the horror
a few years ago, this was pre COVID, and was hanging out with some of my friends there.
And we were lying in this field at night, looking up at the stars. And every once in
a while, a meteor would go by, right? But then just like when mindfulness momentum builds,
we started getting more and more and more of these one after another, one after another
showering through. So when continuity of mindfulness builds, these shooting stars can happen more
and more often. And every now and then, no matter how often they happen, a bigger star
might come through a bigger meteor. Oh, insight can happen at any minute. So second level
of attention. If you want to imagine the tree again, perhaps the tree leafing out. This
is the step back in awareness. So there's this massive difference. When there's even
the slightest difference between an experience and the knowing of it. I was walking with
a dear friend recently, and she had started a mindfulness practice kind of recently. And
I asked her what have you noticed what's different. And she said, it's so huge. When I'm stressed,
I can just notice that I'm stressed. Right, that distance, no longer being hooked into
the story that the stress is making, but just like, Oh, stress, okay. Or Oh, relaxation.
Stephen Covey has been known to describe Victor Frankl's understanding as in this quote that
he found in a library stack somewhere, roughly it states, between stimulus and response is
a space. And within that space, there's a choice. And therein lies freedom. Right. One
of the things that can really help make space is a sense of humor in the practice, playfulness.
And I used to think I was kind of cheating by doing this. On long retreats, I would sort
of invent these things. So I'll tell you one, like, there was this one retreat that I was
just really caught up in resentment about something for the life of me, I have no idea
what it was anymore. But that grudge was just kind of weighing on the mind and pulling it
in. And eventually the mind made it into this little troll, like this little squat, you
know, with ears and hair coming out the ears and just really hammed it up and made it silly.
And imagine the troll stomping back and forth as being the grudge. And that created enough
distance from the experience to be able to hold it lightly. And eventually, it just went
away. Right. And like I said, I kind of thought I was cheating about this until I heard Joseph
Goldstein talk about playing kind of Atari with his thoughts and like shooting and letting
them kind of explode and disappear. So there's all these different ways of being playful that
can help create this second level of attention, the knowing we're aware of the knowing that
we're in an emotional state. Holding it lightly. You get to the flowering of awareness. What
in the Satipatana Sutra, the Four Foundations for Awareness, the Four Establishments of Mindfulness.
That's called full awareness. And it talks about how a practitioner among knows when
they're moving, when they're reaching, when they're eating, when they're using the bathroom,
all these different daily activities. It's, for us, maybe walking, I know I'm walking,
for the refrigerator door, I know I'm reaching. Right. That's at the body level. But this
full awareness, this mindfulness of context applies also to other things like what kind
of practice is helpful in this moment? For example, what's helpful now? Then there's
the awareness of conditions also fits into this. This full awareness I'm describing,
the Pali is Sati Sampajana. And the Sampajana is the mindfulness of context, the bigger
picture. So what kind of practice is helpful when I'm driving, maybe it's just driving,
maybe it's seeing, right? Or having a tough day, maybe it's loving kindness. Mindfulness
of conditions is part of this as well. And that could be as knowing the effects of what
my mind or heart is doing on my body, softening in the chest, relaxation, or a quenching in
the neck, tension, but noticing the relationship between these things. It's noticing our kind
of internal ecosystem, the internal system of interactions that's happening.
Then we get to sort of the tree bearing fruit, which is another level of Sati Sampajana,
mindfulness and full awareness, lucid awareness, as it starts to shade towards a wisdom or
discernment. And this is discernment, one level of this discernment, it's the quality
of the heart and mind at the moment, right? It can be the quality of awareness, how spacious
is it or how contracted is it? Is there distraction or concentration? Is there greed or contentment?
Just as simple as that. Sometimes too, there's almost a spatial component to it. For some
people I know where it's like, the awareness can feel close in and intimate, or it can
feel like surfing the sensations of the changes in the body and the mind can be kind of floating
or very grounded, vast like the sky or as tiny as a little pinhole. Sometimes it even feels
like being immersed in reality, like that fish swimming through water, suddenly realizing
there's water there. It can even feel like being steeped, like there's no separation,
awareness inward and outward. So there's another kind of discernment too, which is perhaps
more helpful even, which is discernment of what's helpful and unhelpful in our minds
and hearts. What's helpful is that which leads to greater benefit for ourselves and
others. What's unhelpful leads to greater affliction. There's a few teachings in the
ancient texts, the Pali Canon, where the Buddha talks about this. He teaches his son in one
of them, and he just talks about a wise person in another. A wise person is one who acts
for benefit for themselves, for others, for themselves and others and all concerned. An
unwise person builds affliction in themselves, affliction in others, affliction in both and
for all concerned. And the Buddha suggests dividing thoughts and meditation kind of along
these lines. On one side are the afflictive thoughts, and on the other side are the beneficial
thoughts. And he suggests keeping very close watch when there are afflictive thoughts happening,
because there can be a cascade effect, right? He talks about it being like a cowherd who
keeps the cows away from the neighbor's crops very carefully. There's also when things
are good, noticing that too, but appreciating it, allowing it to grow, to extend. Mindfulness
in these contexts is sometimes described as a gatekeeper who is guarding a walled city.
The Buddha was alive in the Bronze Age, so there were more like, I think, individual towns
or cities with protection around them. And the gatekeeper knows the way for the important
messengers to go straight to the king. He also has discernment in recognizing who's
coming in that the king's guards might want to keep a closer eye on, or in extreme circumstances,
who's trying to enter that he shouldn't let enter at all. And our minds can be like that,
too, the mindfulness, the discerning quality of our minds. It can just be as simple as
not now, or I'm just not going to go there, right?
Simple qualities of the mind are also balanced by awareness, kind of like a chariotier keeps
horses in sync. That's how it's described in the ancient teachings. There's a quote
that Jack Cornfield, I believe, has said, I believe quoting Annie Lamont, the writer,
saying, my mind is like a bad neighborhood. I try not to go there alone. So these helpful
qualities of mind are sometimes considered to be like seven friends. This is a poem based
on the early teachings of the first ordained monastic women in the Buddha's order. And
this book is poems based on that by Maddie Weingast, called the First Free Women. And
in it, this awakened woman, because they are awakening poems, is saying, I was forever
getting lost until one day the Buddha told me, to walk this path, you will need seven
friends, mindfulness, curiosity, courage, joy, stillness, calm, and perspective. For
many years, these friends and I have traveled together, sometimes wandering in circles,
sometimes taking the long way around. Oh, my heart, you don't have to go it alone. Train
yourself to train just a little more gently. Those seven friends are the seven factors
of awakening. And that translation is a little bit different than the normal one. So gentle,
gentle attention helps in recognizing all of these different forms of awareness. So
there's another broadening of this Sati Sampajana, this full awareness, which is to notice the
forest around the tree. Venerable Analyo highlights how important it is to balance internal awareness,
which we talk about a lot here, with external awareness, awareness of other people, living
beings, or life forms, awareness of our environment. And he says one of the reasons it's so important
to balance internal and external is that there can be an over focus on this self, an over
self absorption that happens if it all becomes about my experience. That can be balanced quite
beautifully if we start noticing and practicing external mindfulness of others and their experience.
So while it can be helpful for to notice one thing at a time in this body, that tree that
I keep mentioning, it's also helpful to have the entire surrounding ecosystem in mind.
In the hidden life of trees, wallabong author talks about how trees actually communicate
through their roots with each other and send out signals. Sometimes they're helped by
the fungi beneath the forest floor. They send each other nutrients, warnings. They even
help prop each other up quite literally when they're in this kind of symbiotic relationship.
Noticing others being present for others is another way of building a symbiotic relationship,
a mutually helpful relationship. And this kind of awareness really draws on awareness
of ourselves, right? So I might notice a person's posture or expression and be able
to infer a certain kind of, you know, with humility with lack of certainty, a certain
kind of perhaps awareness or emotional state or gosh, they look like they might be going
through something. Maybe I should check on them like just so noticing with humility,
with the possibility that, you know, I'm seeing this, am I off here? Right? I could be wrong.
That is one way to start noticing external, noticing people's body movements is a much
easier way, like how they're walking, if they're walking, sitting, close or far. But
all of this can draw on the wisdom, the mindfulness that has been learned inside our bodies,
right? And that is tracking also internal and external awareness. Those of you who
are healthcare professionals or work with people, maybe therapists, coaches, whatnot,
we use this all the time, checking in with our own experience to get a sense of how to
read the room. It's like a stringed instrument. When a really heavy truck drives by and the
building shakes, the stringed instrument might hum in resonance, right? We're also humming
in resonance with everyone around us. Our nervous systems are the instrument, our hearts
are the instrument. Noticing this provides space for something
known as a non-complimentary response. So this means, for example, I don't have to meet
anger with anger. And my day job, one of my jobs is a hospital
chaplain. And there are times where there might be a visiting family member that's
very upset, really angry or grieving. And there's something so powerful about being
able to be with that person and feel that resonance without getting pulled into it.
It enables a sense of compassionate calm in meeting them. And it can transform things
and help someone get further through their process. Or if they're upset, it can help
them calm down very quickly. Because my instrument isn't caught in their instrument's tune.
I'm aware of it. I'm responding to it. But I'm able to be with... And each of us has
this capacity. There's also times when one's impact on others maybe isn't so clear.
Maybe I'm caught up in my head or I'm busy or I'm in a rush or something like that.
And then we can notice how people are showing up in relationship to us as a mirror to our
own behavior. Lily Tomlin talks about how this famous quote, people will forget what
you said. They will forget what you did. But they will never, ever forget how you made
them feel. Right? And we can often see it on people's spaces in their bodies if something
was a little off. It's important to say here too that this internal, external awareness,
this perceptions of other people is also precisely where bias can come in, our own filters.
So those can distort the mirrors and they can also filter our perceptions, including
what we are even able to see, what's even able to be seen at all. And how we see it.
Like a number of you, I sat a lot of home retreat in the last two and a half plus years
of this COVID pandemic. And I just remember on this one retreat, it was during an informal
time between sittings and I was like, walking through my apartment. And the back wall of
the apartment has a lot of windows on it. And one of them looks out onto a porch that
my neighbor also has access to. And my eyes lit on a form on the porch, you know, kind
of brilliantly lit by the sunlight. And almost before I could perceive what it was, there
was a version. And I could just because my mind was quiet, I could just watch the mind
cascade through this story of Oh, my neighbor left that stuff on the porch and like filtered
the view of the neighbor, too. And it definitely filtered the view of the object. The really
humbling thing about this is with the second look, the object wasn't what I thought it
was at all. It was conditioned by these attitudes in my mind. They literally distorted what
I saw. There are also people who have described receiving an email when in an agitated state
and being convinced it says something not good.
Having the presence of mind not to respond to it going back to it later and realizing
it actually said something different, the text was different than they read it to be.
The emotional state filtered the information that much it distorted it that much. So one
benefit of starting to notice awareness is notice when noticing when there might be a
little distortion at play. Oh, I'm maybe I'm not in the best frame of mind to be taking
this in right now. Maybe I'll set it aside. Take it in later.
So
internal and external awareness is where we exercise some of our most important choices.
This includes what voices and sources we amplify in our own hearts and minds that allow our
own hearts and minds to move in certain directions. And it can also be in noticing what we say
or amplify and move on to others. Right? So
the choices we make can be the difference between sort of cultivating trust, kindness,
honesty, awareness, cultivating our sort of cultural and relational comments as opposed
to putting agitation, anger, judgment, fear, even untruths we run across without checking.
We have the power to
emit things that are more wholesome versus things that cause more problems and agitation
than the people we know or don't even know.
Another gatekeeper story and then I'll be done here. So I don't remember if this story
is in the suttas. I think it may be sort of in the literature around the discourses. It's
another gatekeeper. And this gatekeeper is a friendly sort and people ask him all kinds
of questions. And so one day one group kind of comes by and they're doing what they need
to do to get them in the city and they ask, say, what are the people like here? The gatekeeper
looks at them and goes, well, how did you find people in the town you left? Oh, they
were awful. Greedy, conniving, couldn't trust them, always putting people down. They just
nods and he said, I think you'll find people like that here too.
Next group comes by a few groups later. He gets the same question. He gets this question
a lot. What are the people like here? Oh, they're kind, trustworthy, generous. I feel
blessed to have them as neighbors back where I left. I'm going to miss them. Oh, okay.
I think you'll find people here are much like that too. Right? What we put out has a large
impact on what we receive. So to recap, the takeaway is that awareness can take all of
these different forms with different breadth and depth and scope, any of which all of
which can be useful, whether it's moment to moment, more of a general gestalt, if it
is more of a full awareness and encompassing awareness or discernment. Like that, which
I'm going to call it tree and all the fruits and blossoms and buds, eventually mindfulness,
awareness blossoms into that greater discernment and wisdom. Now, this is not a project. It's
just something to keep in mind. You can trust the process. As long as awareness, mindfulness
is practiced as part of the path, it will mature into discernment and wisdom. So maybe
all awaken into healthy relationship with the way things are and to the capacity to
show up in ways that make this life and the lives around us better in all different kinds
of ways. So thank you for your kind attention. We have just two or three minutes if anyone
here has questions that you would like to offer. Comments are also welcome.
I just wanted to thank you for all your words and all the planning and thought that went
into them, but also the way you managed things this morning. That's a very powerful teacher.
Thank you, Martha. I just wanted to point out how much I appreciate the difference between
the stimulus to the stress there's that space. And with that space, a lot of times we get
caught up with the stimulus and ruminate. And not knowing the space is there, mindfulness
is kicking in. And knowing the space creates the expansion. That's when we can have a different
response. And so that really resonates with me. So thank you.
Thank you. Thank you for putting it so well. I can tell you it really went in and resonated.
And now we have just a moment or two behind you.
I loved the gatekeeper at the end that you were talking about when people show up and
what they show up with and perspectives and perceptions that they take with them and project
into their environment. And just it's really important to remember that and to be aware
of that, you know, just to let go of those that are not beneficial. And so thank you
for that end of the story. Thank you, Hilary. Thank you. So thank you, friends, for your
kind attention. May all beings benefit from our practice here together. May all beings
be happy. May all beings be free. May all beings know the highest safety and freedom.
Thank you for your kind attention.
