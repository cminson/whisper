The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Okay, so good morning or afternoon or evening. It's nice to be here with all of
you for this week. And why don't we go ahead and get started with the meditation
and I'll say a bit more afterwards about what we'll be doing together this week.
So please find a posture that is upright and also when you can have some ease in
your body. Just feel yourself settling in and letting go of whatever it was you
were doing before arriving. Just having the sense internally that you have
arrived. If it's comfortable to do so you can gently close your eyes. Otherwise
just have a soft gaze downward and just bring the attention internally. Perhaps
feeling first into the place where you're sitting. So your seat against the
cushion or the chair or the bench or the bed. Maybe you're even doing standing
meditation. So feeling the support under you and just allowing your body to find
some balance. Sometimes I even rock back and forth slightly or forward and back
just to find that center point where the body can be supported with minimal
effort from the muscles. When that balance point is found it may feel like the
body naturally straightens or extends upward almost as if there were a little
string from the top of the head. Just feels natural. Then we can invite some
ease throughout the body especially places where we tend to be habitually
tightened. So softening the muscles of the face like in the forehead and around
the eyes. The jaw. Softening the eyes and the eye sockets. Leasing all the little
muscles around the scalp. Down through the throat and into the shoulders. Letting
the shoulders just naturally settle out. Maybe thinking of the shoulder blades
sliding down the back. Letting the arms soften down through the hands.
Then down into the torso softening the chest area, the upper back. Maybe
sensing the ribcage, front the back, the sides. Down into the belly.
Inviting some softness. Just whatever is willing to release.
Down through the hips. Sinking a little deeper into the support.
Growing muscles. All the way down through the calves and the ankle joints and the
feet. It can be helpful at the beginning of a meditation just to briefly scan
through the body. And all we do is invite some ease. There are parts of the body
that are still tense or that we couldn't connect with particularly. That's fine.
The body is fine as it is.
Then as the body gets a bit more still, just a little bit, often it's easier to
connect with the sensations of breathing. Just allowing that simple
connection of the body breathing in and breathing out. Just naturally not changing
anything about how that happens to be right now.
Just bringing that into the field of mindfulness.
Breathing is a whole body process. There's of course the, we may know anatomically
where the lungs are. But as you tune into the breathing in a meditative way, it may
be possible to sense the way the breath affects other parts of the body. The
shoulders rise and fall slightly. The belly down underneath the lungs, the belly
is moving. Maybe there's even a slight feeling in the arms and the legs or the
head. We don't need to push for that, but I'm just inviting and opening up of our
understanding of the breath.
So we can connect in with very simple sensations. Not even really the idea of
breathing in, breathing out. But sensations more like tingling, or pressure, heat.
The brushing of the clothing against the skin as the body shifts.
Even very subtle sensations that would be hard to put a word on to.
So I call these elemental sensations. They occur throughout the body.
So I would invite in this meditation to use these simple breath or whole body
sensations as the object. If it works for you, you can see them as an observer. You
can imagine that you are watching them with some interest. Maybe the way a child
watches waves on the beach. That's fine. It's also possible to enter into the
sensations directly, as if the mindfulness is getting very close to
these sensations that feel supportive or interesting.
So just connecting with this world of body sensations for a little while. And if the
mind gets distracted, which of course it will, there's no problem. Just immediately open again
to these simple sensations, either as an observer or entering into them directly.
When working with the body, it can be helpful from time to time to just quickly
scan through again and soften many places that may have become tense.
Sometimes the eyes get tense because we are trying to look at these sensations.
Or we might just not notice that we're building up some tension in the shoulders or the belly.
And that's fine when we just turn attention briefly back to the ease in the body. We can
identify those tight spots and soften them and continue on with our
direct connection to this world of the body.
Thank you.
And if there are sensations that feel particularly strong or
dominating the awareness, it's fine to focus on something else.
We're often this observer stance of being separate from that but watching it is a good
way to just maintain the balance of the mind.
And so being sensitive to how you're relating to this particular meditation,
taking care to just stay in something simple.
You may notice also that there is change.
The body is continually glowing, changing.
Even sensations that seem relatively constant have changed since the beginning of this hit,
for example. So being aware also that there is
in constancy and shifting and changing dynamism in the body and continuing to rest with that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So as we continue on, just bringing in one more element
is to consider the knowing, the knowing quality that is allowing you to be
mindful at this moment.
There are different aspects or kinds of knowing.
And what we've emphasized in this sit is this kind of bodily knowing.
It may seem like a subtle difference but consider that the bodily kind of knowing is
it's different from thought, isn't it?
It's different from emotion.
It's different from knowledge that other people have told you about.
The knowing of these direct body sensations is one form of what's called direct knowing,
direct knowledge, very clear and distinct
and completely unique to you, always available.
So just being aware of that direct knowing quality of body sensations.
Thank you.

So there's a lot of information in the body,
a lot of signals coming in and they're always in the present moment.
What is known through the body is always in the present moment.
Whereas the mind can go out to other things that's in other times and places.
So maybe just as we're going about our days this week,
we can consider that having this intimate direct connection to what's going on in our body
can actually help us in our daily life. It may not be as subtle as we have during meditation
but we can use it as a way to know that we're being present, that we're in present moment.
We may be able to notice if we have times of tension, more times of ease,
the body can help us to stay mindful and to stay in a wholesome state of mind.
So when we're with others, we're more likely to remember our meta or our patience.
This is actually very practical,
helpful information to have. Sometimes I just feel my feet on the floor
or what's going on in my belly and that's enough.
Maybe that's all I can bring into my attention while I'm also with someone else,
but it's very helpful. So I invite experimenting with that.
May it be that we can stay with the present moment
so that we can be present for others as well as ourselves. May what we've learned in
this meditation be of service to all beings.
Thank you.
