Practice Note: The Intentionality 
of Attention

One of the obvious tools we use in mindfulness 
practice is the faculty of attention or awareness. 
There are many facets to awareness and 
attention. One is the aspect of intentionality, of 
having an intention to pay attention. For 
example, with sound, first  there is the noticing of 
the sound ; and then, in order to stay with the 
sound, there is a slight intention to keep the 
attention there. Some people say that they turn 
their attention toward the sound in order to take 
it in more fully , more receptively . Or, if you are 
following your breath, then there is an intention 
to bring your attention to your breath. Or, if you 
are with your breath for a while , and then there 
is a sensation in your body like a knee hurting, 
you will bring your attention to the knee. Y ou 
might be aware that the knee hurts; but then you 
decide to focus on that knee, to have som e 
intention to feel in a fuller, more detailed attention to that knee . But e ven though you’re 
not aware of it, it’s not intentional yet.  
 
This aspect of mindfulnes s practice is the 
intentionality of attention. So you might focus a 
little today on the quality of that intention. Be 
curious to see how it works. How do you utilize 
it? What is the quality of that intention? Is the 
intention reluctant, hesitant, resentful ? Do you 
not use any intentional aspect , but rather allow 
the mind to wander freely? Are you content just 
to be casually aware of what happens to come 
your way without looking at anything carefully?  
 
When you have intention to pay attention, does 
that com e along with baggage – extra stuff such 
as “I have to do a good job” or “Something is 
wrong and I have to fix it” or “I better look good  
as a good practitioner – I have to really bore 
down into it, and get into this thing really tight 
and strict ”? Or “Well, it’s all ok; I’ll kind of get 
around to it”?  
 
What is the quality of that intention to be 
attentive? So I offer that to you today as a  topic 
of curiosity, hopefully of delightful interest. It’s 
one aspect that’s always going to be there, so, 
be curious. Don’t approach this as if there is a right way and a wrong way , but more as a 
curious way: h ow is it for you? If you do that, 
noticing i ntention with attention, and you’re 
curious to look at it with more care, then you are 
practicing mindfulness. You are in the present 
moment.  And so it’s a way of being engaged.
