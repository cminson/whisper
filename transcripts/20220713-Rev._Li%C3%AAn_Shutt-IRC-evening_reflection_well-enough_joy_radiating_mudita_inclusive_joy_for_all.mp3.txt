 Another day has or is ending as what we call a day. I want to remind you that the four brahma vahara's are easeful practices. And as today is the third day, I really encourage you to access ease. And so, especially if you know that your pattern is to over effort, I invite you to take a different position than you usually do. Perhaps try lying down, sitting in a chair. And also at any point, of course, you can visualize yourself, another, all beings in any ways that works. Just lie down right in your spot. It doesn't have to be going to one of the designated spots. Whatever position feels easeful for you. I always say that many Asian people have a hard time when their feet is pointed at them. So maybe just have a little awareness about that. Hmm, yeah. Let's try it on. What is it to give yourself ease? Body joy. Yeah, let the arms down. And if taking some deep breaths, really supportive. Enjoy. Let's inhale. Exhale. Send out joy. And next inhale. Again, connect with however you know joy. And if there's a visceral area, perhaps again, it's your heart. Perhaps it's your gut. Perhaps it's touching the ground. As the Buddha did to know that it's as right as a being to know that awakeness, the ease that's possible in life is here and present. You're going to go through all five categories tonight. Yourself a good friend, neutral person, difficult person and all beings. And I apologize. I forgot his Opeca. Sorry, Udita. So we'll start with a benefactor or a good friend, someone whom is really easy to wish these four to freely give to them and that, you know, they will receive it easily. I say you, you can say their names in your heart and mind. Or it can be a category. May my good friend connect with joy when it is present. My good friend, let yourself accept your best effort as success. Your friend, please be able to be fully present with your joy here and now, letting go of any fear that you lose it. Your friend, may you realize satisfaction and contentment as prosperity. Good friend, rest knowing you've done well enough today. On the inhale, you're going to connect with how you know that is true and possible and on the exhale, you're going to send it to your friend or friends, freely given for them to do with as they wish. And then on the next couple of breaths, check in with yourself. How does it land for you? And if there's any adjustment, feel free. Roll their shoulders, move the head, take deep breaths. Now you want to visualize a neutral person or people, ones where there are no strong love or hate. It's mild. And it doesn't have to be a human being, it could just be any being. See the birds here at IRC. Neutral. May this neutral being know that joy is true and possible. Let these strangers accept that their best effort is a form of success. And when there is joy in your life, neutral person, may you be able to be fully present with it, cherishing it and not fear its loss. And strangers, let prosperity for you be satisfaction and contentment. And may you rest knowing you've done well enough today. On the inhale, connect with how you know that it's true and possible. And on the exhale, with sincerity of heart, with openness, with tender heart, you're going to send it to the neutral person or people or beings, freely given for them to do with as they wish. Take in with yourself, are you feeling joy or are you letting it be present? If joy right now is the heaviness of being able to just settle on the ground or leaning back on your chair or the fullness of your breath or the settleness of heart and mind, then let that be your joy and connect with it. Now you visualize a difficult or challenging being. And really this is not to fix how you feel about them or to fix them. So it's really freely given with fullness of tender heart. It's an offering for them to do with as they wish. May person in difficulty, may you know that joy can also be present. If not in this moment, then in another. Difficult being, may you evaluate success as having done your best effort today. Challenging being. May you be able to be fully present with joy whenever you need it. Being in difficulty. May send you satisfaction and contentment for you to blossom with. In difficult person, may you be able to rest knowing you've done well enough today. On your next inhale, you're going to connect with your joy, with your ease of heart and mind and send it radiated to the difficult being, one or many, for them to do with as they wish. On the next inhale, see if there's a moment that you can feel its ease, its joy, its satisfaction, its fullness and rest in that. And if it's difficult to access it right now, perhaps on the exhale, just let yourself connect with however you know it. And if it's difficult mentally or emotionally right now, see if rubbing your finger against another finger or gripping your toes if you're sitting or just pressing your hand to the ground as a way to just ground yourself in the possibility of ease and joy. And if you're able to connect and if you are connecting with joy and ease somewhere in yourself, be it physically, emotionally or mentally, you can use that to visualize a sense of yourself that can receive or from that place, you're going to direct these phrases these wishes either more deeply known there or radiating from that spot. Or if it's hard to feel it right now again, let whatever support you're on, be it your breath or the ground or the seat or the cushion or the presence of one or all of us in here, give you a sense of being a to rest to receive these wishes. Let me rest in the presence of joy here now. May I accept that my best effort is success. When I'm aware of joy and ease, may I let myself be fully present with it and not fear its loss. And may I incorporate the satisfaction and contentment is prosperity. May I rest knowing I've done well enough today. On your next inhale, you're going to just take in any of that that is resonating, that's filling you. And on the exhale, you're going to relax into that and feel the ease and the radiating of it throughout your body, your emotion, your mentalness, all parts of you. And let it let yourself know it, receive it, let it convey itself. Whatever does receive it as it is. And whatever form your joy is expressing itself right now, let it be what it is, accept it, cherish it. Let yourself know it. And now let's visualize all beings. And for some of us, this is difficult because technically it's all beings without exception. So this is a case in which radiating can be that sense that the wish is to let it be everywhere. So that could be as a visualization of an energy of a light, perhaps as a breeze, perhaps as a soft rain everywhere like the mist here in the mornings or warmth of the sunlight. Whatever it is that helps you to know that all beings are touched by it, can receive it and that your conveying is vast and wide. May all beings, without exception, know that joy is not a thing. Joy is true and possible. May all beings, including this one, accept that our best effort is success. May every one of us be able to be fully present for joy and ease here and now, letting go of fear of losing it. May all of us, without exception, realize satisfaction and contentment as prosperity. And may every being be able to rest in knowing that we've done well enough today and every day. On the inhale, you're going to connect with how you feel it and know it, any part. And on the exhale, you're going to let it radiate through yourself first, perhaps from a place, perhaps as entering you, perhaps as coming from you, and then you're going to radiate it out far and wide. And it can be an increment, imagining the people next to you, us in the room, everyone in the building, all beings at IRC, and then wider and wider. Be the whole world and the universe. And then at least 35 other people are rating it far and wide. Feel like coming back. Let yourself receive these wishes of joy, of best effort and success, of being present and cherishing joy, of satisfaction and contentment, and of knowing that you've done well enough today. And on the next exhale, you send it back out and then you can keep it radiating back and forth as mutuality, as all inclusiveness, freely given, freely received. Just in why. And in the silence that all will be doing now, just rest in it. And if a phrase comes up, let it be your song of joy. Otherwise, just rest right here and right now in your tender heart and the joy that you've included for yourself and for all beings. In this way, feel good. All right. I'm going to let you know in leaving the darkness away feeling it. Rest, knowing we've done well enough today.
