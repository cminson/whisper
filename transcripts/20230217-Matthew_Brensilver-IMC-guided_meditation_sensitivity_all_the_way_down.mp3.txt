 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome, welcome folks. Nice to be with you. Nice to see all the little wishes and chats. And yeah, okay, we'll do what we do and settle in. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So the chitta heart-mind, that which gets liberated in this path, is not exactly sure what chitta is. But Ajan Sajjita says, characterized chitta heart-mind as primarily a receptivity system. Thank you. Thank you. So we make ourselves porous, rather than coming to conclusions about life, about ourselves. We sit poised in receptivity. Thank you. Thank you. Compassion is said to be the quivering of the heart. But in a sense, our whole dhyang is always quivering, always being touched by phenomena, the relentlessness, some sorrow. We sit here deeply embodied. Our skin sensitive to everything. Our heart sensitive to everything. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It signals a various urgency is the urge to fiddle with samsara. Sometimes there is wisdom in it. But for right now, we treat everything as a kind of false alarm, staying poised in receptivity, which is another way of saying we're not landing in conclusions about ourself, about life. We're poised in receptivity. Just writing the intensity of embodiment, the intensity of this human realm, the intensity of time, of pleasure and pain. Just writing this is another way of saying we're not landing in conclusions about ourself, you you you you you you you you you you you you you it emits the intensity of the human condition nor porousness almost can feel like we we have to brace against the world in the way one braces so as to minimize the pain in a certain part of our body we're injured maybe we brace trying to quarantine the pain in a deeper way we brace so as to protect sense of self the Matthew within Matthew needs protection from all this receptivity but it's just sensitivity all the way down opening opening the skin quivers the heart quivers no more fake urgencies no more protection safety in the openness you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you in our race activity where we're not trying to go anywhere to get anywhere become anything the goodness is already here we can feel that when there's just a kind of face the logic of the Dharma you you you you you you you you
