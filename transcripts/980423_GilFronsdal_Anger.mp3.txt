 I often feel quite happy or joyful when I come and sit here and come here. I'm feeling kind of happy to be here today, sitting quietly. Can you hear me okay in the back? Okay. Speak a little louder. However, what I thought I would talk about today is anger. Anger is a very common feeling that people have. And it's also one of the more common emotions that people will ask about when they talk about how to apply or bring their mindfulness to their emotional lives. The two big emotions that people will be most interested in asking about is anger or fear. And I don't know which is most popular. But today I thought that we'd talk about anger, partly because it's an important emotion, but partly because it's an emotion which I just use it as an example, perhaps, of how we apply the practice to our emotional lives. And some of what I'll say today applies primarily to what we do in the sitting practice, and some of it applies to bring mindfulness into our daily lives. One of the great advantages or beauties about developing mindfulness of our lives in meditation practice is that it's very clear that as you sit and meditate, you don't have to act and do anything. So you can be furious at someone in meditation. And the dilemma about whether at that moment you're supposed to yell at them or punch them out or do anything at all about it isn't a pertinent issue, because in the moment you're committed to sitting there. And so, free it up from the need to make a decision, we can actually more fully, completely feel the experience of anger in a way that probably we wouldn't feel it so fully if we were struggling with the decision about how to act on it, or even if we were deciding to act on it. So, as most of you know, I have this newborn son at home, and it's interesting to watch the range of his emotions as he goes through the day or through the weeks. He spends a lot of time smiling if we're interacting with him. And he's kind of a clean channel for the most part for his emotions. Sometimes he just looks at you full on, eyes straight to your eyes and just smiles and laughs and smiles. And sometimes he does this thing that looks like shyness. I don't know if it is that, but he smiles and then he immediately goes like this. And then he looks and he smiles and then he goes like this. But also he can express something which looks to me like anger. Though I mentioned that one night, I think maybe here, Monday night, and one of the students here got in my case a little bit, for too quickly interpreting what I saw as being anger as if that was an interpretation that was adding on top of his experience. And maybe it was so. I do know that what he was expressing was intense. And, well, if it wasn't anger, I was going to say it was ferocious. And it certainly wasn't inhibited. It was some expression of tremendous, maybe irritation, and it's a fair enough interpretation of what's going on there. He's really irritated. Something is wrong. And he's really expressing that something is really wrong. And his eyes are kind of zeroing in on my eyes and just looking like great lasers and saying, and his face turns into this ugly pucker. And his whole face has this wonderful, beautiful, angelic face, except when he has this intensity, ferocity, whatever. Demonic, which is also an interpretation. But I'm trying to convey that there's certain intensity to it. And most of us, if we saw that kind of face in an adult, looking at us in that kind of way, most of us would say, well, this person's angry with me. But I don't know what he's feeling. But it happens when something in his universe is wrong. Something is making him uncomfortable. He's hungry or he's sleepy or his diapers need to be changed. Something is really disturbing him, troubling him in a physical way. This intense response occurs. And one of the beautiful things about it is that it doesn't seem to be inhibited in any way. It's just there is this pure expression of energy, of a pure expression of feelings or whatever. And it's quite effective, whether it's his intention or not, or whether it's probably the genetic intention, that it gets his parents' attention. And it's a form of communication where something happens and the conditions get improved for him pretty quickly. So it's very effective. It has a great purpose. Forgetting what he needs to be taken care of. And what I suspect will happen is he gets older. At some point he'll have toys and be playing with other kids. And his toy will be taken by the other kid and the other kid will be playing with it and he'll get angry. And it'll be a very different kind of anger than the first type. Now it's just, you know, I'm uncomfortable with my wife's diapers. But now in the future it's going to be, you know, I'm feeling distress because this person has what I think is mine. And then he's going to be a little bit older and someone's going to call him a dirty name. Your father wears army boots. And so he's going to get riled up around that and get angry at that kind of expression. And then he's going to get older and someone, you know, he's going out with some person and some other person starts going out with that person. He gets angry because he's lost his partner or something. And then, you know, he gets older and someone, you know, puts a scratch, bumps into his car. You know, he gets angry. And then someone else, I mean, it goes on and on, right? And what we're trying to convey, not so successfully, is that the kind of things that we get angry with changes as we get older and older, as we get more developed and mature. We have a greater sense of self, a greater sense of what we identify with, a greater sense of what causes the discomfort to ourselves. But as we get older, often the sources of discomfort is not that stimulates anger or this kind of intensity, this ferocity or whatever, is not some physical discomfort in the world, but often has a psychological base. You know, the fact that someone scratches my car, the intensity of my feelings depends a lot on whether I'm having to drive that old beat-up car or that brand-new car of mine. A beat-up old car that I used to have, you know, who cares? One more scratch. But this new car that I have, it has great consequence. And, you know, it's a psychological world of newness and oldness. It doesn't have any real bearing on my own direct well-being, this kind of indirect, my indirect well-being, and what I identify with, where my sources of happiness, my sources of identification. And it can get quite complicated, what stimulates a sense of distress that causes something like anger. And usually anger can arise, or this intensity arises, when there's some kind of discomfort in our system, when we're feeling discomforted. Sometimes it's fear, sometimes it's a sense of hurt. But something is wrong, and we're stimulated to do something about it. This ferocity, this energy kind of gets born within us. Another thing that happens, however, as we're getting older, is that we start incorporating within ourselves all kinds of messages from our society, from our family, about the rules of the game around anger. My little son now, he has no rules. If he's angry, it just... He hasn't learned that in certain settings you're not supposed to be angry. Certain people you're not supposed to be angry. He hasn't learned that to your father, you're not supposed to be angry. Or whatever, it happens in some families. He doesn't know, he just... But as we get older, we'll learn these things. We shouldn't be angry to our boss, we shouldn't be angry to our girlfriend or our boyfriend, or maybe we don't learn it so much, but we kind of get afraid that if we express it, that there's going to be consequences that we can't handle, we don't want to see. And so we tend to have all these complicated relationships to our anger. It's inappropriate to express it, and sometimes it's appropriate, and other times it's embarrassing, it's frightening, it's many things we feel. And it gets very complicated, you know. The whole ecology of anger is really fascinating, and it's many forms it takes in the world. Many of us take our anger very personally, not recognizing that much of it exists in the field of communication, the field of relationships, and that the field of relationships can be quite complicated. So for example, our society is in part, it's many things, but our society is in part, tends to evoke a lot of anger in some people. I think often minorities, people in minorities, or subordinate types in companies or in society, tend to be in situations where they're not respected as much, as the dominant majority, or the dominant kind of bosses in the corporation or whatever. And the disrespect they get, or the discounting they get, or the ill treatment they might get, causes discomfort and distress, which often then will manifest itself or show itself up in anger, some kind of ferocity. But if you're subordinate type in our culture, to express anger just gets more, you know, the consequences are often bad. So society tends to evoke sometimes anger in people, but if you express it, then something's wrong with you, not with the people causing the anger-provoking stuff. Does that make sense? So it's very complicated, the nexus, the ecology of things of anger. And as we get older, it gets more and more complicated. And as it gets more complicated, the pure expression of it, the pure channel that we're capable of being, begins being inhibited or slowed down or channeled in new ways. And one of the more dramatic ways is it gets repressed. Anger is inappropriate to express. You're wrong for expressing it. Something's wrong, terrible with you. And it's inappropriate, so let's repress it, let's hide it. And that's one of the complicated ways we respond to it. Another complicated relationship is the expression of anger ties into our identity in various ways. One person recently told me that she really loved her anger, in a particular setting, because she felt she had a lot of power. And she usually felt powerless, and feeling that power made her really feel alive and good and healthy in some ways. And so the anger was being used not as an expression of something, communication of a need, but rather she was hanging on to the anger because she felt generally, usually kind of didn't feel her own power, and this was a chance to hang on to it for a while. Or people who sometimes in some societies or some areas, the expression of anger is considered to be an appropriate macho thing to do. Or some families, love is expressed through anger. This is the only way you have kind of intense contact with a fellow family member is if you kind of are angry with each other. And because we want to often have contact with each other, if it's not coming any other way, in some family dynamics, then anger and behavior get self-perpetuated, and has other purposes besides expressing, hey, wait a minute, there's a problem here. So anger gets complicated, both in our relationship as we get older and older. One of the opportunities that exists by doing simple meditation practice is that it's possible to learn how to be present for anger without all the complicated ideas we have about it, without censoring it, without judging it, without feeling if you're wrong for having it, without justifying it, without feeling now you're really great because you have it or whatever. But just the energy, the feeling, the sensation of anger can just be there in a very direct, I don't know if pure is the right word, but kind of pure sensory level, energetic level. And it can be quite something to sit down and be sitting in posture like this or sitting in a chair and say, okay, I'm just going to be, I'm going to open myself fully and let this anger that I have really have its time in the sun, have its time in the light, just let it really be there and I'm going to really feel what it's like to be a human being who's angry without any ideas of what it means to be angry or what's right or what's wrong. And that's a big part, I think, of what mindfulness practice can offer us is this ability to feel our experience directly without all the complications that we add onto it. And this is, I think, one of the really beautiful things about this kind of practice is having very few places in our life where we give ourselves that kind of permission, that kind of unconditional permission to really feel what's going on for us without adding things on top of it. And it becomes a great source of help in our normal life also because as we get a sense of it in this corner of our life, we then start developing a different relationship to our emotions, to our anger when we go back into our normal life where things are more complicated, for sure. But you have to start learning, oh, maybe it's okay to open to it, I don't have to be so afraid of it. We learn how to handle it, how to be present for it, how to learn from it rather than be the victims of it or controlled by it. So that's one of the great things about this practice is just feel it, just be with it, and as non-judgmental stance for our feelings, for our anger. In addition, as we kind of can allow our anger to be there in a full way, in a pure way, just feeling the sensory levels, just the sensation of it, if there is no judgment or no complications with it, no justification of it, no fueling it with more stories about who did what to who, but just really feeling it as it is in the present moment, it tends to take a different course. It tends to soften, it tends to unravel itself much more quickly than if we're riding on top of it and planning our vendetta, or justifying ourselves or constantly harping over the hurt that might have caused it. It tends to have a different life. But more interesting, more important, is once we kind of allow it to be there in this free way, that it allows us also to understand it better, to investigate it better. And this is actually one of the pieces of a very important part of mindfulness practice, is investigation. What is this animal? What is this experience of anger? Once I allow it to be there without judging it, how can I experience it? How can I feel it? What is it? And it's a number of different things. One of the things I think it is, this is my opinion I'll tell you, my opinion about anger is that anger is always a symptom or sign that there's something wrong. And it's best to take anger as kind of a healthy sign that something is wrong, rather than thinking that anger is a problem. It's just like a flag. It says, hey, you dummy. You haven't noticed, but there's something wrong here. There's some distress, there's some hurt, there's some fear, there's something going on that needs your attending to. So in that sense, anger becomes your friend, rather than your enemy or your problem. It's a healthy way of saying something is a problem here. You should pay attention to it. So what are some of the things, so what are some of the, so I'm talking about anger itself. Now, one of the things we also discover is that anger is closely connected, closely related to a lot of other emotions, similar kind of emotions that sometimes look like anger, but are not really anger. And some of the discussions we have often hear about anger and when is anger appropriate, and you know, could be simplified I think quite a bit if we can distinguish between these little animals, species that are so closely connected to each other that they mask for each other. One of them is hostility. I think a lot of people don't often see the difference between anger and hostility, and other anger is mixed with hostility. And so the question, you know, is anger ever appropriate, could be reworded, and we can say, is hostility ever appropriate? And I think if the question is put that way, I think we'll have a different relationship to the issue than if we say is anger appropriate. Hostility, as I understand it, is acting on feelings of aversion, or acting out of feelings of ill will, or acting on feelings of anger that we might have. It's wanting to attack something else, some person out there, or inside, or sometimes we're hostile towards ourselves. It's some kind of attack that goes on. And I don't think it's ever appropriate unless it's really to defend oneself, but defense is not hostility. Is it? I don't think an offensive act is a hostile act. So I don't think it's ever really appropriate to be hostile, but to begin to teasing apart, to the degree to which our anger might be hostile, and to the degree to which it's just anger at the situation, I think is very important. And as we hang out with our anger, we begin teasing apart the intention that seems to come with that anger. And if the intention is hostile for vengeance or revenge, or to make fun of someone, or whatever it might be, then we can maybe, if we see the difference between that, maybe we can take more responsibility for those feelings of hostility. The other close species to anger is resentment, which is often very, you know, can be mistaken for it. And resentment is also not anger. It's connected to anger in that resentment is frozen anger, anger which is gotten stuck. And I think resentment is kind of like a great poison because it is kind of stuck, frozen, tense place inside of us that keeps burning and burning and burning, sometimes decades after the event has occurred. And when there's resentment, there's a complicated relationship that's formed towards the anger, or towards the hurt that causes the anger. So if you start seeing the difference between hostility in one side and resentment in the other, then we can see that in the middle, perhaps, there's the expression of anger that doesn't have to have either one of those in it. And it's possible to experience the anger in a much purer way, in a simpler way, a direct way. And then the question is, how can we be with that? What can we learn from it? What is being communicated? What is the purpose of that expression of anger? Is it like the mind of the sun, where it's really an expression that something is wrong in the universe, something is distressing, there's some suffering here that needs some attention to. So then the question is, what is that force of distress? What's the stimulating, the anger? And it could be a whole range of things. Sometimes this strong ferocity, strong energy, irritation of something is wrong here, of anger, can arise as kind of a protective mechanism. Sometimes there's a real and genuine threat to ourselves, and we're kind of rallying our energy and forces to try to meet that threat. It could be a threat to our identity, a threat to our physical well-being. Sometimes it can be a threat to our integrity, but sometimes it can be a threat to our ego. And some of you might have noticed that your integrity and your ego are not necessarily the same thing. But your ego has a lot to do with how we want other people to see us, or the idea of how we want to see ourselves. I'll give you a personal example. It maybe doesn't relate so much to today, but you'll be forgiving, hopefully. I was running up where I live, and I live up in Skyline. There's really no neighbors. I live in an open space preserve up there. There are all these miles of trails that leave from our driveway. And a lot of mountain bikers use that particular preserve. It's very popular for mountain bikers. Yesterday I was running, and there's a very nice, more or less flat running trail that goes about a mile in each direction from our driveway. And it's not a big deal to run that mile back and forth, especially since it's kind of flat. And I was running back, and the trail crosses another trail, and these two mountain bikers were crisscrossing my path. And this thought went through my mind. Oh, I hope they noticed that I'm running up here in the middle of nowhere. They're probably thinking that I've been running for hours, because there's no houses up here, hardly at all. And hopefully they see that I'm a really great marathon runner. And I hope they don't stop and ask me where I live, because I have to tell them I live just around the corner there. And I could just see this thought going through my mind. It lasted about two seconds. And there was nothing in me that grabbed onto those thoughts. There was no hooks. But what often happens is we grab onto those thoughts. We hook onto them, and then it's like this whole story we're making. And it gets worse and worse. But luckily, at that particular moment, I could just kind of see those thoughts kind of passing through, like clouds in an empty sky. So I would say it's a lot of grief. But my ego somehow was the ego-sistical thoughts that occurred. And if I had hooked onto them, they could have been threatened. And then if they had been threatened, I could have gotten angry, because it wasn't my integrity or my basic self that was being threatened, but it was this little hook of idea of, this is how I have to be to present myself. So I get people's praise and whatever. If anger arises for that purpose, it's very different than if it's a real kind of physical or integrity-threatening threat. But even if it's a threat to our ego, it'd be very easy to judge that and say, oh, that's wrong and that's bad. You know, uh-oh, I can't do that. But I think in Buddhism, in Buddhist practice, we want to actually respect everything and not discount anything. And if it is from our ego, the ego itself tends to arise oftentimes from some place of suffering, a deeper place, a real sense of suffering, a feeling of vulnerability, a feeling of inadequacy, a feeling of hurt, a feeling of whatever. Some feeling is deeper than the ego itself. The ego is often an expression of something deeper. So then we kind of learn to investigate what is actually going on here. What's the actual source of suffering that seems to be the root of this experience of anger? And to do that is to really respect anger, I believe, is to really use anger for its real purpose. Its purpose of anger is not to be hostile towards someone else. The purpose of anger is not to be hostile towards oneself or to feel guilty. But rather, the purpose of anger is to tell you there's some problem that needs some addressing. And so the question is, what is that and what is the appropriate response? And so many of us, for adults, it's not immediate life-threatening situations where, you know, a mountain lion is about to attack your baby and you better generate all the energy you can, and furo you can't, to kind of stop it. You know, it's an office worker who didn't say hello to you that morning and hasn't said hello to you all week. And you know, you feel kind of like discounted, you know, and feeling of being discounted feels bad and you get angry. There's actually much more complicated things. It doesn't require us to kind of jump up to all the ferocity we have to kind of attack that fellow office worker and protect ourselves. So the purpose of anger in most of our adult situations, I think, is to inform us that there's some problem. And then we should learn how to investigate the real source of the problem, to translate the anger into hostility, where the focus of the anger is external, often it takes us away from really where the distress of the problem really is, if we're the one who's angry. This works in reverse fashion also. When someone else gets angry, for example, at you, the mindfulness practice can help because one of the things you can learn to do is to be okay being the recipient of anger. What do you think of that? What's harder? To be okay about yourself being angry or to be okay about being the recipient of someone's anger? I think for some people the latter is more difficult. So to be a recipient to feel the anger from someone else being directed at you is very threatening. But again, in our adult life, in the moment, most situations where someone's angry at you, they're not about to pounce on you, sometimes maybe, but they're not about to tear you apart. They're just kind of letting you know something. And is it possible to just kind of receive that and allow the feelings, sensations inside of you that occur in response to it, to allow that to be there in its free and open, pure way, its just sensation and energy, as you would when you're feeling anger when you're sitting in meditation? It is possible. And it's a tremendous gift to your friends and your society to be able to do that. At some point recently someone was furious at me. This actually happens periodically. And it partly has to do with the little bit with the role that I have. This is a complicated role to be a meditation teacher. And the role comes with a certain amount of, you know, it's not inappropriate, but it makes things complicated, a certain amount of transference projections and idealization about who I am. And as soon as someone is idealized, the cards are set up for that person to be, you know, not to live up to that ideal and that sometimes causes anger for people. So sometimes I'm the recipient of anger. And I sat there and just received anger. And you're quite ferocious. And then the person will come back a couple of days later and just thank me so much that they never had the experience of their life of someone who didn't run away or attack when they were angry at the person. And that it really helped them to feel more comfortable and not be frightened by their own anger and by their own discomfort. It really helped them to feel that maybe the world is a more trustable place than they realized. And it was very helpful for that person just to feel that someone is not going to attack them in return. It doesn't mean that I'm kind of a pushover. It doesn't mean that I'm kind of being weak. I think it's actually a sign of strength to sit there and receive the anger without either wilting or getting angry in return or getting all tense. But simply to be there and just feel it like it's a wind passing through you. And it's not a comfortable wind, but that's okay. That's one of the things we learned through the meditation practice, to learn how to be okay in a sense with uncomfortable feelings. If we don't learn how to be comfortable with uncomfortable feelings, that is when we start reacting unwisely to the world around us. It's very powerful to learn how to be comfortable. When someone's angry at you, it's the same kind of investigation. You can say, well, this person's angry. I don't like it. You don't have to like it. To be an open channel to it. I don't like it. But this is also a symptom that there's some suffering, some distress here. The person's not going to be angry at me unless the anger is being stimulated by some distress within the person. And if we start listening, what is the distress that anger is trying to communicate? The person will often be very grateful if you begin listening to the deeper source of the distress than if you're listening to the anger. I've been in also situations where people are being angry, sometimes at me or sometimes just angry in general. And you make a very simple, sincere reference to the fact that you can appreciate that they're afraid or appreciate that there's real hurt there. And suddenly the conversation will change radically because they feel that they've been seen and heard. And you've kind of moved the conversation to a deeper level, to the source, rather than to the projected object of the problem. Does that make sense? So this principle that anger is always communicating something useful is helpful, I think, in interpersonal relationships too. It's very helpful for close relationships, intimate relationships, because it means that when the person's angry with you in an intimate relationship, they might be projecting on you or angry at you for wrong reasons. You didn't do anything at all. But there's still some distress in the universe. And to be able to address and meet the other person and work out where the distress is is very helpful, even if the person's crazy. I mean, not crazy, but even if the person is a little bit off the wall. We don't want to discount anyone. We don't want to discount anything. What we really want to do is to meet the person where they're really at, and together begin clarifying the situation in the relationship at the deeper and deeper levels of what it is. And if we react to the anger with anger, we're not really allowing ourselves often to kind of see the deeper roots of it, and really help make our relationship connect in a deeper way. It does seem, though, that in the world, I hear others understand what you're saying, particularly in relationships, and you know that there are some people that are abusive about being angry at something. Yes. Well, they're using you for their heart. They're being hostile then. Yes, which is hostile. They're acting on their hurt, perhaps, and taking it out in other people. That happens. And if there is real threat, I think it's appropriate to defend ourselves. It's appropriate to do something. It's appropriate to respond wisely. If the situation allows for it. But we have to be very sensitive. And if we really understand the wider picture of what's going on, sometimes our response can be quite different than if we just kind of look at this particular event. For example, if we have some strong ego of our own, and then we're getting attacked in a way that's really threatening, but we get confused and also think that our ego is being attacked, and we want to defend our ego, the whole thing gets very messy very quickly. So how do we defend ourselves? How do we respond appropriately without kind of having to do it in order to preserve our pride, or preserve our identity or something? Well, like, my department handles complaints, and when you get somebody, and you get people that, you know, they've been passed along for 20 times, and I'll truly be trying to solve their problems with them, but they're so angry at that point, that, you know, they're calling them names, and I can take a bit of that, but after a while, I was like, hey, you know, I'm trying to help, shut up. Or is it because there's an abusive point to it? An abusive point, but I agree, and I think one of the things we have to be very wise and compassionate about is what our own limitations are. So if you really feel that I'm sinking here, then it might be very appropriate to say, you know, shut up. You know, and say it, you know, so ferociously, the whole building kind of shakes, and you really got that person's attention, they're stunned, and they go, okay, maybe that's appropriate sometimes if you really feel. However, what we want to be very careful for with is not to confuse our personal distress, what's happening to us with the other person being the cause for our distress, the condition for it. If someone's yelling at me, you know, your father wears army boots. I bet now, as an adult now, you can say that to me as much as you wish, as strongly as you wish, and I might get bored, but it's not going to have much charge for me. If I did have a charge from it, and I felt really hurt because my identity, my ego's tied up with having a certain kind of father who wears only Birkenstocks, then I want to be very careful, I want to be very careful not just to say that that person is abusing me. When part of my distress has really had to do with my ego identity. This is a very delicate thing I'm saying here, because there are situations of real abuse, so no one discounts abuse, but we want to be careful with that label, because often what we do is we, there is a condition, people are doing things which are uncomfortable producing, so that's definitely uncomfortable, but the degree in which we start feeling kind of terrible around it, you want to kind of react, is often have to do with the inner ecology of our, of our stuff. Now we have to take that very seriously and respect it, and if we need to, kind of put very strong boundaries down and say enough, but I would imagine that your job, I mean I don't want to be in your job, and I necessarily think that probably you can handle better than me at this point, your experience there in that place. I have a lot of respect for what you do, but I also, in addition what I feel is that, it's a fantastic meditation hall. You couldn't design maybe a better meditation hall. To be there, you know, day after day, and these people who are at rate coming at you, and you just breathe, and you try to handle, to really responsibly take care of it properly, and, and, and, so start, start, start, study, study, no, no, study the difference between when you can do it, and when you can't. What is, where are the, what are the, what are the elements that come together that one one thousandths of a time that you can do it. Give yourself a lot of credit for that one one thousandths of a time, and get a sense, get feel what that's like, learn to appreciate that when it does occur. Well, it makes sense to me that, I mean, it's angry so much during the day, but it usually is because there's something going on, and it's existing, but it becomes absurd how many things are wrong, that it becomes really hard to not get like this gnawing ball that becomes really unpleasant and difficult to sit with, and kind of keep holding it. Exactly, right, exactly, I think so, and then, so this is where, again, we're realizing what's happening for us, it's so important, and if, if we feel like things are getting out of hand, that we're drowning in, in a tight tension or whatever, if we have enough clarity to see that, then sometimes we can decide, well, I can't continue this way, I better take a breather, I better go sit and meditate for a little while and try to clear out, or to have, I mean, imagine what it's like for some people who have no way of thinking, or have no way of clearing out, and so the tensions of their lives build and build from day to day and day until they finally explode. You know, we have at least the opportunity to sit every day, for those of you who do, and sitting is extremely powerful for creating some balance, some clarity for our life which can be quite intense, and it's a fantastic resource to bring it into our life, daily sitting. I noticed that while you're giving this talk, I'm feeling like sort of falling over, you know, just kind of like, and my attention is having a hard time staying on what you're talking about, so I'm thinking it just must have something to do with me, you know, this repression and all that kind of stuff. Let me ask you a question, you've been coming here for a long time, listening to me for a long time. So you have a long history to compare with. Is it pretty unusual for you to kind of feel what you're feeling tonight? I could easily imagine someone being bored by me, you know, not interested or whatever, you know, whatever, so I just wanted to check, but see, that's not... I don't think that's what I was thinking. So I'm just checking. I feel like I'm what I feel. It's great, but then you were interpreting it. You said your symptoms and your interpretation must mean something to do with me. And I was just checking, making sure I wasn't just kind of boring you all today. Yeah, so that's actually... So that's very, very, very important symptoms to study and learn from. And the fact that you brought it up, you noticed it and then brought it up, is exactly what we're supposed to be doing in our practice. I said, wait a minute, something here is wrong, and let me become conscious of what's going on here. I'm kind of not paying attention. Why? And maybe you're bored by me. That's interesting to know. I mean, that's interesting to know. That's interesting information to know. Or it could be that it's threatening, or it's frightening, or it has implications that are difficult, and that's also interesting to know. I think she found out that you're down at West Avenue. I'll take this question and we'll come back to you. Why don't you sit with it if you want to say something else. Yes? In common for a number of us that enjoy Buddhism, and help in dealing with very troublesome customers, and I think it indicated the opportunity to be in a job where you see Buddhism every day come to you, to stress you. And all of these people are opportunities trying to teach you that we're intelligent people, that we're all Buddhists. We're trying to bend you in different ways, and it's a wonderful opportunity to get a chance to practice with different Buddhists continually. They're coming and bringing you exactly what you need. And the problem of dealing with many, many, many problems. Some of the things that we do is find one good thing that you do during the day, and really reflect on that one thing that you solve, and then you write it down on the computer screen, and say, wow, you really did that. Just that one thing helped to block out some of the other challenges from the other groups. One question, in reading on anger, there are some readings that have a format for dealing with anger that relate to deciding if it is true or not true. And then if you can do something about it, or not do something about it, as a decision matrix, have you read that, or are you familiar with that? I don't know. What interests me is, I'm reluctant to use the kind of language of true and not true, because in the moment of feeling the experience of anger, it's a true experience. The judgments or the projection that it involves might be true or not true, but the experience itself is true, and that's all I need to know. And then what I'll do is I'll step back behind it and say, what is the fear of the hurt that stimulated it, and is that based on a true false interpretation? But the feeling of hurt is real. And then I'll keep looking, what I keep doing is trying to study what's the real experience in the situation. And as long as I can stay in touch with the real experience, I'm actually reluctant to discount the feeling based on whether the content is true or false. Does that make sense? So, back to you. Because that was quite wonderful that you spoke up on what you felt. Do you have anything else you want to say about it, or anything else that occurs to you? Well, there have been people in my life who've gotten really angry, I guess, and really frightened people as a child. This might be too difficult to reconstruct, but can you remember, was there a certain point in the discussion today where you checked out? Do you remember? Well, I noticed when you used that word, repression, that I started feeling sort of like I was going to go, lame. I don't have to wait for it. I guess I don't know what the next step is. There are some other species that are closely connected to anger. Guilt is one of them. Depression is one that is a species of anger. It's kind of frozen or stuck emotion or anger, stuck expression often. And another one is boredom. Boredom is also a kind of subtle, stuck aversion that might arise. So it's all really great stuff. And, you know, I could talk a lot more about anger, but probably this is enough for one day. Yes? Sometimes when we can tolerate the horrible, then we dissociate, and I mean we're not quite there, you know, part of somewhere else. It's a protective mechanism to dissociate. It's a protective mechanism when you get overwhelmed. And that's what I want to take away from it. And the other thing that I find so difficult to handle with anger, it almost seems a little infectious, you know? That's a good point. You hear that? And it's like I have all this anger, and it almost falls over, and at the end of the day there was some kind of an agitation. So it's kind of left of all this. I think that's really hard to deal with. You know, in psychiatry we call it projected identification. That, you know, somewhat kind of projects all this stuff out, and we kind of identify in some ways with it, you know? And then we're going hard and we feel relief. I'm a psychiatrist, and I think that some of the patients, you know, the condition is just being underprivileged, and there is a lot of anger. And when I'm confronted with the love, I, you know, sometimes come home in the evening and I'm agitated, you know? I came home and my roommate said, let's like tap into her room, and she said, she shouldn't tap. And then I felt really this whole thing coming up and feeling I'm privileged, you know? So I think that really it's still though. One of the things about, when we start studying anger more carefully, and we start understanding some of the roots of our anger, is it's possible then to let the emotional response to a situation rest at the roots before it becomes anger. So if, for example, fear triggers anger, if we really see that and see the fear when it arises, we can learn to kind of keep it at the level of fear and respond to the situation responsibly at just the level of fear and doesn't have to move into anger. If we feel hurt or feel distressed, there's a tremendous amount of terrible things in our society in this world. People treat each other terribly, horribly. And you can feel a lot of distress and a lot of pain. Reading the papers or just talking to some of the people who live in our society who are really suffering because of the injustice that exists. And one of the responses would be angry. But the anger itself arises out of the pain that we feel. And if we just let, it's enough just to feel the pain. It's healthy to feel the pain. And then from the pain, find other responses besides anger. Some people say, well, anger has a purpose because I get all this energy, I can take care of things. That's true. But I think it's also possible to learn as effective ways, as energized ways to take care of things that don't depend on anger to get us energized. And so one of the opportunities that exists is when we understand the roots of the anger, the underlying feeling that's stimulating the anger, we can get that energized response from that rather than from the anger itself. Makes sense? Yes. I know that you say this every time, but what I find the most difficult is not getting involved in the story. It's really hard for me. And you say, well, sit there and feel it. And what I do is I go over and over and over and over and over. And I'm just mad and hurt and whatever. And it's very hard for me to just know how to do that without telling myself the story over and over. This person was so awful to me. So close your eyes for a moment. And recall the time when you were just going over and over in a story, over and over and over again, spinning the story. What does it feel like in your head to do that? Well, very energized and very chaotic. Which of those seems the most predominant for you? Energy. So where do you feel the energy? Here. And what happens when you feel the energy there? Is it difficult to be with that energy? Yes. So what makes it difficult? I'm not sure. Is there resistance? Yes. And where's the resistance? Where do you feel the resistance in your body? Also in my chest. So I don't know if you said earlier that you have a hard time dropping down into the bodily experience of it. But sometimes by feeling, doing as we did now, just feeling the energetics of it is one way in. Because when your mind is spinning around, spinning around, spinning around, it's actually quite uncomfortable. There's actually a feeling of discomfort, energetic discomfort. And that part of your body, the experience that feels the discomfort, loves to get attention, loves to get the salve of awareness. If you could find what in your experience wants that salve of awakening, then... And so if you're looking too quickly, like you have some idea of what it means to be in your body, you might never find it. But you want to find that part of the experience which is begging for a little massage, a massage of awareness. So could you just be the energy? Yes. One of the techniques that I learned at two day retreats that I appreciated very much related to anchor was Carol Wilson talking about, rather than doing a walking meditation, doing a walking meditation. And not so much just to express the anger, but to quick start it, drop the story line and feel it. That's nice. Excellent. Excellent. And it's something that I listened to what you were saying, and it's just being so calm about the anger. And it's really hard to do with your expectations. So the stomping meditation is really, anyway, what's the most effective thing? That's nice. Thank you for filling that in. And if I'm angry enough, that's what I'll do too. I would say stomp, but if I'm angry enough, I might not sit. I might just go for a long walk and just kind of, in the walking, kind of let that be, let that help me be the open channel to it. Because finding somebody to be open channel to it is so useful. If the sitting doesn't do it, find another way. And what you say is quite nice, but giving enough channel to it, enough expression of it in that kind of way, it helps us kind of not be in the story, perhaps, but allow it to be there fully. And what I hope is that that kind of movement is different than catharsis. No, it's not. So what's the difference? It's not just, it's not like pounding the pillow. It's different. Yes. What's the difference between what you're talking about and catharsis? Oh, can't you, catharsis, you're asking? No, no. I think it's very important to see the difference because catharsis, for me, is somehow acting on the feelings. The stomping that you're talking about sounds to me more like you're not acting on it, but rather you're just giving, giving space for those energies to move through you. Right. You're quick-starting, kick-starting them. Maybe. Could you say something about practices like forgiveness or loving kindness in relation to looking at the anchor or being with the anchor? Is this something that might be done in order to make the anchor change into something else, or can it be worked within another way? Sure. One of the nice things about Nancy's comment and Alison's comment is what you'll get, and if you compare that to what I've already said, is what you'll feel, is that I have certain predict-elections for dealing with things in a certain way, and that's just who I am. So those of you who listen to me a lot just have to realize that I just have my way, you have to find your way. So that's the way things have to be always. I can't. So my tendency is really to... I tend to be a little bit of a purist around mindfulness, just to really bring mindfulness to bear on something. But sometimes mindfulness itself is not enough, or it doesn't really work in certain situations. And then there's other tools that can be used, if mindfulness is not the appropriate one. And one of them is to offer what's called the antidote to anger. You kind of bring that which balances anger, and the practice of loving kindness, mental practices, in Buddhism is the great balance, the antidote to anger. And sometimes the very traditional instructions, when there's a lot of anger, is rather than to be mindful of it, is actually to cultivate the opposite, to cultivate the feelings of love or loving kindness or friendliness. And that's very powerful to do. Forgiveness is also very powerful because forgiveness is the antidote to resentment. Loving kindness is the antidote to anger, and forgiveness is the antidote to frozen anger, which I call resentment. Because forgiveness is... We had a long discussion in the last couple of days at home about forgiveness. I mean, this is maybe another topic. Someone lent me this book called The Sunflower. Someone you know it? It's a Holocaust survivor who survived the camps in Poland. And he didn't know whether he was going to live from one day to the next, living in the camps. And a lot of the people around him were being killed and shot and dying. And it was quite awful. But they had to go out on a work duty every day. And one day he was taken into town out of the camps to go work in a German hospital. And they were kind of just doing kind of menial work around the hospital. And a nurse came up to him and said, Are you Jewish? Now, that's... When German asks you if you're Jewish, it's not such a good thing during World War II. But he said yes. He said, well, come with me. So he followed this nurse into this patient's room where this one man was by himself. The only time someone was really by themselves in a room is because they're dying. They put dying patients alone. And he was all bandaged up. And the nurse said, OK, you go, this patient wants to talk to you. And she left the room and closed the door. And the patient was a German officer, an SS officer, who had volunteered for the SS but had reluctantly been involved in some of the... A massacre of Jews in Russia. A horrible massacre that he was kind of forced to be part of. And then a couple of days later, he stepped on a Russian mine. And he was terribly... ...maimed. And he was shuttled around different hospitals. And they came to this hospital in Poland. And he was actually going to... He was dying. And he was telling the whole story of his involvement with the massacre, his involvement with the SS and everything to this... ...this Jew. And the Jew didn't want to hear it. He kept wanting to leave. And the guy said, please stay. And he held his hand. Don't leave. So he heard him out, the whole story. And when he finished his whole story, he said to the Jewish prisoner, please grant me forgiveness. And at this point, the Jewish prisoner turned around and walked out of the room. And then that night, I think, the German soldier died. And he was... He'd been reflecting on this ever since, his decision about not to offer forgiveness. And so there is a true story. And he continues telling this a little bit. It's about 60 or 70 pages of story. And then the rest of the book is made up of essays, short essays, by all kinds of interesting people about their reflections on that situation, about whether he should have offered forgiveness or not. So we've had these conversations at home, and my mother-in-law who's visiting, she survived Bergen-Belsen. She's a Holocaust survivor also. So to ask her, it's a good person to ask. And the thing that... She said a number of things about forgiveness. But my wife said, the purpose of... We were talking about... My mother-in-law couldn't quite understand what forgiveness is. And my wife said that you have to remember that forgiveness is primarily for yourself and not so much for the other person. And part of what forgiveness is is releasing what's frozen inside of you. And so it's for your own sake that you forgive. And that's maybe part of it. And then I said that, for me, forgiveness was a little bit more, but it was actually willing to enter into a relationship of some goodwill again towards the person. It wasn't pardoning them from what they did or ignoring it or excusing it or justifying it. But still, even so, forgiveness is willing to have some kind of expression of goodwill. And my mother-in-law said, she feels that she no longer has any resentment, but she doesn't feel any need to have any goodwill. So that's how I answer it. Anyway, so to Alison's question about... So one of the antidotes to resentment is to do what we call forgiveness practice, to actually offer forgiveness, realizing that forgiveness is maybe for ourselves, not necessarily for the other person. So it's a big world of a lot of suffering and a lot of atrocities and a lot of stuff. The world is a tremendously painful place. And one of the ways in which we perpetuate the pain of the suffering of the world is by contributing to... is by being unskillful about our anger. And probably one of the greatest sources for a lot of this world's suffering is unskillful expressions of anger. And I think it's... I believe that it's a great gift that we give the world, those of us who actually study our anger, rather than just simply act on it blindly, and to learn how to hold it inside of ourselves, whether it's stomping or meditation or whatever, but hold it and really feel it, give us pure, unjudgmental presence to that feelings. And then from that ability to begin teasing apart really what's going on here, both in ourselves and also in others, when others are angry, so we can meet them with compassion and caring rather than reactivity. So I think it's a really powerful and wonderful thing to do and important thing for us to do. So I hope that tonight's talk is for the benefit of the well-being of many people. Next week, many of those people are coming here. I believe, isn't it next week I do the introductory course? It's not? I haven't given my ethics talks. I can't be. Well, I wasn't going to do ethics this time. But, okay, no, so it's a six or seven. So I guess there's a two weeks. So two weeks we have introductory course. We have introductory course. The next week next week is just more of the same. No, not necessarily. Not necessarily. Tonight with ethics.
