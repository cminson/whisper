 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. The We're coming now to the very end of this series on the Satipatanasuta. And it's a practice that is offered by the Buddha for the purposes of ending sorrow, limitations, suffering, distress, for the purification of beings, for the attainment of nirvana or liberation. It's designed to address some of the most fundamental existential issues that humans can have. And while it's sometimes taught in the modern world, mindfulness at least is taught for stress reduction, the Satipatana discourse is really being taught here for the highest realization of the end of suffering. And in this regard, it's often, and traditionally, this practice of Satipatana is considered to be the best practice to have as a person is dying. So to learn this practice well and have it close at hand, and then to, as we're dying, to have this available, to know, to value it, to be able to do it with some ease, not as a forceful practice, but as almost as a natural expression of life as we're dying. And there's a teachings that the Buddha gave to his son that he said that if someone cultivates mindfulness, in this case, he was talking about mindfulness of breathing, that a person will know their last inhale and last exhale as it ceases, as it ends. The tradition says that this means that the person will die calmly, but I believe it's deeper than that, that there's something about being calmly present for one, and really present for one's last breath without being afraid, without being angry, without being distressed, is a phenomenal opportunity, phenomenally wonderful and important way to die. And so the question for this meditation for you is that what is it about being present for the end of, especially the exhale, but the end of inhale, the end of the exhale, as if it's one's last exhale, one's last inhale, and that one follows it all the way out calmly, and what's available there in terms of letting go, in terms of peace? What is it? And that's kind of the question I'd like to leave you for here for this meditation, is that as you settle down and are present, what might there be there with writing, tracking the ending of the inhale, the ending of the exhale, that is invaluable at the time of dying? The ceasing, the letting go, the releasing. And perhaps during this sitting, with all that we've done now these months on Satyavatthana and being present for experience, maybe there can be this question that you engage in with every exhale, every inhale. What is it? What is it about that exhale? What happens there? What's available there? What's the possibility there? What is it that is so important, so valuable that the Buddha is pointing to? And I suggest that if you take this up as a way of being present today, this question, that you don't answer it analytically, you don't answer it cognitively so much that might come as a byproduct, but rather in the stillness of the mind, the answer is in the stillness and the silence and the peacefulness. But have the question and see what comes. And then we'll just sit here today quietly and you have lots of instructions here and guidance and today you're left here with yourself and your own breathing. And I ask you all to log off immediately and look as this..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... peacefully, intimately, with that connection, free of clinging. And with care, may we care for everyone, all the people suffering, all the people going through this human life. May it be that they are happy. May it be that they find safety. May it be that they find peace. May it be that they find freedom. May we live for the welfare and benefit and care of everyone we encounter. And may it be that they find peace. And may it be that they find peace.
