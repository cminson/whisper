The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So I'm a little bit touched or find a wonderful resonance that last Sunday I
gave a talk about Martin Luther King Jr. and this day I'll talk about
Thich Nhat Hanh and they knew each other and they influenced each other. Martin
Luther King was influenced by Thich Nhat Hanh to be opposed to the Vietnam War
and monumental change in his direction of his work that he did when there was
controversial and in retrospect was probably a wonderful and important
change. And in return, partly Martin Luther King but a whole civil rights
movement in the United States had a big impact on Thich Nhat Hanh and he learned
about it while he was staying here in this country in the very early 1960s
and when he went back to Vietnam it inspired him to do the kind of
service work and anti-war work that he dedicated himself to until he was
exiled by the government. So Thich Nhat Hanh was one of the great teachers of
the 20th century and had a huge influence on Western Buddhism. As I said
he was exiled I think around 1964 so from Vietnam and then he settled in
France and and from there started slowly beginning to teach more and more and
that became aware of him in the early 1980s and he was I was living at the
San Francisco Zen Center and and he was contacted to support when the Zen
Center went through tremendous turmoil around the ethical challenges of its
abbot at the time and he tried he was a consultant for both the abbot and for
the Zen Center as a whole and and then he came to Zen Center and he had a big
impact on the students at Zen Center and for a variety of reasons one was that he
included children and he would give a Dharma talk and he'd have the children
come and sit up front and he would talk to them and then they would leave and
he'd give a talk for the adults and while this seems like a small thing in
the kind of a little bit more austere or strict model of Japanese Zen that
San Francisco Zen Center inherited it that was not done that kind of blending
and so it kind of broke the mold and opened up to a whole different kind of
softness and then kindness he also gave a lot of emphasis on lay practitioners
and of course Sam Francisco Zen Center had a lot of lay practitioners but
Tick Man Han kind of elevated the importance of lay practice and also
elevated the importance of lay teachers and I don't think Sam Francisco Zen
Center had really any recognition of lay teachers at that time and a number of the
senior lay practitioners started spending time with Tick Man Han so I'm
going to France to be with him and then became we're transmitted we're
authorized to be teachers in Tick Man Han's lineage and this idea that a lay
person could be become a Buddhist teacher was also kind of novel and kind
of opened up the field and appreciation for lay people in the in the scene he
also had a gentleness and dedication to non-violence and kindness and softness
and to joy and happiness that also was not quite the ethos of Sam Francisco
Zen Center he came and gave us meditation instructions that included
using phrases which was very different from the more silent just sitting
practice that we did and some of the phrases were things like breathing in I
calm my body breathing out I smile
stepping I experienced joy stepping I feel home and so he had all these kind
of phrases that were incorporated into the meditation practice and a member
using them back then and feeling all this joy and delight that that was and to
feel that this was permitted and part of the practice was somewhat novel in the
mid 1980s for me and for some of the other Zen students at the time so he had
a big influence on the local Buddhist communities that I was part of but he
did that for much of the world and he traveled around the world and taught
all over and the after meeting a Thich Nhat Hanh at the San Francisco Zen
Center the next time I met met him was coincidentally I flew into I went back
to Norway to visit my relatives and when I arrived at the airport there are all
these people clearly Buddhists waiting for something special to happen and my
relatives who were waiting for me where I was a Zen priest by then was a little
bit when what's going on here are they waiting for Gil but what I came out of
the into their rival section I had no importance for the people who are
waiting Thich Nhat Hanh was flying flew in on the very next plane so they were
there waiting for him so knowing that Thich Nhat Hanh was going to be there I
spent the weekend with him in a in a school classroom where he was teaching a
relatively small group of people and that was really special to spend this
time with him the Thich Nhat Hanh was a man of I think tremendous emotional depth
emotional capacity he suffered a lot and and he openly talked about it to his
suffering and wrote poems about it he was very creative he was a poet he was a
storyteller he was had a rich imagination a rich use of language very
evocative he was innovative he was probably one of the more innovative
teachers especially monastic teachers of the 20th century pushing the edge and
changing things and doing innovative things with Buddhism itself it's a
famous idea of him is that he was one of the first Buddhist monks to ride a
bicycle and maybe it seems like a small thing but this was kind of really
pushing the boundaries into the modern world he started his own monastic order
that the order of interbeing in Vietnam 1960s because he saw a need to kind of
emphasize a whole different ethos the whole different approach to Buddhism he
coined important terms he called coin the term engage Buddhism which involved
Buddhism that was actively engaged in the social welfare of the world and which
he was to the degree to endanger to at the risk of his own life in fact some of
his colleagues had worked with him lost their lives during the Vietnam War in
their nonviolent work and that was a misunderstood by both sides of the
Vietnam War because he wasn't supporting one side against the other he was seen
as belonging to the other and so both sides saw him that way so he was kind
of in a risky middle but he was dedicated to not having enemies to
working for nonviolence to working for ending the war and they made him
unpopular so eventually became you know exiled but you know this was part of
parcel of his engage Buddhism to see active work in the world and maybe it's
not a coincidence that is his name tick not Han the tick part means that he's a
kind of means he's a child of the Buddha he's in the clan of the Buddha and the
family and the Buddha family and many monks in Thailand are called tick because
of that once you're a day and you join your child of the Buddha kind of and on
the tick not not means one and Han means action so he was a man of action to
engage Buddhism tremendous action and what the one refers to I don't know it's
a lot of symbolic value what one is and but one thing it meant was that when I
knew him and I think other people the tremendous presence he had to just do
the thing he was doing whatever action he was doing that's what he did if he
was drinking tea it was just drinking tea if he was walking just walking and to
be in his presence was excuse me for a moment
to be in his presence was to kind of slow down and and he kind of like brought
you into the present because he was so present and there was a kind of
commanding his gentleness and his softness and his slowness was kind of
commanding to everyone slow down and and and so you know it wasn't like fast
action wasn't like he was in a hurry for anything no hurry whatsoever one action
you just do one thing at a time but in that one thing at a time slowly calmly
he was able to do a phenomenal amount of things
phenomenal amount of teaching action support innovation started monasteries
or you certainly he got lots of help at some point but in the beginning you know
him and his colleagues were able to really foster a phenomenal movement of
Buddhist movement one of the great movements of the modern world and and he
had a tremendous amount of wonderful teachings that he offered we get a sense
of his emotional depth and the degree to which he suffered especially during the
time of the Vietnam War from some of the poetry he wrote at that time and so I
would like to read some of that and this poem is titled for warmth I hold my
face in my two hands no I am not crying I hold my face in my two hands to keep
the loneliness warm two hands protecting two hands nourishing two hands
preventing my soul from leaving me in anger and he talks about you know much
of what he had to deal with and work with in during the Vietnam War and later
the things that people did to each other left him angry and but he he practiced
with it and here's an example of how he practiced with it and this idea of
holding his face with his two hands in the cupped hands over the face holding
his loneliness holding his anger I think is a very tender and way of being
mindful and present some of his fellow monks some of the some of me he knew I
don't know if he knew all of them but he were the ones who burnt themselves in
protest to the war they sat in the streets and poured gasoline over
themselves and there's photographs probably most of you have seen them
of the monks sitting there in meditation posture calmly sitting and
meditating with the engulfed in fire as they're burning until they died and so
here's one poem the fire that burns in you burns my flesh with such pain that
all my tears are not enough to cool your sacred soul deeply wounded I remain
here keeping your hopes and promises for the young I will not betray you are
you listening I remain here because your very heart is now my heart so yeah
had these things pained him tremendously the loss the pain the suffering this is
a man who suffered a lot but he was not afraid to suffer he was not crippled by
a suffering he practiced with it he turned it around he composted it he
dedicated it to a different way of living here's another poem and this was
printed in 1966 for the fellowship of reconciliation as a Christmas card life
has left her footprints on my forehead but I have become a child again this
morning the smile seen through leaves and flowers is back to smooth away the
wrinkles as the rains wipe away footprints on the beach again a cycle of
birth and death begins I walk on thorns but firmly as among flowers I keep my
head high rhymes bloom among the sounds of bombs and
mortars the tears I shed yesterday have become rain I feel calm hearing it
sound on the thatched roof childhood my birth land is calling me and the rains
melt my despair I am still here alive able to smile quietly oh sweet fruit
brought forth by the tree of suffering carrying the dead body of my brother I
go across the rice fields in the darkness earth will keep you tight within
her arms my dear so that tomorrow you will be reborn as flowers those flowers
smiling quietly in the morning field this moment you weep no more my dear we
have gone through too deep a night this morning I kneel down on the grass when I
notice your presence flowers that carry the marvelous smile of ineffability
speak to me in silence the message the message of love and understanding has
indeed come to us so it's a thing is a powerful poem to describe his own
despair his own suffering and the depth of it and probably it's true that he
carried his dead colleague fellow monk to be buried the mortars and bombs that
were blowing up around him and he was he was on the you know he was there
working at the not exactly at the forefront of the war but right there
where it was happening around him and then to end with a message of love what
a powerful thing to do and then he you know and then he he offered would come
to come to us to here in the West and he would do walking meditation with us he
would do team meditation with us and this you know to walk with tick that
hon you're outdoors on the ground slowly mindfully was quite a powerful
experience here's a poem called the walking meditation take my hand we will
walk we will only walk we will enjoy our walk without thinking of arriving
anywhere walk peacefully walk happily our walk is a peace walk our walk is a
happiness walk then we learn that there is no peace walk that peace is the walk
that there is no happiness walk that happiness is the walk we walk for
ourselves we walk for everyone always hand-in-hand walk and touch peace every
moment walk and touch happiness every moment each step brings a fresh breeze
each step makes a flower bloom under our feet kiss the earth with your feet
print on earth your love and happiness earth will be safe when we feel in us
enough safety when we feel in us enough safety so to go from the suffering of
Vietnam in the first poems and his dedication to be in the present moment
and keep looking keeping present and seeing what is here and to be fully
with his suffering then fully with the flowers the next day and to be fully
with the suffering and ready to smile soon thereafter to be fully present for
this and then here we are walking and the earth will be safe when we feel in us
enough safety what does it take to be feel safe have safety within us is that
where safety is to be found is the earth safe when we find in safety in us I
think he would say yes to all those questions that and so he dedicated
himself to teaching people the what he called the miracle of mindfulness to
show up for this moment right here but it wasn't just to show up for it he
emphasized penetrating through to the depth of it seeing through to some kind
of to the ultimate that was there and and so what I read the poem I read the
Vagata I read beginning of the meditation I'll read it again that the
Chan Zen tradition that he was part of classically they used a lot of Gattas
the four line verses and when I was in Japan we were given verses to recite
when we washed our hands we use the toilet and do all kinds of ordinary
things so he had one here I have arrived I am I am home so this again is
emphasis of coming home but here finding it in the present moment I have
arrived I am home in the here in the now I'm solid I am free in the ultimate I
dwell here's another poem with his anger angry in the ultimate dimension I
close my eyes and look deeply 300 years from now where will you be and where
shall I be speaking to his anger anger in 300 years from now where will you be
and where shall I be angry in the ultimate dimension then he wrote when we
are angry what do we usually do we shout scream and try to blame someone else
for our problems but looking at anger with the eyes of impermanence we can
stop and breathe angry at each other in the ultimate dimension we close our eyes
and look deeply we try to see 300 years into the future what will you be like
what will I be like where will you be where will I be we need only to breathe
in and out look at our future and other person's future we don't need to look as
far as 300 years it could be 50 or 60 years from now when we have both passed
away and so he kept emphasizing looking deeply but for him looking deeply in
with impermanence was also kind of open this rich multi-dimensional world that
also used the imagination imagining 300 years in the future and he wouldn't look
in the famous exercise he gave was was to look at a piece of paper and
basically imagined that you see deeply with your mind if you look see deeply
with your imagination you see more than just a paper you see the tree that grew
that became the paper you see the rain that in the soil that nourished
the tree to grow you saw the Sun that's shown in sunlight on it that allowed the
tree to grow you see the person who cut the tree down the people who converted
the paper the people who brought the paper to the store the storekeeper who
sold it to you and you see this rich world that included the ecology that
we're in included the social world we live in and to see all of it together
and in some big way for him was part of waking up to this world and it's partly
maybe why he had such a strong social message that he saw us living in this
what he called interbeing world an interdependent world where we our own
being was no separate than the being of everyone else we enter are is the we
enter are we we exist because someone else exists here you wrote a poem
the title interrelationship you are me and I am you isn't it obvious that we
enter are you cultivate the flower in yourself so that I will be beautiful I
transform the garbage in myself so that you will not suffer I support you you
support me I am in this world to offer you peace you are this and you are in
this world to being to bring me joy so inter are inter being and so you saw
this at the social level at an environmental level all kinds of
levels so he kept emphasizing you know this level in which we enter are and
powerful teachings for him the last week I read a passage by Martin Luther King
where he said that God is love so I don't know if what degree that influence
Thich Nhat Hanh but he had this wonderful book I mean it said more and he
said anthology of different people writing about this but just a title it
was inspiring for me very meaningful when I first came out the title is for a
future to be possible commentaries on the five wonderful precepts so the five
precepts that we have he called wonderful precepts he always would put
these adjectives in front of things and you know that kind of superlatives about
wonderful and wondrous and things like that and so he's talking about the five
ethical precepts and but for a future to be possible and I think it's a powerful
idea we know isn't future going to come futures will always come but will we be
there as a human race for the futures what kind of future will we have and so
and so ethics is part of that and but he wrote the five wonderful precepts are
love itself to love is to understand protect and bring well-being to the
object of our love the practice of the precepts accomplishes this we protect
ourselves and we protect others I am confident that our children and their
children will have an even better understanding of the five precepts and
will obtain even deeper peace and joy this hopeful message so he was looking
into the future he was looking into the past he was looking at this wide
imagination creative imagination throughout the world and he was saying
just show up here when you walk just walk only walk and you know really drink
your tea and just drink your tea so this guy at this capacity had to switch
orientations to understand and to grow and develop and open up and focus and
be here and work through his sorrow and his grief and find happiness and joy
was phenomenal the humanity of this man and to bring so much humanity into his
Buddhism his Buddhist teachings was kind of exceptional I think for any
Buddhist teacher and so he died I think on Thursday we say he died and I suspect
if he said that for himself I died he would have followed it up by there is
no death and he talked about that sometimes there is no death but this
idea of no death no birth and no death that's to be that's not to be believed
or understood logically but it's to be discovered in really being present just
here and now free of our abstract ideas or proliferations free of our stories free
of our concepts and there's something about just being present in the purity
of simplicity of presence that shows a deathless realm shows that birthless
realm shows some aspect of attention of awareness that is free of concepts and
ideas of past and future free of anything but just here and to and to
find his freedom and peace and to feel at home and to recognize this is the
ultimate this is profound this is a profundity which is always here it's a
dimension of that in a certain kind of way doesn't depend on our concepts and
and ideas and our thoughts in a sense doesn't depend on our existence and but
it's the kind of a true home and so in it there's no birth and death there's
just being present so to be fully present the moment of your death for that
moment is being a timeless deathless moment and then afterwards well it
continues to be the same timeless moment and something there's freedom there
that's the avenue for love for this richness that he was so much about was
inclusive of all this so he has a kind of final tribute to him and maybe in a
way that he would appreciate and to quote him again he was a teacher and he
spent tremendous amount of time teaching and the testimony of all his
teaching is all the books that those produced something like a hundred books
in English but he wrote or said teaching is not done by talking alone it is done
by how you live your life my life is my teaching my life is my message so my life
is my message and that message continues he's still alive and his example lives in
us in our memories and those of us he touched and those of us who learn about
him and and as a teaching that points back to ourselves and imagine how would
you live if your life was the message if your life was your teaching and then
maybe we would realize our true nature in the way they take that Han refers to
such language he said our true nature is the nature of no birth and no death
only when we touch our true nature can we transcend the fear of not existing the
fear annihilation so I'm inspired by tick not Han I'm saddened by his passing
I'm inspired by his passing because his passing is just as much as message and to
not see his passing as part of his teachings part of his message is to miss
his teachings miss who he what he was about and so to hold both to hold this
wide range of feelings we have and not to get caught in the feelings and stuck
in them but see them too as part of this interbeing that is not ours alone and
that which by seeing and with the eyes of impermanence seeing with depth we
find our freedom and perhaps our smile in the midst of our sadness may it be
that tick not Han's life
grows the smiles that can exist in this world the smiles of the children may
the children smile a lot and may we support that the smiles of our elders
may our lives be one that brings smiles to them so they experience smiles
before they die their smiles grow smiles for our neighbors smile for our
colleagues smiles for our family or friends maybe live a life that spreads
smiles throughout the world smiles that can help us to hold kindly lovingly
compassionately the sorrows of this world as well may the memory of taking a
hot dick not Han support us guide us inspire us and continue to to benefit
this world for a long time thank you all
