 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Warm greetings from IMC in Redwood City, California. I have a delightful feeling of the goodwill that somehow circles the spot that I'm in, through all the YouTube, spreading out in all directions. I hope that each of you maybe can feel the same thing that from your spot there are circles of goodwill as this community gathers around the globe. This week I'm offering little exercises, mindfulness exercises, that go along with the teachings that I'm doing. The idea is to continue with your mindfulness practice as you do it. But then this little exercise might be relevant that you could do as you go along. Now this one has to do with the idea that something happens and then we react to it. Of course we don't always react, but there are reactions. There's a difficult sound outside, uncomfortable sound, and then we react to it. We get involved in it, we get for and against it, we start thinking about it. It might not be a perfect match for our English idea of reaction. But the Buddha used the word knot entanglement. Sometimes it's translated into English as fetter. So I'm knot, getting knotted up in something. So this idea of getting caught, maybe we use in English. But if you get caught in the spider web, the spider web is kind of responsible. When we get knotted up, we're the ones who create the knot. We tie ourselves up. And so as you go along in this meditation, I want to say one more thing that this way in which we get knotted up with things, caught in things, is not always so conscious. It happens a little bit, not necessarily in the unconscious, but it happens under the radar. We're busy focusing on whatever we do, and we don't notice some of the more subtle ways we get entangled and caught. So this exercise, as you go along doing the basic mindfulness practice, whatever you notice, whatever you're noticing, like if you're noticing the in-breath or the out-breath, you're noticing a sound, a body sensation, a feeling, whatever it is that comes into awareness. If you're caught in it, reacting to it, entangled with it, then use the word label knot, K-N-O-T. And I kind of delight in this label because it can also be spelled N-O-T. So in other words, knot this. Let's not get entangled. Let's not get knotted up. So just say very gently, lovingly, calmly, knot, knot. There's a knot. Recognizing there's a knot and a little subliminal kind of feeling, maybe not. Maybe I don't need to. So just knot. And just notice, so if you start thinking about something, start thinking about your breath, in a subtle way, maybe without any discomfort, you are kind of not, in the Buddhist language, you're not knotted up in it. You're now involved in it. So maybe involved is an English word for this, but knotted up. So if this seems like too much, or you don't care for this, please, you don't have to do it. But it might be interesting to notice how often, in some way or other, you get involved in what's happening. And it might be interesting to see what happens if you just quietly recognize it as a knot. So taking a meditative posture, establishing posture that's upright or alert or supportive for you, and the one that also allows you to relax, to relax, to make room for yourself to become calmer, for calmness to be here as well. And even if you're agitated, there could be a wave of calmness or an envelope of calmness around it. Gently closing your eyes. And taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. With the idea that these deeper breaths are calming you, bringing some calm, some subtleness, especially as you exhale, that calming, peaceful effect. Breathing in, breathing out. Letting your breathing return to normal. And on the exhale for a little while, relax your body, different parts of your body, with the idea that each little micro relaxation is a gentle calming, settling. And steadying yourself on a normal breath, calming yourself into an attention centered on breathing. Maybe the exhale has a little peacemaking movement, a wave of calming, settling. And allow yourself to feel the calming, soothing impact of exhaling. Even if it's just near the end of the exhale. Letting go of thoughts. Every exhale, letting go of thoughts. And if you find yourself involved with anything in the present moment, thinking, feelings, body sensations, sounds, any concern, anything that we call the concern, because you're caught up in it, they're involved. Gently, lovingly, say the word not, recognize it as a not, an entanglement. And see what happens in the wake of simply recognizing there's such no need to let go of it. Just recognize, oh, there's a not. And then continue with your breathing. And continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. If you are involved in thinking, you probably have a not, an entanglement. It can feel innocent enough to be involved in thinking. But when it takes us out of the flow of the present moment, we would call it a not. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing. Continue with your breathing.
