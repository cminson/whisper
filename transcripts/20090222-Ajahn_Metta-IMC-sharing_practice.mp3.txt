Thank you very much for introducing us, too. 
I'm very sorry to have been interrupting you when you read out the bio, because this is, I think this is at least three or four years old, in between things have been changing, or things always change. 
As you all know, that's just part of being alive and being in Sanctara. 
And so basically what my life, how my life is unfolding right now is that I'm spending time here in the Bay Area, which is at the moment rather unusual, because I and also Ajahn Santachita, we live in a monastery in England. 
And we are in the process, together with at least one other nun, Ajahn Ananda Bodhi, to look into the possibility of moving over here. 
We have got an invitation from the Sarana Loka Trust, our Sarana Loka Foundation, who is built up with the possibility of bringing nuns from our tradition over here to build up a monastery. 
And this is what we are looking into right now. 
So we have been, for the last two months, we have been in contact with many groups like yours, not all as large as this one. 
Actually, I'm quite impressed and very glad to see so many of you coming here. 
And I think this is not just because we are here. 
I think this is what you usually do. 
You come together and you practice the Dharma, which is just wonderful. 
And personally, I feel very touched coming here and seeing the interest of people like you, the interest in the Dharma, in the possibility that it brings into our lives, the possibility of change in regards to bringing more depth and more reflection, contemplation and direct experience into this. 
I was asking, when we started to go around and visiting different groups, which my first experience was in the end of 2007, I actually have been visiting this group before and I do recognize some of the faces. 
And it's really wonderful to see you back at this time. 
The question that comes up is, what brings us actually here? What brings us coming together and practicing together? What is it that brings this possibility into our lives? If I look back into how my personal path or how I came to that, it was because of very obvious changes in my life. 
Like I had been married and I had experienced this marriage coming to an end and there was the change, it was there right in front of my face and with that also the suffering that it brought. 
And out of that looking into what possibilities are there now, how do I relate to this situation, what does this change bring and maybe also what does it open up that I haven't been looking into before. 
And I think when I meet people who come to the monastery, I can see that many of them have had whether a very similar situation or really very strong changes of other nature. 
Maybe some of them have been losing their work and had to look into, okay, what now? What is the next step from here? But basically looking deeper we can see changes that bring the experience of suffering. 
And of course this brings us directly into the teaching of the Buddha. 
He has said many times what I'm teaching is understanding suffering and seeing the way that leads out of suffering. 
For doing that I think three steps are very important. 
The first step is really contemplating and reflecting on suffering that we do experience in our lives, in the different situations that we are going through in our lives. 
The next step is really turning towards it, the direct experience of suffering. 
What does it mean? How does it unfold? How does it feel when I'm really in it right now, when it happens? And another step that comes in a way out of both is opening up to a deeper understanding of the place of suffering in our lives. 
What does it show us? What opportunity brings it actually? Are we willing to look deeper into that? Are we willing to look deeper into the reality that unfolds right now? Can I see things as they are? Can I allow myself to see things as they are? For the first step I think most of you or probably all of you who are here have experienced our practicing contemplation and reflection. 
I think otherwise you would not be here. 
That is the very reason to come and to practice together with others and to listen to the Dharma, to study the Dharma. 
Because the Buddha has been giving us, in his teachings, he has been giving us the tools, the tools to use for a deeper understanding. 
For a reflecting, to turn towards painful experiences in our lives. 
And doing that without saying, well, everything of life is suffering. 
Because that is sometimes that gets misunderstood. 
The Buddha never said, well, everything is suffering. 
There is suffering and that is the difference. 
There is suffering in our lives and it unfolds at different times and at different degrees. 
We do experience suffering in ways of painful physical experiences, through illnesses, through physical weaknesses and we do experience suffering in terms of painful emotional experiences. 
Another way of experiencing is looking at changes, as I mentioned before. 
Maybe that is one of the main reasons why we have come here. 
Because there were changes in our lives that have brought a certain call to wake up to ask yourself, like, what I am actually doing here? What is the reason to be here? What is the meaning of this life? How can I use it? How can I use it skillfully? What did I do so far? How did I use it? At least what I am saying right now were questions that came up for myself. 
And looking at it, noticing, where are we right now? We only can start from where we are right now. 
If I look at where I would like to be, that is very helpful. 
That is kind of a name to look at or a direction to look at. 
But we always start from where we are. 
We can't do otherwise. 
It's the same like when you say, well, actually, there is only right now this moment. 
Past is not here anymore, has been done, and future is only to come. 
So what is, is only where we are right now. 
And this is where we have to start from. 
This is where we have to start from in our reflections and contemplation. 
And taking, say, taking the teaching of the Buddha like when he taught the Four Noble Truths, where he started from, what the First Noble Truth is, is there is suffering. 
Which means like how, how can we learn to open up to it? How can we, how can we turn towards it? Because it is something we usually rather would like to withdraw from or look into another direction, look at another experience. 
And I think we have to, when we wake up to, well, yes, there is suffering, and it is unfolding right now, here, turning towards it. 
This is the second step I mentioned earlier on, means really facing up to it. 
How does it, how does it unfold? What is the physical experience of that? Like where in the body do I feel it? Where and how does it manifest in the body? And how does it manifest in relation to others? Taking, taking the space to look at that and holding it without aversion in the mind are the main ingredients for being able to do that. 
We can only look deeper into suffering when we have a certain amount of receptiveness of welcoming it. 
Seeing that there is actually the chance by welcoming and receiving it to move to a deeper understanding, a deeper level of experience. 
When we cut out suffering, when we cut out those experiences that we rather don't like to feel, we also cut out the possibility of joy and happiness. 
Because when we deny suffering, we create a certain numbness, which means a numbness that does not only relate to suffering, to the experience of difficulties in our life. 
It spreads out into all other areas too. 
And turning towards suffering gives the opportunity for the heart to open, to actually do feel it. 
I mean, I don't know for you, but my personal experience of that is that actually when I really face up to it, when I look it into the face, I realize that what I thought it was was actually much bigger. 
It's like one of those, I think it's a kind of fairy tale or something like that. 
You see a giant in the back somewhere far away and he's enormous. 
You're just overwhelming and you just really don't want to come closer. 
You don't want to see it and you turn away. 
You just don't want to face up to that. 
But for some reason you have to, like in the story, like whoever that was, I can't remember. 
So when you have to walk closer to the giant, it actually shrinks our fear about suffering. 
And that is the suffering on top of the suffering. 
The fear of the suffering is that it is too overwhelming that we actually can't hold it. 
And there are ways of reassuring ourselves that we actually are able to hold it by walking step by step towards it and into it. 
That means we face up, we acknowledge and we, I would say, we wrap it into, or we bring it into a space of acceptance, of kindness. 
So we don't, that means we don't blame ourselves for experiencing suffering in life and we don't blame others for experiencing suffering in our lives. 
We can see, well, this is suffering. 
This is how it manifests. 
This is how I experience it, say, physically in the body or how it unfolds emotionally. 
Like, for example, sadness or the feeling of hurt or betrayal, or however the reason might be, whatever the reason is, that suffering unfolds right now. 
So we hold that experience with kindness and with acceptance. 
And we allow it to touch us. 
Instead of keeping a certain distance of cutting it out, of rejecting it, we actually open the heart towards it and allow it to touch us. 
When we do that, and when we do that, if you know it is really something very, very big in your life, you have to be skillful, you have to use wisdom with that, so that it is really not overwhelming. 
But usually we can do it in getting closer to it. 
It's almost like as if you are moving towards the shore of the ocean, you consciously step by step move closer to it. 
You allow it to touch you deeper. 
And using wisdom in the way that you also know, okay, this is as much as I can take right now. 
If I do, if I walk closer into it, if I walk deeper into it, it gets too overwhelming. 
And then I can't hold it anymore. 
And I think that is very important by working, working with suffering. 
And like looking at, for example, using the meditation practice for that, you can bring up an experience in your life where you have suffering or where you had had suffering. 
And when you start doing that, you don't choose the most difficult experience of your life. 
You start with something that you think is manageable. 
But in that way, you learn to develop a skill or a tool that you also can use outside of the meditation. 
By doing so, we turn towards directly experiencing it. 
By directly experiencing it and the contemplation and reflection, we actually, when we bring this together, we actually move into a deeper understanding, a deeper understanding of the First Noble Truth, a deeper understanding of the possibility that suffering brings, that it is an experience we share with all other beings in samsara, that samsara is around where suffering is experienced. 
And something I heard, I think it was about two weeks ago, Robert Thurman was speaking in San Francisco and together with two other sisters, I went to his talk and at one point what he said, and that really touched me very deeply, he said something like, there's samsara and there's nirvana and both is there at the same time and we are all together in that. 
And realizing that actually the work, and he emphasized that we have to do the work together, starting by doing the individual work. 
If we don't do our individual work, we can't also do it with others because that gives us the tools to do it. 
But if we realize it or not, we are all together in this. 
And if we open up to that possibility of being together, we actually give and receive the support from each other. 
And I think this is actually what you are doing here, by coming together, practicing as a lay sangha together. 
This is what you are doing. 
And this is how the path works. 
I hope that makes sense. 
When I look at my life, at a certain point in my life I have made this decision to ordain, to live monastic life. 
The reason for that was I want to live together with people who have the same aspirations, who also say this is the most important thing in my life. 
And I want to concentrate as much as I can to develop the spiritual path and to free myself from suffering. 
And discovering that actually I am not just freeing myself from suffering, I do share suffering while I am doing step by step more out of it. 
I hope that makes sense. 
I would like to offer this to you this morning. 
And we will have some time for questions and answers. 
But before I go into that, I would like to say a little bit more about what we are actually doing here. 
And just for five minutes or so. 
Right now we have a temporary vihara at San Francisco Sunset District. 
And we, as I said earlier on, we are looking into the possibility of building up a monastery for nuns in the Bay Area somewhere. 
We are coming from the Taishanga Forest tradition of Achencha and Achen-Sumedo. 
I think I'm sure quite a few of you have heard about them before. 
And we are living at Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in England so far. 
And there is the possibility, we have to wait right now for the okay of our elders to go ahead to start with the monastery actually by the end of this year. 
We have an invitation from the Saranaloka Foundation to come back and to start with it. 
These last two months of our stay here were absolutely amazing. 
It was wonderful to meet so many people who are interested in what we are doing, who are interested to support us in our lives. 
And actually quite a few of them are here. 
It's lovely to see you. 
And also who are considering the possibility to start training themselves. 
That actually is what we want to do here. 
We want to build up a place where women can come, stay with us, and the possibility to ordain as nuns as we are. 
And if you'd like to know more about this, I don't want to talk too much right now about this, we will be staying afterwards behind so you can ask us or also Jill, maybe raise your hand. 
Jill is actually the, not just director, you're the president of Saranaloka Foundation. 
So she knows everything about that and also we don't know a little bit. 
So you can approach us afterwards if you'd like to. 
And I open this space now for questions and answers. 
Thank you very much for your attention. 
There's material. 
Yeah, there's also like on the tables where you have all the information. 
There's the flyers about the Saranaloka Foundation and what we are doing. 
And there are some books from our tradition. 
So please, if you're interested, have a look at it. 
Okay, I'll stop here. 
So any questions? Sorry, I just mentioned you can also have a look at our website. 
There's a lot of information about Saranaloka Foundation is doing for the nuns. 
Thank you so much for coming and sharing your thoughts with us and sharing the Dharma. 
Is there any kind of presence in California for the Saranaloka Foundation? What you're doing for men? Yes. 
Could you expound on that, please? Maybe someday. 
We have in the north of, as a near-Ukai, there's a monastery called Aparagiri Monastery. 
That's from our tradition. 
They have also a website. 
But it has nothing to do with the Saranaloka Foundation. 
It's a broader monastery from our tradition. 
Is that what you mean? Archon Amaro, you know? I'm familiar with Aparagiri Monastery up there. 
There's a city of 10,000 Buddhas, which is the Mahayana tradition. 
It's quite near the city of 10,000 Buddhas. 
Just maybe 20 minutes from there. 
I'd like to know more about that. 
And also later on, once we have a monastery established, there will be also a possibility for a main come and stay, but not to train, but stay as guests will be possible. 
Just maybe to add that for, like you find, Aparagiri also has a website if you want to go and look at their place. 
If you want to, I can write it down later for you. 
Thank you. 
Would you be offering retreats for women at the monastery? That really depends on the situation of the monastery. 
What we are doing already is we do teach retreats. 
Like Archon Santachita and myself, we are going. 
. 
. 
I mean, it's not here. 
It's like now it is over on the East Coast. 
You'll probably all know IMS in Barra, Massachusetts, or Barrie, Massachusetts. 
Oh, okay. 
I'm German. 
Please excuse my accent. 
So we do teach a 10-day retreat there right now, like in the beginning of March. 
And when we come back here, like Archon Anandabodhi and myself, we will be teaching a retreat with Archon Amaro together. 
That will be at the Angela Center. 
Is that right? Thanksgiving retreat. 
Yeah, the Thanksgiving retreat, but it's not a retreat just for women. 
But when we come back, if we come back, which I think we will, I have to make that very clear, there will be definitely that is something we would like to do. 
But we don't yet have planted or we don't yet have a place for it. 
In the monastery itself, we have to see if there is the space to do that in the monastery itself. 
What we are aiming at is that there will be time for where all monastics or all the people in the monastery are on retreat. 
We do have that like right now in England, we have a three-month winter retreat, which is happening every year. 
So this is something what we also aim to establish. 
And what happens in England is we have a group of supporters who comes for whether the whole three months or just for one month of it. 
And they do support us in that time with cooking for us, doing things that really need to be done. 
And everything else is postponed until the end of the winter retreat. 
And so what we do, the monastics, we are on retreat, but we also practice together with the lay people who are there to support us. 
So in that sense, I think that definitely will come. 
This is something we want to continue because it's very supportive also for the monastics to have a longer period of time in the year where we can really focus on the practice. 
But that is future music. 
One of our sisters, Archon Sundra, is getting a retreat in May. 
Where is that? In Santa Rosa. 
There are flyers of that line at the table there. 
It will be a ten-day retreat, but not just for women. 
No, not just for women. 
I'm always interested in the contrast between practicing as a layperson and practicing as a monastic. 
And I don't know enough of your stories to know whether or not you just jumped into the monastic pool, or did you practice first as a layperson and then go to it? Do you have any reflections on the differences in that? I have started with practice in Thailand, and I've practiced there as a layperson for a few years, living in my own house, but also living in a monastery there. 
So I haven't been practicing for a very long time as a laywoman, because for me, very quickly, I was there in the sedan. 
But I think basically it's the same, because it's about attachment and letting go of attachment, and it's about being with your feelings and just hanging in there. 
But I think for me it was very clear that living in a community where everybody is having the same intention is just easier to just stay focused and have the perseverance you need sometimes in order to cope with certain strong feelings which are coming up without distracting yourself, or distracting yourself maybe a bit less, let's say. 
And because we are living in a situation where there are many avenues of distractions that are just not open to us any longer, not because we think those things are per se unskillful, but it's just a decision in order to minimize the opportunity to turn away from what's happening. 
And so it very much depends on your own living situation, I would think, and on your own strength of mind and your own determination. 
For me personally, it was very quick that I came to the decision that I would need the support of a group of people who are doing the same thing. 
And I can see that many people who come to stay in a monastery in Amarwati, for example in England, who come to stay with us for a certain time, that they are very quickly picking up on the space in the monastery is a much clearer mirror than when you are involved in your own family life where you have a lot of stress and emotionally very strong bonds maybe to your children and to your husband or girlfriend or whatever. 
And so many responsibilities and the pace of life being so fast nowadays. 
And also all the barrage of sense impact coming from all the advertisement, when you go for shopping, when you, it's just like overwhelming. 
And in the monastery is a certain, there's a certain protection there. 
And I find that very helpful. 
So if I wouldn't find it a good thing, I wouldn't do it anyway. 
So I think, you know, if one does it, because you can do anything in your life, the most so-called wholesome thing, if you do it with the wrong intention, if you do it because you want to escape from life, then number one, it doesn't work. 
And number two, you won't stay for long in the monastery, because the monastery is not a place to escape to, because you're just getting in touch with everything on a much more raw level. 
So it's not about that you necessarily have more pleasant feelings, but you have more clarity. 
So, yeah. 
I think that misses answering your question. 
So it's no escape. 
So the ones who want to come to a den because they have enough of samsara, it's a very good idea, but don't think that if you come in through the gates, that you suddenly lift it into heaven in a way. 
And so there are turns that are quite blissful, but I think we do experience that wherever we are. 
It's not all suffering. 
There is also happiness and joy, and also in monastic life. 
Even so, you might think, well, how can there be? But it is, I do really sure. 
And I really detail what Achan Santoshita just said. 
I feel it is helpful, but it's not in any way an escape. 
So, yeah. 
I think I'm not quite sure it is now quarter to 11. 
I wonder, should we stop here? Or are there more really pressing questions that we should consider? I think it looks like we stop here. 
It was very, very lovely meeting you all. 
And maybe there's some time later on to have a bit more personal conversations, as that would be lovely.
