 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Welcome to the meditation time together. Good morning everyone and welcome to our meditation time together. I'd like to offer you a little exercise today. It's not meant to have you be busy but actually help you become quieter and attentive, tranquil and alert. As you know, a big part of mindfulness practice is being mindful of the present moment. The question is, how long is the present moment? I'd like to propose that independent of any logic that you might use or other things, that the present moment certainly can be seen as in an instant. It could also be seen as some little span of time, maybe a second. There's a sense of, as we are present, mindful of now, of this moment, there is a sense of some continuity of the moment, some fullness of the moment, some span of the moment. It's not exact, it's not in different contexts, that span might be different. But it's partly the length of span of it is related to the knowing that is aware that this is the present moment. That it's kind of like the timeless moment that's there for a little while as we're here, as we're present but the mind wanders off. Or maybe it doesn't feel like a timeless moment but it feels like it's a, as we say, what's happening now? And there's a little kind of pause or little opening, little amount of time to take in now. And so the question is, how long is your present moment? How long is the now for you? And it'll come and go, it'll be there for a few, as long as it is, and something will happen and you reset it, you find it again, and you find it again. And there might be even a sense that you're in a river of time and that you're kind of somehow maybe kind of, I don't know, you're in the current of it for a while and in an eddy or in a current of it for a while then maybe you've gotten stuck on a branch sticking out from the shore of the river and then you're back in the current. But the current, how long is that current of the present moment for you? And if you're interested in this exercise, maybe you can try to do it in such a way that the mind becomes quieter, stiller, tranquil and alert. Maybe because the mind that's tranquil and alert, that's not trying to think about this, is the one that reveals the richest feeling, the richest sense of this moment now. So to take a alert posture and gently close your eyes and to take a few long, slow, deep breaths relaxing as you exhale, maybe extending the exhale a bit to allow for a deeper relaxation and letting your breathing return to normal and then see if for a few moments you can give yourself over to relax further, maybe each time you exhale, relaxing the muscles of the face, those muscles can fall away from the skull, maybe held in place by the skin, no work on your part to keep your face together. Softening around the eyes, the forehead and relaxing the shoulders, maybe relaxing down the arm and into the hands, and those are shoulders to relax further. Softening in the belly, deep relaxation, the belly, the torso. To relax the body is to begin to abide peacefully here and now. Breathing in and exhaling, relaxing the thinking mind, letting the thinking mind become quieter, maybe thinking is slower, maybe thinking has pauses between the sentences or images. Breathing in and out. And then to center yourself in the body breathing. Noticing where on your body is it easiest to experience the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out. Or where in the body is it most pleasant to feel the body's experience of breathing. And if you're aware of breathing in the present moment, how long is that present moment? How long are you in the knowing of the present moment? Is it brief touching in? Is it somehow extended through time, through a timeless time? And how long is the present moment if you're relaxed at ease with it, a leisurely present moment being with your breathing? Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. To be mindful, aware, attuned to this present moment. Is an attunement to the present moment that's independent of past and future. Independent of time just now. Paradoxically for the duration that your mind can rest in this moment. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. And within this present moment, for however long it extends for you personally, there is change. The breathing, the body experience of breathing changes. Like a current in a river, always in the present. Or like standing on a bridge over a river and looking down in the timeless present. The current keeps flowing. Relaxing into the present moment is to relax into the current of change. Perhaps experience these most easily. In the changing sensations of breathing through the inhale and the exhale. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Relaxing and settling into this present moment. Maybe near this after sitting for these minutes. Maybe there's a better sense of an extended present moment. Maybe not something we search for, but something within which we rest, trust, the gentle current flow river of the present moment. Wherever long it lasts. And as the sense of the present, present time. Becomes more extended and relaxed and open. We have the greater capacity to know, to sense, to feel others. And our connection to others, our response. And may our ability to be present for others, be present for ourselves, in an open extended way, no hurry. May it be a time for respect and care and a deeper attentiveness to the full humanity of all of us. May this deeper connection be the wellspring of our care for the world. A care which is simultaneously caring for what's best in ourselves. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may our attention, ability to pay attention, support us in making this a better world. Thank you. Thank you.
