 I didn't prepare a talk today because at the end of the talk last Monday I thought that maybe it was a wise thing was to have some follow-up discussion about what happened last Monday, the talk. And in case some of you were kind of left wondering or perplexed, some of you weren't there, weren't here last Monday. So I'd like to kind of tell you a little bit. We had a guest teacher, it's a Malaysian woman who was ordained, is ordained in the Burmese Buddhist tradition and she's been a nun for many years and deeply practiced. She practiced for many years in Malaysia, she practiced many years in Burma. And Burma is one of the countries, one of the preeminent meditation countries of the world, certainly in the Buddhist world. There's this very, very powerful tradition of meditation practice there. And many lineages, many different schools of meditation, many different types of ways of doing even vipassana practice. But it's very popular there. And when I was in Burma myself, I was in one monastery, the monastery I was in, sometime in the springtime when there was kind of spring break. And during that week, there were 5,000 people meditating in the monastery where I was at. Can you imagine 5,000 people meditating? And there were all these kids who came there because it was their vacation. And they came to meditate, to study, and they had a whole program for kids and it was quite kind of adorable. The kids would get ordained when they were there. And they would all be standing in long, long lines with shaved heads, the smallest to be in the front, and then they'd kind of just progressively higher and taller and taller. And one of the things that was very touching about this, seeing the children there, was they're ordained as novices, not as full monks or nuns. But anybody who's ordained in Buddhism is given a higher status than a layperson. They're considered more respect worthy than a layperson, more or less. And so what it meant was that their parents would always sit below them. They would sit in a chair, up in a platform, and their parents would be down on the floor because the parents weren't ordained. And the parents would do these bows to their kids. They'd get down full bows to the floor, a head to the floor, bound to their kids. And I was really moved by this. And I didn't have these kids getting this experience for a week of being so deeply honored and respected that something in them was so worthy of that. And then at the end of the week, they went back to the regular way things were. Things were completely upside and turned around. And Burmese family culture is very patriarchal and very hierarchical. What the parent and the father says, you do. So it's quite a contrast with these kids. And anyway, so this is the whole point being that, so in Burma, they had this very strong tradition of meditation. A lot of people go on meditate and it's very popular and many different schools of meditation. And people go spend years and years doing intensive meditation, exploring the mind, developing the mind, exploring all the different realms of consciousness and mental states that can come with the mind. For a mind that's well practiced, the mind is very malleable and can be developed and shaped in amazing ways. It's astounding what the mind can do. So this woman who came last week, Sister Susila, is deeply practiced in one particular tradition where she's practiced long enough. She's now a teacher in that tradition. It's not a tradition that I've practiced in, even though she practiced for a while in the monastery with the same teacher I had, she left there to go and practice this other teacher, Paok, I think it was her teacher's name. And one of the reasons she left the teacher I studied with was she did two and a half years of intensive vipassana practice under Upandita. And after two and a half years, which means day and night, two and a half years, all day meditating pretty much. And after two and a half years, she was exhausted of that. And rather than, what she decided she needed was she needed some really deep rest. So she didn't go sign up for Club Med or watch television or something, but rather she went to find a teacher who taught concentration meditation. And concentration meditation, when you can really do it well, is very restful for the mind. It's said it's much more restful than vipassana. Vipassana has a little bit more active quality to it. And if you want to really get really deeply rest of the mind, you need to do concentration practice. And sometimes the two practices are taught together so that a person who's doing vipassana practice intensively, if they need to kind of bring some balance and some more rest or relaxation into the mind, will switch over for a while and do samatha or concentration practice. So she was exhausted. She went and found herself as a samatha teacher, concentration teacher. And it turned out that he taught teachers a very elaborate form of meditation, many, many stages and many different kinds of meditation practices. And I've now heard from two of his students about what they do. And it's about the most elaborate Buddhist meditation training that I've heard of in Theravadin world. And so she kind of laid out some of it for us. And I was sitting over there listening. And I thought I saw many perplexed looks in the room. But I don't know if that was the case. You'll see if you have a few minutes when I ask you your comments or questions. So for the sake of people who weren't here, so she says in that practice, which since it's a concentration practice, they start then with a concentration object. And often the first one that people are given is pay attention to the tip of the nostrils, which is quite a classic meditation practice in Buddhism. And it's a place where people specifically develop concentration. And you keep your attention right there. And you might pay attention to the sensations of the air going in and out through the nostrils or changing temperature, the cool going in, the warm going out, or the vibration, the tingling of the nose hairs. Or sometimes you feel sensations on the tip of your, the top kind of tip of your lip here, on top of your lip. And she was quite a really lovely woman, Cecilia. I thought she was really adorable, beautiful woman. Those of you who saw her last week, her presence and who she was, and she would be talking about her doing this breath meditation with the nostrils and she'd kind of put her, her hair looks very cute, I thought. And then she said, you cultivate attention there, but you're not paying attention to the sensation. And then she said, a little bit of a hard time explaining this, but you're paying attention to the idea of the breath at the nostrils, the concept of it. And she couldn't quite explain how you do that, but you used to do it. And this is a very important part of the particular kind of concentration practice. You're concentrating on a concept, not on anything real. Because a concept can be fixed, whereas anything real is always changing. So you have this concept you fix yourself on, and that concept of the breath turns itself into what's called, sometimes in English, counter image. You know, like if you look at a bright light and you turn your eyes away, you still see the bright light there in your retina. I think that's called, is that called counter image? Maybe we can call it that. And anyway, this counter image is called nimitta in Pali or nimit in Thai. And so you cultivate this kind of light, white light, this sort of spot. And at first you have it right here where you're concentrating on. I think it's a function of concentration. It doesn't really, it's not really there, but the mind kind of produces it there. It's kind of like a concept. And that white light gets very, very strong. And then when it gets very strong and very stable, then the person is able to take that little bright white little pearl of light and do things with it. They can expand it and contract it and move it back and forth. And she said you can move it 10 miles away and then move it back. But you don't want to play with it too much. She said you keep it right there. And then you sink the mind into it. So the mind is completely absorbed into that white light. And it doesn't lose consciousness exactly, but it's so absorbed it's no longer present. That's not right to say either. It's like if you're reading a really good book, you're absorbed in your book, you don't hear what's going on around you. So you really absorb that and you kind of don't even know that you're absorbed, you're so absorbed in this white light. When you come out of that absorption, then you can review what happened. And she said you have this mirror, this mirror appears on your heart. And in the mirror you see the shape, there's the same shape as this concept of the breath of the nostrils. And you see that same shape in the mirror of your heart, then you can reflect on what happened during that absorption state. And once you've done mastered that, then you do the four element meditation. The four elements are earth, fire, water, and air. And you find these elements in terms of the sensations in your body. And you're doing this meditation of the elements until your whole body becomes this image of, she said, like a solid ice block. So a crystalline, like a white light or light, a clear white block. And then you look for the space inside the block. And you kind of put yourself in the space to shatter that ice box. So it shatters into a billion particles, smaller than atoms. So once you've been able to do that, then you do 32 parts of the body meditation. And you kind of systematically go through these 32 classic parts of the body that we have in Buddhism. And you meditate on it until you have a clear image, again, a kind of concept, an image of that body part. Like you really see the kidney or whatever. And once you can really do it for yourself, then you do it for other people. You look at other people, look at Frank, look at his kidney. And then you get really good at that. And it's kind of seeing into their body and seeing your body parts. And whether this is really a concept in your mind you're making or you're really seeing into someone, you know, she seems to imply that you're really seeing into someone because you can diagnose. Someone's really good to diagnose people's illnesses because you can see your kidney or whatever. And then you switch to meditations then when you get one. And then you do skeleton meditation. And you do the same thing to see your skeleton very vividly, like X-ray. And I didn't do that as a practice, but it happened a couple of times when I was in Asia where I was sitting meditating and suddenly things just, it was like a shift. And suddenly I had this feeling that there was eyes behind me and I was looking into my skeleton. I could see it as vividly as I was really seeing it. It was really remarkable, 3D. I couldn't believe it, you know. But it didn't last so long. But it cultivated this as a meditation practice. And once you've done that, and you do that for other people too, you look into them and you see the skeleton. And then you do what's called the casino meditation. And there's 10 of them where you look into the back of someone's skull because you can do the skeleton meditation. You see the whites of their skull. And then you let the skull drop away and you're just left with the white. And then you take that white, it's kind of like a white disc, what's left, because there's a skull back here. And then you let that white expand in all 10 directions to kind of cover everything. And you do the same thing with other parts, like the blood. You see red everywhere. And all this requires a tremendously concentrated mind. And it's all a form of concentration practice. Ultimately, it's in the service of switching at some point to doing Vipassana practice. And she didn't really talk about that too much, as I remember. The switch was what that was like. But the point is that at some point, what you're using, that's tremendous concentration you've built up. The real mind is really stable, really penetrating power of the mind. Then to switch over to Vipassana to see the nature of how things actually are. You no longer see an image or a concept, but you see actually how things actually are. Then someone asked in here about various questions about, is this real? What's this about? And someone asked questions like, have you done this? Is it all done? And someone asked the question, is this something like, who can do this kind of stuff? And she said that, or someone said, can someone do it in lay life? Wasn't that a question someone asked? And she said, oh, if they have paramees, which is translated into English as perfections, paramees are these inner qualities that are developed. But paramees are usually understood to have been developed in a performer lifetime. And she said, mostly she thinks that people who meditate now have probably meditated in a past lifetime. And if you have really good paramees from a past life, like you've really done a lot of meditation in past life, then you can do this really easily. But if you haven't, then it's kind of hard. Then what you're doing in this lifetime is getting the paramees for the next life. Is that characterize what you talked about? Well, those of you who are here, and more or less well enough. And I was quite inspired by her, by her presence. And so definitely, obviously that she was someone who was deeply practiced, and very refined character personality, and seemed to have a lot of equanimity. People asked her, I thought, kind of tough questions. She seemed very open and receptive to all the questions, and not defensive at all, and stayed balanced, and very open hearted. It was beautiful to see her. So, I just wanted to give you a chance to ask you any questions about all that. I don't know what I can do about it, but I can't answer for her, but I can, you know. Please. Well, I was supposed to buy a number of things that were surprising to me, but one thing that stuck out was, for saying that when you focus on these 35 or 39 or 32 price super body, that you feel sort of revulsion. That's at least what I thought I had. Oh yeah, that's the word she used. And that the same thing happens when you look at someone else. You feel revulsion. And that this is sort of a delivery, the one thing that can delivery from lust. Exactly, yeah. I thought this was, well this surprised me a lot, because she sounded a lot, and we all should have talked about like, you know, aversion. And it was hard for me to, I saw that. Great, great. It was quite beautiful. She was talking about the repulsive qualities of the body, but she was so happy. She didn't seem like someone who was dour, or morbid, or filled with aversion. It's a classic meditation in early Buddhism to practice meditation. The words translated usually into English is repulsiveness of the body. And the word literally means the unbeautiful, not beautiful, asoba. And it's usually done as an antidote, as she said, for lust. And lust for people who want to become free, and the mind that's not fixated or obsessing by anything, lust can be a little bit of a speed bump. In that process. So sometimes people want to get a little help, rather than kind of, you know, waiting it out. And so, you know, so sometimes the repulsive aspects of the body, or the unbeautiful aspects of the body are meditated upon. And then, I like to describe this as those parts of the body. So we can hear in America, we want to celebrate the body. It's all beautiful, and all nice, and all wonderful. That's okay. It is wonderful. But as those parts of the body, your parts, or someone else's, your friend's parts, which you would rather not have on your pillow when you went to lay down to go to sleep at night. And whatever feeling you have that arises in you, when you see that fluid or that thing, you know, on your pillow, maybe that's what's being talked about. And it's not necessarily revulsion. No, no, no, revulsion is not meant to be aversion. But it's more like, you know, you don't want to touch that. Though, my understanding of all this has changed a little teeny bit, because I was surprised that when my son was 2 or something like that, and he gets sick, you know, he sometimes gets throw up, and he's lying there in bed, and he's getting sick. And before he could do anything, you know, he was probably throwing up. And so it didn't seem like anything else to do, but we didn't have a bucket or anything to catch it. So it seemed like nothing else to do. I put up my hand and catch it in my hand. And I was really surprised that it wasn't revolting. It was my own son, you know, it was only my own of you. I might feel a little bit different. But somehow it just was not my son. And so maybe it wouldn't be for you if I really was connected to you, any one of you really well, and caretaking you, and it just wouldn't be a very different feeling. That's a long answer. So it's there in the tradition to be used as you'd like. Connected to that is another practice that's somewhat connected to that in the same category, kind of, is meditation on a corpse. And this is meant literally. You go find a corpse, and you sit with it, and meditate on it, and study it, and it's not fairly common in Southeast Asia for monks, I just know monks, maybe nuns too, would go to the morgue or to the forensic labs or something, and just sit there with the body and study it, hang out with it, and watch the autopsy and whatever, and really kind of contemplate it. Or once, a few years ago, I sent a monk in Thailand a present, and he sent a very nice letter back, very warm, wonderful, nice, warm thank you back, and just lovely letter. But inside the letter was this very graphic photograph of a decaying corpse. This was his, you know, in kind, right? And I thought of it here. I thought it would actually be quite nice. When I was a college student, a freshman, I think, I took an art class, a drawing class, and our drawing teacher took us one week for two sessions to the autopsy, whatever, department or something, at the university, and they kind of wheeled out this guy, and he was dead, and they were going to draw the corpse. And the teacher said that the students drawing, after they did that in the semester, the students' drawings were always a lot stronger. He thought it had a really beneficial effect on their drawings, and spent some time on a corpse. And most of us, you know, if we do spend time with a corpse, it is someone we love and care about a lot, and so it's a very different thing than seeing someone maybe we don't know. And it's not meant to be a morbid meditation in Buddhism, but it's supposed to be something that can, again, help cultivate a sense of priorities and value and appreciation of life and strength in meditation practice. And I've thought sometimes of doing the same thing for people in our group who are interested, is to try to organize, you know, a few hours at Stanford Medical Hospital to try to seek permission to come in and autopsy and whatever it's seeing. I did that at UC Davis when I was a student there. So, I don't know, that was a long answer. Is that enough? Yes? Could you say more about the creation of the concept of breath from the sensations of the dead zenotus? I don't know if I can say that much about it, but as that mind gets, seemingly as the mind gets fixated or concentrating, if it is a sensation a person is focusing on, because a nimitta can also develop out of a sensation, as you're staying with a particular sensation, that somehow the way you experience that is no longer in the realm of more of a concept interpretation of what it is, rather than what it is actually for itself. Now, this is what the mind normally does anyway. Normally, it kind of often, usually, experiences our reality through the filter of a concept. And so, even when we think we're experiencing something directly, we are kind of experiencing it directly, but it's through the filter of an idea we have of what it is. One of the clearest places to see that is with physical pain, meditation. And you can see how much you're seeing it through an idea, and you can cut through that idea and see it for what it actually is. But you're not trying to see through the concept when you do this concentration practice. You're just kind of getting more and more focused on it. And as you get more and more concentrated, the one point of fixation then, at some point, takes that concept, in a sense, as the focused focal point. And for some people, it's a white light, in a nostril or something. It can also be a sensation in the body, like a feeling of delight and joy in the body, sensations of joy. And it can be really there, but the concentration is not... It's basing the concentration on that sensation initially, but then, at some point, it switches over, and primarily what you're doing is focusing on the idea you have of what it is. The idea is still connected to a feeling. It feels like a feeling. But then, because it's a concept, it's very malleable what you can do with it. You can take sort of moving that concept around, expanding it, moving around the body, around the room, and do all these things with it, because the concepts are malleable. She spoke also about a detour of just relaxation versus concentration. And recall a detail, actually discriminating between them, that they were as a result of concentrating on the breath there. It should be just simply under a drowsy, relaxed state versus a concentrated relaxed state. Oh yeah, definitely. There's lots of... There's various kinds of states where the mind gets dull or cloudy or falls into blackroids that can come and the mind is quite concentrated. And sometimes they're taken as being some kind of very important meditation experience, but really what the mind has just become spacey, for example. And there's one that she described, it was called the Bhavanga state. And she called it as the Continuum Consciousness. In later Buddhism after the Buddha, they developed this concept called the Bhavanga Consciousness, which is that baseline consciousness that is constant in a sense, that everything else is experienced, rising and passing on top of. Or it's like maybe it's like a... I'm not very good at explaining all this, but it may be like if you have strings on a guitar, and you have the base strings, which are kind of the bottom, the base. And if you vibrate those, then the higher ones will vibrate also. But if you take away, sometimes the higher note strings may be completely still, nothing's happening with them. And then the attention all falls down to this kind of vibrating base consciousness, the Bhavanga. And that's what survives or continues over lifetimes, is the Bhavanga. In Bhavanga, there's no value, apparently, in falling into the Bhavanga. But sometimes a meditator will just... consciousness seems to... Most forms of consciousness, the higher strings in the guitar, fall away. And the meditator kind of just falls into this baseline consciousness. There's kind of a blacking out, almost, that happens there. I think that's what she was referring to. How are we doing? Is this interesting enough? Or is it... Some of you might be the first time you've come here. What's this? I thought that she said, pay attention to the breath, we are feeling it, because at one point she said that, if you can't feel it, do the counting. Could you say that? Yes, it seemed like it was only after you start seeing the nimitta that you go away from the sensation. Maybe so, yeah. She started talking a little bit about, don't feel it as the elements, which elements means fire, cold, or tingling. So what does it mean to feel it then? And she said, well, it's a concept. And then she said, I can't really describe it, because it's not a feeling. So I was kind of confused when she was talking about this myself. I must say, every time I come across the idea of past lives, I have a hard time how to hold this, because I've got a physics upbringing, I guess, what's your bother? And I have a hard time taking that literally, so I'm trying to sort of hold it in some kind of a poetic... So that's it. So it's a difficulty for me every time the concept of past lives comes up, because there's this little hurdle in my mind of what to do with that. Is it future lives easier? It's just biology, you know, it's rising and pressing away. So Dan said that it's hard for him to understand or kind of deal with the concept of rebirth when it arises. And he has a physics background, so things are just kind of follow the laws of nature in a very matter-of-fact way. And somebody of consciousness continuing beyond his life doesn't seem to compute. And now Sister Sussila is steeped in, probably culturally, in Asian Buddhist worldview, where the idea of rebirth is not only kind of inseparable often, but is considered indispensable. And I think one of the fundamental goals of her Buddhist practice, the whole reason why you want to practice, is so you can put an end to the cycles of rebirth. You don't want to come back, you know, 30 billion more times as a teenager. I think done it once was enough. And so the idea is exhausting. And so there's a very strong motivation to practice is not to come back in the same way, to find liberation. And then they kind of make the point that this is not annihilation. Buddhists don't want to posit that when you die, as an enlightened person, that things just annihilate it. You just, you know, that's it. They say that's kind of a nihilism. But they also want to say you don't continue. You don't get reborn. And they don't want to say what happens. What happens to the consciousness of an enlightened person when the enlightened person dies cannot be talked about. So it's kind of like, you know, it sounds like a cop-out. But, you know, who are what? They couldn't agree. They couldn't agree. But anyway, this is a very important part of traditional Buddhism, this idea of rebirth. And there are a lot of Westerners who are quite comfortable with the teachings of rebirth. It makes a lot of sense for them, or just even some Westerners who actually feel like they've had past life experiences or whatever. And there's a lot of Westerners for whom this is a really foreign concept and just there's no way they're going to get their mind around it. There was a beautiful debate, beautiful. There was a debate some years ago between Stephen Batchelor and Robert Thurman. Robert Thurman was a Tibetan monk for a while. And I guess Stephen Batchelor was too. But they had come from very different points of view. And Stephen Batchelor has no interest really in rebirth and doesn't really feel like it's an important part of Buddhist practice. And Robert Thurman considers, he felt that you don't have Buddhism without belief in rebirth. So there's this big debate between these two very, you know, thoughtful teachers. My particular position, for what it's worth, is that Buddhist practice is not dependent on believing in rebirth. That all the motivation you need to practice can come from other sources besides wanting to end rebirth. However, practically, I think that more people are going to find tremendous motivation to practice when they have this idea that's trying to get off the wheel of rebirth. It's very, very motivating for those people to have that kind of belief. And they're really going to follow through in the practice much further than, you know, they're the ones who are going to be often becoming monastics. They're the ones who are going to go off and spend endless, you know, lots of years and years practicing intensely. They're the ones who are going to focus on the practice in a different way, maybe than if you don't have that kind of central organizing focus for your life. I was taught a retreat many years ago, 10 years ago or so, in Canada. And there was a, most of the people there were Canadians of kind of European descent. But there was one Canadian who was of Indian descent, East India. And she came to me in an interview and said, she'd been listening to the people asking questions in the hall, meditation hall, after the talk and stuff. And she said, what's going on here? What's going on here? Why are they so interested in their mothers and, you know, in their relationship to, you know, I mean, this practice is all about getting off the wheel of rebirth. What does that have to do with resolving your issues around your mother? She was perplexed. And because her focus was very different. And, you know, I couldn't say much. I just, you know, I just bowed to her. And I didn't bow to me. And I know literally, but in my head I just bowed to her. And with tremendous respect for the worldview, which that's the world that she has, which is the worldview which Buddhism was born into, and the way that carried Buddhism for many years. So for those, so people in the West, some people have a hard time with the idea of rebirth. Some people have an easy time with rebirth. Among the people who have an easy time with rebirth, there are those who think it's really believe it. And some people very easily don't believe it. They have an easy time with rebirth because they don't believe it. Just not a problem. There's a whole range. And that's one of the things that many Westerners have had to deal with when their teachers come who make this a central thing, an important thing, and how to come to terms with this. Yeah. It sounds to me like the people who believe in rebirth are clinging very strongly to this as a motivating force in their whole lives. Everything is just a form of clinging, isn't it? Doesn't it seem that way to you? It could be. I suppose it could seem that way. Though I think that if you have a, you know, if you have a thorn in the soles of your feet, big nail in the stones of your feet, probably relatively expeditiously you try to be motivated to pull it out. And it doesn't have to be clinging, just like, you know, that's what you do when you have a thorn in your nail and your foot. You pull it out. You don't wait. Well, you don't say, well, wait a minute. You know, I think I have better things to do. You know, I cook dinner for my family. And by the way, you know, there's a wonderful television program on. I think I'll watch it first. I'll get to it eventually. You kind of get to it right away. And so same thing with rebirth. If you think that, you know, there's endless lifetimes of further suffering going to happen, and you're aware that you've done that for endless times in the past, then you'd rather expeditiously kind of get on with it, rather than say, well, you know, I'll get around to doing this Buddhist practice in a few more lifetimes. You know, this lifetime, you know, I'll just kind of try to get merit. You know, I'll just do good things and feed the monastics and try to kind of get a lot of good merits. I get reborn better. But if you really feel like it counts and you can really do it, then you really get down to business. You could say this about a lot of things. Sure. You know, like lust, for instance. Or get down to business. You know, just say that you're not clinging to it. It's just something you have to deal with. I mean, it seems like playing with words. Maybe, maybe. But I think that it can be both ways. I think there can be a lot of clinging involved with that kind of idea, a lot of clinging, a lot of aversion. But it doesn't have to be. And so it just, you know, a person's really motivated to do this expeditiously, get on with it. And it doesn't have to be out of clinging. It doesn't have to be, in other words. But, you know, if that's your worldview and, you know, if that's what you think the world is, it's, you know, it's not questionable. That's the way it is. It just is that way. So it's not a question of believing it or not. It's just, that's the way it is, right? I mean, there's a lot of things, you know, that way. You know, democracy. Just the way it is. So, remember, I took a class many years ago from a professor named David Kalapahana, Sri Lankan professor of Buddhism. Great philosopher, written many, many books. Very like books on Buddhism, Buddhist philosophy. And very critical of much of Theravada Buddhism that he came out of. And so I asked him one day, you know, I think, well, this guy's not going to be leaving to rebirth. And I asked him, do you believe in rebirth? Oh, yeah. It's obvious. So it's a curious thing, you know. So what we know. Please. Does Buddhism offer any explanation for why? If there are past laws, why we have no consciousness in one way or another? Does Buddhism offer an explanation here? You know, I've never heard of one. There probably might be somewhere, some. And I can imagine it's because we're so wrapped up in this life that our consciousness doesn't have any ability to kind of, you know, pay attention to what's else. It's said that occasionally there are people who do remember spontaneously. And I was very moved. It was happening in the middle of a three-month retreat, a time when I was very open to be moved. But Steve Smith, who's a bipassana teacher, put on a tape of this young boy who, when he was about four years old or something, started spontaneously chanting, Pali chants, long chants. And people didn't think he had any chance to learn them anywhere, though maybe it was like Mozart, you know, who kind of could just listen to something and pick it up the first time. But the thing was, they took this young boy to scholars of Pali. He wrote chanting in Pali, which is ancient Buddhist language. And they concluded he was chanting in the dialect, or the way of speaking, from 1500 years ago. In particular, error on Buddhism. No one spoke that. So even if he had picked it up from someone, you know, by memorizing it, some monk chanting down the street in the local temple, he wouldn't have had that enunciation that he had. So the idea was he was remembering. He was, you know, he was a Pali monk, 1500 years ago, he was remembering, you know, those chants. And so it came back spontaneously to him. And so they played this tape of him chanting, I think, some suta. And it was very moving to hear this, how to make of it. I don't know what to make of it. And then there are practices you can do that can help you recall past lives. I think sosa sila kind of made some reference to that. There's certain concentration practices that can help you remember backwards. So if you get really constant, one of the purposes of getting really concentrated in Buddhism, to enter into some of these absorptions, is then you can train your mind to remember past lives. Is this real? Is there real memories or the mind just, you know, there's been a lot of people who remember that there'd been Claire Patra. So, you know, you wonder after a while, you know, how many, how many Napoleon's can there be a bit, you know, so is it real or is it is it mind, mind is very amazingly creative, powerful creative force. So is it just the creative ability of the mind to kind of construct something? How do we decide? Steve, you were going to say something on this topic. That's one of the reasons why people don't remember past lives. Some people can't even remember two minutes. So last one, there's nine o'clock and sum up. I wanted to ask about it seemed like she was describing the Jhanas a little quite differently than I heard her read in other places. I wonder if you could speak to that. So these absorptions called Jhanas, there are different kind of states that quantum quantum states, you've got a quantum shifts of consciousness from one state to another that happen in these absorption states. And there's eight of these states and the classic way of defining the states is by factors which are present or absent in those states. And there's usually four or five factors which are present at the first absorption. And then as you go into more and more refined absorptions, some of these drop away. And so you define it by the presence or absence of these factors. However, you could also describe it by the subjective feeling that you are experienced, you have independent of the factors being present or absence. And what happens is different lineages, different teachers who teach concentration practice have different states or different experiences, subjective experiences they define as this is what the absorption is. And it seems to be a range. And for some people, there can be some reflection going on, you can be in an absorption in one of these states. And you can be a little bit reflective of what's going on. You can even think a little bit, a teeny bit reflective, you know, you recognize what's going on. And for other teachers, this is absurd that you could have any kind of reflection. You're so absorbed in there that there's no thinking at all. There's no self reflection at all. You don't have reflection until after you leave this state. So if you line up like half a dozen different teachers who teach concentration practice, you find a spectrum from kind of what seems like a weaker state to something that's very, very powerful. And they all say, I teach the true absorption. So who's to decide? And they say, they all say, well, you should go back and read the texts with the Buddhists. They all say the same thing, go read the suttas. But they all say that. So they all have a way of reading it that supports what they do. So I'm not qualified to judge because I haven't gone through study with all these different teachers to know what their particular take is. But that's been my take, is that there's a quantum shift into different states. And within a particular state, the state is experienced differently depending how powerful your concentration is. So if you have a relatively weak concentration in the state, then it's a relatively weak experience in the state. Maybe there's more self reflection. If there's a very powerful concentration in that state, then there's no self reflection possible at all. But they all qualify as the particular state. There's a range of how that state's experienced. So I like that interpretation because that's very inclusive and friendly. So I hope this was useful as a follow up. And I probably, there's a stimulate, stimulate a lot more questions because this is a, you know, opens the door to many, many issues in Buddhism. And my primary interest is here is to find ways of supporting each of you in your own practice. And the context and the worldview that you hold your practice in can be quite variable. Different people have different worldviews and contexts. I think what we all have in common is the mindfulness practice, the meditation practice. And it's very, very powerful. And what you can do with the mind, train it in healthy ways. The capacity of the mind is really phenomenal. And the capacity of the mind for peace, the capacity for the mind for concentration, the capacity of the mind for love and compassion, it's just awesome. And most people, you know, just barely touch the surface of, you know, the full capacity that they have. And to use the meditation practice as a vehicle to certainly cultivate the mind, but more importantly to follow through with what you feel is your life's deepest intention. That whatever you feel is your life's deepest intention, what you want your life to be about in the deepest, deepest way. When you get to your death bed and you look back over your life and how would you like to look back at your life? What have you done? How have you lived? What have you accomplished? And what's most important for you? And how is it that mindfulness meditation, meditation practice can most help you in that process? How is it that the process of letting go of clinging, of hate, of fear and finding a mind that's not clouded by delusion, how is it that serves you in the deepest intention you have? And if that intention is to step off the cycles of rebirth or just fully be present in this life as it is here in a free way, that's fine. Whatever is fine. The wonderful thing is that two people might practice in the same intensity of practice and attain the same degree of full freedom. And one of them believes in rebirth and one doesn't. And they both are free from rebirth. They become fully free. It's kind of like Niels Bohr who said, he had his horse shoe over his office and he said, I don't believe in that stuff but I've heard that it helps anyway. It works anyway. Even if you don't believe in it. So thank you all very much.
