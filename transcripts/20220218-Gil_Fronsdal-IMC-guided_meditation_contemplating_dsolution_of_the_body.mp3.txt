 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Good morning, everyone. Good day. And a little introduction to, further introduction to this idea of contemplation of a corpse. So we know that one of the core practices of TheravƒÅda Buddhism, of macha Buddhism, is the four foundations of mindfulness. And within that, those teachings, is this teaching on the corpse, contemplating of a corpse. But I think of it as part of a triad of meditations, the one on the parts of the body, the ones on the four elements or properties, and it's not this one, the corpse. And they come together because they all involve using something like the imagination. And some kind of words, a word that's used, especially the first two, for the verb, the action is imagine or visualize something. And here also, we're not going to see a corpse literally, but as if we're seeing one. So using the imagination. And some people would protest that mindfulness practice is not about using the imagination, it's the opposite. It's about seeing directly what's here. And that's true. But we live in imagination quite a bit without realizing it. Sometimes we think that we're in touch with reality, but it's really through the filter of how we interpret, how we imagine things to be, how we construct things to be. And so here we're using imagination to overcome imagination, using imagination to somehow pop the bubble of the previous imaginations so that we can do this deep work of seeing things as they are. And so in some sense, this corpse meditation is kind of preliminary, it's supposed to help us be able to go into the next three foundations and really see much more deeply. And with the parts of the body and the four elements, we're beginning to take apart what we take as a whole. And with a whole, we tend to then project on all these ideas of what the whole is. And we're starting to see the parts. You kind of drop the image of the whole, the idea of the whole, and see the parts of who we are. And this ability to look at the parts then, we use in the corpse meditation, the classic reason for doing it, is to overcome identification with this body. Taking this body as this is who I am, or this is mine in some way. And we know that people are very body conscious in the sense that they very much identify with their body and their physical body and how it appears to other people. This body we have is all made from borrowed material. In a sense, it's given to us for the duration of our life, or not even that, because there's so much recycling going on even while we're alive. But all the material parts of this body are here temporarily. And they're here, they've been recycled many times before. And after these elements in our body, our body is finished with them, they'll go into other transformations, other bodies, other living beings, take other forms. At some point, we'll start dying, we'll die, and this body will be transformed. If we do green burial and bury our body in the ground, fungi and worms and bugs and different things will gently devour this corpse, starting from the outside perhaps, working its way in, bacteria. And if we get cremated, the fire begins on the outside with the skin burning its way inward. In the old days, you leave the body out in the open and the birds would come and peck at it and worms would crawl into it. And it starts from the outside. So the skin would go first, dissolve first, the flesh would dissolve next, the tendons next, the harder. Eventually just the bones are left. And then the bones are left and they begin to bleach in the sun and begin to get more brittle. And eventually they dissolve into dust. And so the meditation on the corpse, contemplation of the corpse is to kind of follow this possibility for ourselves, this dissolution of the body as a way of disidentifying as me, myself, that I'm my body and this is me in some way, to soften those strong associations, but also to quiet the mind. Because the mind that is thinking a lot is the mind, is a thinking that constructs many of the ideas we have about the body. And as meditation goes deeper and deeper, the same kind of journey happens as a dissolution of the body after death, the corpse. First the boundaries of the body get soft and the idea of skin and the boundary to the outside world begins to dissolve and it gets very soft and open. And then the going closer and the muscles, the experience of muscles, the sense of being in a muscle body, flesh body begins to fade away from consciousness. And then you get deeper into the body, even the sense of hardness might be the last thing. Hardness somewhere in the body, heaviness, and eventually that dissolves as well. And so in the meditative process also involves a dissolution. And so this dissolution of the corpse meditation is both a way of disidentifying and a way to begin preparing yourself for this deep process of meditation that can happen. So we'll do some of this today. So taking a meditation posture and the care that you give to your posture, the love and compassion you give to taking a nice posture is maybe the context for doing this meditation. And maybe with the same care and compassion to gently take some deeper breaths to connect to yourself more fully, to connect yourself more kindly. Relaxing as you exhale. Some people when they die, first minutes after they die occasionally, there's a lot of letting go of muscular tension that been holding for a lifetime. It's good not to wait to let go of the tension. Taking your breath, breathe itself, ordinary breathing. Relaxing. Letting go of the holding which will let go as you die. And then taking a few moments, few breaths to just settle into ordinary breathing. Relaxing. As you exhale. As you inhale, feel any tension in your mind, your thinking mind, any pressure or agitation. And with love, with care, on the exhale, relax the thinking mind. Soften. And then whatever way that it occurs to you, feel the edges of your body where the skin either touches the air or touches your clothes. As you exhale, imagine that you're relaxing that contact with the world around your skin. And maybe feeling the spaciousness, the space that's around, all around you. And maybe you feel the porousness or the soft boundaries of the edges of your body and what's beyond the edges of your body and what's inside. Breathing with it, soft boundary, breathing. Letting go of the skin being yours that you're defined by your skin. Like a corpse loses its skin, gets eaten or dissolved or burned. So let go of your skin. Let go of that boundary place. And feel deeper into your body, maybe the warmth of your flesh, the substance of flesh through your body. Maybe it's a warmth, maybe a coolness, tingling, pulsing. A flesh which right now is still alive with sensations. This too will begin to dissolve and break up and decay and disappear. And when your body is a corpse, the flesh will go. Relaxing this flesh, relaxing a sense that it's yours, that you're defined by your flesh. Imagine that your corpse is dissolving and the flesh is disappearing. And then more deeply, all your organs and your torso, all dissolve, all are eaten, they're burned up. These two are not our possession, not what defines us. They all the elements, they return to nature. Imagining large empty cavity in your rib cage and your torso as all the organs vanish, decompose. And then imagine that all you are left is skeleton, hard bones. And this skeleton is not your possession, it's also borrowed materials. It too will dissolve. This too we have to let go of. And first the skeleton, all the tendons decay, decompose and the bones fall apart from each other and lay in a heap on the ground. Disconnected bones, there's no more shape of the body. Body shape has disappeared. A heap of bones. And over time the bones break into pieces or brittle. Slowly, slowly they turn into dust and as the bones turn into dust they blow away in the wind, spreading across the land. Falling into the soil on which new life grows. Let go of bones. This whole body dissolved is gone, the absence of body. Vast space, vast openness in all directions. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. This whole body is gone. Whatever way that you might be more settled or calmer in your sitting now, maybe more peaceful, cozy. Let go. Let go of everything. But let go into that calm. Let go of your body, your skin, your flesh. Let go of your bones. Feel the way that letting go is a better alternative to holding on and being tense. Let go. And as we come to the end of this sitting, imagine encountering other people in situations where it's safe to do so. Safe, comfortable situations. Meeting other people and letting go fully. Just letting go and being present with your caring, with your care, your love, your goodwill, your warmth, your non-defensiveness, free of impatience or desires or wanting things different, just with people. Offering something profound, a presence of attention that wants nothing, needs nothing, just there to be present. And perhaps to care, to love. May our care spread out into the world. May it be that this practice of letting go deeply is a support for the welfare and happiness of ourselves and the whole world. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you.
