Connecting with how you are in this moment.
Just exploring the possibility of opening to yourself as you are without judgments.
Just exploring the possibility of honestly kind of checking in with yourself.
How is this body, how is this mind?
And as you check in, as you notice what's here, noticing the body and noticing how the mind is, just noticing what's here.
You may notice there are some areas of tension in the body, or you might notice a kind of a push-pull around something in the mind,
or a dullness, or a sleepiness, or a restlessness in the mind.
So just seeing if you can open to just that as a place to begin with a friendly, kind attention.
As if you were your own dear friend checking in, how are you?
And honestly being willing to honestly respond, not through language, but through being.
If you have noticed any areas of tension or holding, sometimes this friendly attention can be a container or a way that it can be held,
such that it begins to shift and change.
We don't have to hold on to what we discover.
The very process of being aware with this kind attention has a way of shifting our experience, sometimes in quiet ways, and sometimes in more obvious ways.
So you might notice that just kind of taking inventory, just taking stock of how you are with this simple, kind attention.
You might begin noticing there are some releasing of tension or some shifts in the experience.
Your body and mind appreciate this kind of attention, this kind of friendly attention.
And you may also find it useful to explore relaxing those areas of the body that you've noticed, perhaps some tension.
Relaxation is such a supportive condition for us to be mindful, to be aware.
And so if you've noticed any areas of tension, even just a gentle kind of softening or releasing of that tension is sometimes possible, becoming aware, and then softening.
Thank you.
For myself, after that kind of inventory and a softening of the areas I've noticed,
I'll sometimes check in a little more deeply inside the body.
Intention can be held more deeply inside the body that can sometimes be softened if we just touch it, just touch into it.
So maybe the inside of the throat can relax.
Maybe the area around the heart can relax.
Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax.
And maybe too the mind can relax, letting go of mental tension, thoughts, worries, concerns about the past or the future.
Setting it aside, setting those worries and concerns aside perhaps for the next 20 minutes or so.
Always know where you have to go, know when you need to be right now, and very little to do.
Just connect with your experience, being aware of how you are.
Noticing how the body is.
What is obvious in your experience right now?
What is easy to connect with and experience?
For some of you that may be the breath, or some of you that may be kind of a broader sense of the body, or a specific sensation that's strong.
For some of you it might be the experience of hearing if there's sound in your environment.
Opening to the possibility of receiving, whatever is here, wherever the attention is naturally connecting, can you simply kind of settle back and let the experience come to you.
Perhaps the sensations of breathing can come to you, or the experience of the body can come to you, or the experience of hearing just being received.
Our organism, our body with its senses and its sensitive mind is a natural receiver.
It almost absorbs sensation, sound, very sensitive organism we live with, and it knows how to do the receiving.
It knows how to receive.
The body knows how to feel sensation.
The ear knows how to receive sound.
Our body naturally breathes, we don't have to do that either.
So exploring the possibility of settling back, and being available to be aware of what the body is receiving, what the ear is receiving,
what our senses are receiving, and what the mind is receiving.
Because we can also be aware of moods, emotions, even thoughts.
Our entire system receiving the experience of life.
It's possible to step back and not have any preference for what we receive.
Just be available to receive the next moment of experience, whatever is most obvious in that moment.
It may be a broad experience of a wash of sensation through the body, or a very specific sensation connected with a breath, or a pressure, a pulsing.
Sometimes that can be the most restful way to be in the present moment for some.
Just settle back and let the system receive whatever is available to be received.
For some, it feels a little more easeful to narrow the scope of the attention a little bit, perhaps just to the breath, just receiving the breath.
And if this feels more easeful for you, explore the possibility with that kind of choosing a field of attention like that.
Rather than looking for what's in that field, just see what comes into that field. How does the body receive the breath, for instance?
Exploring the possibility of relaxed receiving of experience.
Whether broad or specific, settling back and opening to how the experience shows up.
