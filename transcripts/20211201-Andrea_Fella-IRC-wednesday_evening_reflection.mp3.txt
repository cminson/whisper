 In our exploration together in these days, we've been looking at awareness, getting familiar with awareness and what supports awareness to be freeing, how to observe experience so that our minds begin to let go of their reactive patterns and habits of greed, aversion, confusion, delusion. Looking at cultivating awareness that opens to things as they are, experience as it is. Allowing that opening to things as they are is that quality of allowing. Accepting, this is what's here. Not fighting or resisting it or holding on to it, but just this is what's here in this moment. Opening to that with curiosity. And my, some of my earlier times in practice when I explored the possibility of accepting things as they are. Part of my belief seemed to be that in order to accept things as they are, I had to somehow agree with it or like it or something like that. But this exploration of acceptance of allowing is really just about not fighting, not denying, maybe that's a better word, not denying that what has come to be has come to be. What is here is already here, is that honesty, this is what's here. That's this quality of allowing acceptance, not fighting what has come to be, not trying to deny it or hold on to it. This is what has come to be. This is a kind of wisdom, way of meeting experience. And as we open to what has come to be, we do begin to see things differently. Notice the change, begin to see below the concepts as Gil was speaking about, just to what's actually here. This is wisdom that frees the mind from its habits of clinging, habits of holding on. And this very movement to allow to open to things as they are. It sounds kind of, I don't know, clinical or something like that. But it's actually one of the kindest things that we can do for ourselves. Not fighting what has come to be, not fighting ourselves, allowing opening to all aspects of our hearts and minds. If we had a dear friend who was willing to sit with us and let us completely be ourselves, completely be who we were, that they allowed us to be exactly as we were in that moment, we would feel like we were really loved. We would perhaps feel a sense of belonging, of that person caring for us and connected with us, understanding who we are. We would feel seen. And we would feel loved. And so that's why I say this movement of seeing ourselves in this way. Opening to the messiness, the struggles, the beauty, that changing flow of experience that is our lives. Opening to it is one of the kindest things, most loving things that we can do for ourselves. And so practicing with this simple practice, aware, receive, curious, simple, meeting what's here, begins to pull this quality of love along for the ride. It's beautiful the way wisdom and love connect, inform each other, relate to each other. You know, sometimes it feels like we're more on the wisdom side looking at things from that perspective, but that is also really kind. We may not feel it all the time, but sometimes we can open to that possibility. I mentioned this morning that if it feels like it's going well, it can be useful to check in and see what's happening, what's happening in the mind when there is that ease or peace or balance of mind. Sometimes we might see love and care, delight and joy in there. So many beautiful qualities of mind that are cultivated and developed with this simple practice, just meeting each moment, our hearts transform.
