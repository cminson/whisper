 Our guest speaker would like to give us some instructions on meditation before we begin and then I'll introduce him fully after the sat-fro before he gives his talk. May we do this? You should practice anapana, may goodness of today. You should focus on the nose tree or upper leg. You should be adjacent in front and out front. Please focus on the touching point, nose tree or upper leg. You should focus on the chest back. Back is going in, going out. You should not follow inside or outside. You should just wait and see in this area. If you can concentrate, it is fine. If you can concentrate, please use counting. Breathe in, breathe out. One. Breathe in, breathe out. Two. Up to eight. Okay. You can do anyway. Please focus on the chest back. If you can concentrate well, it is not necessary counting. Counting. Okay. Tonight is our good fortune to hear the dhamma from our guest teacher, Pa Okusayadaw. This is his first trip to the United States and he'll be back here for a weekend sponsored by the Sati Center later in January. Pa Okusayadaw has been a monk for nearly 60 years and has studied and practiced with Mahasi Sayadaw, Pandita Sayadaw and many other teachers in Burma. His long studies of the Pali texts and his own deep practice that led him to teach both Papasana concentration practices to Burmese and Western students in his monastery and meditation center south of Rangoon. We are fortunate to have him visited us in the United States. Most of us have been taught that concentration builds naturally as Vipassana practice matures. In his teaching, Sayadaw sometimes finds it appropriate, depending on the student, to give instructions in concentration practice before teaching Vipassana. But when listening tonight, please bear in mind that Sayadaw may be speaking about two different practice, two different but related practices, both of which use the breath for their own purposes. So please listen attentively as we hear the dhamma from Pa Okusayadaw. Namo dasa, vaga wadau, raha dosa, masa bhutasa. We are very happy to have gone to America. At the invitation of some devotees when we are in America, we would like to issue something about the system of meditation at the Pala Meditation Forest Meditation Center. It is based upon instructions for in the Bali Bodhis text and we show the maga, the birth of purification. We believe that meditation taught in the Bali Bodhis text is the same as the meditation practice by the Buddha himself and taught by him to his disciples during his lifetime. Why meditation? First we should ask ourselves, why did the Buddha teach meditation or what is the purpose of meditation? The purpose of meditation is to edit nirvana. Nirvana is the cessation of mentality and materiality. To reach nirvana, therefore, we must completely destroy both wholesome mental permissions or wholesome comers, rooted in greed, non-greed, non-anger, and non-delusion. And a wholesome mental permissions rooted in greed, anger, and delusion, all of which produce new rebirth, aging, sickness, and death. If we destroy them totally with the birth knowledge, then we will have realized nirvana. In other words, nirvana is release and freedom from the suffering of the realm of rebirth and the cessation of rebirth, aging, sickness, and death. We are all subject to the suffering of rebirth, aging, sickness, and death. And so to free ourselves from the many forms of suffering, we need to meditate. Since we are free from all suffering, we must learn how to meditate in order to edit nirvana. What is meditation? So what is meditation? Meditation consists of samatha and vipassana meditation, which must both be based upon moral conduct of body and speech. In other words, meditation is the development and profession of the noble report path. Noble report path is right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. Right view, the Buddha God, Vipassana right view. And the right view, right view and right thought are together called the training of wisdom, right speech, right action, and right livelihood are together called the training of morality. Right effort, right mindfulness, and the right concentration together are called the training of concentration. What is, which is samatha meditation? The noble report path. Now let us look a little bit more at each of the eight patterns of the noble report path. The first pattern is right view, samatha teaching. What is right view? Right view constitutes of all kinds of knowledge. The inside knowledge of the noble true of safari, which is the five aggregates of kalingi. The inside knowledge of the noble true of the origin of safari, which descends the causes for the five aggregates of kalingi. In other words, it is the inside knowledge of the bended origination. Number three, the realization and knowledge of the god, causation of safari, cessation of safari, which is the cessation of the five aggregates of kalingi, Vipassana. Number four, the knowledge of the, the knowledge of the noble, but leading to the cessation and suffering, cessation of suffering, which is the way of brightest leading to the realization of nirvana, the noble report path. The second pattern of the noble report path is right thought. What is right thought? Right thought is the four pole. Right thought is the four pole. Ablying thought to the object of the noble true of safari, which is the five aggregates of kalingi. Ablying thought to the object of the noble true of the origin of safari, which is causes, which is the causes for the five aggregates of kalingi. Ablying thought to the object of the noble true of the cessation of suffering, which is nirvana. Ablying thought to the object of noble true of the bud leading to the cessation of suffering, which is the noble report path. That's right thought, applying the mind to the object of the true of safari, the five aggregates of kalingi, and right view, understands it as it really is. These two fighters work together to apply the mind to each of the four noble truths, and to understand them since they were, since they work together in this way. They are called the training of wisdom. The third fighter of the noble report path is right speech. Right speech is the abstaining, prolying, slender, harsh speech, and useless talk. The fourth fighter of the noble report path is right action. Right action is to abstain, proly, front theft, and pro-sexual misconduct. The fifth fighter of the noble report path is right livelihood. Right livelihood is to abstain, pro-obstaining, and living by wrong speech or wrong action. The fifth fighter of the noble report path is right, pro- pro- pro- pro- pro- pro- pro- pro- pro- right lively who are called the training of morality. The sixth fighter of the noble report path is right effort. Right effort is also of focus. The effort to prevent the arising of unhoused animals that have not yet arisen. The right effort to remove unwholesome states that have already risen. The effort to remove the rising of wholesome states that have not yet risen. The effort to increase wholesome states that have already risen. In order to develop these four types of right effort, we must practice and develop the three trainings of morality, concentration, and wisdom. The seventh fender of the Nova April part is Right Mindfulness. Right mindfulness is also of four kinds. Mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of the feelings, mindfulness of consciousness, and mindfulness of the mind. Here, the must are the 51 associated mental factors including feeling, excluding feeling, or the five aggregates of Galingai, the 12 internal and external sense phases, or the 80 elements. Or the seven factors of enlightenment, or the four noble truths, etc. But the four types of mindfulness can be reduced to just two, mindfulness of mentality and mindfulness of materiality. The eighth fender of the Nova April part is Right Concentration. Right concentration is the first genre, second genre, that genre, and fourth genre. These are called Right Concentration. According to the Mahasadhi Prana Souda, Great Souda own the foundation of mindfulness. In the Wizarding Mega, Right Concentration is explained further as the four five material genres, the four and material genres, and excess concentration. Since people have a great accumulation of paramese, they are doing nirvana by simply listening to the brief or detailed talk on the Dhamma. Most people, however, do not have much paramese. They must practice the Nova April part. It is graduate order. It is graduate order. They are called persons to be left near person. They must develop the Nova April part step by step in the order of mentality, morality, concentration, and wisdom. After beautifying their morality, they must try and concentrate. After beautifying their mind, by way of concentration practice, they must try and wisdom. How you develop concentration? Here, how should you develop concentration? There are body subjects of somatic meditation, and if person can develop any of these to add a concentration. Those who cannot decide which meditation subject to be developed should start with the Anabhana Siddhi mindfulness of breathing. Most people succeed in meditation by using either Anabhana Siddhi mindfulness of breathing or four elements meditation. Therefore, let us now look briefly at how to practice Anabhana Siddhi mindfulness of breathing. The development of Anabhana Siddhi mindfulness of breathing is taught by the Buddha in the Mahasrata Vrana Suddha. He says, and establishes mindfulness on the meditation objects. Ever mindfully he breathes in, and ever mindfully he breathes out. Breathing in a long breath, he knows I'm breathing in a long breath. Breathing out a long breath, he knows I'm breathing out a long breath. Breathing in a short breath, he knows I'm breathing in a short breath. Breathing out a short breath, he knows I'm breathing out a short breath. Experiencing the whole breath body, I will breathe in thus he trains himself. And experiencing the whole breath body, I will breathe out thus he trains himself. Coming the breath body, I will breathe in thus he trains himself. And coming the breath body, I will breathe out thus he trains himself. These instructions are taught by the Buddha in Mahasrata Vrana Suddha for the beginners to develop Jhana higher concentration. So how do you practice? To begin meditating, sit in a comfortable position and try to be aware of the breath. As in thus he leaves the body through the nose fields. You should be able to feel it either just below the nose or somewhere around the nose fields. Do not follow the breath into the body or out of the body because then you will not be able to buffer your concentration. Just be aware of the breath at the most obvious place. It brushes against or touches either the top of the upper lip or around the nose field. Then you will be able to develop and buffer your concentration. Do not be addicted to the individual characteristics or general characteristics or color of the nimitta sign of concentration. The individual characteristics are the characteristics of the four elements in the breath, such as hardness, roughness, flowing, heat, supporting, pushing. The general characteristics are the embalminous, suffering, and non-self characteristics of the breath. This means do not know an out-embalmina or an out-suffering or an out-non-self nature to another. Simply be aware of the breath, a breath in or breath. That is the concept. The concept of the breath is the object of the anaphanicity. This object must concentrate on to develop concentration. As you concentrate on the concept of the breath in this way, if you practice this meditation in the previous slide and develop some oramids, you will easily be able to concentrate on the in-and-out breath. If not, the whistle demigod suggests containing the breath. You should count after the end of each breath, an out-one, an out-two, etc. Count after the at least five, but not more than ten. We suggest you go to it because that reminds you of the noble equal path, which you are trying to develop. So you should go as you like up to any number between five and ten and determine that during that day you will not let your mind drift or go elsewhere. But be only commonly aware of the breath. When you go like that, you find that you are able to concentrate your mind and make it commonly aware of the only breath. After concentrating your mind like this for at least half an hour, you should proceed to the first and second stage of the meditation. Number one, breathing in a long breath. He knows I'm breathing in a long breath. Number two, breathing in a short breath. He knows I'm breathing in a short breath. Breathing in a short breath. He knows I'm breathing in a short breath. This is the second stage. At this stage, you have to develop awareness of whether the in-and-out breaths are long or short. Long or short here do not refer to length and feet and chest, but length and time be duration. You should decide for yourself what length of time you will call long and what length of time you will call short. Beware of the duration of each in-and-out breath. You will notice that the breath is sometimes long in time and sometimes short. Just knowing this is all you have to do at this stage. Do not know an out-and-out long or an out-short. Just in or in, beware of whether the breath is long or short. You should know that by being just aware of the length of time that the breath is precious against. Against and touches the upper lip or nose shield from the nose shield as it enters and leaves the body. Sometimes the breath may be long throughout the day and sometimes short. But do not purposely try to make it long or short. At this stage, the nimeda may be a nimeda of any sign of the breath. But if you are able to do this commonly for about one hour, nimeda as usual move on to the back stage. Number three, that stage. Experiencing the whole breath body, I will breathe in. Thus, he traces himself and experiencing the whole breath body. I will breathe out. Thus, he traces himself. This is the third stage. Here, the Buddha is instructing you to have aware of the whole breath from the beginning to the end. In this stage, you should combine three together. When your breath is long, other than usual try to know the whole long breath. When your breath is short, usual try to know the whole short breath. As you do this, the nimeda may not appear. It does not. Immediately, you should not shift your mind to nimeda. But stay with the breath. Because for beginners, when nimeda appear, nimeda is usually not stable. If you shift your mind to the nimeda, then very soon nimeda may disappear. Because of this reason, you should just concentrate on the natural breath only. When your concentration becomes stable, nimeda also will become stable. When you are trying in this way, when your concentration improves, usually your breath becomes subtle. If you are commonly aware of the breath from beginning to the end for about an hour, then nimeda appears, you should move on to the fourth stage. The fourth stage is combine the breath body. I shall breathe in thus he trains himself. In combine the breath body, I will breathe out thus he trains himself. This is the fourth stage. To do this, you should decide to make the breath calm and go on being continuously aware of the breath from the beginning to the end. You should do nothing else, otherwise your concentration will break and fall away. Now you can combine both stages together. When your breath becomes subtle, you should try to know the whole long subtle breath. When your breath becomes short, then you should try to know the whole short subtle breath. But if your breath is not become subtle, then without nimeda, such as four patterns of making the breath calm. Number one, coordination. Number two, reaction. Number three, attention. Number four, reviewing. Reaction means you should be in addition to the breath. You appreciate the breath. You advise the mind towards the breath object. To the other, I will try to make the breath calm. Number two, re-assemble. You continue to do so. That means you will be sustained in addition to the breath that we do it again and again. Keep the breath in the mind to the other. I will try to make the breath calm. This is why you are sitting only. When you obey addition on the breath object, it is not necessary to decide in this way frequently. Number three, attention. Literally, deciding to make the breath calm. Attention is the mental pattern that makes the mind adverse towards the object. Attention makes the mind conscious of the breath. Know the breath calmly. Number four, reviewing. Review means you review the breath. Make it clear to the mind to the effect. I will try to make the breath calm. All you need to do at this stage is to decide to calm the breath and to be continuously aware of it. That way you will be able to find the breath becomes calmer and calmer. And then if you are, when you are concentration improve, the nimedha may appear. Just before the nimedha appear, a lot of yogis encounter difficulties. Mostly they find that the breath becomes very subtle and clear. They may think the breath is stopped. The breath has stopped completely. If this happens, you should give your awareness where you last noticed the breath in. Wait for, wait, wait for the breath there. In that version, if the dust in the womb, a drowned version, an unconscious version, a version in the fourth jhana, a version in the abdomen of the satsanghi, and a brahma, only these seven types of version do not breath. Reflect on the fact that you are not none of them, that you are in reality breathing. And that it is just your mindfulness which is not central enough for you to be aware of the breath. When it is subtle, you should not make the breath more obvious, as the effort will cause agitation. Your concentration will not develop. Just be aware of the breath as it is, and if it is not clear, simply wait for it where you last noticed it. You will find that as you apply your mindfulness in which time, in this way, the breath will reappear. The nimeda. The nimeda of anubhana saddhi varies according to the individual. To the sana, the nimeda is pure and fine like cotton wool, or draw of cotton, or moving air, or a draw of bright light, like the morning star, Venus. There may be also some colors, red color, or maybe yellow color, etc., depending on their difference of perception. In most cases, a pure white nimeda, like cotton wool, is the oghaha nimeda learning sign. The oghaha nimeda is usually dull and opaque. When the nimeda becomes bright like the morning star, brilliant and clear, it is the padeebhaga nimeda counterpart sign. When light is green, ruby, or gem, it is the oghaha nimeda learning sign, or learning sign. But when bright and sparkly, it is called padeebhaga nimeda counterpart sign. The other images should be also understood in the same way too. So, even though anubhana saddhi is a single meditation of subject, it produces various types of nimeda. The nimeda are being used differently to different people. The wizarding magga explains that this is because the nimeda is produced by perception. And the commentary to the wizarding magga explains that it is the different perception which the different yogis had before the nimeda rose. Those nimeda are different because of perception, but perception does not rise low. It rises always together with other mental formations, associated mental formations. So, for example, if a yogi concentrates on the anubhana nimeda with a heavy mind, the mental formations are not only the one perception but are the altogether valuable such as conduct, volition, loneliness, addiction, applying thought, sustained thought, decision, effort, and desire. So, not only perception differs but also all other mental formations differ. This is the fact explained elsewhere in the wizarding magga. It is explanation of the edamat of the ways of nidah perception or non-perception. For further import or put in med riya jana. There the wizarding magga explains that the perception in that jana is very subtle, which is why call it the edamat of nidah perception or non-perception. But it is not only the perception that is very subtle. The feelings, the consciousness, the conduct, and all other mental formations are also very subtle. Thus, says the wizarding magga in the edamat of the nidah perception or non-perception is also, there is also nidah feelay, non-non-feelay, nidah consciousness, non-non-consciousness, nidah conduct, non-non-conduct, etc. So, when the government says the nidah are different, because of the perception, they are merely explaining the unabundant nidah from the single point of view of perception. In terms of perception, using perception as their example. But whatever the shape or color of your nidah, whatever your perception of the nidah operate, it is important not to play with your nidah. Do not let it go away and do not immediately change the edith shape or appearance. If you do, your concentration will not develop any further and your progress will stop. Your nidah will probably disappear. So, when your nidah first appears, do not move your mind from the breath to the nidah. If you do, you will find it disappears. If you find that the nidah is stable, your mind by itself has to go fixed on it. They just leave your mind there. If you focus your mind to come away from it, you will probably lose your concentration. If you animate the abbeys far away in front of you, ignore it, as it will probably disappear. If you ignore it and simply concentrate on the natural breath, then your concentration will improve. When your concentration improves, then your nidah also will become stable. If you animate the abbeys at the place where the breath touches and stays well, the breath will be disturbed. The breath has the nidah. When the nidah and breath are unified together, then please focus on the nidah. Usually, mind automatically stick to the nidah at that time. But you should wait and see whether the nidah and breath unify or not. If the breath is another, nidah is another. At that time, you should not be at this nidah. When your nidah and breath unify, become one. At that time, only you should be at this time, on the nidah. But in this case, usually when the breath and nidah unify, mind automatically stick to the nidah. At that time, if you pay attention, nidah is very good. Your concentration will improve. Then you should determine to keep your mind calmly concentrated on the nidah only. When your concentration improves, nidah will become white. When your concentration is not white, then you should concentrate on that white nidah. If you concentrate one hour, two hours on that white nidah, then the nidah will become transparent. The transparent nidah is called the vajnimidah, the counter-bud sign. The transparent nidah is clear and bright like money, like peanuts. When the nidah becomes clear and bright, you should concentrate on the nidah only, on that nidah only. If you can concentrate thoroughly on that nidah, then the strong bubble of absorption may appear. But at this stage, you will reach either excess or absorption concentration. It is called excess concentration because it is close to n-precite jhana. Absorption concentration is jhana. Both types of concentration have the vajnimidah counter-bud sign as their object. The only difference between them is that in excess concentration stage, the jhana feathers are not fully developed. For this reason, bawenga's life continuum still oga, and one can fall into bawenga's life continuum consciousness. The yogi will say that everything stops and may even think it is nivana. In reality, the mind has not stopped, but the yogi is just not sufficiently skilled to discern this nimidah as the bawenga are very subtle. So in this case, if you can concentrate well on the nimidah, then the strong and powerful absorption may appear. If you can maintain this absorption more than one hour, two hour, three hour, that absorption stage is called jhana. You should maintain this concentration at least for three days. If you can concentrate successfully in every city more than one hour, two hour, or three hour, successfully for three days, then at that time you can reflect your jhana feathers. On usual reflect. Please be a dintian and ariya of your heart. You may see bawenga's life continuum. That bawenga is called mindo. What is bawenga? In gaudra, nigaya, vodat, touch. Baba, sarat, midam, bhikvay, cheda. What is the meaning? Bawenga, mind stay has the brilliant light. What is the meaning? Every consciousness which arise to build a heart base can produce, mind produce small body gas. These small body gas may be smaller than Adam. We call these small body gas as kalaba. In each small body gas, if we analyze, there are at least eight days of materiality. There are earth element, water element, fire element, wind element, color, odor, flavor, and nutritive essence. Among these eight days of materiality, kalaba is very bright because of concentration. Jana concentration. Jana concentration is always concomitant with wisdom fagality. In this case, wisdom fagality means penetrating the anabhana padi bhagav nirita. When the concentrations in wisdom fagality become bawah, they can produce new maras, millions of small body gas. Each small body gas there is color. That color can produce strong and powerful light. That color becomes bright. One kalaba is color, another kalaba is color. When they combine together, this becomes bright. In the same way, bawinga consciousness also can produce strong, many millions of small body gas. Among these small body gas, there is also color. That color is also bright. That brightness is called bawinga only as if figuratively. So if you bring attention inside your heart, you can see this bawinga. When you see bawinga, at the same time, you may also be able to see your anabhana padi bhagav nirita. When your anabhana padi bhagav nirita, abhiya in your bawinga, then you can design bawinga padaas one by one. Apply the sustained dawg, dry bliss and one pointedness. You should design one by one. If you design one by one, then bliss design again. Fight jhana padaas together. If you can design pajana padaas, if you can see jhana padaas clearly, then we can say that you are at the first jhana stage. Then if you want to do continue, then you can go to second jhana, third jhana and fourth jhana. When you reach fourth jhana stage, your breath will completely stop. Fourth jhana also can produce strong and powerful brilliant lights. Based on that light, depending on that light, if you design four elements systematically, then you can see small body gas. If you can see small body gas, if you analyze the body gas, in each small body gas, there are also four elements. If you get design four elements in each small body gas, this is the beginning stage of weipasana. Then you should continue to design the remaining materialities. If you design materialities, then you should continue to design ultimate mentality. If you design ultimate materialities, then you should design their causes. Ultimate materialities and their causes are called formations. If you can design these formations internally and externally, as well as the first present and future, then you should comprehend these formations as nature, dukkha or ananda. Nature is as well as they arise, they pass away, so they are nature. They are always oppressed by rising in poly, so they are suffering dukkha. There is no bombing itself in these formations, so they are ananda, not self. If you can comprehend in this way, this comprehension, that contemplated knowledge is called weipasana. If you practice weipasana system medically, when you work weipasana inside bigger medias, you may realize nirvana. Ultimate materialities and ultimate medialities are called the novatru of suffering. Their causes are called the origin of suffering. Nirvana is the novatru of the cessation of suffering. A noble fact which is associated with fact knowledge, which realize nirvana is called the noble equal fact. So, all together they are up for nova truth. If you practice in this way, systematically, you may also realize for nova truth and you may realize nirvana. May you realize nirvana as possible. We have time for questions. Does anybody have some questions? Can one do vipasana while they are in jhana? It is impossible. Impossible means, for example, now you are practicing anabhana. Anabhana jhana's object is here, counter back side, anabhana bhribhaga nimita. If you get concentrate work on that anabhana bhribhaga nimita, then anabhana jhana absorption, okay? Okay. So, anabhana jhana's object is anabhana bhribhaga nimita only. If you shift to other object, this is not jhana. Imagine from jhana you gain this ultimate mentality, you gain this ultimate materiality, you gain this there causes. This ultimate mentality, ultimate materiality and there causes are the object of vipasana. So, if you want to do vipasana, then you must comprehend this ultimate mentality, ultimate materiality and there causes as nichatoka nada. So, object is different. So, when you are enduring jhana, other day you cannot comprehend these formations as nichatoka nada. If you want to do vipasana, then you must emerge from jhana. Imagine from jhana, then you must decide ultimate mentality, materiality and there causes, then you can comprehend them as nichatoka nada. So, what are the benefits? You just described how one can use jhana to strengthen the vipasana. What are some of the benefits of doing that? Especially jhana concentration can produce such powerful light. These lights are dependent on your concentration's quality. It may differ to each other. Some metadata light is spread around, maybe little bit area only, but some metadata's concentration can produce such powerful lights very far away. With the assessment of that light, if you design ultimate mentality, ultimate materiality and there causes, you can design easily. But if there is no light, then you cannot see these small body gasses. For example, now please be addition your body. Can you see small body gasses? Can you see? Now, now please be addition your body. Do you see body gasses? You cannot see. Why? There is no enough light. The light that was done is necessary when you are practicing some matter in vipasana. If there is no light, then you cannot see these small body gasses. If you cannot see these small body gasses, then you cannot analyze these small body gasses. If you cannot analyze these small body gasses, then you cannot see ultimate materiality. If you cannot see ultimate materiality, you cannot practice vipasana well. Because the object of vipasana is ultimate materiality and ultimate mentality in there causes. Ultimate materiality and mentality are the no virtue of suffering, dukkha, siddha. There are causes of the origin of suffering, smury, siddha. These two dhammas are, or formations are, the object of vipasana. If you have no enough light, then you cannot design there causes. Especially the causes of ultimate materiality and mentality are past causes only, no present causes. Present causes cannot produce present by aggregates or ultimate mentality. Previous causes, especially whole sun kambas, which you had accumulated in previous life, can produce your past aggregates now. So because of this reason, you must design this whole sun kambas. If you have no enough light, that light is called the light of the withstand. If you have no enough light of withstand, then you cannot design there causes, especially whole sun kambas. That whole sun kambas is especially based on ignorance, gravy and clinging. Ignorance means you may have accumulated some type of whole sun kambas, such as donation, performing generosity. We call this whole sun kambas. When you perform generosity, you may have the desire to be a man or woman in future life. According to Bodhana's and Bidama Bodhana's teachings, if you get this sample elements meditation system medically inside your body, then you can see just only small body gas. If you can analyze these small body gas, you can see ultimate materiality. And then if you can design ultimate mentality, there are only ultimate materiality and medallity. These ultimate materiality and medallity, as well as they arise fast away. They are impermanent. There is no man, there is no woman according to ultimate reality. Only medallity and materiality, mind and medallity, they are impermanent. So if you know this is man or this is woman, this is delusion, ignorance. We call this is a wija. Based on ignorance, you have attachment to man life or woman's life. This is gravy. Rapid gravy is called klinging. Based on this ignorance, gravy, klinging and you perform generosity. This is whole sun gamma. But this whole sun gamma as well as they arise the fast away. When they pass away, they left behind the post of gamma which can produce high aggregates and your conception stage. In mother's womb, in the beginning of the rebut-linging consciousness movement. So when you are designing these causes, if you have enough light, then you cannot penetrate these causes. You cannot see clearly. So because of this reason, Vodak dot incan, sicha san yoda, because please develop concentration. Having a dead concentration, you will see the dhammas as they really are. What dhammas they will see? They will see the novatru of the suffering, the novatru of the origin of suffering, the novatru of the cessation of suffering, the novatru of the body leading to the cessation of suffering. So if you have enough concentration, that concentration can produce such powerful light. With the assistance of that light of wisdom, if you try to know pull over troops, you can easily understand. So because of this reason, usually, in many sources, Vodak dot, somata yanika, somata bhihika, pull, we present meditation. Are there any final questions? Monte, thank you very much.
