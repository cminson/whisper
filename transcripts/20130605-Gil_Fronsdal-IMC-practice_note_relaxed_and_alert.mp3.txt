One of the important ways of supporting your meditation 
practice is to have the right balance between being 
relaxed and being alert and upright. You don’t want to 
relax so much that you melt into a puddle on the floor or 
on your chair. But to  sit upright in a posture that allow s 
your muscles to relax as deeply as possible  is a great 
support .  
 
There are many ways of doing this. You can scan 
through your body and relax, soften ing any holding you 
may have. A little technique of imagination that some 
people like is to visualize  some thing like a pebble or a 
piece of flat wood sinking slowly into water  – something 
that doesn’t sink too fast as it goes to  the bottom . Or 
imagine melted butter or warm oil slowly pouring 
through the body.  
 
If you have this sense of a pebble sinking down t hrough 
the water, i magine it’s sinking through you . And as it 
slowly settles , imagine or allow your muscles to relax, 
soften, or melt.  
 
This is useful if there is a lot of thinking or tension going on. When the system is activated  in the head , it is 
helpf ul to just drop that pebble. It slowly sinks , and then 
comes to rest. With this,  our attention, gravity, energy, 
and center of focus can be grounded  – not up in the 
head, but rather down lower , in a balanced way .  
 
Then do it again a few times. Or just do it really slowly. 
Sometimes the relaxing might not be perceptible in 
terms of feeling the muscles actually releasing . It may 
be more of a wave of softening that moves through the 
body.  
 
If we don’t relax , then the tension we hold in the body all 
too easily supports the thinking mind , giving it fuel to 
keep thinking. We don’t hold bodily tension innocently. 
There is a cost. The cost of being tense makes it all too 
easy to keep thinking a lot. But w hen the body is 
relaxed, it is easier for the mind to g et quieter , and we 
can see more clearly  what’s here .
