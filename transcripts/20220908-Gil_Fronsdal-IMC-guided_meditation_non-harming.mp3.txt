 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone. I'm feeling happy looking at the greetings in the chat. Thank you for those of you who take warm greetings every morning. I take the greetings in the chat to be representative of the warm greetings, the goodwill that exists in this extended community that's participating, including the people who are not chatting. I want to thank all of you for this. So, I want to begin a little story from the suttas this morning before the meditation, and I'll continue it tomorrow, so hopefully you'll forgive me. And there is some kind of celestial being that comes down to visit a young monk who's starting to meditate, and the celestial being says, you're young in the prime of life. You should go out and enjoy sensual pleasures. Why do you abandon what is immediate and directly visible here and now for this dharma practice? And the monk says, no, it's not the case. I'm not abandoning what is directly visible here and immediate now. The dharma is directly visible. The dharma is directly present now, immediate, and it goes through like this. And then the deity says, well, explain yourself. And the monk can't explain himself, so I'm new. So, you have to go talk to the Buddha. So, that's the part for tomorrow. But at the end of the Buddha explaining all this to him, to the celestial being, the celestial being summarizes the teachings, the summary, the answer to all this. And that's what I want to read. Oh, no. Yeah, here. Here it is. Okay. One should do nothing mean in all the world, not by speech, by mind, or by body. Having abandoned sensual desires, mindful and clearly comprehending, one should not pursue a course that is painful and harmful. That's why I wanted to read. Should not pursue a course that is painful and harmful. So, this practice that we do, the way that it's immediately beneficial, visible here and now, to be seen for oneself is a practice of non-harming. We see something about the dharma when we harm ourselves. And so, the dharma is seen there if we see it as dharma, if we see it as a teaching, something to learn from, something to practice with. So, suffering and pain and discomfort and despair that we might feel. In the dharma, we don't have to see it as unfortunate. We see it as the dharma. Oh, this is true. This is what's happening. I see it clearly now. And we practice with it, and we learn the practice of non-harming. Thorough non-harming, radical non-harming, non-harming in all directions, including not harming oneself. And that's when we really discover that this dharma is visible here, it's now immediate. It is onward leading. It is to be experienced by the wise. So, that's what we'll do today. Maybe that can be an orientation for your meditation. We practice of non-harming. And there's a way in which letting the mind be distracted, lost in thought, while not directly harming, is a little bit stressful. It's a little bit of tension. It's a little bit away from the place of freedom and peace. And so, this guideline to sit with non-harming quietly, and if you do harm yourself, it's with being mean or being something. Don't add harm on top of that. See the dharma in it. Don't believe it, but dharma it. Don't participate in it. But see it clearly for what it is, and then you're seeing the dharma. So, with that, we'll sit quietly. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
