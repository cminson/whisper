 What I wanted to talk about was the Bodhisattva ideal or the Bodhisattva path. And this is an ideal that they have in Buddhism that we have, that is one of the more beautiful ideals that Buddhism has to offer. The Bodhisattva literally means, sattva means a being, usually translated as a being. Bodhi means awakening. So a Bodhisattva is an awakening being. And awakening means that the person is not totally awake yet. And it also means, that's one meaning of awakening being. And the other meaning of awakening being is that it's a person who helps other people awaken, who helps other people wake up. And because the Bodhisattva ideal is ideal of a person who is not preoccupied, solely involved with that person's awakening for themselves, but is also interested in supporting and helping other people in their awakening and their becoming free and being free of suffering. And this ideal of the Bodhisattva is often associated in Buddhism with Mahayana Buddhism, which is the Buddhism of Tibet, of China, of Japan, of Korea. And it's considered not to be the important ideal for Theravada Buddhism, which is the Buddhism of Sri Lanka and Thailand and Burma. And it's a kind of a misunderstanding. It's kind of an unfortunate division to associate the Arhat ideal with Theravada Buddhism and the Bodhisattva ideal with Mahayana. And then actually both ideals are held in both traditions. And that the Bodhisattva ideal is a Pan-Buddhist ideal that's existed in all schools of Buddhism. And what's historically true is the Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes it almost exclusively, whereas Theravada Buddhism tends to emphasize more the Arhat ideal, but the Bodhisattva ideal is found in it, and it's a very important part of it. And that there are many Theravada Buddhists who pursue the Bodhisattva ideal. So just say that it's a Buddhist ideal. That it doesn't belong to any particular school of Buddhism, this particular ideal. And so I'm talking about an ideal, which is different than usual way Vipassana teachers talk, because the emphasis in Vipassana is in talking about what's actual more than what's ideal. And there's a hesitation, I feel, at least within myself, to talk much about ideals, because ideals get us into big trouble. We compare ourselves against an ideal, we measure ourselves against an ideal, we strive to attain an ideal. And ideals tend to kind of, the danger in ideals is they take us away from what's actually happening in the present moment. And Vipassana is, if nothing else, it's deep practice, Buddhist practice, which is about really waking up to what's, recognizing what's actually happening in the present moment. And we know better than anybody, because of our attempts to do this, how ideals get in the way. And so I say sometimes that rather than, if you're stuck between the ideal and the actual, let go of the ideal, and really pay attention to what the actual is, get to know the actual, and develop as much compassion and understanding for what's actually going on, rather than using some ideal to beat yourself up with. And the tremendous faith that I have, and that I think that Buddhism has, is that your, whatever ideal Buddhism has to offer, can be found through deeply respecting the actual, what's actually happening in the present moment. You don't have to turn away for something, you don't have to strive after something else. You just have to really wake up fully and totally to what's actually here, all the warts and all, even when it's unpleasant, the unpleasant sides of it. And it all comes with time. The ideal will come. However, the ideals, so there's often hesitation to talk about ideals, but ideals also represent our potential. And sometimes it's very valuable to have some discussion and some images of our potential, some sense of, that there's a potential that greater, we have a greater potential than what we're in touch with right now. Or that we have some sense of some potential that we have, or we've touched it at some point, we've tasted it, we know that it's true, it's a true potential that we have, and that this is something that's valuable to explore, to develop, to move towards in our life, and not simply just leave it to chance, you know, I'm going to deal with the actual and let it kind of be the chance that this ever reappears. But actually we can move ourselves in a certain direction based on our potential, and we can be inspired by potential. Part of the function of ideals, the wholesome possibility of having an ideal, talking about an ideal, is that it can awaken within us, it can inspire within us that potential we didn't know that was there. And so if we never talk about ideals, if we never talk about potentials, we might actually not, you know, we're always talking about the actual, we're going to always be talking about the five hindrances. You know, and that's all fine, you know, but to wake up and to be inspired in the possibility, to be inspired by what's already within us, we don't usually see, is part of the function of ideals. So in mindfulness practice it's very much about waking up to what's actual, and as I talked about this morning, it's beginning to see the difference from living a life based on aboutness versus a life that's based on direct experience, of direct participation with our experience as it is. To participate in our experience is a lot different than having an about relationship, you know, this is what it's about, and so we kind of remove ourself from it and we're analyzing it, we're reacting to it, we're having judgments or opinions about it. And rather than having judgments, opinions, fears, hesitations, confusions about what our life is about, we can let go of all that, and we can let go of all that what's left. Buddhism, that's defined as awakening, when all fears and hatreds and aversions and confusions fall away. But what's left is a sense of participation, and you can't maybe even talk about, it's very difficult to talk about this sense of wholeness, a whole sense of experience which appears when the divisions of hate and aversion and desire and lust no longer seems to be kind of creating a division or obstacles. Aboutness is a world of objects, you know, we objectify the world, and the world of holistic experience no longer objectifies the world, and we find ourselves, we are the world in a sense. And this is where we talk funny language sometimes, we are our experience, we are the sound, we are the flower that we're looking at, we are the wind blowing across our face, we are the person that we meet, we are the homeless person that we meet. And I don't know if I should say this, but I'm not saying this to kind of, sometimes I shouldn't talk about myself so much, and I don't say this to kind of point out that I'm doing anything good about me particularly. Just an example, I'm not a very generous person, so I just say that first. But this guy came up to me the other day at downtown Palo Alto, and he asked me for some money to buy a hamburger at the McDonald's there they have, or Burger King, McDonald's right there on University Avenue? Burger King. And so I gave him 50 cents, and then I said, I said, oh why don't I buy you your burger? Because I knew I hadn't given him enough to buy a burger. And so he said, he looked at me and said, okay I trust you. So, okay. So I went over with him and bought him, I said, buy whatever you want. And he said, he ordered a cheeseburger, and I said, is that all you want? And he said, okay I'll get a prize too. And it wasn't like I was thinking of being, I was being generous. It wasn't like I thought I was being generous or I was trying to be generous. It was like, oh, can I just buy this guy his dinner? It wasn't like I was trying to, it wasn't like, no one should think I was generous because I did this thing, because I wasn't generous. It was just like, oh, I don't know why it occurred to me to do it. I gave him the money, that's what he wanted. And I just kind of did it. We went over, we talked for a while, and I bought him dinner and left. It wasn't about anything. He wasn't an object, I wasn't trying to be generous or be a good person in his eyes or for anybody. It was just like this thing that I did. And then it was over and I went on with stuff. So what is it like when we don't live in about life, about something, live more directly? So many of us, I feel, including myself, the center of gravity of how we live our life is in the stories and ideas in our cognitive world, the stories of our thoughts and our ideas. And what we learn, I think, in part through sitting and seeing very clearly what's going on is that that's only part of the story. And if you see it's only part of the story, we can see there's actually much more that's going on in the present moment than our particular thoughts and ideas. And then rather than referencing our life in those thoughts and those ideas, we can reference our life in this bigger picture of what's going on. And if we're in a bigger picture of what's going on, it's not a world of objects anymore. It's my proposal, it's my experience. So there's this ideal of the bodhisattva. And the bodhisattva is an ideal of a person whose life is related to awakening, to a world which is not based on objects, of separation. And we say that one of the definitions of no self in Buddhism is that there's no separate self. It isn't that you have to kind of get it. If you say it that way, then we don't get caught up in what is a self and I have a self and my therapist says I have a self and my therapist says I have a better self, a stronger sense of self. Here you're telling me I have no self, I'm confused. But there's no separate sense of self as a good definition of anatta. There's no sense of inherent separation between me and the tree and me and you and what's going on. The idea of inherent separation and being totally independent is an illusion. And so to find out, and that's what we find when we become awakened, we explore the world of awakening. And we find that there is no inherent separation. So from this no sense of inherent separation, the bodhisattva is a person who wants to live that experience. And maybe doesn't necessarily live it moment by moment, but is inspired by that possibility of being awakened and wants to orient their life by the possibility of that awakening. But not just for themselves, not some individual enlightenment, but really they see that possibility, that potential in other people and other beings also. They see that other people have that ability to live a life that's not objectful, that's not full of fear or ambition or worry or self defense or projection or all the different ways it's about things rather than just being things. And so the bodhisattva is someone who is inspired by this possibility of freedom of awakening in the world, but they don't necessarily only focus on themselves. This is where it's going to happen. They see that it's possible, they want it to happen in the world and around them, everywhere, everything themselves. It's said that the bodhisattva ideal is an altruistic ideal, that it's an ideal of someone who is dedicated to be of service to other people. And it is a kind of service oriented ideal. And I think it's one of the great ideals that we have as human beings. And I'm struck how much the, I don't know if they're role models, but the pop figures, the people we look up to in our society, there's sometimes politicians, sometimes not, maybe more often these days not. Sometimes I wish they were role models. Athletes, the Michael Jordans of the world, and entertainers. Entertainers have become these great icons in our culture. And the Michael Jacksons and the Madanas or whatever. And maybe that's a little bit okay, but what about the people like Desmond Tutu and Aung San Suu Kyi and Dalai Lama and Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi? These are, from Buddhist point of view, all those people are bodhisattvas. And they're inspiring people. And why aren't they more in the limelight? Why don't they get as much attention and much inspiration in our culture as the people who make $2 million because they can make more basket shots than I can. So the ideal. So the ideal is one of service, of being of help to other people. But it's not only that. It's just simply because it's not only that because it's not an ideal which creates separations, about separations. So it's as much about the suffering that goes on in here as it is the suffering that goes on out there. But it's not something that meets suffering wherever it is. And in a sense, I believe that the traditional arahat ideal of Buddhism and the bodhisattva ideal are really not that separate. And that if you don't live in the world of Buddhist mythology, they're inseparable from each other. That the bodhisattva ideal, the real distinction between a bodhisattva and nahrhat in classic Buddhist teachings, in order to allow for the difference, you have to believe in an innumerable number of lifetimes and the mythology of the many lifetimes. And maybe that's fine. I'm not going to debunk that or say that's not where it's at. But the traditional difference between the arahat and the bodhisattva is dependent on having that belief system in place. And if you're not so concerned about that being a central thing in how you can orient your life, then the difference between the arahat and the bodhisattva disappears, I say entirely. And the arahat is as altruistic as a bodhisattva. But the bodhisattva, we say it more explicitly in the bodhisattva ideal. And what's said more explicitly is that the bodhisattva is really of service to the world around him or her. And I think it's natural that anybody who begins waking up, begins sending me a sense that we're participating in this whole show together, that there is no inherent separation between my suffering and your suffering, my joy and your joy, that we meet the joys and the suffering as it is in the world and we respond to it. So, you know, if our dedication is to free the world of suffering and to help the world wake up, you know, you do your own homework, say, and you've managed to free yourself of suffering, you know, great. But then you're sensitive. And what you're sensitive to, you're sensitive to a tremendous amount of suffering in the world around us. And, well, the practice is the same. You've dedicated yourself to practice. So, practice is forever. Because even, say, you've managed to clean your own act up, there's a lot more cleaning up out there that needs to happen. So, we say that in the Bharti Sattva ideal, we make explicit the idea that practice is forever. It isn't something that you kind of reach an end and then it's done. The Arahata ideal, it kind of looks more like, oh, you've come to an end and that's done. And they say in the Arahata ideal, done is what had to be done. So you can, you know, go to Florida and go on vacation, you know. You know what had to be done. But what had to be done is, what's done is all the separation, all the barriers. And then once that's done, what's left, all that possibly could be left is to be of service, is to be of help. And to be a Bharti Sattva. I think all Arahats are Bharti Sattvas. I can't imagine it can be any other way. So the ideal of Bharti Sattva is someone whose practice is not simply oriented just for themselves and for their own well-being. And for me personally, I feel like I'm on the Bharti Sattva path. That's my ideal that I've kind of oriented my life to. And I've taken Bharti Sattva vows in a sense, in the Zen tradition. And it's very interesting to me that most American Vipassana teachers have taken Bharti Sattva vows. And here we're in this, you know, Theravada tradition where usually we don't think that's part of the tradition. And some of them, you know, think that kind of left the tradition to do that. But Bharti Sattva is ideal as part of Theravada tradition as much as anything else. But what it means for me personally is that, I guess, an important meaning for me is that my own particular well-being, my own particular spiritual development and progress and experiences and realization and all that, I'm concerned that that, I don't have to say this exactly, but it's an equal footing with the well-being of other people and the enlightenment, the well-being, the freedom, the spiritual development of others. And so I'm not going to put myself and my own well-being at the forefront of what has to happen. There are times where it's very important, I do put it in the forefront, and I go and retreat and do things, but that it's not the only show in town. And that I'm not going to be preoccupied with holding on to my spiritual development or how I develop myself or my own states of mind at the expense of being able sometimes to be a service and help to other people. And so I'm not going the fast track here to get fully, totally enlightened, because I'm very interested as a bodhisattva in some ways, all of us are in the boat together, and we're all kind of working on this together to become free. So to be a service, to be helpful to other people, to create a space where other people can practice and be introduced to Buddhism is as important for me as my own practice. So there's a tension between the two in a sense, in that it's all too easy to only be of service and get all stressed out and lose any touch with one's own practice and one's well-being and health. And we have to be careful not to go too far. One has to include oneself. We're going to save all beings. You have to include yourself. Otherwise it's dangerous. And what happens is people sometimes who have the bodhisattva vow forget about themselves. And then there are some practitioners who forget about the rest of the world. And where the balance is, everybody has to find for themselves. There's no right balance. There is no right person who's the model of how we're supposed to do this. There are times when it's appropriate to spend many years really focusing just on oneself and one's own spiritual practice. And it's appropriate for many years to forget about oneself and really be of service, a humble servant doing things for other people. And I think it arises out of practice, knowing what you need to do if you're mindful. I spent a lot of time, my first year in the Zen monastery at Tosa Hara, reflecting on my desire or my motivation to be of service in the world, to try to be helpful to other people. And it felt to me that what happened was I didn't trust it. I didn't trust people who wanted to be of service. I thought, well, it's probably self-serving and probably ambitious and it's for their own identity or whatever. Somehow I had some misgivings about it. So I spent a year reflecting about what was my motivation, my attention to live a life that was trying to be of service and helpful to other people. And after a year of reflection, I felt that an exploration of this topic, I felt it was possible to have a motivation to be of service that wasn't self-serving. So that was nice. I was pretty glad to discover that. But then it's one thing to discover that's possible. It's another thing to discover how to do it. But practice is forever. For me, the bodhisattva ideal is that practice never stops. Because if you're not practicing for yourself, then you're practicing in a sense for others without any sense of others being different than you. So my buying this guy his cheeseburger, I wasn't being generous when I did that with him. I just did it. And there were a lot more homeless people on University Avenue that day. So I could have just kept going down the street and feeding these people. I didn't. But you get a sentence forever. It doesn't stop. There's no end to a spiritual practice. It might get easier. It might be easier to buy people their sandwiches or whatever. But it doesn't stop. It just means there's more people. The world is five billion people now. And how many more minutes do you have in your life? It's forever. So we can relax. Some people have pointed out the bodhisattva ideal traditionally is an ideal which is supposed to take three innumerable kalpas to fulfill. And a kalpa is how much time it takes if a bird flew by a granite block that was one mile cube. One mile by one mile by one mile. And once every hundred years this bird flew by and brushed its feather against this cube. A kalpa is how long it takes for that cube to wear down to nothing. So there's three innumerable of these. Not just one of these. So a very long time is a kalpa. So three of these innumerable numbers of these is how long it takes for a bodhisattva to become a Buddha. Because that's what the goal is for a bodhisattva is to finally become a Buddha. Yes? It's long within another universe. So it's pretty long. But one of the ideas that people have, mostly scholars, is that to put the context of your spiritual path in such a huge cosmological frame means that you can relax about your own efforts and where you're going and what you're going to attain. But you don't want to relax so much that you put it off either. Which is what some Buddhists have done. Well, it doesn't really matter why you do this lifetime. Next lifetime I'll get on with it. And so it becomes an excuse not to practice. And you don't want to do that either. But you don't want to also get caught up in the great significance of anything. Where you're going and what you're attaining. You relax. You do the best you can. You practice the best you can. You miss honestly and sincerely as you can. And you trust everything else. You trust the universe. So the bodhisattva ideal is one to be of service and to include other people as part of our practice. So that our practice is not insulated. And I think there's a lot of wisdom to this. Morris Friedman said, we cannot find reality simply by remaining with ourselves or making ourselves the goal. Paradoxically we only know ourselves when we know ourselves responding to others. And I think there's a lot of wisdom to the bodhisattva ideal in the sense that we are simply not independent individuals. And so if you're trying to liberate yourself as an independent individual or make yourself better as an independent individual, it's hopeless. And you only really find, I don't know if you find yourself, but you only really find reality. Not necessarily only in service. It isn't like you have to go out and join a soup kitchen. But you only find reality in our interdependent existence. If you don't sense and feel an interdependent existence, you don't find even yourself. So that's why Sylvia Borstein, she says, it's a lot easier to dedicate your life to the liberation of all beings. Than it is to liberate yourself. Because you don't exist. To liberate something that doesn't exist is a lot more difficult than liberate all these other beings. So rather than thinking that the bodhisattva ideal is just a huge exhausting task, it's actually maybe the only thing we can do. And there's this scripture that I'm studying from a dissertation, which is one of the earliest Buddhist sutras on the bodhisattva path. Someone says, isn't this bodhisattva path really difficult? It's three innumerable kalpas and it's all the suffering and you're still doing all this. And the Buddha says, anybody who has a notion of difficulty is not a bodhisattva. That if you think that you're engaged in difficult practice or difficult activity, then you've gotten caught up in aboutness, in objectifying the situation. And there's no difficulty in being, you know, it's just what's happening. And we're back at the actual. What is the actual? What is our relationship to the actual? So the bodhisattva path, one of the important elements of it, in the kind of usual formulation of it, is something that's called the bodhisattva vow, the idea of a vow. And that's something which is very little part of the vipassana scene, talking about vows, partly, I guess, because we focus so much on the actual rather than the ideal. But even in vipassana there are vows that sometimes get, or resolves, that are part of the practice. Usually a teacher knows the right time to suggest it, the resolves. But the bodhisattva vow is an idea of a vow. As I understand it, the wholesome part of it. I've seen lots of people meet themselves up and suffer a lot because of vows. But the idea of a vow is to have some sense of who we are, some possibility of what's possible for us ourselves, some possibility of awakening, of interconnectedness, of being of service, or whatever. Really feeling this, maybe having a taste of this, a real intimate sense of this. This is who I am. And then a vow is a kind of a commitment, a stated commitment to oneself, that this is what I'm going to really make my life about. And there's a power to commitment, there's a power to vow that's a lot different than not vowing. And just like there's a power to knowing there's an ideal, to knowing we have a potential, there's a different kind of power available to us than if we don't know that potential, don't know that possibility. And so if we never are told about that possibility, we might always stay where we're at right now and really never develop that possibility. So the vow is to recognize there's a possibility potential and to have a stated commitment. This is, maybe even publicly, this is what I'm going to base my life on and what I'm going to orient my life on. Not to be goal-oriented, not to be striving, not because this present moment isn't pulled the way it is, but this is a beautiful ideal. This is who I really am. This is who I really want to be. Or this is, I think, more like a, this is who I am actually. And I vow to live my life most fully from what I know is most true about myself and my interrelated interactive reality that I live in. And so the bodhisattva vow, the bodhisattva lives on that vow. And so by stating it, it's like stating the precepts, you know, we take the precepts, we take refuge. It's acknowledging what's already here and what's already true for us, but it makes it so much stronger for us by having done it, by doing this ritual, by doing this kind of thing. So the vow of bodhisattva is a vow, is a very important part of the bodhisattva path, is to actually recognize most clearly for oneself what it is most important for oneself, what the deepest intention is for oneself. And then state it for oneself, you know, this is my vow. I vow to live a life dedicated towards awakening. I vow to live a life dedicated to the awakening of all beings. So the bodhisattva vow is very ancient. Each bodhisattva is supposed to make their own, but there is a formulaic one, which is quite ancient, which is the way I know it, the translation I know best is the way they say it at the Zen Center. Beings are numberless. I vow to save them all or liberate them all. Delusions are inexhaustible. I vow to end them all. Dharma gates are boundless. I vow to enter them all. And the Buddha's way is unsurpassable. I vow to enter it. And then there's a Zen teacher, I wanted to mention his name, but there's a Zen teacher whose favorite song is or was, maybe it's Frank Sinatra who sang it, The Impossible Dream, because he felt that it represented the bodhisattva ideal. It's impossible. It's impossible to save all beings. But you relax and you do the best you can. So that's something, you know, it's an important part of my life, this ideal, and it's something that, you know, that explains a little bit the decisions I make at times for myself. I don't, the quality of my mind and my concentration and my heart could be a lot better than it is. You know, it could be more calm, more subtle, have more equanimity. If I went off and said endless retreats, but somehow that doesn't seem like what's important and where it's at. And so there's a sacrifice in a sense. I don't want to call it, that's not the right word. I didn't sacrifice, you know, my dollar seventy for this guy's burger the other day. But that doesn't seem as important to me. It's important to have equanimity and have this, you know, settled mind. But that's not as important as it is to kind of help, you know, try to be helpful so other people can practice and have contact with the dharma and practice and awakening. And so I sacrifice in some sense my own well-being at times for all this. But hopefully not too much, because if I have to sacrifice too much then I can't be very helpful. So, you know, we all do it together, we practice together. The bodhisattva path, the ideal. And I think, you know, you don't have to, you know, whatever you think of this, I think it comes naturally from just doing practice itself. And I have a tremendous trust in the power of mindfulness practice, just in and of itself. Whatever needs to happen will happen on its own. You don't have to be caught up and worry about ideals and doing anything else but being mindful in the way that's appropriate for you at this particular stage of your life. So, maybe that's enough? Yes? Why isn't the Buddha, why doesn't he continue to be born if he has so much compassion for suffering at all? Why doesn't he want to come alive? Because he's dead. Control of the inclination. I don't know. I mean, I can tell, I can give you the doctrinal answers to all those questions. But that's just dogma, I don't know. I think it's mostly just mythology. And even the place where that question is coming from is mythology. I mean, there's a lot of presuppositions behind even being able to ask a question like that. So, look at those presuppositions. The nature of a Buddha, the nature of rebirth, the nature of, you know, all kinds of things. So, in order to liberate properly the custodian, we should also think of getting out of here at five. The well-being of all beings. So, those of you who maybe came late, there's two dana baskets up there. One is for the rent. We hope that it's a donation, so if you don't have it, it would be nice if everybody contributed five dollars to pay for the rent of the room. And there's another dana basket for the teacher, and there's Voices of Spirit Rock, if you want to buy a copy. And may the benefit and the merit from this day of practice together be for the benefit of all of you and for the benefit of all beings everywhere, so that all beings may they be happy. Thank you.
