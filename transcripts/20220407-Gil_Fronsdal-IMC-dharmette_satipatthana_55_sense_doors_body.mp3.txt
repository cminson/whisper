There's a delightful for me little teachings in Buddhism that it's possible to become omniscient.
But it's not what maybe you think, that it's possible to know something about everything.
And what is it that omniscience is, is that it's not worth clinging to anything.
So now we know something about everything with a certain kind of omniscience.
So, but kind of continuing on this theme of some kind of omniscience.
For our human experience, all human experiences we have, no matter how sophisticated and complex they are,
have a common denominator.
And that is, we know it through one of the six Zen stores.
The ancient analogy from the time of the Buddha was that if you had a walled city with only one gate coming into the city,
then a guard would stand at the gate and could watch everyone coming and going,
and would decide who can come in and who can go out.
If there were six gates, then there might be six guards doing the same thing.
So we have six doors, six gates, which all experiences that we process, that we take in, that we use to understand our life and all that.
And we have six doors, six gates, and that's seeing the gates of the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the tactile body,
and then the mind door, from which we kind of observe or know what's happening in the mind.
And so we take in the data from these, the sense data, the experiences, and then somehow we process it.
We do something with it, and sometimes we build whole universes with it.
There's a Chinese story of a painter, a very realistic painter, who painted very realistic paintings,
and he was up close painting a tiger and involved in the details,
but at some point he stepped back some feet to look at it, and it was so realistic he became frightened and he ran away.
So we ourselves, our mind is constructing stories, ideas, memories, predictions of the future,
meaning, elaborations, ideas, creativity, poems, and songs, and all kinds of things our mind creates.
And we can live in that inner world and get lost in it.
But in Buddhist practice, what we're trying to do is live at the doors.
Be mindful of things as they appear and occur in the present moment at each of the sense doors.
And the reason for that is if you do that, then you know something about everything.
You know the common denominator. Everything that's going to happen is going to be built on those things coming in from those sense doors.
And if you can be there and see at that point what the reactivity is, the clinging, the resistance, how we relate to it,
it gives us a tremendously wonderful vantage point in which to live a wise life,
to not get caught up in the entanglements and reactivity and build universes of tigers that frighten us
because we're just kind of not there at the start, the beginning point.
And in some ways, our life is always beginning over.
And so to bring ourselves into the sense doors and really be present for it, we're there at the start of the life.
It's always starting in the present, starting over again and over again.
And so to be able to get right there and see it.
Now remember that in these teachings that we're doing now in the six sense doors and the entanglement to them,
we're coming near the end of a long series of practices of the Satipatanasuta.
So this is not a beginner's practice.
This is something that we can begin to do when we've gotten quiet and still enough or focused, mindfulness is strong enough,
we can really stay there and see it.
And the advantage of doing so is like this.
We have a garden with garden beds.
And so I'm kind of responsible for it right now because my wife is away.
She's usually the gardener.
And one of the flower beds is overgrown with maybe a foot and a half tall,
mostly oak grass or some kind of tall grass and all kinds of other weeds.
And it's packed in the flower bed.
All these must be very fertile, the bed, because it's just kind of bursting forth and overwhelming,
you know, how thick it's full of weeds.
We have another bed where there's some onions and some lettuces and things.
And there, there is not so much.
There's almost no weeds at all.
The lettuce and the onions are growing nicely and there's space between them.
And there, if a weed arises, I see a little weed coming up out of the soil and I'm not overwhelmed by that.
I come over and pull it out and it doesn't grow to be a big weed to crowd out what we're trying to grow there.
So, the same thing with our mind.
If we haven't weeded our mind for decades, it can be crowded and overgrown with all kinds of weeds.
And it takes a while to relax and settle and calm down to the point where we start seeing the beginning of a weed,
the beginning of the entanglement.
And if we see at the beginning of it first arising, then we can let go of it.
We can pull it out by the roots and put it in the compost pile.
And so, this is part of, as practice deepens and we have the ability to be much more present and we trust being present,
more than we trust the thinking and predicting and planning and remembering and reviewing and having conversations or having fantasies.
We trust being in the present moment.
Things become clear enough.
Our flower beds become clear enough.
We see the beginning of a weed arising, a beginning of a reaction, a reactivity arising.
And that is a powerful place to be.
Because if you see it arise, then it's easy to let go of it or not participate or let it be.
And it's possible to let it be and let it go and not see it.
No, you're not going to pick it up again.
And this is the instructions for this particular part of the Satipatana Sutta.
It is to know the sense store, know, like today we're talking about the body, know the tactile body,
know the sensations of it, the touch, the object of the tactile experience,
know the arising of an entanglement, know letting it go and know that you're not going to pick it up again.
So that's really the exercise of this point, the part of the Satipatana Sutta,
is to be able to be present for the sense experience and to see the beginning of attachment,
the beginning of clinging, reactivity, and to be able to put it down.
If you can't put it down, it's powerful just to let it be.
Don't pick it up. Don't get involved.
And then know you're not going to get involved again, you know, at least this time around.
And this keeps us in this beautiful, wonderful place of freedom.
It keeps us in this place where maybe we're kind of amused or delighted or relieved
when we see an attachment arise, a clinging and entanglement arise.
Because we know we're not going to get entangled to the entanglement.
We're not going to react to the reactivity.
But rather we're going to see the beauty, the wonderfulness of being aware of its arising.
There it is. And it can be, for some people, kind of amusing, kind of delightful, kind of faith.
It can give birth to a lot of faith and confidence.
That, oh, here I got, here I got, I'm starting to get annoyed.
I'm starting to be frustrated or, and there it is.
Here's me wanting it to be different.
Here's me wanting it to stay forever.
Here's that little clinging going on.
And we say, oh, wow, there's the clinging.
And there's kind of just joy in knowing we're not going to get involved
and knowing that there's freedom and space around it.
It's a very different relationship to clinging and reactivity than, oh, no, this is terrible.
I shouldn't be doing this.
So the sent stores.
And so today we talked about, I talked about the tactile sent store of things touching our body.
And that can be physical things outside, things outside, but also from the inside out.
There's kind of sensate experience the body can reveal.
So today I would encourage you to spend more time with mindfulness of your body
and discover both the delight of being grounded in your body, maybe.
But more importantly for this exercise today, look and see how you're entangled,
judgments, expectations, disappointments with the body, how you compare your body to other bodies,
or how you were before, how you might be in the future, all the ways you get entangled.
And see if you can notice the entanglement with such clarity that maybe you're delighted or amused,
or maybe you're relieved that you see it.
See if you can find a different way of relating to the bad news of being reactive and entangled,
where mindfulness, clear mindfulness brings a different way of relating.
Mindfulness of the body.
It's a way of becoming friends with your body when you stop the reactivity.
And then tomorrow we'll do the last talk on these sent stores and having to do with the sent store of the mind.
Thank you.
