Sound okay in the back?
So a few reflections on perfectionism,
failure,
and loving kindness.
It's a lot for 15 minutes, but...
So on the one hand, there are very
high aspirations for this path
and grand language around
enlightenment and the
potentials of freedom, and in fact we even have
the ten perfections, right?
But this is not a
perfectionistic path
and failure is
important, actually. So
manifestations of perfectionism,
in our normal kind of
nonmeditation practice lives
shows up in lots of different ways of
exceedingly high demands
we place on ourself for harshness in relation to ourself
or kind of a
ruthless discipline.
And, you know, in this way
this kind of perfectionistic style
we're sort of perpetually
fending off failure
and disappointment.
And this mind pattern
shows up a lot in our spiritual practice, right?
We leave our habits at the door once we walk into
IMC, right? It's like, no, how we
practice meditation is how we do the rest of our life, right?
And so the opportunity with meditation
practice is that we actually
can see how we do
everything. And so in the realm of
meditation the perfectionism usually shows up
I see it most in
myself and others as a kind of
a real, an intense striving
and
a lot of evaluation, like a constant
sort of form of evaluation of checking in on progress
of spiritual materialism
and sort of benchmarking where we are
the perfectionism makes us
invariably, like, leads us to compare ourself
not just in relation to other
ideals but to other practitioners too.
And so
we look for the habit of
perfectionism and self-harshness.
We look for it and sometimes
it's such a foundational
habit in the mind that
we don't even see it. It blends into
the world. The view
blends into the world. And so it's like we have to see
some of our deep habits in our peripheral vision.
And I know
in seeing some of the ways that I can be
harsh with myself it's like it only
there are just these short windows
of opportunity when I can have a clear view of it. Most of the time
it sort of just feels like
the way things are and the way things should be.
And then there it's punctuated by these glimpses into
a habit that's really had a pretty
fundamental impact on my life.
So we can
notice the ways in which perfectionism tucks us
deeper into the corner of our minds
and is a cause
of some sense of separation.
This path is a path,
maybe we could say a path of connection, a path into deeper
connection with ourself, deeper connection with
the human condition. And the
habits around perfectionism
and the
harshness that is a part of that
is one of separation and distance.
So
part of the
antidote actually is welcoming
practicing failing,
which does not
sound like good advice, but
this is Norman Fisher
who said this
it's hard being a human being.
There's a lot to it, there really is.
Let's all agree to accept the reality
that we're not going to be able to do a very good job of this.
There's too much to do.
Isn't it a relief to know that it's not all going to work out?
And you can just forget about that part to start with.
You're not going to get it right, you're not going to get it perfect.
Well, don't worry, just remember that there's no hope.
The important thing, the important thing is,
despite this and recognizing and embracing this reality,
don't worry about finishing the job or doing it perfectly.
But start, you see?
Start and continue. This is the thing.
You can really trust that if you will start and if you will continue
with commitment, that will be enough.
And so we can
we can give up on our
spiritual life
looking all polished
and, you know,
buttoned up and
having no loose ends.
And this is a real
real relief.
We are learning, of course, to make progress, to train ourselves
to become more and more free.
But it's indispensable in this process
is the experience of failing, of failing well
of beginning again.
Beckett says
ever tried, ever failed, no matter
try again, fail again, fail better.
We're
if we're not comfortable with
failing, quote failing, we
won't continue practicing.
Or the way in which we'll practice
will be distorted
by our insistence on success.
There's a story
I heard from
Michelle McDonald, a
Vipassana teacher, a lovely teacher,
and she has real strong
connections with Burma and teaches there
and has practiced a lot there. And there's one
retreat, a cook, who would cook on
the retreats where she would practice and teach.
And she told this story of being so
moved by the
generosity and spirit of this cook, and
touched by the dignity
and care with which he served, and having a
really strong impulse to do something nice for him.
And she learned that he needed some kind of
musical equipment. And I don't remember
whether it was an amplifier,
speaker system, something. So anyway, she does
all this research and figures out what's
going to be the right thing, just the thing that he needs.
And as an expression of her
appreciation of his service. And so she buys it,
I think, in the States and carries it
with her flying to Burma.
And she gets it and is really
delighted by the idea of giving
this gift to the cook.
And it turns out she got the wrong thing.
It was the wrong whatever.
And so,
she really
feels badly and sorrow about
doing the wrong thing. And
she wants to explain this to him. And I know this isn't
right. And I think she presents it
and is explaining that I know this was the wrong
thing. And his response to her was
Michelle,
it's such a good mistake.
And
I come back to that line often.
And even the tone I can hear in her
voice, Michelle, it's such a good mistake.
So we're
moving from a model of
an accomplishment and
success into a model of learning from life.
Of being open to what's
being offered to us.
And one of the ways that
we soften in relation to
failure
is meta.
Failure in some sense is just, we're just
touching into the first noble truth.
We just touch that very tenderly.
And
we
can sense something,
something very innocent
about our being.
Something before
success and failures or something beneath
success and failure.
We can actually use our life
and the
stumbles and failures as a way of
softening the heart and of actually reconnecting
with something like innocence.
Once, for New Year's Eve, you know how people
make resolutions, and this is some years ago, but
my resolution was
manifest failure and rejection.
And that was actually
my goal that year.
And I did pretty good.
And of course, the goal
was because I don't want to
have my heart impinged and
because I'm so concerned about failing
and looking stupid, whatever my
mind says. And so it's like we take
these gradual doses, like digestible
doses of, quote, failure
as a way of becoming more free.
And the practice will give us
ample opportunities.
So...
Yeah, maybe we all
fail well.
Okay, thanks.
