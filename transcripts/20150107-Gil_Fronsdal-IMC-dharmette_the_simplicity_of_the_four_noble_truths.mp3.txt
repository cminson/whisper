Dharmette: The Simplicity of the Four 
Noble Truths  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on January 7, 2015  
 
 
It is the custom at IMC that the first talks of the year are 
on the Four Noble Truths. One of the reasons why this 
is a custom is that it seems the new year is a time to 
prepare for the coming year , and to set our sights on 
what is central in our lives. There is something very 
meaningful about the Four Noble Truths as the central 
teachings of Buddhism.  
 
Some people prefer not to have the Four Noble Truths 
because it begins with suffering, and that’s a drag. They 
think i t’s better  not to admit there’s suffering and  better 
to focus on the good things – to celebrate, have joy, go 
dancing.  But not a few people have spent years, or 
maybe lifetimes, cleverly  – or not so cleverly  – avoiding 
their suffering. Sooner or later, this is seen as a dead 
end. At some point, part of growing up is to learn to stop 
and see , “Oh! This is suffering.” We stop in such a way 
that we are not reactive to it, not caught in it, not 
pushing it, not troubled by it. The idea of not being 
troubled by trouble, not being troubled by suffering is a 
phenomenally wonderful thing.  It does no t mean we are condoning it or, as good Buddhists,  suffering  better. It is 
meant to be the beginning of healing. The beginning  of 
the freedom from suffering. That is really the whole 
enterprise of Buddhism : not to be left with suffering , but 
to have suffering leave. We begin by having a ver y 
simple relationship to suffering, learn ing to be with it, not 
trying to escape it, fix it, attack it , or make big cosmic 
conclusions about yourself or the world because of it.  
Just very simple. That is the First Noble T ruth. The truth 
of suffering.  
 
The Second Noble Truth is the cause of suffering. That 
is usually how it is interpreted. That is a powerful 
interpretation because if there is a cause to suffering , 
then we can consider whether it is possible to address 
that cause. If there is no cause to our  suffering , then we 
just have to go along for the ride.  Then we are just 
suffering because….  there is no b ecause. We are just 
suffering. You might as well just accommodate the 
suffering, or pray and hope it goes away. If there is a 
cause , then we can do something about the cause. The 
cause of suffering that Buddhi sm emphasize s is 
psychological. In saying that our suffering has a 
psychol ogical cause, some people say , “Wait a minute! 
It’s all in me? People are doing terrible things to me , 
and treating me terribly. That’s why I’m suffering.” It is 
true they may be  doing that . But it is helpful that the 
definition of suffering in the Four Noble Truths is the 
suffering that arises because of  the psychological cause. If someone insults you or offends you in some 
way, it is painful. In addition to the pain, there might be 
suffering, or something that happens inside of you 
based on your psychological reaction and response to 
the insult.  
 
So, the First Noble Truth is the suffering that arises 
because o f your psychological response.  That is the 
place where we can do the most. That is where w e have 
the most responsibility , and where we can make a 
difference. You may or may not be able to stop 
someone from offending you. Hopefully you will have 
the w isdom to know how and when  to do that . But you 
are the only person whom  you really have ultimate 
influence over. To learn how to be present , and to look 
for the cause within yourself is part of the enterprise of 
the Four Noble Truths.  
 
The good news of Bu ddhism is the Third Noble Truth.  
Initially, u ntil we get into it more deeply, the wording  
appear s rather unfortunate . It only says , “the cessation 
of suffering. ” Some people think it i s not good enough 
just to end suffering. They think they should be , or they 
want to be filled  with delight, joy and happiness. 
Freedom from suffering might seem neutral. They think , 
“These Buddhist don’t have v ery high standard”  
[laughs ]. But this is reall y the good news , and is meant 
to be shorthand, I think, for mahāsukha  – great 
happiness.   
The Fourth Noble Truth is a path of practice, a series of 
things you can do that help create the conditions for 
mahāsukha , the conditions for the end of suffering. T his 
set of conditions is also an ar ea of personal 
responsibility. We have to walk the path.  There is no 
path of practice unless we walk it. We are given these 
eight  different  areas of life where we can start taking 
some responsib ility, and that we can enga ge with – and 
not just wait ing for freedom from suffering to happen on 
its own.  We have to do our part, our work, which is the 
Eightfold Path.  
 
One of the really remarkable things about this 
formulation is that it is at the hear t of Buddhist teaching. 
If we see Buddhism as a religion, it is the core principle 
and teaching of the tradition. It is free of the 
supernatural, free of metaphysics, free of complicated 
abstract philosophy, free of beliefs that you have to 
accept on fai th. It is free of things that may give rise to 
doubt metaphysically, spiritually, or supernaturally. So 
what is this? It is almost non-religious; or maybe it is 
non-religious. It is so basic.  If you suffer, there is a 
cause. It is possi ble to bring that to a n end. T here is a 
way to work  on that. I think it is quite remarkable that 
something that simple lies at the heart of this Buddhist 
tradition. One of the beautiful things it does is free us 
from B uddhism, which I will mention more.   
 I think of the Four No ble Truths as a framework or 
perspective that is portable , and useful in many, many 
different settings. It is meant to cut through the 
complications of many things, so we can get to the core 
and the si mple way to end the suffering. If you are 
suffering in some way , and you are asked , “Why are 
you suffering?” and you respond , “Well, in my religion of 
upbringing , there is a belief about X, Y and Z, and I’m 
not living up to X, Y and Z, although  it says  I should  in 
the great scriptures of my religion.”  It gets complicated 
very quickly : going back through the scriptures , 
speak ing with the religious leaders, or thinking that you 
have to change the scriptures in order to be happy. It 
gets complic ated, and we continue to suffer. Or , 
perhaps we are suffering and  rather than being 
religious, we are Freudian. We start going to a Freudian 
analyst,  and reviewing our childhood  –for years!  – trying 
to understand all the dynamics of what happened . 
Sometimes can  certain ly be very useful to do that.  But it 
can be very expen sive!!  [Gil and listeners laugh .] The 
idea is the Four Noble Truths are meant to be much 
simpler , much more direct. Ideally, this teaching  goes 
right to the heart of where we can make the most 
difference – if we can really see it through to the  end. It 
is applicable in so many different areas.  
 
Here is an analogy that I love for the Four Noble Truths.  
You go to the savannas of Africa as a wildlife 
photographer , and you want to take  pictures of lots of wildlife. You could just wander around the plains looki ng 
for animals to photograph. That’s one w ay, for sure.  But 
another way would be to set yourself up with your 
camera at a watering hole. Sooner or later, all of the 
animals hav e to come to the watering hole , and y ou can 
easily get pictures that way.  In the same way, s ooner or 
later, every important issue in your life will come visit 
you if you sit at the watering hole of suffering. If you are 
paying attention to your suffering, everythin g you really 
need to  know will appear  – if you study that suffering 
and ask yourself , “What is really going on inside of me 
when I am suffering?  What is my contribution to it?”   
 
The condition  that Buddhism is most concerned with, 
and the one it points to most as  what will help you 
become free,  is what is called thirst. Thirst is a certain 
kind of compulsion or driven -ness.  If you are operating 
under com pulsion , then you can’t be free.  This is part of 
the reason that suffering is suffering : because there is 
no freed om in it. You are stuck in it. It is claustrophobic. 
That thirst is a particular kind of desire , which is 
compulsive. Some people like to translate the wor d not 
as thirst , but as craving. What kind of desire are you 
caught in that leads to that suffering ?  
 
Here we are not looking at metaphysics, nor at 
complicat ed spirituality, nor at some great idea of 
cosmic truth.  We are looking at something  very simple 
and psychological : “Oh!! I’m attached to something. I’m caught in something.” If you can stop justifying the value 
of being caught – and some people are  brilliant at 
justifying why it i s important to stay caught in the desire  
and be attached  to it – if you can let go of it, then you 
experience the release, t he freedom from that caught -
ness. You experience the release from  the suffering that 
came out of that caug ht-ness. That freedom creates 
space in the heart, space in the mind for ease, for 
peace, for happiness, for well -being, for being able to 
meet the next situation in a fresh way. It is not a sma ll 
thing to end our compulsion.  
 
It is not a small thing to put down how we are caught b y 
desires of any and all kinds.  We do not have to give up 
desires , but we do have  to give up being caught in 
desires. To not have the suffering that follows in the 
wake of being caught by desires is a phenomenal thing 
to experience. When it is done thoroughly and 
completely, it is maybe *the* greatest happiness  – the 
greatest sense of wellbeing a person can ever 
experience. It comes wit h a lot of benefits , one of which 
is that you become a p erson who is a gift to others  – 
because then you have a heart that is open , a heart that 
is connected. You have no barrier between an open, 
loving or compassionate heart and the world around 
you.  
 
On the simplici ty of the Four Noble Truths , there is a 
Chinese story  of someone  – perhaps  the governor of a province, or someone who thought highly of  himself  – 
who asked  a monk , “What is the core teaching of 
Buddhism?”  The monk replied , “The Four Noble Trut hs.” 
The governor said , “Even a child of six kn ows that!”  The 
monk said , “Yes.  But even a man of ninety doesn’t 
necessarily know how to practice it.”   
 
It is a very simple thing , but it is the support, the heart, 
the key that keeps Buddhism simple, direct and relevant 
in so many different situation s, without extra 
complications. It also frees us from Buddhism , because 
as soon as you get attached to Buddhism , you are 
suffering. If you get attached to your practice, you are 
suffering. If you get attached to the results of your 
practice, you are suffering. So, if you are always ready 
to look : “Oh! Where are the Four Noble Truths in this 
situation?” – then you’ll  see “Oh!  I’m suffering. I’m tense 
because of how I relate to Buddhism. What’s the cause 
of that? Well,  I’m attached! Might as well let go.”  
 
Don’t let go of the practice , but let go of the attachment. 
The Four Noble Truths will protect you from Buddhism.  
May you  be well protected ! [Listeners laugh .] Thank you 
all.
