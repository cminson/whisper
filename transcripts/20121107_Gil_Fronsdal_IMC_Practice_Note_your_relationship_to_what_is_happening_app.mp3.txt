Practice Note: Your Relationship to 
What Is Happening

I want to say a couple of words about the practice of 
mindfulness that may  be meaningful today . There is one 
area of mindfulness that’s particularly significant  and 
useful , both as an area to be mindful of , and also as a 
great protection for you and for the practice . It is 
sometimes a direct route  to be ing calmer, more 
equanimous, a little freer from what’s going on,  and to 
know where the really important area of practice is . That 
area of mindfulness  has to do with our relationship  to 
what’s happening.  
 
I like to say  that there are always two things happening 
in any moment: there’s what’s happening , and there’s 
our relationship to what’s happening . This applies to 
everything. I f there’s a loud noise outside when you are 
meditating, there’s the noise , and your relationship to 
the noise. It might be that your relationship is no 
relationship because you know it’s happening , and 
there’s no  react ion of any kind . Or, it could be that you 
relate to the noise  as a wonderful, pleasant sound . “I 
wish I could record it , and bring it home with me . I really like that car sound .” And you spend time planning how 
to have more of it. Or , perhaps you have aversion to it 
because it interferes with your  practice . You relate to 
your practice as  if you are holding onto it for dear life. Or 
you have so much ambition about being the next great 
Buddha , that in this sitting , you have to protect your 
practice so that you can get enlightened  – but the car 
traffic is interfering with your wonderful, spiritual task . 
So you have aversion to the car traffic , because it’s 
interfering with being free .  
 
Something is going on with your breathing . Something 
is going on with the walking meditation . Something is 
going on all  the time  with all kinds of things . You do 
walking meditation , and you notice the hot water 
machine , and you have a relationship to that: “I want 
more tea ,” or “I wish they serve d coffee here .” 
 
In almost every situation we’re in , we can have some 
simple  – or not so simple  – relationship to what’s going 
on. When we’re practicing mindfulness , there’s often the  
instruction  to pay attention to something , such as your 
breath . But paying attention to your relationship is not 
noticed . However,  if you step back , you might ask, “How 
am I relating to the practice? How am I relating to my  
breathing at this point? ” Then you might notice that 
you’re doing extra thing s. There might be judgments, 
reactions, expectations, demands, hesitations, 
resistances . All kinds of things  might be  going on in th e field we call the relationship to what’s happening . Some 
people find it very effective to turn around , and notice – 
in a simple , ordinary, almost permissive  way: “How am I 
relating to what’s happening now? ” 
 
This might be an interesting area to explore as you do 
your sitting  and walking practice here this morning.
