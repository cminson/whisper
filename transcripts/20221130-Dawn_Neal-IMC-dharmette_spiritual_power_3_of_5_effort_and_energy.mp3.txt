 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good morning again, Sangha. I see some notes about refreshing YouTube in the chat. I just want to mention that we are broadcasting via Zoom. That may have a little bit to do with it. Thank you for your patience with the technology that brings us together and sometimes causes little glitches. These are all recorded. They will be uploaded, most of them will be uploaded on Thursday, I think. They are available on YouTube, they will be available on audioderma.org as well. So, Sangha, the topic for today is balanced effort, energy, perseverance. So, just a brief recap. Effort or energy is one of the key components of these bases of spiritual power, of meditative prowess that the Buddha practiced before his awakening. And each basis has kind of a tripod of qualities in it. One is Samadhi, what I've been calling immersion or collection, sometimes known as concentration or stability. Padhana, engagement, and in this case, Virya, effort. So, three main points this morning. First, Virya, effort or energy, has a range of intensity. Second, it's helpful to balance, adapt that energy, that effort throughout practice and for that matter, throughout any activity. And third, there's one kind of effort so important to the teaching that it's sometimes taught by the Buddha as a fifth basis, and that is perseverance or persistence. So, Virya, effort is a continuum that's reflected in different translations of it, depending on the context. So, just want to invite you to feel in your body how these feel, these words feel, these different nuances of interpretation. And maybe notice any associations that come up with this word cloud. Heroic effort, heroic energy, strength, courageous effort, vigor, perseverance, balanced effort, continuous engagement, gentle persistence, light touch, and receiving or allowing. So, feeling those in your body, feeling those in your mind, your heart. And no one is better than the other at different times in meditation practice. Each one of them has an appropriate place, a helpful place. The key is to take an adaptive approach, fluid, flexible, to how effort and energy come up in this practice. The Buddha likened this process to tuning a stringed instrument, like a lute, as the example used in the ancient Indian texts, but these days it might be more like tuning a guitar or violin or banjo. It's worth noting that with these stringed instruments, changes in the weather will change how the tuning needs to happen, the appropriate amount of turning required to get a good pressure. The same is true for different meditation conditions, which are kind of like the weather, right? There's a tuning or attuning to the appropriate amount of energy that's a little bit different each time we sit down to meditate and throughout the course of a meditation. There's also, in the course of a meditation, maybe different phases for many of us. It can be like running or riding a bike on a hill, courageous effort, vigorous effort is required to get moving. And on the flat, once pedaling has gotten some momentum, it's okay to coast. And then downhill, you can just enjoy the momentum, speeding right along. Pedaling gets easier, lighter and lighter touch, sometimes hands off completely just to allow the flow to happen. And this relates to the engagement, patana. You might want to be lightly touching the handlebars, keeping tabs on where we're going. Maybe the brake to moderate the speed and enjoying the immersion, the intentness, the samadhi, that flow. So that's one similar example of how various energy effort can work with these two complementary qualities. Another important way of adapting energy and effort is to notice what's being cultivated with it. And this goes back to what we talked about yesterday, which is noticing kusala or akusala, skillful or unskillful application of effort. The Buddha talks about this in a teaching called the Four Great Efforts, which I'm just very briefly going to mention. They're called wise exertions, wise engagements or padanas, that same word. In brief, it's to prevent the unskillful arising in the mind and heart, to abandon it if it's arisen, to cultivate what's good and skillful and then to maintain that. Those are the four. Sometimes this involves backing off for tangled up in aversion or frustration, gritting of the teeth, furrowing of the brow, that kind of thing. Other times it can be a total act of courageous effort to place the attention where it's useful and move it off of where it's not useful. So it's a range, right? Finally, one kind of effort is so important to this teaching on spiritual power that it's sometimes taught as a fifth basis. And that is the Pali is Usulhi, U-S-S-O-L with a dot under it, H-I. And this translates in many ways, sometimes even as enthusiasm or vigor, but the translation I like the best is perseverance, persistence. It's this staying with the meditation practice over the long haul, keeping coming back, staying engaged, not too caught up in outcomes. It's like keeping on, keeping on in a long journey. This kind of perseverance, persistence is just vital to successful, powerful meditation practice over the long haul. And the Buddha talks about it in different ways, in different teachings, but it's that stick-to-it-iveness. But you know, any one given meditation session might be beautiful or not, but it's the accumulation, all of these sessions over days or months, even years or decades that add up. So effort energy is central to this teaching on the spiritual power and so much so that each that the overall basis of success contain these three related concepts, Varya, effort or energy, Padanha, the wholehearted engagement. And sometimes this special shout out to persistence, perseverance. So it's kind of layered in there in three different ways. So I want to encourage you to pay a special attention this week to the tuning of effort, the adaptation of energy and what the purpose is that you apply effort or exertion for. So in the next 24 hours, you might notice what kind of effort, energy, engagement are helpful in your activities or your meditation. You might jot down notes, talk with a friend and explore, explore how it goes. So thank you. Thank you all for your attention. Thank you for your practice and look forward to being back with the YouTube online Sangha tomorrow.
