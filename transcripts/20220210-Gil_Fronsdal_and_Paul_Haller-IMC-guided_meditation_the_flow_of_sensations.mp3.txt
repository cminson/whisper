 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and welcome. And maybe for some of you who have been doing this regularly, you feel much like I do, kind of happy and contented to sit down here and spend our time in our meditation posture and doing the practice, exploring the teachings. Thank you. So, I've had a little unusual for me, a little experience with my car. I have a car that I can unlock the car by touching the door handle. It has an electric sensor there. But it relies on the fob, the electric key that I keep in my pocket. If that key is in my pocket, then if I touch the door handle, the car unlocks. But occasionally it's happened that I have not had my fob, my electric key, with me. Not knowing, thinking that I had it with me. And I reach for the touch to slide my hand on the handle and nothing happens. No response at all. And it's a very strange feeling, this kind of feeling the inertness of the car, the non-responsiveness, just metal. And it's inanimate, it's unresponsive. And just to feel the kind of the non-responsivity of the door handle, the car, it really highlights for me the sense that the car is not alive. The car is not, it's just a piece of metal that's sitting there. And so we have sensations in our body. And all those sensations are evidence that we're animated, that we're alive. Every time we have a sensation, whether it's painful or pleasant, whether it's hot or cold, hard or soft, whether things are moving within us, whether we feel a little bit cohesion and how the body is held together. All these sensations of the body are manifestations of our aliveness. And when our body is a corpse, those sensations will not be there. Imagine, if you will, a nice boulder, big boulder that's sitting in a river. And middle of the day, the sun is out, beautiful blue sky and warm sun and nice cool river. And the river just flows along the sides of the boulder, just on both sides. And the boulder has no idea of the fluidity and the flow, the caress of the water. It has no idea, no feeling of the temperature of the water. It doesn't feel the warmth of the sun. It doesn't know that it's warm. It doesn't feel maybe the weight of it sitting on the riverbed and the contact there and the hardness that's there. All those things are absent. But imagine then yourself sitting in the river. Maybe it's shallow enough you could sit in the river bottom just have the water flow by you. And for you, you would feel the caress, the contact, the touch of the river against your skin. You would feel the temperature of the water. You'd feel the temperature of the air, of the sun coming down. You might feel the movements of maybe there's a gentle breeze coming down that blows over your torso and down the valley where the river is. And you also might feel the hardness of the river bottom in which you're sitting on. And you would have all these sensations that it would be there. So with mindfulness practice, we have the equivalent of our kind of electric key, our fob. And that is that if we bring our mindfulness with us, our attentiveness with us, then we can feel the responsivity of this body of ours to the world that it's in through the sensations that the body has. And some of those sensations are responding to things happening internally and some of them externally. But there are all these sensations of aliveness, of vitality that is there because of this, in a sense, because of the electric functioning of our nervous system, which is turned on for all of us. And that's what the meditation of the next meditation of Satyapatthana is about. And it's meant to be something to really settle into and explore and feel and sense so deeply that you're just aware of the sensations as you sit in the river. And all the sensations are just coming and flowing or being there. And the mind kind of takes in different ones at different times. And the idea of the body as a whole, me, myself, and mine, even the place where we're at, fall away as we just feel the flow of sensations. I'll talk more about that later. But for now, assuming an upright meditation posture, an upright either literally or figuratively, gently closing your eyes and taking a few long, slow, deep breaths, relaxing as you exhale, softening in the ribs, the chest. If you feel any sense of contraction in the chest as you inhale, a gentle softening as you exhale, including a softening of the shoulders and a softening of the belly. Letting your breathing return to normal, maybe softening the belly some more, softening the hands, the arms. And then opening up your attention so that awareness floats, flows between the various sensations that appear in your body. So you're not choosing any particular one to focus on for a few minutes here. But just let it move, flow, and take in whatever appears and disappears, whatever the mind is on its own, kind of moves into. Perhaps feeling some solidity, sensations of solidity and weight, maybe with the contact of your body against the floor, your chair, cushion. If there is any tension in the body, being content to just know it as tension or as hardness, tightness, and leave it at that, not a problem. Sometimes your attention moves to the temperatures of your body. Some places in your body it might feel warmer than others. Some places cooler. There might be sensations of movement, of the chest, of the belly. The feeling of movement of air in and out through your nostrils. There might be very subtle movements of the whole body. Sensations of tingling and pulsing. Sensations of weight, heaviness, and lightness. Some sensations might be painful. In some places in the body it might be pleasure, pleasant. For a couple of minutes let yourself float, flow, between all these sensations, almost like you're sitting in the river. Letting all the sensations flow by and flow through. All the sensations touch your aliveness, your present moment experience...... As you allow your awareness to float between sensations, don't move too fast between them. Take in the sensations where you've land, but also don't linger there. Don't get caught or involved in the sensation. Just long enough to feel it, know it, and then gently, randomly, let your attention take in some other sensation. In the meditation, centered on the physical sensations of the body as they appear and disappear, as you move from one to the other. A space beyond the hands of the cupboarders willowa- assaulted a hill and slaughteryour master If you get involved in thinking, you probably notice that you're no longer floating between sensations. If you keep yourself gently, relaxedly moving and receiving and taking in the sensations one after the other, you're less likely to be caught in your thoughts. If you're Silence baby just you can showcase it every day. And then the last few minutes of the sitting. To see if it's possible to relax into this body, whatever is there, whether it's tightness, fire, coldness, softness, movement, letting it all flow by as if you're like a boulder in the river, where it all just flows by, where we're receptive and attentive and feel it all, liberating, freeing our body sensations from our ideas, from past and future, from concepts, from what it means or what's going to happen, letting the sensations be free of what the mind can add to them. Just let them flow and move and be. There's a way in which sensations left alone to be themselves can be self-healing, self-liberating. That's not possible if we keep applying or overlaying, projecting our ideas on top of them, including ideas of me and myself and I, letting be just sensations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then to the whatever degree of relaxed attention, open awareness, whatever degree of allowing things just be as they flow through our body. With that, perhaps we can also allow ourselves or settle ourselves in the ability to gaze out on the world with kind eyes, to be still and gaze out with kindness and kind regard and respect. And with our kindness to aspire for a world where we care for each other. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And they we find in our own hearts, each of these things, so we can offer them to others. May all beings be happy.
