The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So welcome, welcome to happy hour.
And it's nice to see everybody.
Today I'd like to start with this poem.
That's by Jane Hirschfield.
She is a Zen practitioner on the translator and a poet.
And I believe that she lived at the San Francisco Zen Center for quite some time.
Not exactly sure, but that's what I.
There's like a connection with her and kind of the Darmacene here in the Bay Area.
And she, as poems, my view may know it, she writes about redwood trees.
And some of you may know that, you know, I am C is in Redwood City.
Would you be surprised if I said there's lots of redwood trees in Redwood City.
In fact, I didn't grow up in Redwood City, but I grew up in the Bay Area and we had to have redwood tree when I was growing up.
But whether they are just in there's in the neighborhood, when you, a lot of the places hiking nearby here, like maybe 10, 15 minutes, 20 minutes from I am C.
There's these redwood groves and there's something kind of majestic about them. There's, if you've never been can really, really recommend it.
There's something kind of majestic and they form like a cathedral.
And they're so tall and straight and a little bit awe inspiring is my own word, I would say.
And they grow to be very old.
And I know in the house that I grew up in.
For us and our neighbors, it was always a problem, but the roots of the tree getting into the, into the sewage lines and I'm seeing that problem too.
So they're pretty redwood trees are pretty.
I don't know what the word is the persevere, maybe.
Okay, so with that as the background.
You might be wondering, Diana, please stop talking about trees. This is happy hour not to arborist hour or something like this.
So the name of this poem is called tree by Jane Hirschfield and it goes like this.
It is foolish to let a young redwood grow next to a house.
In this one lifetime, you will have to choose that great calm being this clutter of soup pots and books.
Already the first branch tips brush at the window.
Softly, calmly, immensely taps at your life.
I'll read it again.
It is foolish to let a young redwood grow next to a house.
Even in this one lifetime, you will have to choose that great calm being.
This clutter of soup pots and books.
Already the first branch tips brush at the window.
Softly, calmly, immensely taps at your life.
This idea of the redwood trees, they just grow slowly.
It seems like nothing's really happening, but they are growing.
Those of you who have been to the retreat center, there's lots of redwoods.
And or even having to redo part of a deck because of a redwood tree is growing.
So this is those things that we construct, that we build.
They maybe can't withstand, they can't hold up against the immensity of a redwood tree that just very slowly grows step by step.
And I believe that the poet here is pointing to, this is what practice is like.
This is what meditation practice is, spiritual practice.
It's that it just grows and grows in a very, we keep on saying this, but right, it is something about trees that we don't see them growing.
We just all of a sudden notice that they've gotten closer or that they've gotten and, you know, the deck needs to be repaired or whatever it might be.
It's the idea that we have to choose.
Will we allow the redwood trees, will we allow our spiritual practice to continue to grow, even though it might be a little bit disruptive or a lot disruptive things we construct, maybe relationships we have,
issues about ourselves, all these things start to get, you know, shift and change.
They start to be impacted by this redwood tree that's growing nearby.
And loving kindness practice can definitely be this way too.
That's partly the reason why we do loving kindness practices too.
Maybe undermine some of these constructs, these things that we've created, some of these ideas we have about ourselves, some of these ideas that we have about others.
We've said, allow this immensity to touch us and to allow new ideas, new experiences, new thoughts, new beliefs to take hold and get expressed in different ways.
This is meditation practice.
Just taking a meditation posture.
Feel upright and steady, but also relaxed and easeful.
And to sit and know you're sitting.
How does it feel like to be here at this moment?
Maybe there are sounds.
Pressure against the body where you're sitting.
And then allowing the attention to rest on the sensations of breathing.
Feeling the movement of the body as it breathes.
Feeling the movement of the body.
The mind wanders. Just very simply, gently begin again. No need to judge it, have an opinion about it, make a story about it, we just begin again.
Absolutely does not matter how many times one begins again.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
To feel warm hearted towards, to feel care, love, respect, warmth, benevolence, goodwill, whichever words resonate with you.
Choose somebody for whom it's easy to have those experiences, those emotions with.
Bringing this loveable being to mind, whether it's an imaginary kitten, puppies, babies, whether it's a coach, mentor, teacher, author who has touched your life, or if it's somebody you have a relationship with right now.
Bringing them to mind.
The key word here is easy.
Connecting with this loveable being.
Allow yourself to feel how much you appreciate and care for them.
Make your way feels comfortable for you.
To support the cultivation of loving kindness, we can repeat these phrases.
May you be safe.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
Connecting with this loveable being.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
Allow yourself to feel supported, nourished by any feelings of warmth or warmheartedness, openness, spaciousness, happiness.
That's just a small part of your experience.
That's just a small part of your experience.
May I be safe.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be safe.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I live with ease.
May I be safe.
Read this poem again.
And in this one lifetime you will have to choose that great calm being, this clutter of soup pots and books.
Already the first branch tips brush at the window. Softly, calmly, immensity taps at your life.
That's just a small part of your experience.
That's just a small part of your experience.
That's just a small part of your experience.
That's just a small part of your experience.
That's just a small part of your experience.
That's just a small part of your experience.
And then expanding our loving kindness to neutral people. People we don't know that we don't have relationships with.
Maybe somebody on this Zoom call, somebody you see occasionally in the neighborhood. This best you can bringing this individual to mind.
Maybe it's just a name on Zoom here.
May you be safe.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
And then extending well wishes to people we don't know.
It's one way we allow this immensity to tap at our life.
It's one way that we allow our spiritual practice to grow and mature and express itself.
It's one way that we allow our spiritual practice to grow and mature and express itself.
