 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. www.rhedu.com So, hello everyone. Welcome to this meditation session. And I'd like to start with an introduction, but the introduction will be a bit of a rhetorical device. So, I say that to you because maybe rhetorical devices should have a warning in front of them. This way of talking may be hazardous for your habits. Or maybe hazardous if you overdo them. So, the statement in introduction is that............ So, I'll try again. It seemed that I had the impression that I had a 24-hour cold starting at the end of yesterday's teaching. And rested quite a bit yesterday. Felt much better today, quite well, and thought I would come down here. It seems like I'm still have a little bit of a compromised throat. It's kind of a little bit dry, I suppose, or something. It's not hurt, but happy to be here. So, this big build-up for an introduction is to say that an important part of meditation is to enjoy it, to find pleasure. And for this meditation, I would like to give you some guidance, some instruction, if you'd like to take it, on actually enjoying your meditation. Finding pleasure. And one of the places in the beginning to find pleasure is to find whatever pleasure there might be in relaxing. And if... And part of the reason to use pleasure is, in fact, to break our habits. Some of us have habits of kind of a negativity bias, habit towards thinking about what's terrible, what doesn't work. A habit to orient ourselves around the problems of life, and problems we have now, and how we're not doing well, and how it's difficult. It's certainly reasonable to have those thoughts occasionally, and if you never have those thoughts, maybe that's not healthy either. But... For today, let's try to break those habits by focusing on what's pleasant in the pleasure. But don't chase pleasure. Don't have a high standard for what it means. Even the absence of some thing uncomfortable you had in the past, it can be kind of a pleasure. And so maybe that's good enough. So assuming taking a pleasant posture. Not the most pleasant posture you can take, but the pleasant posture for meditation. The most pleasant posture you can find, that also where the body itself expresses being alert, aware. Amen. To close your eyes, or let your eyes, if you don't want to close them, let your eyes be relaxed and looking down. And then looking for how to make it pleasant, that you really enjoy doing this. Doing it in your way. Take a few deeper breaths, maybe slowly. And the exhale is slow enough to enjoy it. And to the extent it feels nice. And as you take deeper breaths, adjusting it, maybe so it remains enjoyable. And as you exhale, relax your body. And look for where the relaxing is pleasant, enjoyable, even to the most minor degree. And then letting your breath return to normal. And even thinking of a normal breathing as occurring within a range. And as we breathe in, if you can look for how to breathe a normal inhale that you enjoy, that has some pleasure to it. Maybe only a small piece of the journey of inhaling. The beginning, the end, the middle. And also seeing, is there anywhere in the exhale that you can enjoy? There's pleasure. Maybe it's the very, very beginning of the exhale. Or there's a smooth feeling in the middle of just, or maybe at the end. Maybe some of the pleasure of breathing, very, very subtle, is that just before you breathe in, it's slightly uncomfortable. There's a desire to breathe in. And it feels good to begin breathing in. And the same as you breathe out. The very beginning might feel like, oh, it's good to begin. And as you breathe in and breathe out, is there any pleasure more widely in your body that is kind of the atmosphere or the weather around your breathing? And how you are in the weather of your body. Are there ways you can relax the body more as you exhale? Maybe enjoying the effect of relaxing. And part of the function of feeling pleasure, enjoyment while you meditate is so that you can be more in the present moment where enjoyment occurs. The embodied pleasure or enjoyment of here and now. And then to enjoy relaxing the thinking mind. Maybe on the exhale, softening, quieting the mind. And maybe there's found some enjoyment or pleasure. In the mind, if you're aware of the spaciousness around your thoughts, the softness beyond the edges of your concerns. And as you're being aware, especially aware of your breathing, maybe it can be more pleasant to shift where you're aware from. If you're aware from kind of the front of your brain, be aware of breathing from the back. Or be aware from within breathing itself. Letting the thinking mind become quieter for the purpose of better sensing, taking in, registering whatever is pleasant here and now. In your body with your breathing, in the quieting of the mind. In your body with your breathing. In your body with your breathing. In your body with your breathing. In your body with your breathing. In your body with your breathing. In your body with your breathing. Allow yourself to feel whatever pleasure is here. If your body's beginning to anchor, you might shift your posture. Trust, assume it's okay to take in whatever degree of pleasure there is here. A pleasure which supports you being present in a quiet way. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If you're so gently, slightly, turn up the corners of your mouth to a small half smile. And if there's any pleasure from doing that, include that pleasure as part of mindfulness of breathing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then coming to the end of the sitting. Feeling or imagining what it's like to be with yourself. When the body has a degree of ease, enjoyment within it. And then imagine how you would walk around your home, informed by that ease or that enjoyment. How would you do ordinary household chores if you had all the time in the world and you did them informed by the ease, the pleasure. Staying close to it, not in a hurry to get the job over, but as a vehicle for continuing to feel the pleasure. And if you're sitting in a comfortable chair, feeling this pleasure and enjoyment, then you're talking with a friend. And if you talked, resting in this ease or this pleasure, how would you talk? There's a Native American expression to walk in beauty. How would you live in beauty? How does it support you to live in beauty? To have this reference point of a sense of pleasure, enjoyment in your body. And how might you care for the welfare and happiness of others if you cared in beauty? If you cared, informed by your sense of inner physical ease, pleasure. How might your heart wish well for others? May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you.
