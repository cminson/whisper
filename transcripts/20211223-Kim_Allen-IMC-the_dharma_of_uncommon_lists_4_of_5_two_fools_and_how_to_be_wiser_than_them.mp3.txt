Nice to be here again for those who missed it earlier.
I'm sorry that we cut out yesterday.
That shouldn't happen today.
I'm in a different place that requires me to have a mask, so I hope you can hear all right.
So today we're continuing with our Dharma of Uncommon Lists,
and we're on an unusual list of two items today.
And I've chosen one that I like because it can relate to having skill in how we conduct our practice.
So all along the path, we have to use whatever discernment we have to guide the path itself.
And of course, this list also relates to very pragmatic elements of our daily practice.
So let me read the quote that it comes from.
It uses the word fool, which I hope you won't get wrapped up in that item in that particular term.
So it goes like this.
These two are fools, which to the one who takes up a burden that hasn't fallen to him,
and the one who doesn't take up a burden that has these two are fools.
So the word that's translated here as burden also means task or something that we have responsibility for.
So we see that being foolish, as this quote says, being foolish is about taking up responsibilities or tasks that are not ours,
and also not taking up tasks that are our responsibility.
So this is, I think, rich material to unpack. So let's unpack this a bit.
I think it's largely an individual journey to understand how these phrases are going to specifically relate to our own individual path,
but I'm going to give some possibilities to help frame that.
So we can apply this quote in a very specific everyday way, and also it applies to the longer term arc of our practice.
So whether you're very new or you've practiced for a long time, there's definitely a domain that will apply.
So let's start with the first half of our list of two. So that's taking up a burden or task that is not our responsibility.
So there are things that we sometimes take up that really we don't need to.
So just to offer some options, there are some genuinely impossible tasks in the world. For example, trying to stop aging or illness or death when it's coming.
But there's a lot of effort that goes into trying to stop these things or trying to control them in ways that are ultimately not possible.
So we can think about the vast effort that goes into that.
And the Dharma would say, no, it's good to acknowledge rather than deny, of course, but this is a process that's unfolding.
And so there's a way in which we can have some grace with that, not try to take on an impossible task.
But also impossible. Some people are taking on impossible tasks of trying to save every being or the entire world, exhausting themselves in ways that go out.
We'll get back to how much we can act in the world in the second part of this talk, the second item on the list.
And just to note that there are ways in which we can take on too much external responsibility also.
And then there are a series of, as I thought about this element, there are a series of cases where we have to be careful about how much energy we put into something to make sure that we're not taking on something that isn't our responsibility.
For example, there are ways in which we try very hard to control how other people see us.
Some people are very concerned with getting everybody to like them, for example.
And that can take a lot of energy. And it's also not something that we have complete control over.
So it's a little bit outside of our domain of responsibility to completely control our image in terms of how everyone else sees us.
So you might consider that's an area where energy is going.
And then trying to remedy things that are nearly inconvenient or unpleasant, just in order to relieve the unpleasantness, this is something that we do quite a lot.
Actually, before we're on the path, it's pretty much the way we go through the world is trying to maximize pleasure and minimize pain, let's say.
But there can be ways in which we put a lot of energy into solving inconvenience or unpleasantness simply because we don't want to feel that.
So for example, I live near a road that goes up over the mountains, and it's a little bit dangerous. It's a highway, but still it's a windy road through the trees and the mountains.
And it's not that important to try to go really fast over this hill, but some people like to drive it at regular freeway speeds.
And if somebody is going closer to the speed limit, which is slower than that, they can get very antsy and try to pass on this somewhat dangerous road.
And it seems clear that essentially they feel an unpleasant feeling being behind a car that's going closer to the speed limit, and there's an inability to tolerate that unpleasant feeling.
And so that overrides the issue of safety and the past. I've observed this many times and there's also a lot of accidents on that road.
So we can notice though, maybe we're not so extreme in our practice, but I've noticed in myself repeatedly ways in which I put energy into avoiding inconvenience or unpleasantness just because I don't want to feel that.
And there's a way there's an encouragement in the practice to consider other factors that are, you know, broader than whether or not we're simply putting up with something that's unpleasant.
Maybe we can put up with it in order for some wider good to happen like the safety of the road, for example.
And then there are also burdens that we take up, quote unquote, in trying to fix or change other people.
So even if we are genuinely helping someone else, there is always an element of change that needs to come from the other person.
And so we can take on too much responsibility in trying to make others be as we would like them to be.
So that's something to consider also is how much responsibility we take there.
And then there's the other side of this interesting list, which is, are there ways in which we are not taking up responsibilities that are ours, not taking up tasks that we do need to do.
And I think this is directed particularly to people who are on the spiritual path.
There are things to do on the path. And sometimes, you know, sometimes we're not doing those.
So in particular in the suttas, the Buddha gives various advice to lay people.
One of them is to look after our material life so that it's balanced.
And to see that in the teachings, the Buddha does encourage, for example, spending less than the income that we earn.
So he encourages people to live in a way that's balanced.
And, you know, making sure that we, the amount of income that we bring in, we spend it wisely and a certain amount to take care of our own family and our own life.
And maybe we have some leftover to donate or to support other relatives.
So there's a way in which we take responsibility for the just kind of the day to day items in our lives.
And this alone can be a big task. I certainly know that.
So, but just being aware that that's actually part of the spiritual path.
And then I think more deeply is we have some responsibility to look at our mental habits and to do the practices that are offered on the path.
Meditation, as Gil often says, meditation only works when you do it.
And there's a way in which we wouldn't ask other people to pee for us.
That's also one that I heard from Gil. And in the same way, no one else can meditate for us.
And then conversely, of course, if we do meditate, we will definitely get the benefits. That always happens.
So these are ways in which we can check on our practice.
We've summed up nicely in the Dhammapada verse that's very well known, not doing evil or not doing harm, doing what is beneficial and cultivating the mind.
This is the teaching of the Buddhas.
It's fairly straightforward, but there are things that we want to not do things that we should do. And then there's the cultivation of the mind in order to kind of know, know the distinction between them.
I think about the, the declaration of Barahants, who, you know, when they're saying they've become free, one of the statements that they make is done is what had to be done.
That's interesting. That's part of the longer stock phrase that they say. So it makes it clear that there are certain things to be done on the path.
And when those are done, then we can say, okay, done is what had to be done.
It might sound a little bit surprising if it were set out of context, but in the context of this discussion, I want to offer a quote from Ajahn Lee, who was one of the great forest masters Thai forest masters of the last century, talking about wisdom.
He said, when, when you're a wise, you know what kinds of stress and pain should be remedied. And so you remedy them. And you know what kinds shouldn't be remedied. And so you don't.
It's interesting, right? Are there kinds of stress and pain that shouldn't be remedied?
Maybe, maybe we think that all Duke should eventually be let go. But, you know, for example, the certain pains associated with aging or illness, you know, maybe they can't be remedied at times.
And so we have wisdom to at that point put up with the unpleasantness or tolerate or cultivate equanimity.
And yet there are other kinds of stress and pain, things like anxiety or things associated with with our mental state that should be remedied and we shouldn't.
Some cases, you know, shouldn't really just put up with those being in our mind. So there's a kind of wisdom in this quote of not taking up taking up burdens that haven't come to us and not taking up burdens that have.
We can also maybe think a little bit more broadly. There's a quote from Talmud, the Jewish law, it says, you are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to desist from it.
So this is again directed at people who have taken on a spiritual path, of course.
But it isn't that we need to feel that everything has to be done, and we have to somehow try very hard to get everything done that might be taking on more responsibility than has really come to us.
But on the other side, neither are we free to just not do anything if we're on the path or tasks to be done.
There's a story of a person walking along the beach, and there are clams all over the beach that have come up, washed onto the beach during a storm, the day earlier and then the tide has gone out and kind of stranded them up on the on the sand.
The person is throwing the clams back into the ocean one by one, but they're, you know, there are thousands and thousands of clams on the beach. They're not going to be able to do all of them.
And someone comes along and says to the person, Oh, there are so many, there's so many, it hardly matters what you're doing.
And the person says calmly, well, it hold up a clam and say it matters to this one.
And there's a way in which what we're doing is a large task and then and yet clam by clam.
We make a difference.
So, returning to our unusual list for today.
These two are fools, which to the one who takes up a burden that hasn't fallen to him, and the one who doesn't take up a burden that has.
They're fools.
So it's, in some ways, a kind of a pointed teaching, and yet very compassionate.
There are ways in which we are exhausting ourselves that we maybe don't need to be, and also ways in which we could direct our effort and it would be more beneficial, or it might be that your practice is quite well balanced right now.
So I encourage this kind of thinking about this quote, and just seeing if there are ways that we could tweak it. You know, are there ways in which we could put a little bit less effort into something that doesn't seem to be bearing fruit is doesn't seem
necessary, or ways that we could put a little bit more effort into an area that we feel like yeah actually I, I should be looking at that.
I began by saying it's going to be something that's I think very unique and individual to each of our paths, and we're encouraged just to from time to time reflect as to where effort is going.
So I don't think this is something to stew over or write down and really work on, but more like just gently drop it into the heart and see what comes so that we can be working in ways that are really feeling nourishing to us there's a way in which the
path is meant to feel nourishing, even at times where it's hard or we're working on something that's, you know, somewhat heavy or we're working through something.
If that's where the effort needs to go that's what's come up to our responsibility. It feels so satisfying to work in that way.
And we can also I think feel when we're taking on something that isn't, isn't needed, isn't important for a path at this moment. So, even from moment to moment, we can feel that throughout the day, or we can reflect on the broader way that our path is unfolding.
So I hope this is an interesting, unusual list for you and something that you might just drop in and see, see how it unfolds for you. I found it fruitful to reflect on this from time to time.
All right, so we'll enjoy the day and we'll be back tomorrow for our final list of one.
Be well everyone.
