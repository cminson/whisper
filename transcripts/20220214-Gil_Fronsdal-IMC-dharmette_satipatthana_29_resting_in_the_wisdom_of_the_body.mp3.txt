The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So this part of the discourse on the foundations for awareness is the simplest of them all.
It's a simple description, an instruction. It simply says, in this body there is the property of earth,
the property of water, the property of fire, and the property of air, wind.
And that's it. It does give an analogy. I'll mention the analogy similarly tomorrow.
But the instruction, that's all it says. So there's a recognition of each of these properties as they appear within us.
And so it's so simple that it might be overlooked, it might not be understood how profound it is,
that it's actually one of the central ways that Vipassana practice is practiced,
is it really delving deep into the level of the sensations of our experience.
It's easy to not be in the sensations too. Certainly it's possible to have sensations of some kind or other
and then start interpreting it, have stories around it, reactions to it.
It's possible to not be connected to our sensations at all and be living in the abstract world of thoughts and ideas
and feelings that are disconnected from our body.
Part of mindfulness practice is to awaken the body.
There is one Mahayana Sutra that says that we awakening and enlightenment happens through the body.
The Buddha himself said that there is no awakening without mindfulness of the body.
What we're doing and partly just dropping into the sensations, just feeling the sensations that they appear,
is that we're beginning to expand our awareness throughout our body.
So more and more of our body starts being, we feel really connected to it,
it's our feeling embodied.
It does a lot of wonderful things for us to do this.
One is that the body itself can process so much of our life,
so much of our difficulties and our emotions and our thoughts and our concerns, our tensions,
partly because when we're not in the body, we're often in the reactivity, in the thoughts, the interpretations,
the stressful ways of thinking that are reinforcing the tension in the body.
If we drop down into the body, then there's room for things to unfold, there's breathing room for things,
and even things which, and some things will just naturally unfold and resolve themselves,
like tension, for example, oftentimes. Some things don't resolve themselves,
maybe there's chronic physical tension in the body,
but there's an art to just feeling the tension without adding any second arrows to it,
without adding any tension, extra tension to it,
and then delving even deeper into the pain.
So we're no longer experiencing at the conceptual level.
What I mean with that is to take pain as an example.
The word pain is an abstraction.
It's an umbrella term for sensations which are quite intense,
and those sensations can be varied. There can be intense burning, stabbing,
there can be intense twisting, there can be intense stretch pulling and tightening going on,
there can be intense exhaustion of the muscles, it's really aching.
And so those are the particular sensations that what we call pain,
and two people can say they have pain, and they have very different sensations.
Sometimes when we call things pain, we react to all the ideas and notions we have about pain,
rather than, and it's the abstraction we're reacting to,
what it means, where it's going, what's going to happen in the future,
rather than just dropping into the pain itself and feeling the particularities of the sensation.
It's possible at the level of calling it pain, it just feels like it's constant.
When we drop into the level of sensations, we can discover if we're really focused
that the sensations are not constant, they're inconstant, they come and they go,
they appear and they disappear.
You know, there might be a, I've had, you know, when I was first a new Zen student,
I used to bring my attention to feel the pain in my knees, which I had a lot of,
and it would be sometimes just to be reduced to a little square centimeter,
and in that centimeter, there would be this dancing of intense sensations,
sparking sensations of stabbing and tightening and different things,
and it was kind of fascinating to watch the dance and flicking around
that there was no one sensation to hold on to or react to
because they were constantly moving in this little square centimeter.
For some things, that ability to just feel at the sensation level
gives breathing room for it to resolve itself, to unwind, to dissolve,
and for other things which are pleasant and enjoyable,
there's breathing room for it to grow and expand.
And some of the great feelings of well-being that come with practice,
that we want to have come with practice,
are much more accessible if we can feel it more fully in the body.
The more we're awakened to the body, the more the body is a field of sensations that we can feel,
so much of the happiness and joy and well-being can be felt in an embodied way.
It's more stable, it's more fuller, it's more coursing through us
if we can really feel it through the body.
So this ability to drop down and feel the sensations increases our capacity
for experiencing joy and happiness.
Dropping down and feeling being embodied with our experience,
referring everything back in the body and let the body hold it,
and the body wakes up and becomes more expansive, in a sense, with sensations,
not that we're living from the neck up.
It also turns out we have a lot more capacity for being with difficulties.
That the mind doesn't have actually sometimes a lot of capacity
in its stories, ideas, reactions, beliefs, memories, projections in the future.
It can get very claustrophobic,
but if we can be centered and grounded and stable in our body,
making room to feel the sensations, letting the sensations come and making room for them,
then we have a much bigger capacity to deal with challenges,
a much bigger ability to be uncomfortable so that we're not knocked over or pushed around
or we become reactive or we get tense or we feel like our boundaries are being pushed
because we have all this capacity to hold it and be aware of it.
It's kind of like in the analogy I like that if you put a pyramid on its head, on the point,
it's not very stable and maybe you can get just perfectly balanced for a moment,
but someone just taps it and it just falls over.
But if you turn the pyramid upside down, I mean right side up,
and so it's sitting on its base, then you push it and it's not going to tip over so easily,
or at all.
So there's something about being stably centered in our physicality of our body,
sensations of body, that we don't easily get pushed over or thrown off balance by events of the world.
So this simple exercise, maybe the exercise is not simple to do but always,
but the simple instructions opens up to a vast world of possibility.
The world of our body being centered, grounded in our body, embodied in our body,
letting the body process our life, letting the body be the place we just compost things into our body.
When I have difficult emotions, I just find it so valuable to sit and meditate
and just feel those emotions in my body, just trust the body, like the body is composting them,
and I just kind of put them back into my body, into my body and feel it in the body.
And it's so relieving to realize that the wisdom of the body knows how to take care of things
sometimes much better than the mind is trying to figure it out,
or trying to navigate, negotiate, mediate, bargain with reality.
So to begin increasing your vocabulary for sensations,
you might want to draw up a list and maybe ask friends to add words to them.
And of all the ways that direct sensory experiences is felt,
and the greater that vocabulary list, the more you have to enter into this world of sensations and feeling them,
entering in so fully that at some point you start feeling the dynamism of it,
the dynamic nature in which it changes and moves and flows and comes alive more and more as we rest in the body,
as awareness is embodied.
So I offer you that one as an exercise to do supporting this sensation meditation
is to draw up a list, a long list of all the words in your language that describe sensations,
twisting, pulling, heat, hot, cold, heavy, light, you know, just go on and on, itching and whatever it might be.
And maybe get your friends involved with it, and they have different words than you do,
and your vocabulary increases, and as the vocabulary increases, perhaps your sensitivity also increases.
You're able to identify the differences between some of them that otherwise would have been missed.
So thank you, and I hope that you'll come to a day, maybe today, that you come to love your body,
much metta to your body.
May your body be one of your valentines. Thank you.
