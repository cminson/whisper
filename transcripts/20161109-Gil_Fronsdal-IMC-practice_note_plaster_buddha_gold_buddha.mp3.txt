What is relevant today? Fifteen years ago we had 9/11 , 
and today we have 11/9.  
 
I'm not sure exactly when it was, but sometime in the 
last 100 years or so, there was a very large plaster 
Buddha in Thailand. It  was larger than life -size, and 
sitting in meditation. The monks  were going to move this 
plaster Budd ha from one place to another – maybe  
within the temple  or to a new temple . They got a crane 
to pick it up , and it turned out that this plaster Buddha 
was much heavier than they’d anticipated . And as they 
lifted it, it fell.  The crane gave way , and it fell down on a 
corner . The plaster on th at corner broke , and to 
everyone’s surprise, there was something underneath 
the plaster : gold!  Inside, it  was a solid gold Buddha . I 
don’t know if it was solid all the way through , but maybe  
it was cast in so lid gold . So they took the plaster off , and 
there was this beautiful shiny gold Buddha  that was 
extremely valuable . 
 
For a few centuries no -one knew it was there . They realized that there was a time some centuries ago , 
when Thailand was being invaded by th e Burmese 
army . So in order to protect  their gold Buddha , the 
monks  camouflaged  it by putting plaster all over it , to 
make it look like a plaster Buddha  that was  not be worth 
much . And it seems to have worked . The Burmese army 
didn’t take it away and melt it down. However,  the 
people who put the plaster on  apparently didn’t pass on 
the knowledge . So for a number of centuries, it was just 
a plaster Buddha.  
 
Part of the function wh en we sit and meditate , taking  the 
meditation posture, is to let the old crusty plaster fall off . 
There are lots of things that can arise : disappointment s, 
discouragements, fears, angers and resentments  – all 
kinds of things that we build up as layers of plaster or 
crust around us  – places  where  we get stuck or  we hold 
on. One of the functions of sitting in meditation is to sit 
with all of that  crusty stuff , and then allow  it to fall off.   
 
Sometimes, the plaster  falls off much better when we’ ve 
been dropped  – when we run into something hard and 
difficult  that cracks the heart . And then we sit. If you sit 
for a long time , and you’re  with what it is, then that 
which is not necessary, that which gunks up the s ystem , 
has a chance to fall off, to be shed . 
 
Maybe inside of you, there ’s a golden Buddha sitting 
and meditating . This works very well, I think, as an image when  you’re meditating . 
 
Or perhaps  it’s like the skin of a snake that falls off as 
you get bigger . Maybe when you get up from 
meditation, you can be a wonderful snake th at’s bigger 
and stronger, ready to support and help in this world of 
ours.  
 
So may today be a day of sitting with what is, and 
seeing what is not needed as you grow  break off .
