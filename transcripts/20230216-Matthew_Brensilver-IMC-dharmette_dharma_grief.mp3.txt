 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Okay. I've got to say with you, um, um, so, uh, the, the Buddha, uh, uh, witnessed aging, sickness, death, and, uh, it was this, this changingness. And, uh, maybe we could say anticipatory grief that, uh, that launched his spiritual surge. And anticipatory grief, um, is a profound engine for Dharma motivation. Uh, this, this week, the, the, the, it's been, uh, kind of Dharma, prominent Dharma themes that, that, that don't appear in this. And so it was awe, surrender, humor, playfulness, and, uh, today, uh, grieving. The, the story of, uh, story of the Buddha is that, uh, his mother died around the time of his birth, maybe the most, uh, primal form of grief. And generally we see that the Buddha wanted to be free from grief beyond grief, sorrow, lamentation, grief, sorrow, and lamentation. This is a path beyond grief, sorrow, and lamentation. But then again, when, when, uh, two, uh, very dear disciples of his died, the Buddha said that, uh, this hall that is full with hundreds of monastics feels empty with the death of, sorry, puta, Moggallana. And then the sutta goes on to say, but the Buddha didn't suffer. And I, I don't, don't know about you. This is quite individual. Don't know about you, but, um, but I want my Buddha to grieve. And it took some time, but, uh, kind of clarify in my own heart, but, um, I, I don't place, um, grief in the cluster of afflictive emotions. And I don't live it, but I could imagine a life free of, of anger and agitation, anxiety, could imagine it. But it's very hard to imagine a life free of grief, what that would even mean. And it's like, how do you even look at the world for one minute and see the, the carnival of greed, hatred, delusion, destruction that brings and not feel some bit of grief. And so for me, I associate grief with some of really our best qualities of sensitivity of love, of morality. I really don't, don't know what our Sila would look like if we never grieved. You know, loss is kind of, it's part of what makes the sanctity of life intelligible. It's finitude. And, um, you know, children, children have sometimes called growing pains, right? They say their legs hurt at night or something. And, uh, Dharma practice has growing pains too. And the growing pains of Dharma often taste like grief. How does it actually feel to change in the actual trenches of change? Not on the other side of letting go. The other side of letting go might feel great, feel like release, feel like we've been freed up from some impingement. But the process of letting go, the movement from the clenched fist of clinging to the open hand of surrender of letting go, the movement of that, that is often painful. And the pain often feels something like grieving. How does it feel to deepen our compassion? To truly awaken to dukkha, to suffering. The Buddha said comprehend suffering. To comprehend suffering. What does that, what does that entail? How does it feel to grow up ethically, to have one's, the circle of empathy expand, the process of coming out of our, the depth of our self absorption into some awareness of the vastness of suffering. That feels like grieving. And before the truth of suffering, the first noble truth of suffering, before the truth of suffering ennobles us, we grieve it. We grieve it for a long time. The ordinariness of suffering, the endlessness of samsara is startling. There's research, Shelly, Shelly Taylor, on positive illusions, positive illusions. So these are sort of like illusions we have that seem to be associated with health. So she writes, self aggrandizing, self perceptions, an illusion of control, and unrealistic optimism are widespread in human thought. These illusions foster the criteria normally associated with mental health. Self aggrandizing, self perceptions, the illusion of control, unrealistic optimism associated with mental health. And it's said that these illusions bolster and stabilize sense of self. Indeed, philosopher Metzinger says creating too much awareness of mortality threatens the integrity of your and other people's conscious self model, because it implies a deep existential loss of control. Almost nobody wants to gaze into an abyss for too long because, as Nietzsche famously remarked, the abyss might eventually gaze back into you as well. We do get the comfort of our illusions, and we don't live every moment as death contemplation. But there's a subtle agitation of self deception. The Dharma is the longing, longing, deep burning, desire, longing, or truth. And when some part of us, one part of us knows we're fooling another part of us, we can't settle, there's agitation. And so the chickens come home to roost at some point. Those illusions will not sustain themselves. The chickens come home to roost. And if we've not grieved the homelessness of ego, the ungovernability of existence, we've not grieved the end of all things, we will be shattered. And so that sense, that kind of anticipatory grieving, conditions our heart, not towards hopelessness, but towards motivation to practice with what we can practice with. To grow into compassion, the two wings of awakening, wisdom, compassion, to grow, to deepen into it, to evolve as moral creatures, to really evolve, to grow up as ethical beings. This will stretch ourselves. And we'll entail some measure of grief. Now the grief I speak of is, it's very fluid rather than stagnant. James Baldwin said that people can cry much easier than they can change. That line's always kind of haunted me, you know, it's like, I don't want those tears to be a kind of rationalization of stagnation. But the Dharma, the Dharma grieving is a process by which something else becomes love. And something else becomes love. Dharma is this alchemical process transmuting, transmuting. Pema Chudrin, this beautiful line saying that grief is completely pregnant with bodhicitta, the awakened heart, completely pregnant. And this inside path, the path of purification is transmuting suffering into wisdom and love. And even when the grief hurts, the love never feels far. So I offer this for your consideration today. And yeah, it's good to, I appreciate the opportunity to be able to touch into these themes together, these kind of universal human themes together. So thank you all, and we'll look forward to gathering tomorrow. Okay, have a good day.
