 Walking, formal walking meditation is important to do. It's actually the broader function of it, besides the fact that we can't sit all the time because it's hard on the body, is that it connects the cushion in daily life. So please take those periods seriously today. Of course you can use these times for visiting the restroom and having a snack or having a cup of tea. That's fine. But maybe try to do that either at the beginning or the end of the walking period so that you have a block of walking that's connected on one end or the other with your sitting. And there are many approaches to walking meditation of course and if you already have something well established in your practice that's fine. I would invite continuing to open to the possibility of joy and tranquility in the walking meditation also. Maybe the rhythm of the breath is replaced with the rhythm of the steps. And there's this nice background feeling also. The body likes kind of the mind likes rhythm, rhythmic experience as a calming factor. And we can also just have a simple connection with the any ease that we have through our simple walking path back and forth. If you haven't done walking meditation before, I'll now offer some very general instructions. But if you feel comfortable, it's okay to sign off at this point. And we'll be back again at 1030 Pacific for another sit. If walking is new to you or if you just want to review, the way that we do walking meditation is it's not so much that we are going for a walk or walking around because then there's a little bit of mental activity and negotiating the path and walking around corners and such. So we have a practice of simple walking back and forth 10 to 15 paces. You can do it inside in a room with not too much clutter. You can do it in hallway. You can do it on the porch or out in nature if there's a space where that feels comfortable. And it's warm enough. And you begin by standing at the beginning of the path and just gathering yourself in the way that you would bring mindfulness to the sitting posture as soon as you sit down on the cushion. So we just are aware all the bodies in the standing posture. And then we can begin to really feel the minute feelings of walking the way they're subtle sensations of the breath. As it comes in, noism spreads through the body. I pointed to those a little bit. Again with walking, we can just do it very unthinkingly as we often do, or we can really be there for the shifting of the weight onto one foot, the lifting of the other foot, moving it through space and placing it. And we shift the weight onto that one so that we can move the other foot. It's a fascinating process actually that goes on without our need to do it consciously. And you don't need to do it super duper slow and painstakingly. Walking is a natural process like breathing. You can do it at the pace that feels natural for your energy level. So if you're somewhat energetic, you may want to walk at a near normal pace. And if you're feeling calm, walking at a normal pace will agitate you. So walk slow. When you walk, you're 10 to 15 paces, get to the end, stop, know that you've stopped. And then you turn, feel the turning. That's a complicated balance process, but it all happens by itself. You don't have to do it. And then you're again standing at the beginning of your walking path and you walk. And of course you'll get distracted and when you do, you bring the mind back in the same way as with sitting. Ah, I'm back. I was thinking, got off on something. Maybe stop and then start again. Just walking back and forth in this simple way gives the body some refreshment, allows the mind to be a little bit more open, have an external, because you're seeing, have external senses, hearing. And just take it, take it easy and see if you can touch into these qualities of tranquility and joy. And when it's time to come back and sit or to visit the restroom and such, then you do those with that same spirit. I hope you'll find the walking to be an enjoyable balance to our practice today. All right, enjoy.
