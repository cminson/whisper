The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Since this natural capacity to be mindful, aware, in the present moment, is supported by relaxation, we'll begin by allowing the body to relax.
It can be helpful to start by kind of scanning through the body and noticing where you may be holding tension.
Just kind of a quick scan, so we'll start and just notice in the head and face, if there can be any softening of the muscles of the head and face, relaxing the muscles of the head and face.
Around the eyes, across the forehead, around the mouth and jaw.
Relaxing the neck, shoulders, arms and hands.
Softening the muscles of the chest and upper back. All those muscles around the rib cage.
Relaxing across the stomach and abdomen.
See if there can be a softening down the spine through the middle and lower back.
Relaxing the hips, the legs, the feet.
And sometimes there's also a possibility, we've kind of scanned through the muscles of the body.
Sometimes we can also hold tension more deeply inside the body in our organs and in the visceral area.
And sometimes there can be a conscious relaxing of that area, so just check in. It's not always available, but maybe the inside of the throat can soften.
Relax. Maybe the heart, the area around the heart can relax.
Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax.
And then maybe too, the mind can relax.
This may be kind of unfamiliar or the idea of relaxing the mind.
When our minds are tense, they're kind of caught often in worries or concerns or the feeling of tightness or constriction in our mental realm.
And if we can soften, relax the mental, Gil sometimes calls it the thinking muscle. Maybe that can relax a little bit.
Another analogy Gil sometimes brings in that I find useful is if the brain were a muscle, maybe the brain can relax.
It may give a sense of what it means to relax the mind. Maybe the brain can relax.
And from this place of relaxation, of whatever relaxation is available, it's a gentle checking in and are you aware?
Do you know that you're aware right now? Just the lightest touch, yeah. Do you know that you're aware?
And then what is obvious in this moment? What's naturally already available to be known?
Just the lightest touch of awareness. What's happening now?
You don't have to bear down on what we know, what we become aware of. Whatever reveals itself is enough.
And then in the next moment, what's obvious now?
A really light touch of effort, just enough to know this body sensation, this sound.
And then doing it again.
Are you aware?
What is obvious?
Exploring the possibility of settling back and letting what's obvious come in to you, come to you as opposed to looking for what?
To be aware of.
Relax.
Receive.
And then what's received may shift from moment to moment.
It can be a kind of a feeling of following the attention.
It may seem like there's a shift from one thing to another kind of in a flow.
Following the attention.
Sometimes it can feel more jumpy. This is happening and then suddenly something else pops in.
Relax.
Are you aware?
What is obvious?
Often something that's obvious is our body sensations.
The physicality of our body, the weight, the pressure, coolness, or heat.
Or sound.
Relax. Receive.
There's no need to make a lot of effort to be mindful.
Quite naturally, if you're aware, what's obvious can just be here in this moment.
How much effort does it take to be aware of sound right now?
It's just happening.
Just moment after moment, a light touch. Just enough to be with this in this moment.
And just enough in this moment.
That's obvious. We don't have to dig to find anything underneath.
Just this.
Moods and emotions may also sometimes become what we're aware of.
Just noticing.
What's obvious about that? With emotions, sometimes there can be physical sensations that are connected.
That may be where the attention lands.
Can be thoughts.
We can be aware of thoughts. And if that's possible for you in this moment, just noticing, oh, thinking.
Aware of thinking right now.
And yet thoughts are a place where we do tend to get lost.
And we will get lost.
The moment when mindfulness returns after we've been lost, in that moment of recognizing, I've been lost.
That moment right then is the arising of mindfulness again.
You've become aware again.
Can that be the curiosity?
That's a good moment to begin to recognize what it's like to be aware.
Actually begin to notice that quality.
Aware again.
So in the return of mindfulness, see if that can be the curiosity. Oh, aware again.
Knowing aware. Awareness is here.
And then what's here? What's obvious in that moment?
Sometimes after the mind has been wandering, what's obvious is connected to where the mind has been.
An emotion, a mood, attention.
So noticing how you are in this moment.
And if there is more tension in the system following the mind wandering,
bring the relaxation practice back for a few moments.
After the mind wanders, check in. Is there tension? Relax.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the mind.
Creating the conditions for this natural capacity of mindfulness to be more peacefully present.
Relax.
Are you aware?
What is obvious?
And from time to time checking in, how are you in relationship to the experience?
This may be an attitude or relationship to a sensation that's happening.
A sound, a relationship to a sound, a body sensation, a relationship to that.
It also might be a relationship to the meditation itself, a frustration,
not the experience, not being what I want it to be, not being calm enough, frustration about this being different than I'm used to.
Can you just recognize, oh, there's this relationship, and it's almost like making the mindfulness bigger to contain that as well.
Is this happening and this relationship to it?
How is that to know that? What is obvious about that relationship?
You don't need to dig, figure anything out.
The mind begins to understand and learn because that's its nature to learn.
We don't actually have to do the learning.
Let's have some patience with just the witnessing.
In this practice, we could say we're learning the way a naturalist learns, going out into nature and sitting quietly, watching,
watching the relationships between the different things happening, witnessing and learning through stillness and curiosity.
Are you aware?
What is obvious?
What's already happening?
How about now?
Opening to this flow of changing human experience.
Sitting here in stillness.
There's a lot happening, just receiving here and now in this moment.
There's this and this and this.
There's this and this.
There's this and this.
