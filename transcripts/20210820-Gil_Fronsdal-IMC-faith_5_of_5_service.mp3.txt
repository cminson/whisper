 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So for the talk today, the general topic may be the title can be Service, Faith and Service. And the idea of service is to offer care. But to offer care when we combine the idea of faith, maybe it's associated a little bit with devotion, a little bit with trust, a little bit with generosity. That faith can also involve not only what we receive, what we trust and kind of just allow for, it's also something deeper in that it's also a wellspring of what we offer. That it's an action of expression of our love and expression of our faith, expression of where we place our hearts, what inspires us in some deep way. And so faith is not, we're only recipients in having faith, we're actually givers. And to really have faith, I think it really helps to also, if there is a feeling or recognition inside, that there's a desire for action to do something. And many times it's desire to serve whatever the source is for the faith, to support it, to help it out, to benefit it. But it could be a faith can, this kind of the service aspect of faith doesn't have to be to some particular, the source of the faith, your religion, for example, or your community, religious community or practice community. But it could be faith can elicit this desire to, out of love, out of care, compassion, out of a fullness of heart, to serve people anywhere in the world, maybe Haiti, maybe other places, maybe your neighbors, maybe more fully in your own family. And this idea of service, to serve, is a beautiful thing of the heart. It's kind of a wonderful, rich, multifaceted quality of generosity, of love, of care. And there's something about caring that's really part of freedom, non-clinging, which I talked about yesterday. As we don't cling to anything, there's much more room in the heart, in the mind, to be responsive to the world around us, responsive to the suffering and the joys of the world, and to respond in a way that feels like we're expanding the faith, or expanding our freedom, expanding our love out into the world in some wonderful way. And so, to serve out of faith is not to want anything in return, but rather it's just a clear, clean expression of generosity, of serving something that's valuable to serve. And this language that I use in the meditation, that the circles of giving and receiving, and to have those circles be to flow and move and turn freely, not to be clogged up or stopped, or not have the brakes on. If a wheel, if you take half of the wheel away, it's not a wheel anymore, it won't roll. It will lead the whole wheel to roll. And so the wheel of giving and receiving, giving and receiving, that arises not out of a should, not out of obligation, but from being settled in some deep way in our hearts, in a way that something here we trust, here we have a devotion to, here we have confidence in. Yesterday I talked about the confidence in non-clinging, that to rest in that confidence is not a passive thing, but it's kind of like the soil, the nutriments, for then responding to the world. A response, which again I want to emphasize is not an obligation, but it feels like the most natural thing in the world, just what flows out of it. The liberated heart, the heart that's filled with this kind of dharma of faith, the heart that goes for refuge, is not a passive heart. It's one that has an orientation and a motivation and inspiration to act in a new way, to live a new way. And one of the ways of understanding this is to live with care. To offer care. To care for, in some ways it's natural to care for, I think I say it a little differently, one of the wonderful things to do is to care for the place in which you practice in. Part of the practice is to care for the place you practice. Part of the practice is to care for the world in which you practice. And that world spreads out beyond any walls, beyond any boundaries, and open-ended. And so to do that as a sense of the kind of service that is almost like a devotional service or an expression of love or goodwill. So I've talked about all these different qualities, characteristics of faith this week, and there's many more. Faith is a rich, rich thing. And as I said in meditation, I think that I actually prefer not to believe that I know exactly what faith is. I can talk about different aspects of it, but it feels much more in harmony with faith, with this deep trust, not to know fully what it is, and in not knowing to open myself, to trust it or appreciate something larger and bigger than anything I could know or anything that I could have control over or possess. And so there's a kind of a wonderful feeling of willingness to be open that doesn't have to know, but is ready to serve, ready to care, ready to participate in this world as if I belong here, we belong here. We're belonging as this wonderful circle of giving and receiving care. And maybe in the end, this practice that we do is a practice that transforms us into free beings. They're deeply connected to our communities and our world in this mutuality of giving and receiving care. So service has an element of faith. So thank you.
