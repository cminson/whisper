Dharmette: Working with I-dent-
ification

I want to talk today  about identification. But first I’ll ask 
you for your patience, because sometimes my mind 
likes to do funny things with words . So, when I look at  
the word ‘identity ,’ I see the ‘I -dent’ [ laughter ] – as 
though w e’re whole to begin with, but then we get 
dented . We get dented with the ‘I .’ And the idea is to go 
back to being whole, rather than focusing only on the 
dent. As if the dent were  the whole thing  – as if we are 
the dent.  
 
So we ‘i-dent-ify.’ We dent ourselves with ideas of our 
roles, of who we should  be, of how we’re supposed to 
be. We can dent ourselves  with almost  kind of  an idea . 
If you say, ‘I am X ,’ and you fill in the blank, chances are 
that you are denting yourself. It’s not automatic  – it’s not 
required  – to dent yourself . There are innocent ways of 
saying “I am” something, but there is  often a 
preoccupation with the dent, with th e hole that’s made in  
the whole – the gap or dent . 
 
One difficulty with identification  is when it causes suffering . We take the identity  as the whole, rather than 
just a dent in the whole . If we see ourselves as whole, 
as complete, then any of the things we would normally 
identify with can be seen as part of the whole, but not 
the whole . In this play on words , if we see it as 
complete, as the whole , inevitably we end up dropping 
the ‘w’ so that we’re in this hole . We fall into the hole, as 
opposed to being the whole. I think they’re pronounced 
the same way in English , aren’t they? My poor English ! 
 
It’s fine to have emotions and feelings . It’s fine to have  
roles . It’s fine to be a person in all the different ways  we 
can be a person . But what happens when we dent 
ourselves with it  – when we make a hole that we fall 
into, as opposed  to seeing it as a part of the  whole ?  
 
In our society it’s very sad when  other people  do the 
identification  for you , and we go round denting each 
other. We see someone as their role , or as some aspect 
of who they are, and we hold them to being  that role : 
“That’s the kind of person they are .” And we limit them 
that way .  
 
Sometimes we live under the struggle of how other 
people have dented us  – made us less than we ar e. 
Some people don’t have a strong experience  of what it’s 
like to be whole because no one  saw them that way 
when they were growing up . They were  always see n in 
a particular way , like being the role of a family member  – to always be a son, or a daughter, or a parent in 
people ’s eyes . These certainly a re roles that are 
relevant , but if we only see a person that way, if we’re 
only seen  that way, then we’re limited . We’re not being 
seen as whole, as complete . We need to be careful of 
the ways in which we human beings latch onto ideas, 
roles, feelings, thoughts, the body, ways our bodies are, 
and then “who I am .” The way we are  becomes a dent . 
Then we have  fallen into the hole . The dent is made, 
and causes a tremendous amount of suffering . 
 
In a sense,  part of the task in moving towards  freedom 
is to become whole again . That means that we don’t 
have  to reject  anything . We don’t have to push any of 
the dents awa y.  
 
As you know , there are  car body shops where they fix 
the dents  in cars, but sometimes it’s not even that 
interesting to fix the dents . In our society o ne of the 
things people identify with too much i s perfectionism  – 
that you’re  only going to be a good person if you’re 
‘dentless ’ – if you’re completely without flaws , problems, 
or difficulties . I don’t think that’s so helpful.  
 
How can we be whole ? How can we see the complete 
picture in some way  – in a way that we’re also accepting 
the dents, the challenges , and  the difficulties we have ? 
Being identified  with needing to be perfect is to make a 
big dent. If fact, that’s probably  the dent that you’ll never undo [laughter] .  
 
Here, mindfulness, awareness practice, can be helpful. 
There is something powerful about so clearly  noticing, 
recognizing, how we’re identified with something . When  
we notice it so clearly, so fully, we can see  it from some 
part of ourselves that’s bigger than t he place of 
identification.  
 
Some  people identify strongly with an aspect of 
themselves . I’ve known people who identify with 
psychological  attitudes  and feel  incapable  of dong many 
things . Right now I’m reading a book called  Hillbilly 
Elegy . Some of you may have read it . The author  talks 
about  how he grew up with a certain self -image . In his 
case , that only changed when  he went into the military , 
where he dis covered  how capable  he was. It turns out 
that he’s smart, but he grew up thinking  that he’s not 
really capable of managing on his  own.  He was taught  
this strong identity by his close family  and culture . But 
then he learned to step away from that identity . He was 
bigger tha n that; he was  capable.  
 
There’s something about the clear recognition of 
mindfulness that pulls us out of the mud. It pulls us out 
of where we’re stuck , and the fact that we can see it 
makes a huge difference . The task is : how do we se e it 
fully, completely, so that we’re not in the dent, not 
caught in it anymore ? Part of the art and the work of mindfulness  is not just to be mindful  and say, “Oh, I 
recog nize that it’s there .” You can recognize that 
something ’s there , but still be mired in it, still be caught 
up in it . Just because  you’re mindful doesn’t mean that 
you’re  not caught. But  what it does mean is that you can  
use the po wer of attention  and recognition to see it so 
strongly  and fully that you’re recognizing f rom some 
place inside that is not identifying with what you’re 
caught in . That can be very liberating, very helpful .  
 
For people  who use mental noting , one way to do it , 
which is a little  bit ridiculous  – the word play on I -dent is 
perhaps ridiculous  – is to say  your mental notes  about  
what’s happening really loudly . Maybe you can even 
add some wonderful expressions . For example , if you’re 
really identified with your anger, don’t just say, “anger, 
I’m angry , I’m angry, angry .” You can use colorful  
words, “I AM ^%$%^ ANGRY! Boy oh boy! [laughter]  I’m 
colorfully  angry  [laughter]. There is a lot of color  today . 
Boy! This is quite something! I wonder if there’s anyone 
as angry as me today? I really have it going . This is 
amazing! This is like looking into the Grand Can yon. It’s 
a wonder of nature to look at me being  so angry !” You 
can talk to yourself  in such a way that after a while 
you’re not quite in it , not caught  anymore . By doing that 
kind of self-talk – admitting to yourself so  strongly that 
you’re angry in all kinds  of creative ways  – your 
thoughts  are no longer hijacked by your identification  
with the anger . You’ll know that you ’ve succeeded if you smile  – if there’ s a little glimmer, a little crack of light, a 
smile: “This is ridiculous !” 
 
The idea is to become independent  of what you identify 
with. To step back, but not to push it away . Not to have 
it go away, but rather  you realize  that you’re  much more 
that that. There’s something more going on . We’re not 
‘it.’ ‘It’ is a part of us , but we’re something  else.  
 
Another  really powerful thing to do  – for those  who can 
do it – is to drop into the body and really feel physically 
what it’s like to identify  with what’s going on . Some 
people find that if they drop into the physicality of the 
experience, it’s harder to identify  with those thought -
stories , which  are the glue for identific ation. There’s 
something very simple about direct bodily experience 
and feeling . The more fully we can enter into  and feel 
what’s happening physically , the more removed we are 
from the glue that keeps us bound to it. But part of the 
cost of that is to really feel  fully what’s there, which can 
be tricky too.  
 
In addition to m ental noting, self -talk, and feeling it in 
the body, finding  ways to get  calm is a nother  fantastic 
way to realize  that there’s  more going on tha n wha t 
we’re identified with . Part of Buddhist wisdom comes 
from developing calm and settledness  in meditation . 
This field of calmness  or well -being shows  us that 
there’s a lot more going on that the tight, narrow world of what we’re caught  in and identifying wit h. So try to 
have some modicum of calm , and then look at what’s 
going on for you. Look at your identifications from the 
perspective of calm . Being  calm helps us realize  that 
there’s more to the whole picture.  
 
The good  news, I think, is that all of  us are greater and 
more wonderful than anything  we identify with . And if 
you identify with being whole, I can reassure you that’s 
just one more dent. You’re greater and more wonderful 
than any identity you build around  the whole, because , 
with awareness, you can always step away from it and 
see it as well . With awareness, you can always st ep 
back and see the bigger picture . There’s always more 
than any definition you may have of what it is . And to be 
able to rest in a place of no definition, no identity, is 
phenomenally  healing and helpful .  
 
So don’t fall into your dents.
