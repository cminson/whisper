 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Well, good morning everybody, good day. And I'm aware that this is being webcasted as well. And so there may be folks joining online, so we have to kind of stretch our imagination to feel the sense of kind of practicing together in this multiple forms. So we'll start with a meditation. And this morning I wanted to invite in our meditation, paying particular attention to the conditioned nature of our experience. So I offer some guidance, maybe particularly at the beginning of the meditation, maybe towards the end. And hopefully those pointers will offer something for you to explore in our meditation. So we'll begin our meditation by maybe just begin to pay attention to our sitting position and sitting postures. And if you'd like to close your eyes, feel free to gently close your eyes. Or if you'd like to keep it open, that's fine also. The first few moments arriving at our seats and our cushions allow this arriving to be just taking its time, letting it take its time. Maybe having some generosity towards this process of arriving. Sometimes there is a sense for me as if the flights are landing. I'm not completely stopped just yet. I'm coming to our seats. Arriving may feel a little bit like that. Maybe our minds are still moving about, thinking this and that. Our bodily energy can feel a bit bubbly. Just by noticing that arriving is happening, mindfulness is already here. Become available to this process, however it's unfolding. Taking a few long deep breaths. Maybe as you breathe out, allow that sense of arriving to settle even deeper. Become aware of this whole body sitting right here and right now. That's the first few moments of our sitting. I invite you to rest your awareness in the lower half of the body. What's the felt sense of sitting against the chairs, the floor, pressure, the weight, underside? Maybe some sense of energetic settling downwards. Supported by Earth grounded. We can tune in to the stability aspect of the body by resting in the felt sense of Earth element. Firmness of the bones. A stability of the pelvic floor supporting the rest of the body. You're sitting like a mountain. You can expand to include the earthy, earthy feeling of the rest of the body. Maybe the strength of the spine, the weight of the limbs, and study. Maybe you already noticed with the steadiness as the backdrop, there is a movement in the body, movements of the breath, the tension sensations of the body. Receiving both the steadiness and the movements. You're sitting like a mountain. You can expand our awareness even further. You receive the movements in the mind, the emotions of our dancing emotions in our experience, thoughts, memories. The waves of emotions are ripples. Including in our field of awareness, all experiences coming through our senses, sound, smell. Today I would like to invite you, if you like, to pay particular attention on how experiences arise and pass as a conditioned phenomenon. Maybe the sound of my voice coming, you hear the words, having some perceptions of it. Noticing what arises right after that. Curiosity, aversion, too much, too little. And there may be stories about it, about yourself, others. This comes through a conditioned process with a sense contact of hearing, evaluation, judging, storytelling arises. And noticing how they pass away. Becoming really interested in the unfolding of your lived experience right here and now. Not to think about it, trying to figure it out. Just sitting here, becoming available to the unfolding of our experiences. Boeing, If you find yourself a wandering away from here and now, it's never too late to simply return to the simplicity of this experience right now, right here.
