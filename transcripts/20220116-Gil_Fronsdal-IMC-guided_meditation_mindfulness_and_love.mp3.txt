 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone, and I feel particularly heartfelt to greet you on this weekend of Martin Luther King's birthday. And I think at the foundation of his message, and therefore his life, that influenced this country to such an extent that there's a holiday after him. The foundation is his dedication to love. And at its best, or what it can grow into, mindfulness becomes love. Or mindfulness is inseparable from love when it's strong, when it's well developed. There's something about the nature of awareness that is unrestricted. Awareness which is unveiled, unclouded, that allows the heart's capacity for love to shine. And I suspect that for each person, love is something a little different. It's not like a single, absolute same phenomenon. But it's the human capacity to care for others with generosity, with friendliness, with valuing of others, respecting others. And now, kind of the beautiful thing that can happen with mindfulness is that when mindfulness and love seem inseparable, maybe become the same, that it also doesn't require having an object. It doesn't require having someone that is the object of love. It's just love, just care, just warmth, just tenderness or gentleness or compassion. And this huge family, love is like a family of different emotions. And so I don't want to narrow it down to one thing for any of us, but to sit quietly, openly in awareness, and allowing, making space for the possibility for the many flavors of love to be born, to show themselves. And so to value this awareness, this mindfulness enough, or to value it more than our distractions, so that when we are distracted, or caught up in concerns and feelings, we don't dismiss those, but we center ourselves in the awareness of them, maybe with the idea that awareness is kindness. Awareness is free enough from our concerns and our challenges that there's room for the heart's capacity for love, for everything, including our challenges and including our distracted mind. So assuming a meditation posture, taking a posture itself that maybe expresses your care, your goodwill towards yourself, maybe one that allows the chest and the heart center to begin to open to all that's here for us, the difficult and the wonderful. And to gently close the eyes, not to shut out the world, but rather so there's more room to open to a different way of sensing this world, knowing this world from deep inside, from the place in which there may be love exists, compassion, kindness. And to take a few long, slow, deep breaths. As a way of awakening a heightened sensitivity to our body, which is not just our physical body, but is our physical capacity for sensing the physical awareness, embodiment, breathing in deeply and exhaling and settling into the body's capacity to be aware, to sense, to feel. And then gently letting your breathing return to normal. And with a relatively normal breath, on the inhale, feel whatever tension or holding there might be in the body, wherever it appears, on the exhale, kindly, without ambition, soften and relax around that with that tightness. It might be around the face, the chest, might be around the belly, or in the arms and hands, in the hips or the legs. And what kind of receptivity or opening, what kind of sensing would you need to feel your capacity to love? Where in your body would you open, feel, rest your attention? If you were going to be available for love, kindness, a generosity of spirit, and if it's comfortable for you, on the inhale, feel your love with awareness, with sensing and feeling. Maybe breathing into the place where love is found in your body. On the exhale, continue to soften and relax into that place where awareness and love are closely connected, either touching each other as you breathe, or moving to become almost the same, lovingly aware, mindfully loving, one breath at a time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Perhaps turning your corners of your lips up a little bit, just enough to feel a smile. And with that little smile, is it a little easier for mindfulness to be accompanied by kindness, for whatever you're mindful of? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For whatever mindfulness knows, what happens if you use the quiet soft mental note? Yes. Just yes, without agreeing or approving, just a yes for awareness. Yes. This too I can be aware of. And will that yes, make room for kindness, love, as you are aware. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For those who are threatened with violence, that they may experience peace, that those who are oppressed, they have the oppression lifted. So they can breathe freely and live freely and find their way in the world successfully. May we be a source of goodness for this world. May all beings be happy. Amen.
