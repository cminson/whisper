The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So I'd like to start with this poem by an Australian poet and cartoonist.
Michael Lunik, Lunik Lunik, I'm not exactly sure how to pronounce his name.
And the poem goes like this.
There are only two feelings, love and fear.
There are only two languages, love and fear.
There are only two activities, love and fear.
There are only two motives, two procedures, two frameworks, two results.
Love and fear, love and fear.
Of course, this is a gross generalization, but I kind of like this idea that so much can be kind of figured,
was this headed more towards love or was this headed more towards fear?
But one thing that's really beautiful about this practice is that unlike most binary opposites,
we talk about good or bad, right or wrong, success or failure or something like this,
that when we bring up these pairs, there's often like a grabbing for one of them and a rejecting of the other.
But with love and fear, if we wanted to orient towards love, then it doesn't require that we push away fear.
It doesn't require that we shove fear or ignore it or anything like this.
Instead, we just love the fear.
So not negating it as much as loving it to death in some kind of way.
And some of you know that in some of the Buddhist teachings is this idea that loving kindness as a protection.
And maybe this is one way is that we might think of a protection is that love or loving kindness is a way to help us out of fear.
So if we don't want to live in fear, maybe to cultivate and develop loving kindness.
So what does this mean to love, fear?
It means to acknowledge that it's there.
It means to allow ourselves to say, yeah, this, this is scary. This is frightening.
Maybe it's something that's obvious that we kind of move or they change a job or relationship status is changing or something like this.
But there's also so many things that we have fear about that are not so tangible and obvious fear of standing up for ourselves.
Fear of really speaking our truth with kindness, but still our truth.
Maybe there's a way in which we so often are holding back.
So one way to love fear is to just acknowledge.
Yeah, there's some hesitation here. There's some unwillingness.
There's some kind of like a psychologist like Jesus word arousal like the nervous system is, is upregulated in some kind of way.
Maybe we don't even know exactly how to describe it.
So our loving kindness practice if we have a way in which we can tune into our hearts if we can tune into the well wishing the goodness that we all have inside of us.
Sometimes it's maybe a little bit more accessible than other times.
So it's a loving kindness practice just making it more accessible so that then even when we are in fear and I don't want to talk about fear when there's, you know, the tiger that's right there about a pound.
So I mean that's a whole different thing than what I'm talking about here so imminent physical danger.
The car is careening or something like that. That's something completely different.
I don't know about fear of, I don't know, sometimes we have fear that's maybe not even clearly articulated or clearly understood but just this hesitation.
And so, without a kindness practice, it kind of like increase our capacity that we can be with some of these nebulous uncomfortable experiences.
And sometimes this was years ago.
I used to like at the end of the day I used to like do like this little tally okay did I spend more of my day and love or more of it in fear.
And again recognizing these are giant buckets.
And we is a little aside there's some people who really dislike putting things in giant buckets. They prefer to kind of like tease things apart.
There's some people who like to put things in giant buckets. I'm in one of those people and if you're not that's okay maybe this practice isn't for you but it can be helpful though just to think about okay.
How much was fear kind of running the show and how much was love running the show.
I love this poem again.
There are only two feelings. Love and fear.
There are only two languages.
Love and fear.
There are only two activities.
Love and fear.
To help us be with love let's do some loving kindness practice.
And so we'll take a meditation posture if you haven't already.
I'm just going to mute us just so we can without good meditation sometimes what doesn't seem noisy to you just because it happens near the microphone is noisy to us.
So you have to be glad you're microphone.
Feeling into this moment.
Sit and know you're sitting.
Bringing attention to the sensations in the body.
Sometimes it's easiest to start with the most obvious.
For example the pressure against the body.
The body is resting on the chair cushion bench.
Noticing any areas that have some tightness or tension.
And as best we can bringing some softness some warmth to those areas some caring awareness.
There will be lessening of the tension, maybe not to no guarantees.
Time to rest the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
The expansion and contraction with the breath.
What does it feel like to breathe.
What are the sensations associated with breathing.
What are the sensations associated with breathing.
What are the sensations associated with breathing.
When the mind wanders.
Just very simply gently begin again without making it a problem or something we have to fix.
We just want to just as ourselves or make a story about it.
What are the sensations associated with breathing.
What are the sensations associated with breathing.
Then to begin our loving kindness practice.
Bringing to mind a level of being.
Someone for whom it's easy and complicated.
To have warm hearted feelings towards.
Connecting with this level of being.
To help support our connection and our cultivating loving kindness.
We can say these phrases.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be happy.
May you be happy.
May you be happy.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
And then to extend our loving kindness.
To a dear one, a good friend, a family member.
Sometimes our friends we love them dearly and yet to others maybe not as smooth as someone with a lovable being.
Maybe there's tiny little hiccups just perfectly fine.
Giving a friend or family member to mind.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you live with ease.
And then to expand our loving kindness to ourselves.
In my view it's important to always include ourselves. Sometimes we exclude ourselves and care.
Sometimes we bring into mind either the felt sense of what it's like to be here this moment or visualizing yourself.
People like to visualize when they were children, some as they are now, whichever feels the most comfortable and accessible.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
What is it like to orient ourselves towards love, towards kindness?
Maybe not in any grand way. Just go in that particular direction.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
And then to extend our loving kindness to a neutral person, somebody we don't know, we don't have a relationship with.
Somebody on the Zoom call, somebody you see in the neighborhood on occasion.
Bring this person to mind.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
Sometimes it takes a little bit more effort than a neutral person.
Because we're not emotionally entangled with them in any way.
We can slip out of the mind.
We can just begin again.
And then we'll end this meditation with some equanimity practice.
Bring this person to mind, somebody that you care about, and is a little bit irksome sometimes.
We probably all have somebody like this in our life.
And for equanimity practice, we'll use a different phrase.
I mean the little bit irksome person to mind.
I care about you and I cannot make your choices for you.
I care about you and I cannot make your choices for you.
I care about you and I cannot make your choices for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's possible that I didn't share that audio very well or not at all.
Maybe you didn't hear the bell.
Maybe you saw my computer instead.
So, ding.
So technical error on my part.
Yeah.
Love and fear.
There are only two feelings.
Love and fear.
Two languages.
Love and fear.
Two activities.
Two motives.
Two procedures.
Two frameworks.
Two results.
Love and fear.
Love and fear.
Maybe you think, oh, this is a great idea.
Maybe you think like, I don't know.
This just seems like awful and I don't quite get it.
I've heard it explained that there's two types of people in the world.
The lumpers and the splitters.
And so,
those people who like to kind of like put things together into big
categories and those who like to kind of tease apart all the
differences and really look at the exceptions and really highlight
those.
And never the train shall they meet.
And I've co-taught with some people that are splitters and some
that are lumpers.
And I can't help myself.
I'm a really hardcore lumper.
I like to kind of look at the commonalities and how things are the
same.
And some people do like to look how they're different.
And I'm just saying this because clearly this poet is a
lumper.
Love and fear.
Everything's in one lump together with one or the other.
If you were a lumper, what do you think of this idea of
contrasting fear with love?
Setting these up as two possibilities, two orientations, two
ways of being in the world.
So I like to put you in some breakout rooms where you can talk
about this with each other.
And maybe explore this
idea of love and fear.
Put you into groups of three or four.
And be in for about 13 minutes or so.
We'll go back here and do a little bit of balancing.
Okay.
So those of you who have been coming here often, you for how
many times have you heard me say this?
I'll just say it so that everybody's on the same page.
It's helpful not to say everything you know about this
topic or every idea that you have.
Just say one point.
And then let it go to the next person.
They say one point.
That goes to another next person.
They say one point.
And then it comes back around to you.
And now you have heard other ideas or different expressions
and maybe there's, you have a new idea.
So instead of informing others about what you know,
create the conditions in which everybody can maybe like have
some new ideas, some new understanding,
some new thoughts about it.
So if it's helpful, you can go in the order of the first digit
of your house number.
If you live on 100 Main Street, number one, you'll go first.
Okay.
Here we go.
Welcome back.
Welcome back.
Anybody have a comment or something they'd like to share?
Yes, Michael.
Hi, Michael.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Great.
I found my happiness seeds were very much watered.
Very, very sweet.
Yeah.
So thank you for your teachings and thank you,
Sangha and especially small groupies.
Small groupies.
That's a nice way of saying it.
Thank you, Michael.
Yes, yes.
I'm happy to hear that.
And anybody else have a comment, something they'd like to add or say?
Yes, Charles Lee.
Thanks.
Just to remind me of the love, fear, I guess, pho dichotomy.
I remember the Buddha saying I teach one thing and one thing only,
suffering at its end.
And I was like, well, that's two things.
Feel like this is kind of the same.
Is it really two things or love and fear?
Or are they two different manifestations of the same emotion?
I didn't hear the last thing you said.
You said, are they really the same emotion?
Are they really?
Oh, yeah.
Are they really different things?
Or are they actually two different manifestations of the same?
They're in the same water, strong emotion.
Yeah.
That's a great question.
Thank you, Charles Lee, for asking it.
And I think it's worthwhile to investigate for ourselves.
How does it feel when I feel love?
I feel tingly or spacious or giddy or,
how do I feel when I feel fear?
And just like to, like, oh, there's a tingly,
maybe feeling in the body also.
Is that the same?
Is it different?
Sometimes they feel like the same.
Maybe sometimes they feel really different.
I appreciate very much what you're saying, Charles Lee.
Kind of like, let's look at this.
We have all these assumptions about what is love.
We have all these assumptions about what is fear.
But let's see for ourselves.
Thank you.
Thank you, Charles Lee.
Jerry.
Thank you.
So I don't have my glasses on, but I was thinking,
you know, this dichotomy of love and fear,
Charles Lee's point and others, that maybe it's a,
let's take COVID.
Some people might say, oh, you know, you're not loving us
because you're not coming over here
because you're so fearful of getting infected or whatever.
But you could actually be loving because you're fearful
with a good reason about getting Omnicon, whatever it is,
whatever version.
And so you take precautions.
So I don't, out of love, that may have good foundations
and fear.
So you don't come over to someone's house
because you don't infect them.
You don't want to get yourself infected.
So I kind of think in that instance, maybe the fact
could have a false dichotomy of love and fear.
In fact, you could be doing both and actually loving
both people, yourself and the others,
by taking good precautions with respect to becoming infected
with a potential leaf of virus.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So kind of looking at our motivations.
Maybe they're mixed.
Maybe there's, you know, it's love and fear.
Maybe we don't need to make a distinction between them.
Thank you.
Thank you, Jerry.
Jamie.
Well, you know, I always love these small groups.
And tonight I just felt like we each looked at the
meditation and just the two buckets you gave us in
different ways.
But we seem to do really well at hearing each other.
And I saw more ways of seeing the buckets after the
conversation that I did on my own.
So it was a wonderful gift from my groupies.
But something happened tonight that has never happened
to me before.
And it leaves me with a very unresolved feeling.
Yeah.
And that's that, you know, no names,
but there was someone in our group who didn't reveal
themselves and didn't participate.
And I feel like in the year I've come,
like I've gotten something out of almost everyone in
every one of the small groups.
And there was a person who probably had a gift for me as
something that I could benefit from that I didn't get.
And so I'm a little sad about that.
And I hope it doesn't happen next time.
I hope that, you know, hope that person will share.
So Jamie, just so I understand.
So they didn't have the video on and you didn't hear a
peep from them.
Is that right?
So it could have been somebody just left their computer and
was taking the dog for a walk or something.
Sure.
Oh, sure.
I'm worried this is perilously close to criticism.
That's not my intent at all.
You know, I just,
I know I can gain from all of you because I have,
I've been doing it for a year.
It's been incredible.
And I just wanted to keep up.
So thank you to all of you for making me feel that way.
Yeah, right.
Just is an amazing thing that we've created here.
Right.
But thank you, Jamie, for saying that. Yeah.
And of course,
I don't know who these people are when I put them into small
groups, whether they're still present or not.
So, and I apologize if that's happened.
I know sometimes Nikki or she in the past,
she has told me that she's made some,
some announcement along the lines of,
if you're planning on attending,
just leave as opposed to still being connected or still being
there.
Thank you for saying that, Jamie.
Okay.
So love and fear are life.
Yeah.
If Charles Lee writes, if I didn't love anything,
would I fear anything?
Right.
It's kind of interesting to see how these two emotions,
I'll use that word really are the relationship between them.
And it's worth that.
It's worth an exploration, I think,
for all of us,
how they influence one another.
Okay.
So if you'd like to unmute, we can say goodbye.
And really wave perhaps.
Bye-bye.
And thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you, everyone.
It's great to be with you all.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Thanks everybody.
Bye-bye.
Take care.
Bye.
Good night.
Good night.
