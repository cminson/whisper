The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Now, I'll just offer a few reflections.
And after that, we'll have plenty of time to discuss what's coming up in our practice,
any questions or thoughts you have.
So, Sayada Utejenia, the Burmese master,
tells us that awareness alone is not enough.
This brings up the question, what else do we need?
And one answer given in one of the suttas is that we need to be able to discern
what will lead to long-term welfare and happiness and what will not.
Most of us are here to alleviate suffering or stress in our lives.
So, here's what is expressed in an excerpt from Asuta in the Middle East Discourses, number 135.
This is the way leading to discernment.
When visiting a contemplative or Brahmin to ask,
What is skillful, venerable sir?
What is unskillful?
What is blame-worthy?
What is blame-less?
What should be cultivated?
What should not be cultivated?
What, having been done by me, will be for my long-term harm and suffering?
Or what, having been done by me, will be for my long-term welfare and happiness?
So, the excerpt suggesting that we can learn from teachers which things are skillful and unskillful
and which things are wise conduct,
which things will lead to long-term welfare and happiness instead of suffering.
And, of course, teachers and Dharma discussions can definitely help point us in the right direction.
Having said that, though, our direct experiences during meditation and daily life with awareness are our most significant teachers.
These experiences help us truly get to know what the teachers have pointed towards, but we have to experience it.
So, in the guided meditation we did at the beginning of this evening, there were invitations to notice with awareness what is present,
what else is here, and to recognize when something felt wholesome, when something felt unwholesome, without getting caught up in it.
These are just pointers towards discerning what things will lead to long-term welfare and happiness.
So, through our meditation, our sitting practice, and our daily life mindfulness, we get to know our conditioning, our stress, our suffering.
We get to understand what arises by means of this continued and renewed practice of awareness.
And this unveils different layers or kinds of experience.
So, we practice sitting meditation and receiving experiences.
Being alert to what's actually coming up right now in the mind, those are what I might call unfoldings of what we're experiencing.
So, we just continue to allow awareness to show us experience as it changes, and we can be very attentive as it becomes more apparent what's happening,
rather than just kind of mentally checking off something that we see and then letting the mind drift.
So, instead of like, okay, pain, right, we stay with it, and we renew the awareness and the attention, and that allows curiosity.
That's a kind of curiosity that allows us to see what is actually happening in the mind.
And that's different than trying to have certain types of experience.
Perhaps you've noticed at times if you try to have an experience or you pursue it or force it, it just continues to elude you,
or it can lead to a lot of mental proliferation and more suffering, one big headache,
or it can lead to a kind of faking it when we're pretending to have the experience to ourselves, but some part of us knows we're not feeling it.
An example of that might be what happens when restlessness is present during a sitting.
We might be sitting and not realizing that we're not very present.
Instead, a bunch of thoughts are arising.
I really should have started this meditation earlier.
I have so much to do, or we might think specific thoughts about doing a certain task.
And if we try to push those thoughts away, we might just get more uncomfortable feeling the tension of fighting our experience.
If we sit really still kind of faking it while still feeling really tense and jumpy, we'll continue to experience mostly stress.
But if instead we relax into allowing what is actually going on, recognizing restlessness, thinking, planning, allowing that that is what's happening,
and remaining aware of what else is arising with it, curiosity can show us more about the experience.
So we could notice that our body is getting very tense as we're thinking, oh, I've got this to do, I've got that to do.
Or while we're trying to sit still, but really we're very restless.
And just that light curiosity helps us to recognize, oh, I'm starting to judge myself for being restless.
But if we sit down with an attitude of curiosity, an attitude of allowing awareness to arise and pass of this and that, it opens up wisdom.
It shows us patterns of our conditioning.
And this light touch of curiosity or investigation will show us more when conditions are ripe for it.
And sometimes this comes after we've been aware of something arising again and again and again and again and again until finally the mind gets more curious.
Why this again? What's needed for this to let go?
As an example, the mind might get curious about the pattern of restlessness and see we've been spending most of our time every day rushing around and multitasking, and that that is what is present when we sit down to meditate.
Or sometimes an insight or an inspiration will spontaneously arise.
Maybe we'll be aware there's a shift.
Sometimes something's fallen away that used to be an affliction.
So maybe we used to think, oh, I'm so restless. I can't do this meditation.
But now we see restlessness is just a natural consequence of a busy day.
And we might even have the insight that if we allow ourselves more time to unwind or even just make a mental restlessness, every time we notice it in meditation, we start to watch it relax and fall away over the course of the meditation.
So these are ways that awareness, curiosity can gradually allow us to discern what's helpful, what's more skillful, what leads to wisdom and freedom from suffering.
So now there's plenty of time for your own experience.
