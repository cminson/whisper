Particularly in light of the homework so-called that we provided on Thursday, just encouraging
people to reread, reconsider these two suttas, Majumma Nakaya 29 and 107, with an eye to
their practice, how, as we hope people are finding, how the suttas, how sutta study
can be kind of brought into practice in ways that make the suttas come alive and also help
keep practice vibrant and alive.
So curious if there's any questions, reflections from the last couple of days.
Feel free to put some things in the chat if you want or raise a hand.
Zoom hand preferred so we make sure we see it.
But you know, feel free to wave a hand or shake a leg if you can't find a zoom hand.
Susan.
Hi, good morning.
You know, I noticed that one of you, I think Kim, probably all of you, are referring to
Bikko Bodhi's translation as well, and I'm wondering if that would be a good strategy
for us as well to find other translations and look at those in conjunction with the translation
that was provided.
That's a really great question, Susan, and yeah, it can be very instructive and also
very inspiring to consider alternative translations of both words and whole texts, and we particularly
find ourselves drawn to the site called Sutta Central, and maybe somebody could put a link
into that if you're not aware of it, where you'll find for all of these discourses, sometimes
multiple translations in various languages about Bikko Bodhi, I would say, I think it's
safe to say the four of us probably go to Bikko Bodhi first.
He has created a whole body of work of translation with incredible care and sophistication and
great technique, real artist translator, artist and scientist, very complete text with very
wonderfully annotated and footnoted comments.
In addition, Bikko Sujato, who is sort of behind Sutta Central, has wonderful translations
that sometimes have a more contemporary feel.
I see Diana has unmuted, she's an expert here, let me see if she has something to add.
Yeah, maybe I'll just add that, I'll say, if I'm doing Sutta study, I'll look at Bikko
Bodhi because it is really close to the poly, whereas if I'm giving a dermatoc, I'll look
at Bikko Sujato on Sutta Central, as David says, the more contemporary, not as close
to the poly, but is given a flavor of what's happening.
Part of the reason why we gave the link to Sutta Central is because it's freely available.
Bikko Bodhi's translations, you have to have these, the books, you need to purchase the
books where we can't do the copyright, just give those out.
We are looking at both and I just wanted to share how I use the two different translators.
Thank you.
Here's the Bikko Bodhi Majama Nakaya with my multiple colored inserts and the annotation
of my own, but it's a large volume and with the various Suttas, there are five of these.
So yeah, it's easy to go online, everybody, I see Kim also raised hers.
We have these always at the left or right hand because that's the first place to go.
In addition, I'm just going to put in a plug for Sutta Central to say, as Diana mentioned,
if you care about the poly, you can view it in various ways and some translations, Sujaptas,
include the ability to see the poly either side by side or line by line with the English
translation and so Sutta Central is a very powerful tool.
It has a chord, what do we call them, concordances and indexes and way to search for things.
Enough said about that, Nancy.
Nancy and my friend.
I kind of forgot what my point was I was going to make, I was so stunned by all of your tabs
on your book there, I was wondering how do you find what you need with all of those tabs?
It's like you almost have as many tabs as there are pages, so how do you find it?
Are they color coded for particular things?
You know, at the risk of making this about me, since I was in graduate school, I do use
a color coded system for notifications and tabs and at the top of the volume, you'll
see there are many fewer and these take me directly to things like the Satipatama Sutta.
Other ones where, as Diana said, in creating talks or going back again and again, I find
it useful to go.
Did you have another question?
Sorry to sidetrack you.
No, I sort of just, I had been reflecting the whole thing about the tree, the heartwood
and the tree just really touched me and all of these analogies keep going off in my brain
about it.
One being in California with the fires, it's really the heartwood and the trees that make
the trees continue to exist after fire, right?
Because it's the one thing that saves the life of the tree.
Another thing is that the heartwood or the tree doesn't remain strong unless there are
the leaves or the branches, I mean, it really is a living whole.
I think somebody made that point earlier and no one part really exists without the other,
which reminds me of our practice, which is not linear, but it all sort of feeds, continually
feeds the practice.
Nice observations and it's really true that letting these similes come alive in our practice
is something we're really trying to make accessible.
We don't have to think about them in one way.
You mentioned fires, of course, in the case of redwoods, the bark provides a protection
against fire and the cones only open with fire.
There's just a hundred ways to go around these and bring them into each of our own practices
and make the simile our own, make the practice our own.
Thanks for that, Nancy.
And the outer bark and that when it protects the tree is also the newest part of the tree
so that when you're learning all the time, it still can be protective and, I don't know,
you know what I'm saying.
Thank you.
Anyway, thank you.
No, you bet.
The hands are now popping up fast and furious.
Let me take just one more question now and then we'll have additional time for questions
coming up.
But let me go, I'm going to, I'm going to, Winnie, if I can ask you to hold on for just
a moment.
Let me go to Joni, whose voice we haven't heard, I think, yet in this class.
So Joni, oh, could you unmute?
There we go.
I'm finding a little fun.
Thank you.
Yeah, I was mentioning to my husband this morning, today's Earth Day, and we're talking about
hardwood and the trees and I, and I, and I really relate to this, that you're sharing
all this wisdom with us or helping us develop our own wisdom and open up to more teachings
and the trees have this underground growth system going where they're always helping
each other.
They share nutrients, they share water, food, and they support each other.
And in the case of redwoods, like you said, the bark keeps them protected.
Aspen's have all these other, they can have acres and acres and acres of one tree that
shoots up to thousands of trees.
And I relate that to the teachings and you're sharing your wisdom with us.
Yeah.
Thank you so much and happy Earth Day.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Wonderful point.
And it's interesting just that we become, we know more about how trees interact as communities
now than perhaps it was appreciated at the Buddhist time.
Can't say that for sure.
Sometimes ancient cultures had, you know, a more, more profound understanding of the interconnections
of life than we do.
But again, lovely to bring the simile alive into practice.
So I've written down Winnie and Will, we'll keep that in mind as we, when we open the
next Q&A period, keep your question in mind.
Let me turn it over to Diana for our first teaching.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What a delight.
I don't know.
I feel like, oh, our being trees and like connected.
I love this and nourished by the sun and the rain and each other.
I just love this.
So I echo this happy Earth Day to everybody.
So I wanted to just bring in something, maybe a theme that we've been talking about in this
class and that is that there are times in which we might be stopping short or veering
off the path.
Another way we might say this is that we just have some resistance or maybe just a little
bit of like struggle with this feeling like, yeah, I don't really want you today.
You know, just this, yeah, or this is natural.
This is part of what I want to say.
It's a natural part of practice.
It is not a personal feeling.
It is not a character flaw.
It's natural that the mind will rebel when we're trying to train it.
It's just whatever, no matter whether it's a meditation practice or learning to crochet
or how to change the oil in the car or whatever it is, there's a way in which sometimes there's
this a little bit of resistance.
And so what can we do to support us with this?
Recognizing that we don't have to beat ourselves up.
We don't have to make it be about us as much as recognizing, oh yeah, this too is part
of the path of practice.
And so I'd like to share an awakening poem, those we've been doing many of our classes
will recognize this poem, but I feel really touched by this poem, so I like to share it.
And this is a poem where from somebody, this is from the Buddha's time, thousands of years
ago, written by a woman who was maybe not so differently than Ganaka Mogulana, whom
we meet in Manjumma 107, who was wondering about this training.
Other people train.
Do you guys train?
Padachara, the author of this poem, she also is having a similar question, but she finds
her way with it.
So the poem goes like this, plowing fields with plows, sowing seeds in the ground, caring
for children and family, people being wealth.
So she's noticing that other people are getting fruits of their labor.
Then she asks, why is it that I, thorough and virtuous conduct, doing the Buddha's instructions,
not lazy or proud, have not attained release?
So why doesn't she find the fruits of her labor?
Just like other people are.
And so she says that she is doing the training.
She says that she has thorough and virtuous conduct doing the Buddha's instruction, but
she doesn't see the fruits of her practice.
But the poem continues, I watched the water, the foot washing water flow from high ground
to low, with this, the mind concentrated, like a thoroughbred horse, taking an oiled
lamp, I entered my hut and looking over the bed, I sat down on the bed.
So she's practicing with just ordinary experiences.
If there's no pavement and no shoes, you wash your feet very often.
And she's just getting ready for sleep.
So she's taking her lamp into her room and she's looking at the bed, sitting down on
the bed.
And then the poem continues, taking a needle, I pulled out the wick.
As the flame went out, the mind was freed.
It's fantastic, right, that she's practicing just with what's happening.
So after creating the foundation of this training, she finds freedom in an ordinary experience,
how many times had she turned off a lamp in her lifetime, countless times.
So this poem is pointing to using the foundation of the training, but maybe we might be expecting
that there's got to be, we have to do something extraordinary or do something different than
what's being pointed to.
But this poem is pointing to just living our ordinary life.
So I want to share another poem that talks about like inspiration, like sometimes we
do feel like, I don't really want to, I don't, there's just this resistance, you know, other
things seem more important or maybe we feel like we don't have the energy.
This poem was written by a poet who was inspired by these women's poems.
So the poet is not a woman, the poet is from today, contemporary time, but this poet was
inspired by some of these early Buddhist women.
The poet is a Mediwine gust and it's entitled Dantica and this poem goes like this.
While walking along the river after a long day meditating on Vultures Peak, I watched
an elephant splashing its way out of the water and up the bank.
Hello, my friend, the person waiting there said scratching the elephant behind its ear.
Did you have a good bath?
Elephant stretched out its leg, the person climbed up and the two of them rode off like
that together.
Seeing what had been once so wild, now a friend and a companion to this good person, I took
a seat under the nearest tree and reached out a gentle hand to my own mind.
Suddenly I thought, this is why I came to the woods.
So this poet here is describing finding inspiration, just noticing an ordinary sight, an ancient
India, an elephant, I don't know if everybody had contact with them all the time, but this
is just an elephant taking a bath, coming out and the person interacting with them.
So again, the author that's being referred to here begins with after a long day meditating
on Vultures Peak.
So just again pointing to having invested the training, then somehow imbues the heart
in the mind with some sensitivity that might notice ordinary things in a new way that provides
inspiration.
So when we are feeling a sense of resistance, when we want to stop on this path or veer
off, I might say instead of entangling ourselves more with this resistance or so entangling
ourselves with the struggle or even like struggling with the struggle or resisting with the resistance,
instead, can we take it as feedback when we notice this resistance, like, oh, something's
here, something to pay attention to, and can we settle back and open up?
And maybe we can drop in this question, what is happening now that I'm not open to?
Sometimes we can get tight and just keep on struggling and struggling, but can we maybe
take a step back, maybe drop in this question, what is happening now that I'm not open to?
And it's asking the question rather than finding the answer that is the way forward, asking
the question in which that we are getting into the present moment and tuning into ourselves.
And this is a way in which we can not align with the practice.
And we might even say that the Buddha recognized that this resistance, I'm using this word
resistance, you know, stopping short, veering off, struggling, aversion, he recognized this
and put it as an integral part of this path of practice for those of you who are familiar
with the Eightfold Path will recognize wise effort, which we might summarize and maybe
use some colloquial language to wise effort as in with the helpful and out with the unhelpful.
So noticing what is unhelpful, noticing what is helpful in finding our way on this path.
And part of our practice, of course, is to becoming sensitive to what is helpful and
what is not helpful, just like maybe in these poems.
So I said that can we like settle back and open up and maybe drop in this question about
emotions or maybe there's or what is it that's not being seen and maybe it's some difficult
emotions or this feeling of discomfort, but just as in the same way, there might be some
unseen views that are being clung to some unseen beliefs that were being clung to there.
Maybe the power is that they're unseen, maybe not so aware of them.
And I think in some of the stories that we saw in Majama 29, similar to the Heartwood
in Majama 107, Ganaka Mogulana, that we see some of these views that are brought forth
and maybe because they're exaggerated, we think like, I'm not like that.
But are there ways in which we are a little bit like that?
Maybe not using the exact language there, for example, maybe we do have a little bit
of complacency, just because of the amount of progress that we have, or maybe we have
a little bit of pride, maybe I don't know if pride is the right word.
But this feeling like, well, you know, I've done this, what more do I need to do?
For example, in Majama 29, section four, this language describing a practitioner being diligent,
they achieve concentration.
They're happy with that.
They've got all they wished for.
And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that.
I'm the one with concentration and unified mind.
Those others, they lack concentration and they have strained minds.
And so they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding that accomplishment and
concentration and being negligent, they live in suffering.
We might think like, I'm not going to do that, but I'll tell this little story.
And one time I was on a really long retreat and, you know, I had plenty of time for the
mind to get settled and to get quiet.
And just in particular, on this one day, I was able to just, I don't know, tapped into
something that was different and felt really quiet.
So when the bell rang for the end of the sitting meditation, I thought, I'm not ready to get
up.
I'm just going to keep sitting.
Then I walked set for a while.
Then the end of the next session, the walking session, where is the bell?
I could hear the bell in the other room for the walking and the walking, but I thought,
you know, maybe I'm going to stay here a little bit.
I shifted my posture a little bit and settled in for the next sitting.
This is not my usual thing.
It's not something that I do all the time, but at that time it seemed possible.
And then I sat through that second sitting.
And then I thought, like, wow, more than me, I sat through all this, a sit, walk, sit.
And I didn't think I was doing that until later that day, I was late to one of the sits.
I walked in late, which I don't like to do.
It's, you know, discouraged on retreat.
But I noticed the mind going, like, it's okay, I walked in late.
I'm the one that did the sit, walk, sit earlier in the day, so I could show it late.
So there's this way in which we don't even notice how what we've done or what we've accomplished
is a, affects us.
So just when we feel like we're struggling, is there just to notice if there's some unseen
maybe beliefs or views that are happening, and then of course, in Majama 107, the Buddha
is saying, Nibbana exists, the path leading to Nibbana exists, and I am present as the
guide yet when my disciples have been advised and instructed by me, some of them attain
Nibbana and some do not.
What can I do about that?
I'm the one who shows the way, and plus it is they are the one that has to do the work.
But just some unseen view that we might have is notice if we have some beliefs that sometime
we will find the perfect practice or the perfect teacher.
Maybe we're holding back a little bit thinking that okay, I'm not quite sure about this one.
I need to wait to find the absolutely perfect one.
And I appreciate very much that Jack Cornfield, he tells his story, who he was a student of
Ajahn Chah.
Some of you may know, he's recognized Ajahn Chah as one of the greatest meditation masters
in the 20th century.
And Jack Cornfield is a Westerner having some hoots goes to Ajahn Chah and says, you don't
seem very enlightened to me, can you imagine, Ajahn Chah, he replies, it's good that I don't
seem enlightened to you, because then you'd still be looking for enlightenment outside
of yourself, pointing to you'd still be looking for the perfect teacher, the perfect practice
or something like this.
So maybe even though we might have heard this practice or the instructions, we're not quite
following them because we're still waiting to feel like the perfect ones.
So just wanted to offer some ways in which we might put together some of this what we're
learning in Madama 29 and 107 about supports for us for when we are finding resistance
towards the practice when we might be stopping short or veering off.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.
Thank you, Diana, that was wonderful.
Now is a chance for you to talk a bit among yourselves and talk a little bit about this
issue of orienting toward the path and working with your own mind as we go along.
So we'll have some breakout groups.
And just as a reminder, it would be just a time to really share about your own practice
and appreciate what you're hearing from others.
So we're not trying to give advice or anything like that or convince people of things.
So the questions to consider with your small group of three or four are, first of all,
what do you use as kind of a North Star for your practice?
And that doesn't mean the ideal.
We just heard we're not looking for something perfect.
But what is it that draws your mind as something to orient around?
And that can be different for different people.
And you might get ideas from the other folks in your group.
Maybe you look more toward people or practices or you have a certain sense in your body of
what helps guide you.
And then the second question, which is kind of a refinement or a sub question of that is,
what are the orienting values that guide your practice?
Maybe a sense.
I don't want to put any words in your mouth, but what are the inspirations that draw you?
Are you drawn to peace and tranquility, to harmony, to kindness?
What helps you know when you're on track or not?
Diana pointed toward knowing, having a feeling in our system of what is on track or not.
And somebody may be able to put these in the chat.
I could do that, actually.
Okay, so you'll have a bit of time to talk about this and enjoy.
Okay, hello, welcome back.
Nice to see everyone.
So we can have an opportunity for some questions or comments.
And I wanted to make sure that we included Winnie and Will, who had their hands up earlier.
You could comment on the breakout rooms or if your question or comment is still relevant.
Winnie, would you like to offer something?
I'll just be really quick, because when you were talking about restraints, I remember
I heard that somewhere, and it was in the Dhammapada in your class.
So I went back and looked at it, and I don't need to go into it, but it made it much clearer
what you were talking about as part of our discussion on Thursday.
So I just want to share with you that if anyone has a copy of the Dhammapada, it's in there
and it's very succinct about what restraint means.
Oh, great.
Well, thank you.
One of the fruits that we hope people will have from Suta Study is the ability to recognize
that an idea is something that they've seen somewhere else in the teachings, and to go
look that up and then realize, ah, this one in the Madhya Maha supports something in the
Dhammapada that I didn't understand before or adds a new dimension.
That's a skill, actually, to start to be able to do that.
Thank you so much, Winnie.
And Will, did you want to comment?
Well, yeah, I don't know whether this would be a distraction or not, but the question
kind of lingers from last time, too.
And that is in Majma 107, it seems like, you know, when they're kind of laying out a path
there or describing it, that it stops with the jhanas, with the fourth jhana.
And then it talks about, you know, if you're an arhat, continue doing this.
If you're not an arhat, yeah.
So I just wonder if that's a peculiarity of this particular Suta, because I know other
places it doesn't just stop with the jhanas, right?
It's an interesting question, yeah, that this MN107, I noticed that also doesn't explicitly
reference insight and awakening as the fruit of jhana practice.
And I don't know that I have a clear explanation for why that is, except that it's maybe, it's
focusing on what the Buddha is teaching someone, how he's restraining or disciplining them,
as it says in the texts.
And so there's this series of steps early on, and then he sends them off to the forest
to cultivate jhana.
And that's, maybe it's showing us that that's kind of the extent of what a teacher does.
They give the instructions all the way to the culmination of the mind in jhana.
And then it's kind of not up to either the teacher or us at that point to move on into
the insight stages.
That's just my pasted on explanation, if any of the other teachers want to comment.
But it seems like in the spirit of the text, it's more about the process than about the
insights that come from it.
I love that answer, Kim.
I think that's right, and it kind of goes back to the distinction made yesterday and
also by Diana this morning of sort of what the teacher, how the teacher points the way
that responsibility and then the practitioner and then the practice.
And Diana this morning in the poem, the first poem, mentioned that this practitioner notices
water falling, right, that this, this momentum is created in the mind by practice, and it
has its own momentum.
And I think that jives nicely with your response.
Thanks, it's a good question.
Yeah.
Other thoughts?
How was that breakout room?
That fruitful, interesting, yeah, Eileen.
Sorry about that.
It was a little slow.
Good morning, everyone.
I'm really lovely to see you all.
I feel funny because I always used to be one of those people who never said anything, and
it seems like I keep saying things.
But what, at first I went blank when I saw these questions about North Star, but I realized
that the thing that kind of keeps, basically, a lot of what keeps me going is, a lot of it
is the third and fourth noble truths, which offer, you know, that there is a way out that
this isn't necessarily inevitable, that we'd just be miserable all the time and then just
have to go see a movie or go talk to our girlfriend or whatever to relieve the suffering temporarily,
but it's different, you know, that we don't have, also have to wait for a savior to come
down and fix it all for us, that we can take action for ourselves.
I realized as everyone was talking to that suffering is a lot of what keeps me on track,
and honestly, death, also, is a big one because it seems to me that in the Maranasati kinds
of context, people said, you know, since you're not going to be here forever, you better get
on with it.
You better get on with your enlightenment or otherwise you're going to be a heap of
bones and not enlightening, you know, so to, to wake up before it's too late, basically.
It's the message of that.
So I don't have a regular Maranasati practice, and I often have resisted that, but it's,
it's really that fear that, you know, I don't, I don't want to come back here, so that kind
of keeps me going too.
Appreciate everyone this morning.
Thank you.
Thank you, Aivine.
Yeah, just to highlight the, the word that you use Maranasati, that means mindfulness
of death, which is one of the practices among many that the Buddha offered to, as an inspiration,
actually, people who, you know, aren't familiar with Buddhism can sometimes find that surprising
that there's this direct emphasis on death, but many people have found it to be motivating.
I actually heard you name two sides, which is quite beautiful.
You know, there's the side that kind of spurs us on, like, oh, I'm not free yet, or death
is coming, and how am I going to be able to meet that well?
And then there's the inspirational side of the third and fourth Noble Truths.
Ah, there's freedom possible, there's peace possible, and, you know, some people choose
one side or the other, or different ones at different times, but they're like the front
and the back of the hand, they can both lead us onward, whether we are moving away from
suffering or toward freedom, it's the same movement.
So thank you so much for articulating that.
And that was part of the point of the question.
You said it first, you weren't sure what to make of the question, it can help to kind
of think explicitly, oh, yeah, I do have things that I orient around, and maybe we haven't
quite directed our mind to that yet, and it can change, by the way.
So whatever you chose, don't grasp onto it forever, because it might shift through the
course of the path.
There's another short comment we could.
All right, well, then I'm happy to pass it on to Ying.
Actually, to David, I answer to Ying, that works for me, but no, no, let's, before we
have another teaching from Ying, let's sit together in meditation a little bit and bring
the teachings suggested by these two suttas directly into a guided meditation practice
of about 15 minutes.
So join me, join us, join one another in finding your way back to your meditation posture, bringing
the eyes down to a relaxed place, if that feels comfortable.
And as we do so, enjoying maybe, certainly recognizing the subtle rebalances that happen
as we bring our attention inward, bring our attention away from the visual stimulation
to the inner life, rebalancing a little bit maybe the head and the heart, bringing our
attention down inward and down into the body, taking note of the breath in the body, and
noticing there too, the natural balance that we can enjoy and take advantage of with each
in breath, a little spritz of energy, we don't have to make anything up in our practice, we
don't have to look outside, we don't have to imagine, we can just be aware that when
oxygen hits the bloodstream with each in breath, there's a little bit of energy available.
And that with each out breath, there's a letting go, we can just enjoy these rebalances as
we enter the meditation.
And then perhaps in this meditation as a way of invoking these wonderful suttas, we can
briefly touch in with the heartwood of our practice to protect ourselves against stopping
short.
That is, maybe we can set an intention for this sip.
And just as in the poem that Diana read and her commentary, we don't need to look outside
ourselves, somewhere in this bringing ourselves into meditation, you may find some warm heartedness
or some ease or some stillness, some opening up some sensitivity some connection, some clarity.
And there we find the heartwood of the practice, something that something that leads forward
something that points the way something that keeps us keeps us in the path.
Maybe we can touch in with a little humility that also points forward and onward.
Maybe our intention for the sip, maybe our touching in with the heartwood is very simple,
just to keep coming back here, noticing the here and now of our experience, bringing the
breath back to the center or the foreground of our experience over and over again.
Maybe touching in with the heartwood, setting an intention in the outset of our sip can
take the form of
being attentive to the heart, seeing whether it feels tight or whether it feels open, not
judging, not second guessing, just noticing.
And then once we've grounded ourselves in some heartwood, some intention, some awareness
of the goodness in our practice, knowing that that goodness leads onward, we can just be
aware of how we keep going, just like we don't have to set an intention or think of
heartwood outside ourselves, we can just notice in our practice how we do keep going.
For example, simply how we return to the breath or how we bring the breathing back to the
center of our attention.
Maybe the mind gets snagged around a thought, the usual, planning, solution, finding, problem
solving, thinking about the past, thinking about other people, thinking about ourselves.
We can just bring the breath back to the middle of our attention, come back to here, come
back to now.
And as we do so, we can return, open back up to the breath, bring the breath back to the
foreground, gently, kindly, unhurriedly.
Everything that comes up in the meditation has a place here, as with the poem that Diana
read in which the lamp is put out, the ordinary experience of our world that happens in meditation,
never arises, sound, thought is good enough.
All the ordinary experience that comes up in our meditation, we can become aware of, touch,
and allow to proceed on its way, let go.
And though in this way, in this manner, we keep going, we keep going on the path.
We may notice things that arise that cause a tangle or not, a little stress, some suffering.
And we may notice things like the clarity, the stillness, the opening, the softheartedness
that are supportive.
And we can keep going by letting the helpful in and letting the unhelpful go.
And with the helpful, as Diana said, out with the unhelpful.
And with the helpful, as Diana said, out with the unhelpful.

BELLS RINGING
So I'm going to offer another short darmet today.
And I feel like I'm, you know, all of us teachers
are kind of saying the same thing.
Maybe different voices.
Maybe different examples.
And the message that those two suttas are offering
is to keep practicing, keep going.
So on my part of the talk, we wanted to explore this question
that sometimes comes up in our practice.
That is, how can we know that we're walking the path?
How can we know that we're on the path?
And we've talked about how one might veer off or stop short.
How can we know that we're on the path or walking the path?
And I feel a little apologetic that I won't offer you the answer
that you may like to hear.
And there's no magic here.
As a graduate training, we come to know this more and more clearly
little by little, gradually.
And it's oftentimes that it's not totally clear,
because we may be running into a spell of difficulties
with our practice and wondering around.
We got distracted a bit.
It's not always clear.
But when we give ourselves over to the practice
with the sincerity, persistence,
we can learn little by little.
And so we can learn by observing the effects of our practice,
of the training.
And we can also observe the effect when we do veer off or stop short.
And we can learn from our mistakes along the way.
And so, you know, who hasn't made mistakes?
You know, we all have veered off and stopped short,
probably thousands of times on the way.
And it's important to just remember that we can always come back.
I want to share this sutra that maybe many of you have heard.
There's a sutra before.
And this is a sutra where the Buddha was offering a teaching
to his Yang Sang, Rahula,
and about how to reflect often when he goes about taking actions
in living his life.
This is when Rahula was quite young.
Probably wasn't able to meditate that much well.
And so the Buddha offered this instruction,
to say, oh, reflect very often before you take your action to do something.
Reflect if this action is going to lead the benefit for yourself,
for others, and for both.
And that doesn't do it while you're taking action.
You also observe and reflect.
If this is leading to benefits to yourself, others, and both self and others,
and then after taking the action, you reflect the back.
Did this action lead to well-being for myself, others, and both?
And so what this is pointing to is,
the way that we can engage with this practice as an ongoing learning process.
I didn't say that Rahula would just stop after you reflect the first time,
because we don't always know why we're doing it.
All kinds of things may be happening that we may lose track.
And so reflect often, observe all these effects as we go along.
And I like this in that way.
We can grow, mature little by little.
And so this hardwood simile,
yeah, maybe since we don't know what the hardwood is,
and we just heard someone saying that tree has a hardwood.
Go get it there.
We don't quite know for ourselves what the hardwood is.
So maybe we got twigs and branches and barks,
and we went and tried to build a house.
And so enough of we discover, oh, this doesn't work.
And so we come back.
We come back.
And that's the important aspect of this.
And it may be hard along the way,
and the practice is not easy.
And life throws all kinds of challenging things at us,
crazy things at us.
We're inviting ourselves to keep coming back,
because getting to the hardwood, you know,
who knows the road might be closed, you know,
and you've got a weather system,
and you can't really chip away all these outer layers.
It takes a while.
I will keep doing this.
I'm fond of the suttas that I heard on this last month-long retreat
in March in Spear Rock.
In the middle of the month, you know,
people might have all kinds of difficulties
that you're offered. This is Sutta from Samyotani Kaya,
Samyotani Kaya 2.6,
called Kamada Sutta.
This is a deity, Kamada,
that is complaining to the Buddha
how hard the practice is.
The spiritual practice is so hard.
This is what the Kamada was complaining, lamenting,
and again.
And the Buddha was very honest.
The Buddha agreed.
Yup, practice is hard.
But the Buddha points out
that the true practitioner do it
even though it's hard.
I want to read this a little bit.
It was really kind of fun
when the teacher highlighted this,
that Kamada was a deity.
I don't know what kind of a difficulty
the deities would meet.
But we know, you know, with the human bodies,
then we have all kinds of challenges.
And this deity apparently has struggled a lot.
So we opened up this conversation
with the Buddha, says,
So hard it is to do, Lord.
It's so very hard to do.
And the Buddha says,
But still, they do what's hard to do.
Who study themselves with the virtual.
For when pursuing thus, content arises.
And with it, joy.
And this conversation goes on, you know,
walking through this step-by-step
and virtual and Samadhi and Panya.
But each time, each step Kamada would lament,
So hard it is to get this concentrated mind
or contentment.
And the Buddha said,
But still, they get what's hard to get
and they're diligent.
And so hard it is to tame this wild mind.
And the Buddha said,
But still, they tame what's hard to tame.
And I want to read this last passage in this Sutta.
And the Kamada complains,
It is so hard it is to do, Lord,
on this path that gets so rough.
We can probably relate to this, right?
And get a little rough or lot rougher.
And the Buddha says,
Still, nobles Kamada proceed on path,
both rough and hard to take.
Those who are less than noble fall on their heads
when the path gets rough.
But for nobles, the path is smooth.
For nobles, smooth out what is rough.
I just, I love this.
Nobles are not nobles
because of some sort of entitlement and inheritance.
And nobles walks the path
even if it's rough and hard.
And they're nobles
because they put in the work
to smooth out the rough spots.
And so that's the invitation
of walking this path
sincerely, wholeheartedly,
courageously,
and with a commitment.
And when we talk about the path,
sometimes people can hold this path
as a kind of conceptual ideas
and some sort of abstract philosophy.
But walking the path, this practice
is about where we are right now,
here and now.
In the ordinariness of our life,
in this body, in our mind and heart right here,
maybe in the midst of listening to a Dharma talk
or in giving a Dharma talk,
or when you're sharing with fellow practitioners
or eating meals, drinking tea,
replying an email.
It's in the ordinariness of our life
as Diana was pointing out
in reading this Bhattachara poem.
And we can feel then the potency
of walking this path right here in our being.
And sometimes Diana spoke about
how we might have this sense
of the movements of the path in us
and of the hint of the path.
We may also sometimes have this intuitive sense
of being off.
Maybe the heart feels constricted.
How do you know this
if we began to pay attention
to what's happening here and now?
Maybe there are certain kind of tensions
we carry in our body
that seems unnecessary,
but it's there.
And so there are those signs
to allow us to begin to notice
in our practice.
And there are times that where
maybe even we're veering off
or short in some big ways.
Maybe it feels really hard at times
and we just end up going back
to some usual distractions.
Watching TV.
I don't know, hanging out at the bar.
I don't know what people all do.
But there are times that we do veer off
in some significant ways.
But if we notice
and that this is happening,
at some point we may notice
that this is not going to work.
And maybe there is a sense of a disconnect
with the deeper kind of our being
or disconnect with our values
of the North Star that the Kim
was inviting us to reflect.
And so we come back
and it's never too late to come back.
I want to read this story
from the monastery within.
I have kind of a similar kind of
notes on this little tiny book too.
We're not color coded,
but they're definitely oriented.
Tell me what to bring up.
I want to share this little story
called Aspirations.
It says the two young men
happened to enter the monastery
on the same day.
One was an aristocrat
who had a sense of entitlement.
The other was the son
of a local farmer
who had spent his life
working on the family farm.
During their entrance interview,
the abbess asked them
why they were becoming monks.
The aristocrat said that
he had come to climb
to the highest achievement
in human life,
to experience the bliss,
the glory,
and the brilliant light
of liberation.
The peasant said,
I'm poor and out of school,
and I have no hope of enlightenment.
However, I hope to find the path
in the everyday activity of my life.
May I see the truth
in the food I eat,
in the work I do,
and in the people I encounter.
Within six months,
the peasant was graced with liberation.
The aristocrat is still striving on
courageously.
This is another flavor
of the Patujera story, I guess.
And so resting in
an immediacy of our experience,
and so we'll get to know this path
little by little.
And I think I'm going to stop now
and pass it on to Diana.
Diana, yes.
Thank you, Ying.
That was lovely, lovely.
Yeah, so now we'd like to open it up
to whatever questions or comments
you might have about any of the
teachings or this idea of
how to, when we're feeling stuck
or stopping short, bearing off
some of the ways to work with it.
Ying, I appreciated that in your talk,
you said, well, you kind of said,
well, the noble ones, they do what is hard to do.
So kind of like we're noble.
And then in the story of the monastery,
within, it's like, well, the peasant is the one
who just with ordinary experiences,
like we're peasants, I just love this.
Right, it's not like we're one or the other.
I mean, sometimes we feel like one or the other
or whomever or whatever our background is
or however we're considering ourselves,
there's a way to practice.
There's a way to practice.
So thank you, Ying.
Anybody have some comments or questions
they'd like to share as we kind of like wrap up
this journey we've been on for these past three days?
So Kevin or Erin, I'm not sure which one of you,
but maybe Kevin, he's leaning forward.
So I'm guessing it's Kevin.
Thank you.
Just with the flavor of everyone's reflections
and also this came up in our small group discussion.
Maybe it's a sign of advancing age,
but I really like short mnemonic things.
And what came to rise for me is striking a balance
between Marna Satya and Mehta in terms of motivation.
There's this quality that keeps coming up of
what is the right balance between carrot and stick.
And I'm one of those people that has veered off
heavily towards the stick part.
And that leads to the self-judgment,
the striving, the pushing in practice.
And so really looking at it from the point of view
of what's the balance that I need in order to create some vega
when I sit down every day and when I'm doing it.
And I feel like these suttas are encouraging that.
And above all, all of you on the teaching team
have been encouraging and modeling that the whole time.
So I just wanted to bring that up.
Thank you.
Thank you, Kevin.
The carrot or the stick, yes.
And I'll just say that you're in good company with this idea
about the stick.
I think there's so many people we're kind of like
are hitting ourselves.
And I'll just say in case it's helpful that recognizing this,
I used to teach like happy hour,
which was like loving kindness practice twice a week.
And I did a whole, for months,
I did a whole session just on the inner critic.
Like how can we work with the inner critic
and some of the loving kindness practices
or other practices we can do.
Just this recognition that it's so common to do this,
to think that, you know, to beat ourselves up about something.
But yeah, thank you, Kevin, for bringing that in.
And I'll just throw in also, I appreciate it.
I think it was, I think you brought in Mara Nasati.
Yeah, this is a, like, we're all going to die.
And it's part of this recollection practices or,
so there's some formal ways to practice with this
and how powerful that can be.
And maybe I'll say, not only powerful,
Kevin and what you were saying,
you talked about like meta and Mara Nasati,
there's a way I feel like kind of both of them merge together
where there's just this tenderness of the heart
that happens with both practices
and how such an integral way that can be for our practice,
this tenderness of the heart.
Thank you.
Maybe I'll pass it on to Kim,
who can help us do a little bit of this wrapping up.
Okay, great.
So, yeah, we're nearing the end of our time.
And just to tie things up a bit, you know,
we've had a lot of talk around this idea of the path
and our staying on it or going far enough on it.
And I think what we want to land on at the end here
is the sense of inner resource that we bring with us,
you know, because the path, it's a nice image,
this idea of a road or something external,
like a tree that we're moving into the middle of,
but actually the path is something
that doesn't exist outside of us.
You know, it's something that is grown through our own practice.
We are the tree, we are the road that is forming
and learning to tune into that through the heart,
through this sense of, am I off?
Am I aligned?
That's what we start to point toward in practice.
And we start to understand these images as inspirations
more than as kind of the external things
that we may see them as initially.
So the hope is that there's maybe something
that you learned from someone else
or from engaging with this material
that you can take forward with you
as some kind of a inner guide.
And if you, you know, maybe just take a moment to reflect,
is there something that, you know, in the next week of practice
I could emphasize more that would help deepen
where I am on the path right now,
how the path is emerging in me right now
through my very daily actions
and then kind of lean toward that.
And then things will shift
and there will be another leaning,
but there's a, there starts to be kind of an art form about the path.
And I hope that's what we've pointed to in the end.
So it just can be so evocative in that way.
So I guess one of the obligations of this section
is to share the Donal Link.
So let me do that.
That's, that will let the Sati Center know
that anything you offer is for this class in particular.
And then looking forward,
we just wanted to mention that the four of us
will be teaching a retreat at the Insight Retreat Center.
It's our first opportunity to teach a residential retreat together.
And it will be, we call these Sati Center classes
as a study and practice,
and we're calling the retreat practice and study.
So it will have both components,
emphasis on maybe the sitting in the internal practice,
but it will also include some interactions,
some readings, some reflecting.
So a little different from the standard Insight Retreat Center retreat
and registration.
You can register still if you go to IRC's website,
it will say you're going to be added to the waitlist,
but I'll tell you the waitlist is relatively short right now.
So feel free to register and chances are good.
So that will be in July, July 24 through 29,
that Insight Retreat Center.
And we're going to look at the four elements.
No, the five elements or including space.
So come and find out about those.
All right.
We're coming to the end of this class series together.
And let's take a moment to kind of do this ritual
that in our tradition,
we do at the end of a session or a class,
which is called a dedication of a merit.
That is our practice in learning is not only beneficial to ourselves,
but it's also beneficial to all beings.
And so we use this ritual as a way to express this sentiment.
So maybe you can join me.
Just take a moment.
And maybe remember some goodness
and that arose out of practicing and studying together
in this past week.
However small or big, whatever form it may be,
embodied in the mind or heart.
And allow yourself to rest in that goodness.
And I'm going to read in this Buddhist prayer
as a form of a dedication of a merit.
Just as the soft rings fill the streams,
pour into the rivers and join together in the oceans.
So may the power of every moment of your goodness
flow forth to awaken and to heal all beings.
Those here now, those gone before,
those yet to come.
So may it be so.
Thank you everyone for your participation.
And feel free to unmute and we can have a chaotic good-bye.
Thank you.
