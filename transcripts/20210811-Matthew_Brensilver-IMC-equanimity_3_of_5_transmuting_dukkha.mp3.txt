Thank you.
As I sense a certain kind of closeness to you, to the Sangha,
sort of recognition that whether we're in the same room or on YouTube spread across the globe,
it's only ever sight and sound and thought and feeling,
and there's a kind of fundamental equivalence to all of our situations.
So this feeling of closeness is not secondary.
So, equanimity.
The Buddha is said to have found the middle path,
the middle path between self-mortification and self-indulgence.
And it should be noted that the middle path sounds middle,
but it's kind of hardcore. It's one meal a day and no TikTok.
It's kind of hardcore.
But it is not an ascetic path. It is not a path of asceticism.
In other words, it's not trying to make ourselves suffer,
make the body suffer so that the mind gains strength.
That was a model, a reason to pursue a kind of path of pain.
This is not the Buddhist conception.
It's the Ajahn Sumedo. Desire does not cause suffering.
You really have to investigate desire and know it for what it is.
We can be very idealistic and thinking that even the need for food
is some kind of desire we should not have.
One can be quite ridiculous about it.
The Buddha was not an idealist and he was not a moralist.
He was not trying to condemn anything.
He was trying to awaken us to truth so that we could see things clearly.
So pain on its own has no liberatory potential.
It's a fact that usually has the opposite effect.
Self-denial is not a path.
I think it's a story from the suttas, but maybe I'm misremembering.
But it's something like the Buddha meets a spiritual seeker
who's standing on one leg and asks, like, what are you doing?
And the seeker says, I'm burning up my karma.
And the Buddha asks, well, how much is burn?
I don't know. How much is left? I don't know.
How will you know when you're done? I don't know.
And the Buddha says, this is foolishness.
But here's the catch. Pain, minor, dramatic, met with equanimity,
has profound liberatory potential.
And in a way, the Buddhist path is about not squandering dukkha,
not squandering the opportunities of dukkha, of suffering,
of unsatisfactoriness.
And so famously, Thich Nhat Hanh just says, no mud, no lotus.
It's mud, not problems.
And we recognize that dukkha is usually, it's usually squandered.
It usually doesn't become wisdom. It doesn't become love.
And this path is about this kind of, this turn of the heart.
How do we transform difficulty into something nourishing?
And it is almost a kind of, I don't use the word often,
but alchemical sort of process where we are transmuting difficulty
into love and a longing for liberation.
My experience like that is what dukkha is transformed into.
In the cauldron of the heart, in the trenches of practice,
dukkha is transformed into something like love and a longing for liberation.
And so sometimes people say, you know, I'm doing metta practice,
I'm doing loving kindness practice, and I cannot feel the love.
Well, sometimes the path into a deep, steady, radical love,
it's more circuitous, yeah? It's not straight into metta.
It's the circuitous path through dukkha, met by equanimity.
And in a way, it can be even more potent than the direct path of love.
It's a love that fully understands dukkha.
One of my teaching colleagues, Tweri Sala, described equanimity as kind of softening to the uncontrollability of conditions.
And she emphasized that word softening, softening.
The heart is softened by this. We sit, and here we are.
Who knows what comes up, yeah? Who knows what comes up,
and we just actually give up the kind of the reins we have on experience and surrender, surrender, soften.
And I feel like one of the primary roles of a Dharma teacher is being something like a trustworthy cheerleader, you know,
because there is a part of ourselves that just cannot believe this is the practice, yeah?
Everyone, everyone wants peace, but who wants purification?
So experiencing pain, experiencing pain, experiencing dukkha without equanimity often, often leads to hate.
And you can perceive this at the kind of different scales.
At the national level, like pain, not met with wisdom, not met with equanimity, it can wreck the mind.
It can contort the mind into just incredible destructiveness, ugliness.
But pain met with equanimity, this is a cause for love, yeah? In that the cauldron of the heart, yeah?
In the basement level of practice, like the capacity to actually bring difficulty into attention, to bring pain, physical, emotional, into attention.
This is profound, and it's the basis for not spilling or suffering on others, right?
When do we harm others? When do we do things we regret? When does our own self-regulation fail, yeah?
So we stay, we stay with the dissatisfaction, and it does feel almost like magic, what happens, that so much of the time of practice has just been this kind of like, honest, simple labor, you know?
Labor of the heart, this process of purification, which is transforming energy that ordinarily causes suffering into the seeds of our growing freedom.
King described non-violence as the sword that heals, yeah? The sword that heals. How can that be? How can that work? Well, it's kind of wild.
Shinsen Yang said that equanimity is the primary cathartic factor of Dharma practice.
I've always loved that description, the primary cathartic factor of practice.
Now, not all of Dharma practice is cathartic, yeah? There's building of intensity, the pits of despair, intense negative affect, the wave crests and breaks, and there's relief, there's ease, there's bliss, there's peace, there's something.
Yes, not all of practice is like that. Some of practice is just this very invisible accumulation of the parames, yeah, of goodness. We don't even see it, but some of it is dramatic and cathartic.
The wave breaks, and equanimity is very deeply involved in that wave breaking, in the catharsis, in the being reborn into some new open space, new pasture.
And so we start to get a taste, a taste of this process of purification, an acquired taste for sure, but a taste for it nonetheless.
And that begins to bring a certain kind of equivalence to experience, to pleasure and pain.
And after we work with this, we work with this, maybe it's just this sit, just this sit, we've worked patiently with tolerance, with equanimity, with difficulty.
It's so hard to hate, it's hard to rush, it's hard to despair, it's hard to do the subtle kinds of violence to our own hearts.
So something is softened, love is the byproduct of this meeting of equanimity and dukkha, and that is profound, and that is something we share with others.
So thank you. Thank you for your attention, it's good to be with you these days.
Yeah, I wish you all a good day, good morning if that's what it is, but I am aware that we don't live in a geocentric world, nor is California the center of the universe, the standard time zone or something.
So for those in the evening, you'll be well too. And yeah, it's sweet to think of you everywhere. So thank you.
