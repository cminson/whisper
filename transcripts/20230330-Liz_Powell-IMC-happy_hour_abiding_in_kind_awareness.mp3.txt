 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, this evening, the invitation will be towards relaxing into awareness. Perhaps letting go of the doing of these practices of loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity, gratitude, these many beautiful qualities that we cultivate during happy hour. And instead, allowing yourself time for being, instead of doing, being with experience as it comes to awareness. So, usually we're actively cultivating these beautiful qualities of heart and mind, and that's a wonderful practice. However, they are also a byproduct, a result of the practice of awareness, and they can spontaneously arise by themselves. And you may have noticed this if you've spontaneously found yourself sending a kind wish to someone during your day, or perhaps doing something kind for someone, or when you see news of some natural or man-made disaster, and you feel compassion for people who've been directly affected, the cultivation that you've been doing is arising spontaneously. As you sit quietly in meditation, and awareness is present, simply allowing the mindfulness, the mind to settle, the body to settle, the heart to settle, awareness will do its job of noticing whatever is most prominent in the attention, as we meditate. And the qualities of kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity, gratitude, many qualities like this may arise in your meditation. As an example, you may find yourself experiencing physical or emotional challenges or discomfort as you meditate, and perhaps there's a little compassion there. Or even the very subtle intention of compassion might be part of your whole framework for this practice. There may be a built-in wish in doing this practice. May this practice bring suffering to an end. Or you might notice that in the past, when physical discomfort was present, this is certainly true for me, I was kind of a little hard on myself, trying furiously to make it go away or find the right way to be with it. But over time, qualities of compassion and kindness grew, and these days, I feel much kinder towards my body and mind, and I don't have to fight with discomfort when it comes up. It may be there, and I can be with it, just aware of it. Or as another example, while you're meditating, someone you know may be on your mind as you sit, and you may know some feelings of kindness towards them, or some feelings of happiness for them. So just by dropping the doing from your meditation this evening, you might feel some relief. You don't have to work so hard, some relaxation, maybe even a little freedom. So with these comments as background, the invitation this evening is to allow awareness to be present without doing, without having to work hard at practice, and allowing the prior cultivation of everything that you've cultivated, including the happy hour of beautiful qualities of mind that you've already cultivated in the past, allowing that various qualities of mind will arise, however they come into awareness. And whatever experience comes up, allowing it, being with it, it's fine, whatever it is. And with that introduction, perhaps taking a few longer, deeper, or slower breaths, to settle into a supportive posture for awareness, allowing the out breaths to carry some tension away, let go of some preoccupations maybe. Releasing anything that can easily release, and allowing awareness of anything else that's present that wants your attention. Whatever's most obvious in experience. No need to go out looking for anything. Sometimes awareness is just present, available. Nothing big happening at times. Resting in that, if that's what's going on, allowing any experience to be received that's arising in awareness. Releasing any need for doing, there's no need to do meditation. Simply be. You're already aware. Easing upon yourself. Allowing. Whatever's experienced, it's fine just as it is. Rest with it. Resting the mind. Resting the heart. Resting the body. No need to change anything. No need to make anything happen. No need to change anything or stop it from happening. Simply receiving the flow of whatever comes to awareness. Allowing awareness to show you whatever it wants to show you. Allowing awareness to show you what's going on. Allowing awareness to show you what's going on. If the mind gets lost or you feel the need to support awareness with phrases of compassion or kindness, feel free to do that. Or to continue in silence, simply receiving, receiving in itself what awareness wants to show us is compassionate. It is kind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you you you and whatever has been arising in awareness this evening this is how it is right now these are the results of conditions that came before and just by paying attention to this is what it's like now and witnessing the changes you're practicing compassion for your experience you're practicing kindness towards your experience experience is just like this right now and perhaps giving yourself a little gratitude for this experiment of being with instead of doing the practice you so many of us are conditioned you know by our jobs by our culture to constantly be doing doing everything working on everything very hard and with meditation practice guided practices are very helpful but it's also very important to give yourself time to simply allow awareness of what is happening without guidance just noticing what your mind and heart produce or show you and that and the other thing that can happen with this is these practices that we do by giving silence and time to practice we can be cultivating a more settled mind a more quiet mind a more collected mind and that's pretty powerful because that's a wonderful field first of all it's wonderful just to be settled and restful and not be hammering on yourself to achieve this and that but also it's a wonderful field in which insight can arise when it's ready to arise so i i was inspired somebody reminded me recently that the teacher of some of our western teachers who brought vipassana to the west menindraji who was joseph goldstein's teacher jack cornefield's teacher sharon salsberg said if you can something like this if you can just sit and know you are sitting the whole path of the dharma will open before you i think that's pretty inspiring just sit and be aware that you're sitting and things will present themselves so with that we will take some time to be in small groups together and this is a wonderful time to listen profoundly to your own heart as you listen to the other members of your group each share one thought at a time and go around the circle and as we're sharing those thoughts this is a chance to share what feels comfortable or relevant for you and to know that i hope everybody here can agree that in these small groups we keep what is said in that small group private we don't repeat george said this mary said that when we come back to the big group or even outside of this group we just listen with in confidence and we don't and we don't offer each other advice or we're not trying to teach each other we're really listening to what the other person has to say listening to our own heart and then sharing something that was up for us this evening so with that i will create rooms for us and by the way if you find yourself in a room where you don't have other participants don't worry i will find you and i will put you in a room where there are there there you know we start out that way but sometimes people drop out so you and Olivia if you can hear me you should click join to join your room there you go you you
