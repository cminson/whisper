The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So this week we will continue to talk about this wonderful quality of
mindfulness but the theme will be different aspects of mindfulness as
protection and in fact I wanted to show you and see on this wrist I have this
red cord and this one I have a little white cord. These are called protection
cords and you may have received them at some retreat or other other Buddhist
event and I'm remembering that one time the teacher I think it was John Travis
asked was when he was receiving one so what is this protection from and the
monk who was giving it to him said it's protection from yourself and I found
that to be a useful idea in some sense they're just pieces of string but we
can conceive of them as protections from ourself and I think as we practice we
come to understand that that is useful. That's a useful image. So speaking of
images this week we'll be looking at images or similes from the suttas that
relate to mindfulness and there are a lot and you know as I was sort of
looking through and collecting up the various images it was clear that that
protection is really a theme and different aspects of it so maybe I'll
just talk for a moment about the value of these images and similes that there
are in the suttas. I don't know how many there are but there are certainly well
over a hundred different images used for various qualities and experiences in
the teachings it's clear that the Buddha was a kind of a teacher who liked to
evoke that aspect of us you know the images the feelings that are
connection to them and often the images relate to things that are quite
accessible in in life images of simple feelings that we have or well of course
many of them are agricultural from you know his time but we can imagine that
fairly well still and they're meant to be I think quite experiential you know
we're meant to have a sense of really a visceral sense of what that image is
pointing to and that may speak to a different part of our heart than just
hearing words or having ideas so that's one of the reasons to look at them
carefully they speak maybe to the non-rational aspect of us which is not
the irrational aspect of us but the non-rational hopefully you can see the
difference and it's possible I have found that these images maybe I read them at
the time and I think oh yeah okay that that makes sense I can kind of feel that
but sometimes they can really bubble up during a sit you know the mind will
you read something about fear and then and it's nice in the moment and then
during a sit maybe when fear comes up that same image will suddenly have
meaning I found it's like oh that is what that was referring to that's
exactly what it feels like wow and so I hope maybe you'll take in some of these
images and consider just store them maybe store them somehow in your mind or your
heart and see if they come up for you sometime so each day has a theme which is
some aspect of protection and we'll be looking at these images sometimes one
sometimes more than one each day that relate to a certain theme so today's
protection related theme is called guarding the scent stores and so that
is it's about mindfulness as a basic protection for ourself and guarding the
scent stores means taking care with the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind such
that inputs to those senses don't overwhelm the mind in Buddhist teachings
there are six six cent stores those ones that I named so one basic image that's
used is the image of six animals that are bound together by a rope and so the
animals are a snake a crocodile a bird a dog a jackal and a monkey pretty
different kinds of animals and so you can imagine that what happens is each one
wants to go in its own direction each one tries to go toward its natural place
and monkey wants to go up to the trees and the bird wants to fly and I think it
says the snake wants to go to the anthill but anyway they're all going in a
different direction and if you just tie them together with a rope and let the
rope go the strongest animal is going to win and they'll all have to go that way
and so this is the in the idea here the metaphor is that the six animals are the
six sense faces that each want to do something different our eyes are going
somewhere our ears our mind and so if we're just you know willy-nilly let that
happen what kind of whatever is the strongest is what we'll end up doing and
that's really not so helpful but that might be kind of how we go through our
day when we're not mindful so then the contrast is to have the same six animals
bound with a rope but they're tied up to a stake and the stake is put in the
ground and so then what happens is the animals can't actually go and
eventually they get tired and they lie down so the image says and so the same
thing is if we have mindfulness of our senses then our sense doors then we don't
get drawn off they're not running off in different directions you know we can
just hear things but we don't start talking thinking about that and worrying
about that or being angry about the thought about the sound and so
eventually things will settle down quiet down we can maybe see this sometimes in
meditation also applicable you know in daily life when all of our we have all
six senses operating so then so that's maybe one way we can think about how
mindfulness guards our sense doors prevents them from running off but I
want to also talk about another nice image that's more specifically for the
sixth sense door of the mind which is the one where we often get in trouble I
think we can see so this is one that's from MN 19 Suta about thoughts about
different kinds of thoughts and so when we have many different thoughts in our
mind that are related to the hindrances actually the Suta says they're related
to sensual desire ill will or cruelty but we could probably include all
hindrance related thoughts since I know you just talked last week with Gil
about the hindrances and so when we have a lot of thoughts like that it's a kind
of a drain on the mind and if we keep track of what we're thinking with
mindfulness then we can kind of redirect those unhelpful thoughts and the
image given is that of a cow herd who is trying to handle a pack of cows does
ever feel like your thoughts are like a herd of cows going in different
directions got to try to kind of keep it together so the image is like this it
says just as in the last month of the rainy season in the autumn when the
crops thicken a cow herd would guard his cows by constantly tapping and poking
them on this side and that in order to check them so the idea here is that it
won't be good if the cows get into the crops and eat them and so the cow herd
stays close to the cows kind of poking them this way and that and when the mind
has a lot of these thoughts then in the same way we have to kind of guard our
mind carefully by doing a lot of noting practice for example or really paying
attention to those thoughts each time they come and maybe one thing to note
also is that the cow herd is not angrily beating the cows to get them back in
line he's just tapping them gently but firmly and so if we do that in our mind
and we gently but firmly you know okay nope not gonna go off into anxiety no
not gonna ruminate about my housemate etc as we do this the mind will tend to
settle down same way that the six animals get tired when they're bound to
the stake and eventually settle down and then the nice thing is that we don't
need to be checking so actively with the with the mindfulness the mindfulness
also can change and so there's another image given in that same sutta again
about the cow herd and it says just as in the last month of the hot season when
all the crops have been brought inside the villages a cow herd would guard his
cows while staying at the root of a tree or out in the open since he only needs
to be mindful that the cows are there so it's a whole different image right the
cows can just be you know out in the field because there's no crops left that
they're gonna eat and so the cow herd gets to just rest under a tree and just
kind of watch that they're there and in the same way if the mind is in a more
skillful place you know having thoughts of non ill will non cruelty thoughts of
generosity it's fine just to know that those thoughts are there or maybe it
even settles down enough not to have very many thoughts and then we can just be
calmly present so this this protection that's called guarding the send stores
could be quite active or it could be quite relaxed it depends on the state
of the mind and what sort of external inputs and internal thoughts we're
experiencing at a given time how we need to be mindful of them in order to guard
our senses so over time we'll find that we can be with more and more challenging
situations mindfully so the mind gets less reactive overall so we'll find that
the the nature of guarding changes throughout the course of our the long
arc of our practice as well as you know the short-term arc of just how the mind
is right now so the hope then is that during this week we'll build a picture
out of different images of the many ways that mindfulness serves as a protector
and today we looked at this idea of guarding the send stores of not letting
the mind run out in the same way that seems like the images are about animals
in the same way that animals kind of wander off if we don't keep track of
them so I hope that's a helpful image for you to get started on today or
maybe it's later in the day for you but consider maybe consider today what it
would be like to guard the send stores with mindfulness and to see mindfulness
as our our simple protector so thank you
