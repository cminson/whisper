 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. All right, so welcome to our half day today. Just a few little logistics at the beginning to get us oriented and then we'll sit for a couple minutes. This is a Sati Center event being held here at IMC, but it's being held through the Sati Center. Many of you are familiar with IMC, but I also know we have at least one new person here. And so we have three bathrooms in the back and there's also tea that's available for any time and water, fresh water also. You can see that we're all wearing our masks and we'll keep those on during the day. And we'll also be running the air purifiers at the breaks and we can open the doors and such. But I think for noise, we'll keep them closed for now. Today is going to include teachings and some sitting and some chance to interact with others in small groups and large group discussion also. There are going to be two relatively brief breaks, but if those aren't coming at the right time for you, feel free to take care of your needs as needed. And if you'd like, we can have lunch together outside afterwards if you brought your lunch or tea, whatever you'd like. If you wanted to have a more informal time to talk afterwards, that's fine also. That'll be at noon when this finishes. Are there any questions as we get started about the day? Okay, great. Why don't we just sit for a few minutes to settle down and allow the couple of additional people to come in. So I'm not offering a lot of guidance for this, but just allowing yourself to orient to this place. This nice group of people that are here. And just letting the mind and body settle. We'll sit for about another seven minutes or so. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Welcome, everyone. I think it might be nice given that we're all kind of masked up. If we just went around the room and each said just our name so that we can hear everyone's voice through the mask. I know some people come to events in order just to be very quiet and after that, it will be more individual. But why don't we just start here and go around. Thanks. Thanks, everyone. And I'm Kim. It's nice to be here. So let's talk a little bit about shifts in understanding, which is kind of the theme for today. It's very natural that our understanding will shift along the path. You know, there will be changes in how we understand things. That's kind of what it means to walk the path, actually. And it doesn't just mean an accumulation of knowledge over time. There are some times that we realize that we have come into an entirely new way of seeing things. And we're actually going to have to change our behavior or our practice in order to be in line with how we've come to see things through practice. So today we're going to focus particularly on our understanding of dukkha and the end of dukkha. And I deliberately use the Pali word there because we may not know quite how to say that in English. I mean, suffering, unsatisfactoriness, stress, we'll see different possibilities. But we'll also see that releasing dukkha, what it means to be free from dukkha, we would think that would be simple enough. But that also changes along the path, how we understand that. So these ideas, of course, lie at the very heart of Buddhist practice. It's about suffering and the end of suffering. The Buddha said sometimes that's all he teaches. So these are not static ideas to learn their dynamic, active knowledges that we cultivate. The knowledge of dukkha, the knowledge of the end of dukkha. When we set out to understand dukkha, our understanding begins one way and then it changes as we mature in practice. And the same is true for letting go. So maybe just take a moment to reflect, can you think of some part of the Dharma that you understand differently than when you started practice? And even if you just started practice recently, probably there's already been some kind of shift. Yeah, so just bearing that in mind, let's talk about this first noble truth, the one concerning dukkha. It says simply in kind of broad terms that there is dukkha in life. And according to the first discourse of the Buddha, the very first sermon that he gave, the definition goes like this. And this one translates dukkha as suffering. Now this, bhikkhus, meaning us, practitioners, is the first noble truth of suffering. Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering, union with what is displeasing is suffering, separation from what is pleasing is suffering, not to get what one wants is suffering. In brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering. So don't worry too much about the technical term at the end, about the aggregates, but I think we can kind of relate to those things. And then in that same suta, there are tasks associated with each of the truths. And for the first truth, it says this noble truth of suffering is to be fully understood. That's the task. So I came across a nice quote by the scholar Gethin who said, developing an understanding of the first noble truth involves not so much the revelation that dukkha exists as the realization of what dukkha is. Does anyone really need a lot of help to understand that dukkha exists? I don't think so. I think we we understand that one right away. But the realization of what dukkha really is that can pull the mind pretty deep. And we'll we'll talk a little bit more specifically about different possibilities for how we could understand what dukkha is. But just to know that this task of fully understanding suffering is something that goes on for a long time can be helpful. And we'll also talk about the third noble truth. We're not only going to talk about dukkha. That's coming later today. So for completeness, then let's just mention the tasks for each of the noble truths. So for dukkha, it was to fully understand for the origin or the arising of dukkha. That's the second noble truth. The task is to abandon that to abandon the causes or the conditions for it. For the third noble truth, the cessation of dukkha, the task is to realize it, to fully realize that. And for the path to the cessation of dukkha, that's the fourth noble truth. The task is to develop it. So let's think about that. To develop the path, I would suggest that some of what we develop on the path is the ability to do the other tasks. We develop in how we understand dukkha. We develop in how our ability to realize the end of dukkha. So the proposition for our session today is that we're going to apply the fourth noble truth to the other truths, or particularly to the first and the third truth. Sound okay? Yeah. Yeah. I think we sometimes don't realize how the process of the path can be a little bit subtle sometimes. We just do our sitting every day. We come to events at IMC. We talk with people. And then we wake up one day and realize, oh, wait a minute. Something has really changed. And that's normal. And sometimes it's helpful to really bring that to awareness. Okay. So let's do a sitting to delve a little bit more deeply into our current understanding of this quality of dukkha. So find a posture that would be good for meditation. Find a comfortable place to sit. Settle into a balanced posture. I like to even shift back and forth a little bit or forward and back in order to really find the center point where I'm sitting. And if you're comfortable doing so, you can close your eyes. Maybe taking a little time to deliberately go through the body and soften the areas where we tend to hold some tension. So softening the muscles of the face, the forehead, around the eyes, the jaw. Softening the eyes and the eye sockets. And then through the throat, into the shoulders. I think the shoulders drop a bit without rolling forward. Maybe thinking of sliding the shoulder blades down the back. And then bringing the tension into the chest area. Feeling the front, back sides of the ribcage, allowing those to soften. Sensing the diaphragm. And softening down through the belly and the lower back. Just allowing the balance and the straightness of the spine to support the body. And softening the hip joints. Releasing any bracing in the legs. Generally just inviting ease throughout the body. And if there are parts that are sore or still tense, that's totally fine. We have ease in the mind about how the body is right now. And just allowing awareness to be soft. Mindfulness of the body, hearing sounds, letting any thoughts or emotions just be there. Just maintaining a sense of simple presence. Great. So in this meditation, I'm going to suggest several different areas of life where we tend to experience some of what the Buddha called Dukkha. And so in each case, I'll invite you to call to mind some aspect of that area that's challenging for you. Don't choose the heaviest thing. The purpose of the reflection is to feel your relationship to Dukkha and sort of your current understanding. So one clear area where we experience Dukkha is the body. Perhaps you have some pain or illness or injury or just the usual challenges of getting older. So just touch into some aspect of the body that for you there is some Dukkha, some unsatisfactoriness, some pain, some suffering. Just notice how that is in your mind. How do you relate to that? Just breathe. And then you can release that and just go back to the open awareness. Trying to breathe. And then a second area where the Buddha points out that we often experience challenge Dukkha is the stress of some kind of change in your life. Perhaps your work has shifted. You've lost your job or something. You've been reassigned or there's been a shift in a relationship or some activity you used to enjoy is no longer available. And on a smaller scale there are the innumerable changes that we deal with all day, keeping our body comfortable, the changes of emotions, the challenge of thinking and responding, being on all day. There's really no break from change. How do you relate to those kinds of stresses? Just feeling in your mind and heart your understanding of the challenges of change. And breathing. And once you feel you have a sense of that softening again into the open awareness. Don't hold your breath for too long. Now it feels it feels it feels so cavity. And then the third area, and the last one we'll touch into, where the Buddha pointed out the difficulty of being human, is the kind of fundamental difficulty of getting everything aligned. Your health, body, food, your work, your emotions, relationships, finances, living situation, politics, providing support to others. Can you get all of that working well at the same time and keep it that way? This is hard. Feel the dukkha of the maintenance of a human life and psyche. And how do you see that? How do you feel that in your body and heart and mind? Getting with that? When you have a sense of that, just open again the awareness to the body sitting. You may wish to pass your attention again through the body, softening. In the present moment, all is fine. You're sitting here. Take a moment to wish well for yourself. And to wish well for other people. A little metta that feels natural after touching into dukkha.
