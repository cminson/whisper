 Sit. Let's meditate briefly. I'll meditate briefly with you and then you continue meditating while I talk. Okay. So get comfortable in position. I think that's a good will. Good will is a wish for true happiness, as we said, and spread it around because true happiness comes from within. There's no conflict between your true happiness and anyone else's. So when you wish good will for yourself, extend good will to yourself. It's not a selfish thought, but it's the main motivation for the practice. Same as when you have good will for others, you remind yourself that you're looking for happiness that is going to be harmful to no one. So you want to develop your own internal resources as a way of finding that happiness. So tell yourself, I'm going to be truly happy. I understand the causes of true happiness and be willing to act on them. And then extend the same thought to others, starting with people who are close to your heart, the moving out, never widening circles. And then bring your attention to the breath. It's good to start with some good long deep in and out breaths to emphasize the feeling of breathing in the body. Find your spot where it's clearest. And then ask yourself if long breathing is comfortable, start adjusting things. So you find a breath that's not too long, not too short, not too heavy, not too light. When it feels just right from the knees of the body and the knees of the mind right now. Of course, those needs may change. So stay on top of what the body needs and stay on top of what your mind needs right now. And then as the breath gets comfortable, we start surveying through the body. See what feels best for you. Starting down at the navel, moving up the front of the torso, through the head, down the shoulders and the arms, down the back, out the legs. Go at your own pace. Then when you're ready, you can settle down and just be at one spot. Think of your awareness spreading from that spot to fill the whole body. Like the light of a candle in the middle of a dark room, the flame of the candles in one spot, but it's like fills the entire room. And try to maintain that centered but enlarged awareness as best you can. If it begins to blur out, go back to the survey of the body, section by section. Otherwise learn how to stay right there, clear, centered. And then you meditate while I talk. This afternoon, we'll talk about how to approach the issue of death from the perspective of the Buddha's awakening. Remember that you had three analogies. Death is followed by rebirth. And then we go through many levels of being, where it's possible to go through many levels of being. The second knowledge is what determines those levels of being is our karmic record, the actions we've done both in the past and in the present moment. His first interest was in the present moment, at death, the choices that the mind makes, whether it has right view or wrong view at that moment. But that led him in the third knowledge to look more carefully at his mind in the present moment, to see what actions would lead to death, aging, birth, becoming, clinging, craving, just going down the list. Look at him simply as actions without paying attention to who was doing the action. Just the principle of action in and of itself. And discover that that was the way to avoid the issue of the dilemma that's created by the fact that both craving for becoming and craving for non-becoming can lead simply to more becoming. Just seeing those actions and learning how to develop this passion for them. That was our delectous experience of the daphnis. The lessons we can learn from that have to do both with preparing for a good rebirth, if we can totally reach the daphnis. But also learning why we can do it as we meditate to learn the skills that would be necessary. We're finding that daphnis element. The Buddha recommends mindfulness of death as a meditation practice. In fact, that's the context in which he talks about being in the present moment or focusing on the present moment. Present moment is not a good in and of itself, but it's the place where the work has to be done. And so when he's coming about recollections after not thinking simply death, death, death, death, death, you're thinking, given the fact that death can come at any time. And the state of my mind at death and also the karmic record that I've developed up to that point will have a huge impact on where I'm going to go. There's work I've got to do. And the work you can do, it kind of falls into two main categories. One is simply the things you can do in order to create good options for rebirth, in case you need them for the moment of death. And the other is mastering the skills in the present moments to understand what are these actions that lead to becoming that lead to craving? And how can I learn how to deal with them more skillfully so they don't have to slip off into an unscampled birth at that time? So the first category, creating good karma in advance to create good options. The most basic list that the Buddha gives, both the things you have to do, is to develop conviction, virtue, generosity, and discernment. That conviction we've already talked about, it's basically conviction in the Buddha's awakening, that what he learned in the night of his awakening really is a good guide to how we should look at our lives. I was talking with a Zen teacher one time and said, your turn buttons, you have faith in your practice, right? He said, yes. Well, do you have faith in anything more specific than just faith in the Dharma? And I said, yes, we have faith in the Buddha's awakening. For us, it's the central event around which we shape our lives. Then based on that, there's a quality of virtue, and the virtue is observing the precepts, not precept against killing, stealing, illicit sex, lying, and taking intoxicants. That third quality, generosity. When the Buddha was asked, where should the gift be given? He says, where you feel inspired. Generosity is our first taste of free will. We do have choices, we have things that we could keep for ourselves, but we decide that no, we'd rather share the mercy of someone else. You realize that you're not a slave to your cravings. You can't step back from your cravings and think about long-term consequences and gradations of pleasure. There's the pleasure of consuming something, but there's also a greater pleasure that comes as you learn how to share what you have and make sense. And then finally, with discernment, it's defined as discernment of arising and passing away that is penetrated. I'd like to talk a little bit about the fact that even though these are said to be qualities that are there to prepare you for good options when the option of rebirth comes, they also shade into the training of the mind. Conviction, of course, points you where. If you have a conviction, the Buddha's awakening is the main lesson you learned, of course, with the Fourteen Truths. Suffering comes from within, comes from our actions, comes from our clinging and craving. So if you truly have conviction in the Buddha's awakening, you're going to start looking inside, observing your mind. Similarly with virtue, when you take on the precepts, the precept is that you are not going to intentionally do any of those things. You cannot break a precept unintentionally. In other words, if you happen to step on a bhagana, knowing that it's there. Or if you say something that you think is true, but it turns out that it's not true, that's neither of those actions will break a precept. So as you take on the precepts, you focus more and more attention on your intentions. At the same time, you have to develop qualities of mindfulness, alertness, art and sing. Mindfulness to keep the precept in mind, alertness to watch what you're doing as you're doing it. Then, RNC is to stick with it. Even there will be cases where you will have to make sacrifices in order to maintain your precepts, which you're willing to put out the effort. There's three qualities, RNC, alertness and mindfulness, are qualities that are developed in mindfulness practice and concentration practice. So you're preparing yourself to meditate as you take on the precepts. With generosity, the Buddha focuses on how the rewards of generosity are not just a matter of the gift you give or to whom you give it, but a lot of it has to do with the motivation with which you give. Because one passes where he talks about the different kinds of motivation you might have. And in the very first one, it sounds like he's starting out with a catch-22. He's recommending that one of the rewards of generosity is that you would be reborn in a good place. He says one of the lowest motivations for generosity is that I will enjoy this after death. In other words, I'm going to get this back with interest. He doesn't say it's a bad motivation. He talks about the different levels of Davis and how different motivations correspond to different levels of David lands that you might go to after death. This would be the Four Great Kings, which is not a bad place to be. He says there are higher motivations and he encourages them. The next higher one is simply that giving is good. It's a good thing to be generous. Higher than that is that you have a family custom of being generous and you will maintain your family custom out of respect for your parents and your ancestors. And even higher motivation is seeing that there are people who are not well-off lawyers. You are well-off. It's not right that you don't share. This is an obligation when you have something that other people don't. Higher motivation is that there have been great gift-giving sacrifices in the past. You can give in that same way. Higher motivation still is that it makes the mind serene in a way that you are generous. You have a sense of gratification and joy arise. Then finally, higher than that is the sense of this ornament of the mind. At that point you don't need anything anymore from the generosity. It's just a good thing to have. So here again, the practice of generosity makes you more and more sensitive to what's going on in each of these cases. You're basically talking to yourself about why you're giving. And the Buddhism has some more sensitivity to different motivations that you might have for being generous. As for discernment, this says penetrative knowledge of arising and passing away. It's not simply watching things coming and going. To be penetrative, the knowledge has to be one, see what is the origination of these things that are coming and going in the mind. Whatever it is that I'm experiencing. And origination basically means causation. And when the Buddha uses the word origination nine times out of ten, it's origination coming from within. The causes are things that are coming from your own mind. Then beyond that, to be penetrated, your discernment has to see which things that are arising should be encouraged to stay and which should not be encouraged to stay. So again, more and more sensitive to what's going on in the mind and the effect that certain mind states will have. Learning, encouraging yourself to develop skillful mind states and to get rid of unskillful mind states. So even though this would be classified as one of the practices for preparing yourself for a good rebirth in the future, it's also pointing you more and more to your mind in the present moment. This way it gives you practice in getting ready to meditate. Now in addition to those four qualities, conviction, virtue, generosity, and discernment, there are other lists. This is where they're talking about the qualities that would make you a deva. And that list has those four qualities plus learning. You would be learning in the drama. Now back in those days when you learned the drama, it simply wasn't a matter of reading, but you would find good passages that you found inspiring. You would memorize them. And this is a practice I would encourage because you think about what's going to sloshing around in your mind as a relative, or Zelda having been exposed to TV and Internet. One of the monks here at the monastery tells the story about when he was an exchange student down in Mexico. And there had to be a party for these visiting green girls. And the Mexican students would sing folk songs. And then they turned to the Americans and said, okay, you sing us some American folk songs. And the American students looked at one another, and they didn't know any folk songs. So they ended up singing Gilligan's Island and other commercial jingles. So if that's the kind of stuff you have in your mind, it might be good to replace it with some good poly passages or poly passages translated into any question. You just let them memorize them, running over your mind. So these things are with you when you need them. I know in my own case, after John Fuhn passed away that first year at the monastery, it was a difficult year because we had people coming in from outside trying to take a move in the monastery and it created a lot of difficulties. And time and again, I would be thinking about, well, what would John Fuhn do to handle this case? And his words would come right back to me. One time he said this and another time he said that. And that was what kept me going well. I was having that in my mind. It's one of the reasons why I wrote the book, Awareness Itself, was to keep those things in mind and to share them with other people. So it's good to have good short Dharma passages that you could hold in mind as a way of giving you strength and giving you guidance when you need it. Another one of the practices that leads to go to your breath is the practice of the Brahman Beharas. Good will for all beings, compassion for all beings, empathetic joy for all beings, and equanimity with regard to all beings. And the Buddha says, if you make a constant practice of this, it can have a very high impact on your opportunities to be reborn in the Brahman world for either one, two, four, even five or eight times these instances. So that's another way that you can prepare for good options. It'll be available to you at the moment of death that you develop these skills and events. Now, yes, you're developing these skills. Remember, as I said earlier, this is going to require a certain amount of effort, this practice, certain amount of dedication. And you have to be developing a skillful sense of self around you. So don't be afraid of that sense of self. I don't know how many times I've heard people say, well, if you do concentration practice, it requires a lot of effort and effort requires a sense of self. But we all know sense of self is a bad thing. Well, if the sense of self is developed around comparing yourself with other people, yes, that is unskillable. But the sense of self that says, okay, I'm capable of doing this, I will benefit from it. I am the response to one who's going to be responsible for my breath, or my how I handle aging and listen to that sense of self is going to be necessary. So don't be afraid of developing that. As long as you're not on the verge for our relationship, you need a sense of self to motivate yourself to act. So those are some things you can do as preliminaries to prepare good options to be available for you at the moment of death. Then the things you do as you focus in on the present moment in your meditation. Again, we're here, as the word says, because there's work to be done. And particularly want to learn about the steps that are going to be leading the creative as remember that image that Buddha had rebirth is like a fire being blown from one building to another building. And those days, they believe that the fire had to feed on something in order to burn, in this case, it would feed on the wind, carrying it from one building to another. We know how winds can be and we know how fires can be in winds. They can spread in all directions and they're pretty blind. So you want to be able to learn how to gain some control over your cravings. This is the big focus of learning to meditate in the present moment is getting some control over your craters. Well, notice, I'm just noticing in the passing that when the Buddha focuses on meditation, when you study something actually focuses your attention on two of the main factors in sequence that lead up to craving and the better horizon. One is feeling how feeling leads to craving. And the other is fabrication. Remember, fabrication is the first factor that occurs in the list after, after ignorance. So for example, when you're developing concentration, you've got the three types of fabrication. You've got the book, the in and out breath as your object, that's bodily provocation, direct thought and evaluation as you talk to yourself about the breath, adjust the breath. And then mental fabrication, which will be feelings and perceptions, the feeling of ease that you're trying to create as you focus on the breath and the perceptions of the mental images that you hold in mind to keep it there. And these are the things that need to be put together in order to get the mind and concentration. And as you work with these things, you'll find that you get hands on experience with these different kinds of applications. So instead of doing them in ignorance, you'll be doing them in knowledge. Netrance from the cause of suffering into part of the path. Similarly with feeling. Feeling is one of those fabrications that can lead to craving. But if you look at your feelings and learn how to analyze them, the same we talked about this morning. So as you get some distance from them and I feel so truly overwhelmed by them, then you're not so likely to jumping for whatever craving comes your way. So this is the main focus in the present moment in the practice is focusing on these factors of independent core rising. Actually, whichever factor you find most congenial focus on some people find name and form other people find different factors to be good. But what's in every case in the event of rising as things are happening in the present moment, you're trying to understand cause and effect. So you focus your attention on the present moment, you focus on these things as they're happening in and of themselves. Think of the Buddhist formula for mindfulness, you're focusing on the body and of itself. Putting art and alert and mindful, putting aside creative distress and breakfast to the world, or you're focusing on feelings or mind states. In each case, you're looking at these things in and of themselves actions in the present moment. And you're not concerned about what you want in the world outside. Remember the sense of the world outside is part of becoming energy being pushed out of one becoming, you don't want to say, well, I just want to go to another becoming whatever shows up. So we have to learn how to focus on this frame of reference, which is the thing in and of itself, the experience in and of itself, but that reference to the world outside. And we're doing this because as the Buddha said, we have to deal with dangers that are coming up. And this is one of the aspects of mindfulness practice that is often underplayed. They talk about mindfulness being accepting and open, but the Buddha often talks about, okay, there has to be a sense of urgency as you develop your mindfulness as it develops in the concentration, because there are dangers all around. You think of the image of the quail that's caught by the hawk because it wandered in the wrong territory, or the monkey that's been caught because it wandered into the wrong territory, got caught in a monkey trap. There's the image of the gatekeeper at the fortress. Just to make sure that no enemies come in. In other words, no unskillable states coming. There's the image of your head being on fire and you have to be very mindful to put the fire out. So again and again, when the Buddha is talking about mindfulness, images, they give rise to a sense of urgency and your counter-wracking dangers. When you apply this to breath meditation, this is one of the types of meditation which gives a lot of emphasis on fabrication. You think about the first tetrad in breath meditation instructions. The Buddha talks about calming bodily fabrication. Now bodily fabrication here means you're in and out of breath. Anybody asks, well, why is he talking about it in such tactical terms? Why can't he just say, calm the breath? He's trying to get you to see the role of fabrication, the role of your intentions in the way you breathe. Similarly in the second tetrad, when he talks about being sensitive to mental fabrication and calming mental fabrication, he wants you to see these processes of fabrication and to learn how to manipulate them and say manipulating them that you get awareness and knowledge of them. Okay, I've talked to some people who say, well, if you're working on the breath, what are you going to do when you die? You won't be able to be with your breath anymore. Well, in working on the breath, you're going to become more and more sensitive to these processes of fabrication. That's precisely what the Buddha wants you to look at. Not just a vague awareness of your awareness, but simply where is the fabrication going on in your mind right now? Where are your intentions in the mind right now? In what direction are they leading? This is the purpose of breath meditation, is to get you sensitive to those things. Now there's a tradition in the forest tradition that says basically that when you're meditating like this, you are preparing. You're learning the skills you're going to need when you die. The Buddha himself seems to say as much, there's a passage where he goes in and sees the monks in the sick ward and he says, look, approach death, mindful and alert. And he finds alert across being alert to what you're doing and the results of what you're doing. Mindfully it defines in terms of establishing the mind. So as you're trying to get the mind centered like this, these are the instructions where you get into concentration. You're basically learning the skills that you will need after you die. Now the things that are going to come in at that moment are basically the same problems that you encounter as humanity. In other words, the hindrances. These are the things that get in the way of mind posts, they get in the way of concentration, and they get in the way of discernment. The passage is where the Buddha talks about mind states that you have to watch out for as you're approaching death. Four out of the five hindrances are mentioned explicitly. Sloth and torpor is the only one that's not mentioned. But because sloth and torpor would obscure your mindfulness, alertness, and it's implicit there that this is something you've got to watch out for. So what are the five hindrances? You've got central desire. At the moment of death, you're going to be strongly attached to the body and have lots of central pleasures. This is one problem. You will. Which might be directed at us for their past bad actions, wanting to see them punished. Think of what the Buddha had to say about that. To the soldier asking me, my teachers told me that if I die in battle, I will go to the heaven of those heroes slain in battle. What does the Buddha have to say about this? The Buddha, along with the etiquette of the time, decided this is not a topic you wanted to talk about. But the soldier asked him three times. So Buddha had to answer. So he said, basically, if you're thinking, may these beings be destroyed, may these beings be pretty hard as you may, if you die at that moment, your mind would pull down the hell of those slain in battle. In other words, if those, it's precisely ill will that you have for people at that time. The other example he gives is of the bandits sawing you up with that song. If you have ill will for them, you're going to be reborn in a bad place, a place that would once you get back at them. And we have to be careful about the ill will because one of the ways in which ill will disguises itself is as justified anger and desire for justice. You want to see somebody get their just desserts, they see someone who's going unpunished for their for the misdeeds and you say, this person really deserves to suffer. That is ill will. The ideal thing would be the attitude that the Buddha had toward ungoy malasim, even gone to imalasim, murdered all those people. Still had the potential for awakening. You could avoid a lot of suffering by awakening. I think we know the story that after you give him a camel monk, there were a lot of people were still upset about the fact that literally he was getting away with murder. They would throw things at him when he was on his own job. But that's what was going to be for their long term harm because here he was, here he was. Now, so I have to watch out for your desire to see that justice be done because it can lead you to a bad rebirth. A rebirth is based on thoughts of revenge or based on thoughts of wanting to avenge something. It's a bad rebirth. You don't want to go there. And so there's sloth and topper is the third hindrance obscures your mindfulness and awareness. Worrying those restless and anxiety can also be a big hindrance of moment of death. You'll be worried over the future of your loved ones or concerned for any punishments that you may have for your own past mistakes. These are the two big worries that the Buddha addresses. That's something you will have to want to counteract. And then finally, a doubt in uncertainty comes from not seeing the true Dharma. In other words, you haven't had an experience of the deathless yet. So there's going to be some doubts. Did the Buddha really know what he's talking about? Until you received, I'll tell you, I'll tell you, gaining the drama eye, there's still going to be some doubt. So this is one of the things you have to work on is what can I do to meditate in order to have that experience so I can overcome this doubt. Now, the antidotes for these of the five, the first one that has to be addressed is uncertainty because if you don't believe what the Buddha had to say or not confident what he had to say, then it's going to be hard to counteract the other hindrances at that moment of death to see them as the big problem facing you. So the Buddha gives various ways of addressing doubt prior to the stream after the first one is what we call his Buddhist wagers. We all know Pascal's wager. But however, if there is a God, it's a good thing to obey him. If there is no God, that doesn't hurt you. You've lost nothing. Well, in the Buddhist sense, he says, if you live a skillful life, even though it turns out that there is no such thing as karma, there is no such thing as rebirth, you can hold yourself with a sense of honor that you've lived in a harmless way by developing skillful qualities in the mind and abandoning non-skilful ones. Also, he says, just learn how to watch your own mind and try to make the distinction between what qualities in the mind are skillful and which ones are unskillful. And then notice, when you act on skillful qualities, how does it change your life? What benefits do you have? In particular, he recommends developing good will. This is of the very skillful qualities, as probably the quickest one to see that if you have good will for others, you're going to be able in a lot more skillful way. And again, you can hold yourself vulnerable if you haven't harmed anybody, even if there are no results of karma, there is no regret. And it gets you confident that yes, you can actually do this, because that's the other aspect of doubt. You may believe what the Buddha had to say, but if you say, I can't do this, that's going to really get in the way. But you can see yourself, good will is not that hard to develop. Because you think about it, we're the people for whom you have ill will. And you can probably think of a few right off the bat. You say, well, if what am I asked to do when I'm extending good will to them is basically, may this person see the error of their ways and change their ways, so they can find true happiness. Now that's something you can wish for anybody. The world will be a lot better place. So people could see, oh, I've been acting on skillful way, I should change my ways without having to think about getting punished or anything like that. You might say, well, there are certain people I'd like to see him hanging in the wind a little bit before they change their ways. And you have to remind yourself, well, nothing's really gained that way. And there's very few people who undergo punishment like that who don't get the sense of being justified or feel that they've been mistreated. Very few people see the connection between their mistakes and their suffering. So ideally, you should say, okay, maybe they see the error of their ways and learn how to change them. Another one of the hindrances the body gives instructions for these, you can read in the readings is how to deal with drowsiness. It starts with your meditating, and you find that you're getting drowsier will change the topic of your meditation. You can give us the breath, change the way you breathe first. And if you find that the breath, no matter how you breathe, you're still getting drowsier. Try to give yourself a meditation topic that engages the mind more. You can think of the different parts of the body or you can think about the bones in your scalp and start with the bones and the tips of your fingers. Where are they right now? Relax around them and move up to the second joint, third joint into the palms and hands off to the wrist, up to the arm, and start at the toes and work out through the body. Give yourself something more active to do. When I was in Thailand, there was a period when John Troy was very sick and we had a number of months there looking after him. But one by one by one, the different monks kept finding other things that they had to do. And so I started taking on this month's period of time of the day and on that month's period of time of the day. And I ended up with the 2am to 8pm shift, and all the other monks had 8pm to 2am. And so you can imagine me at 3am in the morning after that, I didn't get much sleep looking after John Troy and getting very drowsy. And I found that if I moved the spot of my focus, as I was focusing on the breath, three breaths in the middle of the chest, three breaths here, three breaths there, I was able to keep myself awake. So that's one of the ways in which you can counteract drowsiness. Give yourself something more active to think about as you meditate. As for the remaining three hindrances, these are the ones that come up most often in the Buddhist instructions to people who are dying. A lot of them worry comes up first. You're worried over the fate of others for whom you've been responsible. And if you think those thoughts yourself, you just have to say, what the time for that is, Pat, there's nothing I can do right now. I've got something else that I have to focus on right now, which is the fact that I'm dying. And I better get my mind focused on that. There's a couple of incidences. And you know, they're in the readings you read about. Mikula's mother talking to Mikula's father. Don't worry about me. She says, I'm going to be able to look after myself. I know how to sew. I know how to card will. I know how to weave cloth. I can look after the kids. If you're worried that I'm going to take on another husband, don't worry. I'm going to be as faithful to you after you die as I was during your life. Turns out the husband doesn't die. He goes to see the Buddha in the way. So, you know, you're really lucky that you have her as your teacher and counselor. So that's one thing you have to think about. Okay. You find someone yourself, you're worried about your past responsibilities. You realize, okay, a human being can take on so many responsibilities. It's going to be to have to be a time when you have to let them go. The time has come. Let them go. If you're worried over your past actions and things you've done in the past, they were unskillful. Here's another case where the Buddha has you develop the Brahma viharas. First, you remind yourself, okay, that was unskillful. I don't want to make that mistake again. Then you spread goodwill to yourself so you don't beat yourself up. And then goodwill to all beings. So you remind yourself, okay, I want to make sure I don't harm anybody. And in order to remind yourself of right view, this is what everybody says at the moment of death, it's good to think of your good actions even as you reflect on your generosity, reflect on your virtue, reflect on the qualities that lead someone to be a deva. So it's real. I'm sorry, I do have some good time. You focus on that. This has become a traditional practice throughout our body countries. And if somebody's dying, people around them will try to remind them none of the good times they've had in the past, but of the good things they've done. Of course, the antidote for ill will is thoughts of goodwill. The antidote to sensuality is the Buddhist contemplations on the drawbacks, the sensuality and the drawbacks of the body. Think of all those different images that Buddha gives of sensuality as being like chewing a dog, chewing on some bones, where there's no flesh at all. And John Lee's telling of that particular image, he says, it does have some flavor, which is the flavor of some saliva. That's a good image to give in mind. When you find yourself salivating over sensual pleasures, that's it, you're just eating around saliva. With the drawbacks of the body, you can think of the contemplation of the body in S32 parts or the fact that each of those parts is subject to an illness of one kind. You have an eye where there are eye illnesses, you have a mouth, there are mouth illnesses in the mouth, you have skin, there are skin illnesses, you're down the list. And do you really want to come to doctor and view my body like this? This is where we get into those interesting instructions to Mananama, where Mananama was asking the Buddha, if someone is passing away while the Buddha is gone, how do you counsel them? And the Buddha says, okay, once you've gotten sure that they're no longer worried about their parents or their wives, their children, responsibilities they've had in the past, and ask them, are you still concerned about leaving your human sensuality? And if the person says yes, and he said, well, the Davids have better sensuality than this, set your mind there instead. He starts out with the lowest level of the Davids and works up, up, up, up. And so you use sensuality of that kind to pull you away from your attraction to the human realm, because there are better realms to be in. And finally, you get to the point where you get to the Brahma realm, even in the Brahma realm, they have they suffer from self-identity. It'd be good to let go of your self-identity. In other words, stop thinking in terms of self and worlds in that case, and just look at the events in the mind and in other selves. And it is possible to put a set at that moment when the person can find release. So here we see the role of a caregiver is to encourage positive thoughts and act as a memory aid for those his memory is calling as staff approaches. Now, of course, going to a good destination is a good thing. You must imagine going to a bad one. There was a group of people came to see John Fung one time they'd been studying Appadama. And they heard that he was a good teacher. So they came to see him and they asked what he taught. He said, look at him, get into meditation posture and start focusing on your breath. Oh, no, no, we can't focus on the breath. We're afraid of a fall into China and be reborn as promise. He laughed. He said, well, being born as a problem is not a bad thing, even though the returns of being reborn as promise. And they were being reborn as a promise better being reborn as a dog. So good, good destination is not a bad thing. But you have to remember that going to a good destination the next time around doesn't guarantee that you're going to go into a good destination after that. So you're not 100% safe. So this is where if you want to go beyond any kind of good destination, and I'm sorry, this is where I have to understand becoming. You need to have to learn how to upset observe the steps leading there. This is what dependent core rising is all about. And learning how to see them in and of themselves. This is where you try to get rid of the narratives or worldviews that tend to come clustering in on you notices, of course, when you sit down and meditate, sometimes it's the narratives of the day, sometimes it's old stuff coming up. I've noticed especially during the pandemic that people say these memories of childhood come up. Unbidden. Because you know, there's not much happening in your daily life right now. And so you tend to be start focusing on things that happen in the past that come up, recently, well, that's we're going to come up with a moment of death to. And so you have to learn how not to go running with those narratives. Because they're going to create a sense of becoming, plus fear around what you become, will become when you have to lead these things. So you have to develop the skills that you learn in not giving meaning to pleasures and pains in the stories you tell yourself around them. In other words, to see these events as separate, this events coming and going in the mind. And to see where the appeal is, what's their lore, but also to see their drawbacks. Because everybody said the way to develop this passion for things is look for the appeal. Why does the mind go for them? Look for the drawbacks. And then when you see that the drawbacks outweigh the alert, that's when you can develop the dispassion will give you give you a sense of release. So you overcome clinging that by trying to see everything as a oneness. You're actually trying to see these events in the mind simply as separate events that are part of the calls of path process. You can keep the line on that level. As the Buddha said, you begin to see that it's just nothing but thoughts of your existence, or the existence of the world and the people that occur to you at that time, or thoughts of your non existence don't occur to you, either, or the non existence of the world is simply stress arising stress passing away. You say, I don't need this. There must be something better. And that's when the mind inclines toward the And this is what gives you the freedom from attachment. You would need to keep going in order to keep on being a being. At that moment when you're free from attachment, you're also free from all the limitations that go with attachment. The mind, the Buddha's image is of a fire that's released from its attachment to a fuel. Remember those days? The theory was that fire burns because it's feeding on its fuel. At the same time, it's clinging to the fuel. It's not the case that the fuel is clinging to the fire. So for the fire to be freed, the fire has to let go. In the same way, you're not the one who's being trapped by the narrative. So you tell yourself you're not the one who's being trapped by the pain that's coming up. You're the one that's holding on. It's your clinging that is trapping you. If you can limit how to let go, that's how you become free. And as the Buddha said, remind yourself that as you let go, you're not going into an annihilation. That, that, as he says, is a good thing. Since if you see that deathless would be something that we didn't have any pain or any sense of limitation or any sense of nostalgia or regret, this has maybe raised that thought because it's not true. Deathless is a good thing. So this is what the teachings are all aimed at. As I said, the Buddha started his quest for the Dharma, looking for what would not buy. It's because of his quest, because he stayed to stuck to it so thoroughly and so consistently that we have the drama to practice now. Which means that when we think about issues of aging, illness and death, there are not tangential applications of some Dharma that's meant to be just for the present moment. They're what the Dharma is all about because these are the big issues in life. You don't understand how to live your life well. It's good to understand what happens at death. What is the, how does the mind handle aging, illness and death so it doesn't have to suffer? When you can answer those questions, and then you've taken care of all the things that would really weigh down the mind, and you've given a good direction to your life. So those are the thoughts I have for this afternoon. And we will open the floor for questions. Quill. Thank you so much, Bande, for your teaching today and your enormous commitment to writing and websites and all you do. I appreciate it. Thank you for taking my question. I'm an end of life doula and I have a couple questions around that. One is compassionate choice. When I first began, I was quite black and white about it. It was just I can't support people who make this choice. As I've gone along, I'm starting to find differences with intention. And I'm wondering what you have to say about that. You're the nature. Well, you're the nature or in California, you can have assistance from a medical person if you meet certain criteria. Okay, well, from the Buddhist point of view, that's not a skivol approach. So what if someone makes that choice and I've been working with them, then do I just go, sorry, I can't be here. I can't help you. Okay, I want to say that this is something I can't assist you with. I'll get you in touch with somebody who can, but I can't do that. Okay, thank you. I also wonder what you would say around doing meta for people who've already died. Spread them as much meta as you want. Okay, good thing. Sometimes they tell you not to do that. Why? Why? I don't know, but I've heard that from just before. Well, there is the distinction that when you dedicate merit, that's something you do to people who have passed away. Because when you're dedicating merit, the person to whom it's being dedicated has to express appreciation for it. Now you can do that with people who are alive, but it's kind of embarrassing to say, I made some merit for you the other day and I dedicate you. I hope you're happy. Now if somebody can say that too without embarrassment, and they actually would be happy. Okay, go ahead. Okay, my third question is just around the present moment. In my experience, when I am in a very concentrated state, the present moment isn't really, it's a movement, so there's no stopping at a moment. Yeah, so I'm not sure how to be doing it in the present moment, I'm just with what is. Yeah, exactly. Because some people say when you're in the present moment, you're outside of time, but that's not the case. Time is very much there. You can see it slipping, slipping, slipping away. So what you want to do is say, given that this is where I am right now, in this sort of this flow, to what extent am I contributing to the flow, especially to what extent I'm contributing to any stress or suffering in the flow? Thank you. Appreciate that. Thank you. Peter? Okay, so I have a question about the hindrance of where is our anxiousness. I suspect that maybe a glimpse of what I could expect towards death. So my morning meditation is very often thoughts about the day flood me, but in a way that well, their fears or anxieties, but not anything that's really scary. It's mostly thoughts about angry people that I'm going to meet, angry phone calls, generic tens, I have this tense profession. And I know the other, like going over what's going to happen to me in the future, it sometimes helps because I can plan, or find an idea or solve a problem. So there is allure and I know that. There are also drawbacks because I know it's ruined my morning meditation, because evening meditation is easy compared to that. The mornings are difficult. To the point that I'm sometimes afraid to sit because I know I'm going to waste this hour or half an hour. So can you give me some advice? Okay, I would say make a promise with yourself that the last 10 minutes of the meditation, you will think about these issues. And then be very strict with yourself for the remainder of the time that you're not going to think about them. I tell you something, I'll be able to think them, think about them more clearly, because I have meditated out loud the mind to get quiet. The quiet mind is a much better source for insight than a worried mind. To make that promise with yourself, okay, I'll think about these things, say the last 10 minutes. And then in the meantime, I get, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. And this is where you get out your karate chop. But they're mostly rubbish. I don't want to think about them at all. Not even for 10 minutes. Okay, well, I mean, it's part of the practice is learning how to prevent unskillful qualities for rising in the future, right? Yeah. Okay, okay. And I want to prepare, I don't want to say anything unskillful to the people that I will meet or the angry phone calls that I'm going to receive in the course of the day. So take some time to think about it, think it through. So there must be a skillful way of doing this. And during the morning session, when you replied that we should treat these voices with goodwill, we're thinking about these kind of voices or something else. Because I thought when you talked about intrusive thoughts, this was the kind of voices that you that we're supposed to treat with goodwill. Yeah, there's the part of you that is legitimately worried about making a big error in the course of the day, right? So that's a good will for that part. Don't brush this side. Don't mistreat it. Because it will rebel after a while. Okay, it just like, it doesn't seem to make any sense this morning, because it's like, it's completely gone by afternoon. But it's just one of those cases where I want to survive the day. And when you get to him when you get the afternoon, I'm pretty close to survival now. Something the morning seems a little healthy long. The day seems a bit long in the morning. So it's good to say, okay, you humor that voice a little bit. So okay, let's let's, you probably know, at least one person who will call you in the course of the day who might get angry. So as you know, think about that person in particular, spread goodwill to that person and also then think, okay, what would be a skillful way of dealing with this person's way of dealing? And that way, that way, that little voice will probably then give you more time to actually do some meditation for the rest of that 15 minutes. That's right. Thank you. Thank you. Jeff and Rita. Hi, Donna, John. Thank you very much for teaching today. As always, I want to talk, ask about back to the issue of comma. And for those of us with sort of performance anxieties, this moment of death, reflection, contemplation can be incredibly daunting. And sometimes I think I get caught in seeing commas, a sentence sentencing, versus like a quintessential tool and teaching to be used to help guide me throughout my life, rather than just that moment of death. And so I, and I think I even heard, I guess, simply based on the suttas that I've come across, there seems to be a pointed effort, a focus on the heaviness of unskillful actions. And I think I even was at Ajahn Chah, who said, rather than doing good, don't do any harm, which seems to suggest a focus of, yeah, not doing anything unskillful would mean that I was already doing something skillful. So if I focus on- I think that John Chah there's talking to people who would like to give the generous a lot, but are not particularly concerned about observing the precepts. Okay. This is a problem that I ran into when I was teaching in Thailand. I know people were happy to be generous, but they didn't want to be bothered with the precepts. So he's saying, look, you've got to take them seriously. Now, if you find that you're taking them so seriously that you can't function, say, back off a little bit, remember the goodness that you've done. Okay. So there's just as much weight given by the Buddha in doing skillful as avoiding unskillful. Right. I mean, this is why he has your due reflection on recollection of your virtue of recollection of your generosity, recollection of the quality of the devas. I mean, these are things you have focused on those to lift your spirits. Okay. Okay. So just as many opportunities as doing good and focusing on that versus focusing on what I might get into trouble wise, right? To look for something skillful. And then do I understand correctly that the comma that will happen, if it's a good rebirth, even the Deva realms of the Brahma realms, they could be adversely affected by unskillfulness that we've done. And it would be there to make those positive realms somehow unpleasant. The only places they have is the passage on the betas who have palaces. The hungry ghost who have palaces. In other words, they spend half the day in their palace and half a day wandering around outside. Oh, so it's just a strictly positive experience. I guess the Deva realms are pretty positive. Yes. Okay. I guess I'm thinking of like the hell realms where, you know, the Buddha had that one thought of helping somebody who was being beaten and he left the hell realms immediately. So that shortened his length of stay just by having had passed good comma. So I guess it's just a complexity then after your Deva realms, you're going to pay for more. Which means that if you're in a Deva realm, make sure you're determined to practice. So you can approach death with that. If you haven't entered the stream with I want to be in a Deva realm practicing. Right. Right. Okay. So lastly, does the Buddha ever give suggestion of just the strength of practicing his teachings for awakening? Like he does going to the hell realms. Does he ever say if you're doing my teachings, you're going to be pretty sound? Well, basically it says, as you follow his teachings, you're not creating any of the causes for going to the lower realms. Now you may have some past bad karma, which this, these can erase, but remember the image of the lump of salt in the river. Right. Okay. You can, you can mitigate what you've done in the past by developing expansive mind states. Okay. Great. So in essence, you know, continue to focus on skillful and not just keep on doing good. Keep on doing good. And you're going to do well. Thank you. Oh, read also has a question. Can this be a two per one? So as I've been considering death and the transition, I've started to sense some fear coming up with claustrophobia. And I was wondering if you could give any recommendations on how to work with that. Think of a sense of space. Yeah. I told you that story about a John Fung student who was meditating one night and his voice came to her and say, you're going to die. And she couldn't stay anywhere in her body. She couldn't focus in here. So it was like a house of fire. Every room we went into was on flame. And then she thought of space. And so she took space as her object. And you know, if she had died at that time, she probably would have become a space data. Yeah. At least at least that gets you out of that feeling of everything's kind of closing in on you. Okay, so as I envision like losing contact with the Sun stores, just maybe focus on cultivating more of an awareness of space then. Thank you. Steve Ross. Thank you. I want to come back to Quillie's question about she talked about assisted, assisted suicide. And you mentioned euthanasia. But suicide itself, and the decision that person simply doesn't, well, I won't phrase it that way. But what confuses me is that in the suttas, we see examples of some our hearts who end their lives with a knife or what have you, I have not been able to understand how because you said that's not a skillful way they assisted suicide. The Buddha said that they are had suicide is the only suicide that is that is not lame where they are. They do it without any creative version of the vision. Right. That's in the canon. Yeah, I've forgotten which suttas in but it's, it's in one of the suttas. Okay, thank you. That clears everything up. Thank you very much. Steve Wells. Thank you. I've been studying in the Thai forest tradition for several years, but my teacher has not spoken of their teachings around death and dying. And I'm just wondering if there's some correlation between those teachings and the Tibetan Bardot teachings. Okay, there. Yeah, I think I mentioned my, my teacher had a number of students who are psychic, and they could see different people as they were going through the transition. And each person's transition is going to be very different, depending on the past karma. In other cases, there's some cases where they go through certain stages before they're reborn. In other cases, that's just like their vacuum cleaner pulls them out and there's someplace else right away. Like that case, I said, where the woman saw the dead bodies on the side of the road, but also saw those people standing around looking kind of lost. So sometimes, for lack of a better word, the spirit will be hanging around. And in cases like that, she would stop, spread goodwill to the men, then they would move on. Others just go right on. And there's a huge near-death experience, the literature in Thailand. And one of the common themes is that there's kind of a police clearing room, where there's somebody sitting behind a desk and they've got the ledger for where you go. And in each case, of course, the sergeant in charge looks at the ledger, it's not this time, this person's time yet. It's like, I get sent back, but sometimes they get the spirit guide that says, well, you know, as long as you're here, do you want to see a little bit of heaven and hell? I'm sure it'd be great. So they wander around and they come back, and then they tell their experiences. My favorite one was this one guy was going to this heaven, and all the devas were dressed in the traditional Thai style dress. And so he asked this guy, he says, is this just a heaven or a Buddhist? Are there no other religions here in heaven? And he said, oh no, we've got plenty of Christians and Muslims and other Hindus and whatnot. He says, well, aren't they kind of surprised to see all the devas wearing Thai clothing like this? And the guy said, you see us as you expect to see us. So the thing about going through the Bardos is they don't have that. And there's no set stage that everybody's going to have to go through. It's going to depend on your karma, whether it's a very good karma, pull your up right away or whatever. Thank you. Jeanie? Hi, I'm there, Jeff. So this question might be one of those unanswerable questions, but what is it that gets reborn? Is it the karma? Well, this is precisely what the Buddha says he didn't focus on. He focused more on how does the process happen? Because that's something you can actually do something about. I mean, if you want to take on an identity, you create your identity around what you're attached to. But the whole point is, you create your identity about the things you're around, the things you're attached to. That's what you are as a being, as your attachments. And so he wants to take attention away from that question. Because sometimes you say, well, what am I and you're going to grab onto this, this, this and make that into yourself. So he's trying to get you to get that way of looking at things in terms of simply actions in and of themselves. What am I doing? And what is it leading to? So that's where you want to focus. Okay. I think I understand that. Wonderful to see you. Thank you for teaching all of us. Thank you. So, so, so, so, I had a question on the 12 links. And I've heard still two schools of thought. And I think both are possibly correct. One is that you can break the links at any point. And the second is that you could break the links at contact with the five sense faculties. And then feeling arises, neutral, happy and sad. And then from there, we are intention and then clinging and craving. So if we break it at that point, would it help to contemplate on Anicha, Anatha and Dukkha impermanence, not self, right? And suffering, right? Right. Okay, you basically you can you can break the chain anywhere. There are two passages in the can and whether we're talking about every chain, every link in the chain is the one where you can possibly make the break. And in each case, he recommends that you look at it in terms of the four and all truths. What is the suffering around this thing? And then what is what is the origination of that suffering around this thing? What can I just stop it? Now, one of the ways that you're going to stop it is to develop this passion for it. And the way one way to develop this passion, of course, is once you've seen the allure, then you try to look at in terms of three perceptions. Anicha and Dukkha, yeah. And Nibida. So to develop Nibida will help. But you've had to develop a sense of disenchantment. Yeah. Okay, thank you so much. So wonderful to see you. Thank you. Isabelle. Thank you. Thank you, Tanajan. It's good to see you. My question is twofold. The first is what kind of chants or thoughts can I send to someone who is dying or who has just died, and I'm not with them? And then the second one related is, is that different for someone who has died because of assisted suicide? We have lots of goodwill. Lots of goodwill. If you want to chant, there's the chant, there's the Gauraniya Mehta Surtan, which is basically about goodwill. And remember, the Buddha never kept his teachings for only those who don't deserve to suffer. In other words, no matter what you've done in the past, whatever reason you're suffering may stop suffering. So it doesn't really matter how they died or whether you still send out sick of will. And then dedicate the merit of your practice to that person. Thank you. Sylvia. Good afternoon, Tanajan. Thank you for your wonderful talk. I have a question regarding the natural and unnatural death. Let's say that you're struck in the natural disasters like an earthquake or lightning strikes or a car hits you suddenly. How can we prepare for that? When it's a second, how can we still be mindful and alert at times like that? Here, I think the last one is safe. Okay. Basically, the Buddha says there's a similar case like this in the Surtas where Mahatma comes to say the Buddha says, you know, what if an elephant strikes me? That was their version of a car crash. And it was the same sort of thing. He said, just keep your mind close, just remind yourself, okay, the time has come, I just got to drop things. And this is one of the reasons why the Adjarnas encourage you to stay with the breath as much as you can as you go through the day. So if anything unexpected comes up, okay, you're there, you're ready, you're ready. Thank you. Drake. Hello, Adjarn, thank you. Thank you for everything. I saw in the readings you included MN 143. I don't think you talked about it just now, but or didn't explicitly talk about it, but in that Suta, Saraputa is talking to Ana and he's basically walking him through things to like, don't cling to this, don't cling to this. And it's like, don't cling to the eye, don't cling to forms, don't cling to the eye consciousness. And then it goes through like, contact and feelings and fabrications and jhana grounds. And I'm just wondering if that progression of that list shows up anywhere else. Is that a list that I'm not recognizing somehow? Or that particular list appears? Okay, it doesn't seem like it. Well, maybe there's some order to it that I just don't see very easily. But well, maybe Saraputa was reading his mind. Oh, okay. Something I didn't think was related to today's topic, but maybe it is. I mean, before I fall asleep, as I'm falling asleep, I do some meditation and keeps occurring to me that that might not be so often advised against to meditate until you fall asleep. I was just wondering, I can't remember you saying either way. It's perfectly fine. Okay. But also meditate at some other time that I choose. So your meditation doesn't always end in sleep. Yes. Okay. Yes. Yes. For sure. Okay. Yep. Okay. Thank you. Kevin. Kevin. Kevin China. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Can you hear me? Okay. Thank you, Chen Zhan, for I want to show my greatest respect to you, for my wife and me, and for your current talk and the past ones. My English is poor, so I apologise first. So I want to report my daily practice first, and I have a short question later. So I listen to your talks every day. And I, in the morning, every time I sit like half an hour, I listen to your talks, whole body breathes. Very good. Very nice. And in the noon, I have a snap of half an hour. By that time, with fewer awareness, but the refreshment is also good. So after I finish my work, I go to practice some yoga. Though the mind is much more restless than pastor too. But I still always remind myself that you said we shall try to be aware. Just remind Ramana. And later, after the yoga, the awareness come back, the body feel good, and the mind quality become better. So because of that, because I practice that day by day, and I would like to report that my addiction to gaming is decreasing dramatically. Because before, you know, I also practice but you know, the mind is very weak in the night, so he cannot stop attached to the gaming, though the gaming is very exhausted. But nowadays, because the value judgment system is slowly created. So when he finds that the mind and the body is more have more high quality, so the mind immediately dropped gaming, because it's not worth it. Sometimes I also craft, I also hold the gaming, but quality is so it's a bad business. So the mind, I can see it's very sharp. He slowly transferred to the to the good sign. So I was so I would say, thanks, thanks for for you teaching because it's not very easy. I've tried many years, many teachers and thank you very much, Ajang, your, your teaching for me to so they can see the mind change to the to another way. So this is my first report. And second is, I see sometimes I just say one question is that I saw sometimes many times the mind is have a pattern that he was saying, for example, when I go to the have the weekend, things will becomes better. Something like if the holiday comes, things becomes better like he wants to change the beans. I don't know if I say clearly, for example, you said now that the days is too busy to suffering, the weekends will be better. For example, also like the holidays will become better means these days he wants to forget now, a present. And I found that the mind have that kind of pattern. You want to forget the present and hold the concept like later, from a weekend from the holiday is that the truth. Run that question, pass me again. So I want to say that I find many times the mind when he was the condition is not good, he was thinking one away the mind was thinking, if I have the weekends, if the weekends comes, the things will become better than now. I saw many times like the holiday comes, he think when the holiday comes, then that's your question. I got your question. Yeah. Well, basically, if it's one way that helps you have some patience and endurance with the difficult situations, reminding yourself, okay, things will get better. That's one way of doing it. In order to have some patience with what's going on in endurance. The other way, of course, is to remind yourself, even though conditions outside are not that good, I can still breathe comfortably in the midst of all this. Right now, I can find some pleasure. So you don't have to wait until the holiday or wait until the weekend in order to have a good time. You can say, okay, there's some, there's still some opportunities for pleasure here, even in a difficult circumstance. Thank you. Thank you. Alex. So, I had a question. You mentioned goodwill, quite a lot, and in the first part. So just to check something with you. So my understanding is that goodwill is about intention. So that when we're practicing meta, that we should be thinking about the intention to not do harm. So it's about the action, rather than focusing just on spreading this sense of people. You want to do both. Think about how, you know, it would really be good to see people happy. Yeah. As I go about that, what can I do to help them? Because they're going to be the ones that will have to create the causes for happiness for their actions. Is there anything that I can help? So your focus, is it the intention that you focus on? Focus on the intention and also on what you hope, the intention aims at happiness for everybody. So the other thing that's connected with that is that there's a relationship, am I right? I think there's a relationship between Siva, which is a kind of protection and goodwill. They share that same aspect of protecting your mind. Is that right? Right, right. Because they both have to do with intention. It's simply that goodwill is part of the motivation for observing the precepts. This is one way of being harmless. So if you want to develop goodwill to further as much as possible, could you take it as a concentration practice? Oh, yes, yes. Again, this would be something that it depends on your individual tendency. Some people find goodwill an easy topic to use as a concentration practice. Other people find it a little bit too vague and they need the body as a grounding. So this will be an individual matter. So when I'm practicing goodwill, there's a whole sort of sentence, which you can say, you know, may all beings be one happy, may treat some suffering, animosity, etc. But I find that can be a bit laborious. Okay, then you just shorten it down to one word, which is may, thought, or goodwill. And you can just keep that word in mind. And if there's no feeling, does that still, as long as there's a thought of intention? Because sometimes it's a little bit of intention. Yeah, because sometimes the feeling doesn't come because it's a lot of work on the intention. Because those mental phrases, there are a few that are found in the canon. But they're not nearly as elaborate. Basically, is may all beings be happy and also may they all acts in a skillful way, because that's going to be the causes for the happiness. So then come back to that. Right. And then for a concentration practice, and he's shorted it to one word. There was just a quick question, if that's okay, about the conversation between Sarah Putter and Ananda Pindika. When he goes through all the different stages, aspects of things not to claim to anywhere or anything. Is that a reflection, like a contemplation to reflect on as a practice? Or is it a concentration practice? Basically, a discernment practice. Are you attached to this again? Let it go. Attached the list, let it go. Now hopefully Ananda Pindika had his mind concentrated at the time. Because it requires a fair amount of concentration to see clearly what it is you're attached to. So a bit of both maybe reflection. Right. Okay. Thank you. Hindu. And Tanashian. So just coming back to a question that was asked before. You know how apparently in the sutas there's like arahants who commit suicide and that's okay. So given that they've got this sort of undisturbed happiness, I'm guessing that the suffering of their bodies are just easily managed. Why would they want to kill themselves? Because they see that they're just a burden to other people. Oh, wow. They don't want to be a burden to them. Okay. I had two other quick questions. One is to do with, so if someone's like for a practitioner, I understand at the moment of death, like your intention should be, okay, where can I practice the dumb mother best? Let's go there. But if it's someone who's culturally Buddhist, like my dad, who's not like a big practitioner, and even listening to like talks on nibbana gets him all agitated and he's like, no, no, no, it's not time yet. For a person like that, telling him, okay, so maybe your intention should be somewhere you could practice, you should go for somewhere, aim for somewhere where you need to practice doesn't really feel like it's going to be effective, because that's not where his mind's at. So what could I tell him to aim for? Tell him to aim for a state of being where she's harmless. Harmless. Okay. Could I ask him to aim for somewhere where it's like a lot of pleasure, hoping that it'll be a day around? Well, you never know what pleasure he's going to latch on to at that moment. He said, this looks pretty good. You know the story of the two friends who are practicing, and one of them dies, becomes a deva, and the other one becomes a fly in an outhouse. So the deva goes down and says, where's my friend? What happened to him? He sees him, he's a fly down in the outhouse. So he goes down and talks to him. He says, what are you doing down here? And the friend says, what do you mean down here? I'm in heaven. See, my head is green. I'm an Indra, you know, and food falls out of the sky. More food than I can eat falls out of the sky every day. So don't just go for pleasure, go for harmless pleasure. Okay, harmless pleasure. Yeah. And the other quick question I had was, so I've been falling into this trap of thinking something is good enough and thinking that it's a skillful way of thinking, but it's also quite an easy mask for laziness and also not going for high expectations for the day. So what I'm doing now is to kind of reflect at the end of the day, okay, well, did I, did I have a good day where I met my expectations or did I just say things are good enough and just kind of like walked off? But the thing is when I do that reflection is there's a relentless voice in my mind that tells me that I could do better. And I don't know how to manage that because there's always things I could do better. So do I just keep driving myself because that sounds like a lot of pain. I will do one one extra thing better every day. Okay, just just throw a little something for good measure. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Awesome. Thank you. Aileen. energy. I wanted to ask about mindfulness of death because there's part of me that is already doing it. My birthday's coming up on Tuesday. If I live that long, I'm going to be 70. And that's in my mind, but there's another part of my mind that say, mindfulness of death, that's heavy. And you know, that sounds weird. And if I told my friends what I was doing this Saturday, they'd go, So there's, there's the ambivalence. And I'm just wondering what I can do. I'm not going to tell my friends about yet. But what can I do to help myself not be not tell the resistant part? What can I tell it to come up? Okay, well, basically, remember, mindfulness of death is not just thinking death, death, death, death, death, all the time. We're thinking, I have the opportunity with this breath to do something good. What can I do with it? That's what it's all about. Thank you very much. Tom. Hi, John. I'll just talk about the realms. I'm getting a little bit confused about what I should be aiming for. I thought I heard at one point that the human realm was the best realms of practice. But it sounds like now I was hearing you say going to some other realms, like Devo or Brahm, Brahm might be better. But what should we be aiming for? Or I don't press my own judgment, I'm afraid I'm going to pick the wrong one. Because my mind's not very wide all the time. Don't choose anything below the human realm. Okay. Okay. Is there one realm that's the best realm? Or it depends on your They say that the realm of the contented Devos is a really good one to practice in. They're the ones that are kind of wise about pleasure. And they're sort of far seeing Devos and they can see the dangers of being heedless. And John, Suwat made a comment to one of his, some of his students who visited from Bangkok one time, he said, the human realm is going to get pretty bad. Don't come back to the human realm, try for a Devo realm. I can see that happening. I mean, I can see that coming. Thank you. Thank you. Anh Phuong? Thank you for your teaching. Thank you for your teaching, Monday. My question is about follow up with Gita about the dwelling of independent origination, Monday. I don't understand how can we can break the cycle at any point because they becoming or say rebirth. It seems like when we say that is like we have the control over the natural cycle of thing. I thought that we should just break it at ignorant by having wisdom. Okay, you're basically it's bringing it's bringing it's bringing wisdom to any of the things. You don't just cut with the scissors, you have to cut with knowledge. And so if you bring knowledge of the formidable truths to any of the factors, basically, because any of the factors up to clinging, once you've hit clinging, you're suffering already. So I have to turn back and look at the craving because you have to cut it at the craving. So anything from anything from fabrication up through craving, you can cut it. Yes, as long as you bring bring knowledge to that particular connection. Thank you. Marisol. I don't Jeff, I'm afraid your answer to a previous question about the our Hans committing suicide because and because they thought they were too much of a burden. Makes me think of me. I mean, if they are too much of a burden, I must be, you know, 5000 times much more of a burden than their work is done. Their work is done. They just want to go. Your work is done yet. I know. Yeah. That's why I'm around working on it. I'm sorry. That's why you have to hang around and work on it. Okay, so so their work is done. And they've earned the luxury of being able to, you know, bow out, I guess. Okay, I haven't earned that yet. Okay, thank you. Okay. Hello, I'm sorry, no video. I just want to say that I think with everything we've heard you say today, and as we learn about self and not self, we the way out appears to be fabrications clearing out the misfabrications we have in our mind in order to end suffering. But for me, whenever I try to attempt to whenever I see that I'm going off track, and I try to change the perceptions, and in order to stay with things as they are in and off themselves and not of the world, because you know, the corporate world ideas come in, diffusing things that relate to the four nodal truths. I just wondered if you were going to write a demo app that we could all plug into our minds to care all of this. I mean, it's ongoing. And it really appears to be that, you know, just clearing the fabrications, and thinning them down and refining them is the way out. How what sort of what can I keep in mind when I sit down to meditate or even when I'm walking around, and thoughts come into into my head? What can I keep in mind in order to stay in the in what's happening in and of itself? And in order to stay within the parameters of the four noble truths? I think if I have something like that to put me back on track, I'd be able to say, oh, and if this is the case, and this is it, then this is what I need to do. Can you can you can you well, this is about the Buddha has those four, the four frames of reference for establishing mindfulness. Choose any one of the four. So I'm just gonna make this the constant practice of being with the body in and of itself or feelings in of themselves and have my mind keep returning to returning to as much as I can. And you bring in issues of the world only when you have to deal with the people in the world or other issues in the world. And try to make history a default mode that you're going to go back to get just feelings in and of themselves or the bodies in and of itself. Try to hold that in mind as your frame of reference. Okay. And so that will help stabilize the mind in any one of those frames from which Okay, thank you, Ajahnjal. Right. I don't know if I said your name right. Sorry. Right. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ajahnjal for the generosity this summer for us. My question will be about is having an aspiration to be to rebirth in a better place like Devarium or or Brahmarium constitute as a identity view in lower factors. Thank you. As long as you have that sense of identity. Yes, I want to be reborn here. I want to be born there. There is a sense of identity that goes with that. But there, as long as you still need a sense of identity in order to function, you're trying to choose a choice, choose a skillful one. So in that case, in our practice, we shouldn't aim to be rebirth in the good realm, but to liberation, right? I can't aim at liberation. But also, I had to say this, but edge your bets. So you do have some you have prepared it just in case I don't make it all the way to our hardship in this lifetime. I'll have some good things to fall back on good places to practice. I see. Thank you very much. So Tanujan, that concludes all the questions. Okay. I had a few questions if you don't mind. Okay, sure. Go ahead. So one was the Buddha's wager versus the Pascal's wager, which you actually got, which I thought was very interesting. I was just thinking a little bit about it. And I noticed that Pascal's wager was more for the end goal that he was driving for was that you would adopt a particular belief, belief in God in that particular case. Whereas in the version of the Buddha's wager that you actually presented. If I understand correctly, there are two versions, both of which are connected. One was basically towards skillfulness of actions towards making you more skillful. But the other one is also set of beliefs, right view. There are four different gradations of right view, all the way culminating in view that okay, Nipana is possible. Yeah. Both of these are connected, but I often find that people, at least most of the times, people seem to be more comfortable with the one which is expressed just in terms of skillful actions, not so comfortable with the one that is expressed in terms of the four gradations of belief, the four different right views. Can you speak a little bit to that? Can you kind of clarify how we should arrange our mind around this maybe to understand this a little bit? Well, the idea that there is Nirvana, some people find a little bit too daunting. Right. If I really believed in Nirvana, it would require more of me. Or if I really believed in Nirvana, it would require more of me. Okay. Right. It's interesting that this question is being brought up here in the study center. I do not belong in the study center. Okay. No, but in under their ages, because there was one year that I was saying, there's there are all these courses where people say, imagine that you have only one year left to live and you get together as a group and you say, what is the date that we're going to sign kind of as our cutoff date and imagine what it would be like if this were our last year to live. And I said, what you really ought to do is get a group of people together and say, what if we really believed in rebirth? Let's live our life for one year as if we really believed in rebirth. And a year after that, someone came up to me and he had been at the previous session and he said, you know, when you said that I really resisted it. And so I thought, so I looked into it, why do I resist this idea? And he said, it would make me realize I would have to live a much better life. Okay. The other thing that I had as a question, sorry, I'm taking so long. I thought you said somewhere in between that only four of the five hindrances that appear at the moment of death. But when you're they can all appear at just that in the canon, when they when they mentioned the hindrances that can appear at death, they make explicit reference only to four. Ah, okay. Okay. So even though the flaws and torpor is implicitly there when the Buddha is saying be mindful of the alert is basically don't be slothful. Don't be torpid. Okay. Okay. Then the other question that was coming up was remembering the triple gem at the moment of death. Is that is that of any value? Because I've been told that remembering the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha is a kind of right view. It's connected with the right view in a way. But what's connected is connected with conviction and American victim in the Buddhist is because what? Because we believe that he really was awakened. Right. So that connects with conviction as a quality that's that's useful to have. In that particular context, is it more useful to actually just think that, okay, awakening is possible? Or is it more useful to think that this was the one stage whose teachings are the ones that actually need to awaken? Which one is actually? Well, you would have both. Yes, it is possible. And this is the guy who knows the way. Okay, both, both of those are required. Okay. The one question that was coming around about spirits was that, you know, oftentimes I've heard at least in the whenever talk around spirits actually starts somewhere in, you know, among my friends or something Dhamma friends. Usually the question comes about, is there anything over there? Is there anything there? And sometimes some people say there is nothing there. You can't really pinpoint what is there can point out this is this is the one that is the spirit that is the one that is the spirit. But I thought of answering that in this way, I thought, why not we say, okay, what is it clinging to? Is there something that it can cling to? And if there is something that is clinging to whatever being is there that is actually clinging to it, that would be this. Okay, because what we what we think of experience is actually kind of an intro rebirth. Right. And again, the rebirth comes because of what becomes and becomes becoming and becoming happens because of clinging. Okay, okay. The last question, one thing that you mentioned was justice, don't bother about it at the moment of death. Okay, that somebody deserves to suffer at the moment. That almost seems like, you know, we've been talking, you also given one interesting talk, and you've written an essay also on, you know, Google over justice or something. There's no justice. Yeah, there's no more justice. And seems like justice is that longer heads with me. Is that a true statement? Well, again, where where it is that loggerheads you have to choose the wise path. Well, there are a lot of times where it's not at loggerheads. I mean, you try to you try to arrange things and try to get things to settle that is figure out who made the mistake and how we can correct it. That kind of justice. Okay, but there are certain cases where you're gonna have to choose either I'm gonna have to go over justice or I'm gonna have to go for the wise course. And okay, in that case, I've just got to go for the wise course and let this go. That's where I've been in it. And because it to an extent justice does not really hold at the ultimate level when it comes to the banner, we're probably lucky in the sense that we can actually get out if justice is ready. If you had to repay for all your mistakes, you would never get out. You never get out. Okay. And so you don't have to make everybody else pay for their mistakes either. All right. Thank you so much. I'm sorry. I took so much. There's some questions in the chat. Yeah, that's what I wanted to read. Oh, okay. One of them is would it be unskillful if one is terminally ill but die without assistance, but choose to stop eating and drinking? That's your choice. Okay, another question in some cultures in the past aged or ill person would choose to be left or die, but stop eating in order to benefit the family or tribe so as not to be a burden that is not greed of craving or is a delusion. Okay. Basically, it's you're just being leaving yourself out to die at a natural pace. And here again, this is one of those cases where that's your choice. That time when it's on shot and had that operation which made him nonfunctional and they kept on calling an artificial life support every John and Tyler to other students don't do that to me. When the time comes to go, just let me go. Okay, thank you. One question. Next question, would it be skillful if one is terminally ill but die without assistance, but choose to stop eating and drinking. The other one is, dear John, could you please explain more about why compassion and choice is not a skillful way for death. The patients all have terminal illness and have six months left. The Buddhists choose it to die, what will be the result of his or her afterlife. Okay, they're basically, this is their chance to continue learning how to deal with pain and a lot of useful lessons can be learned that way. Because you don't know if when you go, if you choose to die, a lot of this desire to die is the idea of being able to put an end to your suffering. We don't know. You could go to a worse place as a human being. And if you're a practitioner, you still have the opportunity to practice. So go ahead and keep on practicing. Okay, one more question. Is it okay to receive pain during medication like OPH near death? Would it be unskilled? Would it be unskillful in terms of mindfulness? Okay, there you can take doses that don't interfere with your mindfulness. You know, those places where they allow the patients to control the amount of, you know, morphine that they're getting, whatever, they tend to take a lot less than when the nurses come around and give them shots. Because the nurses have to compensate for the fact they're not going to be able to give a shot from another 24 hours or whatever. So they tend to overdose the patients. Whereas when you're on the drip, you can control the better and the patients tend to be more mindful and use a lot less of the painkiller. Thank you, Taja. I don't see anything else in the stream. I think there was another question that you missed from Stephanie. Please go ahead and read it out. If you can see it. Yeah, yeah, Arjun. What's a skillful way to help a person who's at the end of their life do not study the Dhamma and who have a lot of remorse about things they have done? Thank you so much for teaching. Okay, reminding them that the best thing you can do about remorse about things you've done is to just take up makeup your mind that you recognize that as a mistake and you resolve not to repeat the mistake. I then just have lots and lots and lots of goodwill about goodwill for all beings. And doing research for this particular issue, I kept coming up again again and again how much goodwill plays a role in dealing with illness. Goodwill plays a role in dealing with worrying. It plays a role in dealing with, of course, with ill will, plays a role in dealing with uncertainty. It's one of the ways in which you can prepare yourself for a good rebirth. So the practice of goodwill is a very important part of preparing for aging and less of that more than I would expect it. Okay, well, I hope this has been helpful. Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. Did you say anything about chanting? Thank you, Banti. Thank you very much, Tanya. Thank you. And thank you to all the organizers. Thank you, Banti. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Banti. Bye. Thank you. Thank you to all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Janata Marcos, aren't you glad you're not translating? Oh, I'm very glad. Thank you very much. We all be well. We all be well. Thank you.
