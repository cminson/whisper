 Hi, everyone. So over the past weeks, we've been exploring this teaching on awareness of mindfulness, the Buddhist teachings on four foundations of mindfulness, the Satipatanasuta. And we've been kind of doing a deep dive, maybe deeper than in other areas in a way, in the teaching in that sutta on the mindfulness of the five aggregates, which is in the fourth foundation of the Satipatanasuta. The five aggregates are a way that the Buddha kind of described what we experience. We have this body, this mind that experiences things, and there's different ways to describe the things that we experience, what the process is, what happens for us as human beings. We can think of our human system as different senses, for example, the six senses of the five physical senses plus the mind. And the Buddha also had this perspective on our experience from a different, kind of a different avenue, which he used the term, the five aggregates for, five processes of body and mind that interweave, that connect and create what we experience. I mean, these processes work together to, I guess, create what we experience is as good a way to put it as any. So the body, the form, physical form is one of these five aggregates. It is the physicality of our experience. And that in general, that comes in through our five physical senses. So the body, the skin, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the mouth, all of that, all of the experiences that come in through the physical sense basis, that is called form. So that's the first aggregate. So it's a big lump of physicality, basically, and lump or heap or mass. That's a good translation, actually, for aggregate. In other places in the suttas, I just recognized the other day in several places in the suttas, that word that's sometimes translated as aggregate in this particular teaching is elsewhere just translated as mass. Big heap of stuff. So the body is one collection of the area of our experience. And then the other four that the Buddha brings out in this particular teaching are connected to processes and things that happen in our mind. So the kind of the interweaving of various threads of mental process that kind of put together what we experience. So the other four are feeling, the pleasant, unpleasant, neutral aspect of experience, perception, how we recognize experience, the kind of the way our system works, that when we come into this world, we don't have names or identification for various objects, but we learn over time what things are. And so that is the process of learning or recognizing, beginning to recognize what's happening around us. So I look around this room and easily, instantly know flower and couch and wall and light window, that kind of thing. So that's the process of perception at work. So that's the second of the mental aggregates of the mental heaps. Then the third mental aggregate is what's called mental formation or volitional formation. This is a whole set of states of mind that have a kind of an intentionality to them. So this includes all of our emotions. It includes our thoughts. It includes a variety of mind states. So the emotional realm, such as anger, frustration, confusion, love, happiness, fear, all of that is found in this aggregate of mind state of mental formation. But also things like mindfulness, concentration, equanimity, things that we wouldn't necessarily consider emotions are found in there. And thoughts are also in this aspect of experience. And then the fifth is consciousness. That's this bare kind of knowing experience. And it said the teaching on consciousness in the Buddha's psychology says there's six kinds of consciousness, one for each of the five physical sense basis. So there's seeing consciousness, hearing consciousness, smelling consciousness, taste consciousness, touch consciousness. And then there's also consciousness connected with mind. So there's awareness or so there's not only awareness when we see there's the kind of there's a sight and there's the eye and there's, you know, kind of a contact of physical contact of a photon on the eye. And that's translated into sight. So there's all of these physical sense basis have a kind of a contact to them. But then and also in the mind, there's understood to be a kind of a contact of various experiences like an emotion is arising in our experience and emotion is arising. And there's the recognition of it. There's a knowing of it. A thought is arising and there's a knowing of it. And so there's also understood to be mind consciousness, consciousness, awareness of what goes on in our minds. And so these five aggregates, the form, the physicality, feeling, perception, mental formations and consciousness, they kind of all come together in in a moment. We experience what we experience as kind of an interweaving of these five things of these five aspects. And and that will continually flow and change the different experiences. There'll be experiences with certain pleasant experiences, pleasant sensations for a while and it'll shift to unpleasant or our our mental formation will shift from confusion to fear. So there's all this this flow, this change, our bodily sensations are continuously changing and flowing. So the experience that we that we have, what we experience, the the definition of these five aggregates is is the totality of our human experience. And so whatever we experience is found within these five aggregates. So this is this is a way of thinking about the entirety of what we experience. So in a moment, we'll be experiencing some composition of these five aggregates. In the Satipatanasuta, the encouragement for awareness is to get to know these these experiences to get to know what body is, what feeling is, what perception is, get to know them all, and then to be aware of their impermanent nature, how they arise, how they pass, that they change. And part of the reason for that is because very easily our human processes, the way our system works, and particularly actually perception is part of this confusion that we misperceive, misunderstand these aggregates or the experience that we have. Let's just talk about it as the experience we have. We can even leave aside the word aggregate for now. Just that the experience we have, we misperceive it or mistake it as having some kind of substantiality. And because we mistake it as having some kind of substantiality, we tend to cling to it. We tend to think it's worth clinging to. We tend to think it's, there's something to cling to as opposed to things being just a continual flux. We kind of land or think, okay, this, this experience, this has got some substance to it. And that mistake around substantiality often expresses itself through some form of identification. This is mine. This is who I am. Or this is myself. This is me. We talked a little bit about that in the last couple of times. Today I'd really like to start focusing on the, there's a teaching, one of my favorite teachings in the, in the suttas is around the insubstantiality of the aggregates. And it's framed through five similes, five similes about each one of the aggregates and how the, the each of these aggregates is, is insubstantial. And that the similes point to the way we might mistake or confuse something to be substantial. So the, the observance or recognition of the insubstantiality of the, of the, of these experiences in our body and mind helps to correct that misperception that there's something there to cling to, something to identify with, something that is I or me or mine. And so the, the I think that the teaching on insubstantiality that I'm going to start today, I, I'm really thinking to, to do it over several weeks rather than trying to do all five of these in one talk, you know, to, to just take some time with each one. But I'll, I'll give you all five similes right now and just give you the flavor of the similes. And then over the next weeks, we'll, we'll explore each one of these similes. So so the five similes are for form. Actually, I'll read, I'll read, I'll read this. Or I'll read abbreviated. I'll read this abbreviated. Suppose this river Ganges was carrying along a great lump of foam. Someone with good sight would inspect it, ponder it care and carefully investigate it. And it would appear to them to be void, hollow and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a lump of foam? So to whatever kind of form there is, whatever physicality there is, one ponders it, inspects it, investigates it, and it would appear to one as hollow and insubstantial. For what substance can there be in form? So this is the comparison of the physicality to a lump of foam. The second. Suppose that in the autumn it is raining and big drops are falling. A water bubble arises and bursts on the surface of the water. When with good sight would inspect it, ponder it, investigate it, and it would appear to be void, hollow and insubstantial. For what substance can there be in a water bubble? So to whatever kind of feeling there is, one inspects it, ponders it and carefully investigates it and it would appear to be void, hollow and insubstantial. For what substance can there be in feeling? The third is comparing perception to a mirage. Notice that in the last month of the hot season, at high noon, a shimmering mirage appears. One with good sight would inspect it, investigate it, and it would appear hollow and insubstantial. The fourth is comparing, this one's a little bit odd and when we get to this one, I'll unpack it much, much more than I will today. The fourth is comparing these mental formations, the activities in our mind, those intentional kind of activities, anger, confusion, frustration, also love and happiness and thoughts, all of that, all of those mental things. He compares them to basically to a banana tree. He compares them to a plantain tree. And the image there, he says, suppose someone in needing heartwood, in search of heartwood, went into a forest and saw the trunk of a large plantain tree, straight, fresh, without a fruit bud core. And I lived in the South Pacific for a while and banana trees are pretty substantial looking. Their trunks can be six inches across or even bigger sometimes. So they're pretty substantial. They're solid, they're hard. But you cut it down. So this is what he says, they would cut down the plantain tree, cut off the crown and unroll the coil because that's what you do, that's what you can do with a plantain tree. Basically that trunk that looks so solid and substantial is made of layers, one leaf on top of another, one thing on top of another. And you roll it, you unroll it, you unroll it, you unroll it. And there's nothing solid in the middle. That's his analogy for our mental formations. It is one layered on top of another on top of another. And boy, that does really resonate with me when I think about my mental formations, the way they layered. It's like the thought will yield an emotion and that emotion will trigger another emotion, which will trigger another thought and they just like, they build, they roll up, they coil up and they become very solid and substantial feeling. So that's the image for the mental formations. The last image that is brought up in this set of analogies is for consciousness. He compares consciousness to a magic show. So he says, suppose that a magician or a magician's apprentice would display a magical illusion, one with good sight when inspected, pondered and carefully investigated, and it would appear insubstantial. For what substance can there be in a magic show? Now this one I'll just leave there for consciousness right now and we'll talk about it in some other weeks. This one to me is a deeper unpacking. So we'll just leave that one there. So these five images for each four hour experience. Form is like a massive foam. Feeling is like an airy bubble, a bubble that's float that's on the surface of a stream. Perception is like a mirage. Mental formations is like that coil of banana tree and consciousness is like a magician's show, like a magic show. So he's pointing to the emptiness, the insubstantiality and using these images. So each of these images both points to, in one way, points to something that we might take or mistake to be solid. And yet when we look at it carefully, we see that it's not. So it's got that illusory nature. And so the images are kind of pointing to something that might seem solid, but then when you look at it more carefully, it's not. And the similes are, I think, very brilliantly connected to the aggregate. Like the description of the mental formations in the banana tree. To me, that's a brilliant analogy of the way the layers of our mental formations gather and collect on top of each other and feel so substantial. And so each of these images both points to the way we think of or might experience something is substantial. And then the closer inspection revealing it not to be substantial. So the teaching on insubstantiality has a couple of different flavors to it. It's got the flavor of not having a kind of solid or stable existence. That's one piece of it, the insubstantiality. So without inherent existence. And one way of reflecting on that is that experience is based on conditions. It comes into being on conditions and it falls apart on conditions. So it's not got its own inherent nature. It's dependent on other things. And when conditions fall apart, what we think of as a thing falls apart. And so it's not really a thing. It is a process of an unfolding process. And so that's one way of understanding this insubstantiality. And some of the analogies point to that pretty directly too. Another way of understanding insubstantiality is the word often used or sometimes used is empty. And he uses that word here. Well, I don't think that the word shunyata is actually used in this, but in translating it inspects it, it would be void, void or empty, void, hollow and insubstantial. So those three words the Buddha has used to describe each of these similes and each of the aggregates void, hollow and insubstantial. So void or empty. You know, sometimes when we think of empty, we think of nothing. But what the Buddha that there's elsewhere in the, in the teachings, the Buddha says that when he speaks of emptiness, somebody asked him a question, what do you mean when you say empty? And he said, it is empty of self and what belongs to self. So that's the definition of emptiness in the polycanon. It's empty of self and what belongs to self. So the exploration of the emptiness of these aggregates is also pointing to the not self nature of these aggregates. So this is a pretty deep teaching and there's a lot to unpack here. So the first simile, just go into a little bit more depth in, in the first simile on the body. So the Buddha says, suppose that this river Ganges was carrying along a great lump of foam. Now, I've never been to India or to see the river Ganges, but there's, there's, I have been to the Pacific coast and there are certain times of the year where there seem to be a lot of, you know, organic matter in the water. And if there's a lot of churning waves, then there can be great, big, huge lumps of foam that are kind of tossed up onto the beach. One day I was, I was at a, this is up in Oregon. I was at a house doing a self retreat and there'd been a huge storm and I'd been going along the ocean and walking and seeing the various places in the, along the beach. And there was this one beautiful cove that I love to go and sit on. It was very, it's a little still kind of almost like a pond, but it was fed with the, it was fed both with freshwater and with saltwater. And when the tide came in, the, the, the cove filled up a little bit more and then it went down. Well, when I, I went on a walk after this huge storm, it had been an enormous storm and I went for this walk and I went down to the cove and I couldn't even get onto the little beach area. There's a little beach area with all these rocks because the entire, the entire cove, which is, you know, pretty good sized, you know, it's, it's, it's the size of a, of a, of a, I don't know how, a very large pond, let's say, it's the size of a large pond. It was filled with foam. It was, it was like six feet deep in foam. And I, what I said, what I said is, wow, you know, well, there goes the pond for the rest of my, for the rest of my trip. You know, that's so much foam. It's like my mind created, it's kind of permanent, right? It looks so solid. I knew it was, I knew it was foam, right? I knew I could walk into it and walk through it. I didn't want to because it kind of would smell bad, but, but, you know, so I knew that it was insubstantial. I knew that it was kind of would pop if I walked through it, but my mind created this idea of, wow, look at that. It's there. I, you know, I was there for another two or three weeks. I was like, well, there goes the, the cove for the rest of my trip. I came back the next day or some hours later, it was gone. It was gone. So that insubstantial nature of foam, you know, so the, the, the mind had created a kind of a permanence to it, even though I knew it was impermanent, it created that permanence. And so that's what the Buddha says that we do with the body, with, with our physicality. And so the appearance of foam, you know, the appearance of it is it looks substantial. We know it's insubstantial. We may not know how insubstantial as, as I kind of made that mistake, but we know, we know it's insubstantial and yet we still impute some kind of stability to it. And so too with our, with our physicality, I, another part of this image that was brought out in, in the commentaries is that, you know, that, that lump of foam, you know, it's consists mostly of air, right? It's primarily air. There's a little bit of matter that is held together by some bubble structures, you know, so it's got, it's got that, but there's, there's a lot of different kinds of matter in there. It's maybe got a little bit of soapy stuff, you know, cause it does kind of look soapy or scummy, but it's also got the bodies of beings in there. So it's, it's, it's made of a whole bunch of different kinds of things. So too with our physicality, you know, we, we think of ourselves as having human cells, right? We do. There's a lot of different human cells. So that's a way we can think about our body as having different components. And you know, we think of our body as solid and yet we know actually there's a lot of air in there and there's a lot of water in there. So there's, there's, you know, the, the, the components we can kind of reflect and think of our body as having different components. Something I read just, I think it was just yesterday or the day before. It was, it was, it was an article about the microbiome, you know, how it was, is how our, how our the microbes might affect our mind, you know, so it was this kind of interweaving between what's in our gut and how our mind thinks and feels. It was a, it was a kind of an interesting article that they're doing some research on this microbiome and treating the microbiome to support Alzheimer's to, you know, to, to treat things like Parkinson's and even, you know, depression, things like that. So there's, there's understood to be this connection. Now what, what it said in this article that really stunned me was 42% of our body of what we think of as us, 42% of it are human cells. The other 58% are this microbiome, bacteria and fungus, other, other creatures basically 58% of our body is not us, is not human, is not human. That's another kind of, you know, mistaken thing that we think of ourselves as, you know, it's like that's majority of me isn't even human. And that non-human part is affecting the human part. It's a system, it's a system. So you know, so these kinds of reflections can help us to see our body as not substantial, to see our body as this kind of lump of foam. But then there's also the experiential, the more direct experience, which is kind of more perhaps what the Satipatthana sutta is pointing to, to see the insubstantial nature of experience through seeing its impermanent nature. So the instructions in the Satipatthana are to see the impermanent nature. So to see experience come and go. So what is our actual bodily experience? When we start to feel it, start to experience it. It's, there's very little of it that's stable when we start to look at the actual sensations. In the guided meditation, I pointed to this a little bit, you know, you may be experiencing things, you know, when we experience things through the idea of some aspect of our experience, like we experience perhaps a knee that's uncomfortable or tension in our back or something like that. Often we are experiencing it through the idea of back or knee and that overlaying of that idea, so that's perception actually, that's another of the aggregates, the perception of back, the perception of knee. That when we overlay that perception, we tend to miss, it's like the perception kind of solidifies the experience. And this is, I think, a big way this mistaken perception happens. The way we take things to be solid and stable is because perception makes that mistake. Like my perception of the phone, you know, I just saw it as substantial. And so the perception of our physical experience or the way we experience our physicality is often through a perception. We're not directly often experiencing the actual sensations, the actual physicality, the actual contact. I talked about each of these senses, you know, the tongue, the contact with the tongue. You put an orange in your mouth, for example, and it's very hard not to taste orange, you know, not to have the idea of orange. But what that orange is, is a whole blend of other sensations, some of them being taste sensations, sweet and tart, sour, those a little bitterness, those are independent flavors that the tongue picks up on. And then there's the other aspects of it that are maybe a little bit more physical, like liquidity. So you might have something that's sweet, tart and sour, that's wet like an orange, and you might have something that's sweet, tart and sour. I can't think of what that might be, but that's dry, you know, that doesn't have the liquidity. And that's a piece of the information about that perception takes and creates, you know, takes all those sensations and packages this together and says, well, this is orange and this is, you know, one of those plums from Asia, those really, you know, those dry plums that are very, they've got tartness and saltiness and various things. So you know the different flavors, the recognition, the process has put it together. But we're not really feeling or knowing all of the things that put it together. And so we identify the experience as plum or as orange or as a carrot or as celery or, you know, so we identify the experience that way. And likewise too with sound, you know, there's pitch and tone that hits the ear. And the idea of what it is, like bird or lawnmower, you know, all of those various things, that's perception at work. And so we don't often come to the actual experience of body unless we're actually meditating and curious about what's going on. Mostly we experience our daily lives through this perceptual lens. And that's essentially the kind of the mistake that the mistake around the foam is that we we perceive it as having a solidity. And if we actually walk into that foam, it's pretty clear there's no solidity or substantiality there. So the exploration can be to look more, to recognize that there's the perception and be curious, maybe just ask the question, okay, well, that feels like knee or that feels like hand, but what's the actual experience? And then in my, as in the guided meditation, I encouraged a more receptive quality, like receiving, well, what's there? So just right now put your attention in your hand, you know, just hold your hand out and like you can think of it as a hand, look at it, know what hands do, you know, look at me in that way, but then like let go of that idea and just maybe close your eyes and feel the hand, just receive what's obvious about experience there. Maybe there's a little tension, some stiffness, some coolness, some moisture, heat, maybe some vibration or pulsing. Those sensations, when we touch into those or kind of can receive those, we often experience them as kind of dynamic, you know, that's not, they're not so solid or stable. When we look at our hand as a hand and think about what it's doing, it has more of a feeling of or the sense of substantial. And yet the actual sensation level of experience, which is what the Buddha is pointing to in the Satipatthana, the sensation level of experience. At the sensation level, it's very dynamic and so that begins to undermine the kind of the sense of the solidity of it. Now there is a kind of solidity there. I mean, the bones in there, you know, we know through some reflection that our cells, we know from science that our cells are replacing themselves. So there's not a substantiality to even the cells of our body. But it still feels substantial. And so that's, it has that experience of like, no, it feels so solid. It's right here. And this is partly why in terms of the body, the Buddha encouraged in that first foundation of mindfulness to reflect on how bones themselves will decay, you know, in the death contemplations. You know, that when there is no longer nutriment that is, you know, giving moisture and food to nourish our human system, it's going to dry up. It's going to fall apart. And you can see that in the charnel grounds at the time of the Buddha, there were these charnel grounds and you could see the bones decaying. So there's a variety of ways into exploring this insubstantiality to kind of undermine this belief of the substantial nature on our experience. And so in our experience, note that the, we often will grasp at the concept. We are mostly grasping at concept when we are having, so the sense of substantiality is mostly created through the concept or the idea. And so, you know, the idea of pain, for instance, you know, that we have relationships to the idea of pain, you know, the sense of the body in pain. And we'll talk about that more when we talk about feeling. But the idea of pain, when we come underneath it, it's like the idea of pain feels so solid. If our knee is in pain, the experience of that, it feels so solid. It's like, yes, my knee hurts. But then when we start looking at, well, what is knee? What are the sensations that are there? What is this experience of pain? We find that it is rapidly changing. And what we are mostly reacting to isn't the actual sensations. There can be some reactivity to the actual, especially when the sensations spark or kind of intensify quickly. Sometimes a sensation will rapidly increase and there can be some reactivity there. But most of the time, much of the time where we're reacting to the idea that this is here, this is my knee, this is a problem, this is going to continue, what does this mean? And so we're kind of clinging to the idea of pain and then reacting to that more than we are actually clinging to the actual experience. And so this question of what is actually happening, what actually is the experience of body, that's kind of this exploration of the insubstantiality of body and is an encouragement to look at in the Satipatanasuta pointing to, well, noticing the body, noticing form as arising and passing. So we can start to observe this in this way. So I want to stop there and see comments or questions or thoughts or reflections. Anything you'd like to share? Yeah, Kate, did you? No? Okay. I actually do have something I would ask. So I think that I've often stumbled on the substantiality, particularly of form in the aspect of like, okay, there's a table in front of me. Now, how the heck do I see that as insubstantial? But today I was really focusing on seeing it as insubstantial in that it came together through the conditions of growth of a tree and the sun and all of that. And seeing it as insubstantial simply by thinking through the fact that it will decay and go away, which is like knowing it's arising and passing, but not in the way that I know the arising and passing of breath or anger or something like that. It really has a very mental thought through component of it. Yes. And I think that that is for the external things. And even like for the physicality of the body, if we think about it as the bones and the organs and things like that, more the reflective question. And the Buddha pointed to reflection a lot. In that first foundation, many of those are reflective practices. So the reflecting on the insubstantiality of our human body. And in other places too, the Buddha compared the body as, I don't remember which exercise this is. The elements in looking at the elements. He also encouraged us to reflect on our body, kind of like being like a cow that might get cut up and you would no longer when the cow gets cut up and sold in the marketplaces meet. You're not any longer thinking of that. Oh, this is cow that I'm buying. You're thinking of it more as this is flank or this is hindcourt or whatever. That's how you're thinking of it so that it's kind of more in these pieces. And so the reflection to some extent, that does help us to see the insubstantial nature of things that are external like tables, like lamps. We can know they are impermanent, but I think actually more what we attach to isn't so much the permanence of that table. We might attach to some aspects of it. You have a nice new table and then a guest comes along and puts a water glass down on it. And you get this big spot on it and it's like, that's impermanence, right? We don't normally think about that as impermanence, but that's also impermanence. And the reason that would create suffering is because of attachment to that table being the way we want it to be. And so the identification with those external objects and some kind of stability of those external objects, it doesn't have to be that the table goes poof. It can just get a little water spot on it and we suffer about it. Or the fire burns it down. That's a more dramatic way that we'd see it. But a lot of the suffering that happens, it's not so much that we suffer because the table is coming into being and falling apart slowly, which it is. That table will not be here forever. We know that. But we mostly suffer around our identification of it as mine and what that means. And so that's another exploration in the aggregate teaching to look at how do we take things to be mine and where is the suffering happening about that. But also recollecting the insubstantial nature of something helps us to see at a bigger level it's not mine. And also to recognize that it inevitably will decay so that there might be a little bit less of the tendency to cling to it. Thanks for that question. Any other comments or reflections? This sparked a question for me around like cleaning the house. I've noticed that, for example, when the sink is filled and it's time to do the dishes, often the motivation will be the satisfaction of now the kitchen is clean. But then tomorrow the kitchen is dirty again. And yet somehow it's very appropriate to do the dishes. And so for me where that's landed is maybe kind of a difference between doing the dishes in order to create the state clean kitchen and maybe doing the dishes out of a sense of caring for the space, but not necessarily trying to get the state of clean kitchen because that will come and go very rapidly. It does come and go rapidly. And yet as you point to, I think there are other motivations for cleaning the kitchen. The taking care not only of the space, but also of our health. If you don't clean the kitchen, then there's other beings that kind of come in and live with us and spread disease and illness. And so there's a caring for not only the space, but for ourselves in that. But that caring for, for instance, it's like brushing your teeth. That's another thing that is just continually changing. You brush your teeth and almost instantly there's something that's starting to build up in there again. More bacteria are building up in there. But if you never cleaned your teeth, there would be another form of suffering. So the idea too is not necessarily to have the idea. Sometimes we could take this teaching of like, well, I shouldn't want to clean the kitchen then. But there's other, that's kind of applying the idea of kind of insubstantiality in a, it's kind of bringing in an idea of that as if things are insubstantial, I shouldn't do X. But that's just another mistaken idea. The process that the Buddha points to around moving in the direction of freedom is to recognize the processes that move in the direction of suffering. So the clinging to the clean kitchen and any frustration you experience when you walk in and see it's not clean, not clean, that's moving in the direction of suffering. If you see that you're clinging to the idea of clean kitchen, then it's not necessarily that the movement would be to stop cleaning the kitchen, but rather to look at the clinging. And so to see the movements in the direction of that and what kind of contributes to that and then to see the movements in the direction of letting go, what contributes to well-being, what contributes to the heart having ease. And some of that is compassion, taking care, wishing to support beings, all beings, including ourselves to not experience stress and suffering. And so the process is, but that's a dynamic process. There's not a place to land where forevermore I will not have to do anything to take care of myself. This is an ongoing process. So the exploration is to look at those processes that support leading to freedom and encourage those and to look at those processes that are leading towards clinging. And we experience those two very differently. The feedback loop that we get in our system around that is that when we notice, when we turn towards the experience and feel the clinging around clean kitchen, we experience a contraction. We experience something that makes it clear this is not actually helpful. When we look at the experience of compassion, of wanting to take care, of supporting ourselves and others, there's not that contraction. There's more of a sense of space and connection. Even with suffering, even if there's suffering happening, there can be an ache in there, but that ache doesn't have to have a contracted feeling. It can have a connecting feeling and then moving towards caring for ourselves and other beings from that space of open heartedness. So that's the exploration, not the idea of, okay, I shouldn't want, like for instance, one of the big things that happens in practice is I shouldn't want to practice because I'm wanting to not feel bad anymore. So I'm practicing in order to not feel bad, so therefore I shouldn't practice. You never get anywhere if you approached it that way. So you have to kind of recognize these processes and watch how they unfold and encourage the ones that are more open and explore, actually not try to push away, but to explore. Well, what is it like to want to have a clean kitchen and to feel that contraction and maybe see the letting go of that contraction and feeling a different way to relate to clean kitchen and not clean kitchen that might come from care rather than from craving? That's a great question. Thanks. And it's time to stop. So thank you all.
