 Okay, so the good news around mindfulness practice is that by paying attention to what's going on moment by moment, we increase the amount of choice we have in our life. We also increase the number of possibilities we have also. So the increased possibilities comes also with increased choice, which is very, very nice. And choice is connected to intention. The motivation that's expressed in the choice that we make. And this may be a little thing aside, but I went to have dinner today at a little taqueria. And where I often have dinner sometimes when, and I had a lot of time. So I just wasn't in a hurry to have my dinner and go on someplace else. I had a lot of time and I showed up and there's no one else there. And I stood at the cashier to kind of order the table at the cashier. And so I was in a hurry to order and I was just standing there and kind of, I knew what I wanted. I didn't have to look at the menu. And so the woman behind the cashier taking my order, she seemed to have all the time in the world too. And so I was pretty relaxed and she was pretty relaxed and she seemed happy and I was happy. And so there was this wonderful moment there. We looked at each other and made contact in the eyes and made this nice smile. And then there was kind of this wonderful exchange as I was ordering my food. It was really delightful. And I reflected about how that wouldn't have happened if I'd come in there in a hurry. I would have kind of quickly ordered my food. I wouldn't have paid much attention to her and I would have missed the opportunity. There was this wonderful Zen master there ready to meet me. And I could have missed her if I'd been in a hurry. So this, not being in a hurry, but rather paying attention to what's going on in the moment increases the realm of possible things can happen to us and also increases the amount of choice we have. Another thing that mindfulness does and choice does, the mindfulness gives us a chance also for our conscience to come into play. And conscious is a word that I never really used much in this context of teaching Buddhism, but I think it's a very interesting word because conscience literally means with knowing. And with knowing is what mindfulness is, to do things with knowing. And when we are mindful of situations, we can choose better what we want to do because we see the choices there. But also with mindfulness, with the knowingness of mindfulness, there's also a subtle working of consciousness, of registering and sensing and feeling our way through our choices to see whether they work with our conscience, however we want to decide, whatever we want to call that. And also there's often reviewing that happens of our life and some of the kind of clean conscience or bad conscience that people have come a little bit from reviewing past intentions, the choices we've made in the past. The choices we make affect our consciousness. And consciousness can make you sleep good or bad. A clean consciousness will help you sleep, that they say, and a bad conscience will make you sleep poorly. So I used the word conscience today because I came across a very interesting report from the United States Senate from 1830. This report was written by a Baptist senator from Kentucky. And it had to do, it used to be that the US Postal Service delivered mail on Sunday. You know that? They used to do that. In 1830, they were wondering whether they should stop this and have Sunday be a holiday for the post people. And so the Senate committee reviewed this issue. And the Baptist, this here it says he was a Kentucky senator and active best Baptist leader. And he wrote this, the Constitution regards the conscience of the Jew as sacred as that of the Christian and gives no more authority to adopt a measure affecting the conscience of a solitary individual than that of a whole community. If Congress shall declare the first day of the whole a week, first day of the week holy, it will not satisfy the Jew nor the Sabbatarian. It will dissatisfied both and consequently convert neither. It must be recollected that in the earliest settlement of this country, the spirit of persecution which drove the pilgrims from their native homes was brought with them to their new habitations and that some Christians were scourged and others put to death for no other crime than dissenting from the dogmas of the rulers. If a solemn act of legislation shall be shall in one point define the God or point out to the citizen one religious duty, it may with equal propriety define every part of divine revelation and enforce every religious obligation. Even to the forms and ceremonies of worship, the endowment of the church and the support of the clergy. It is the duty of this government to affirm to all to the Jew and Gentile pagan or Christian the protection and advantages of our benign institutions, for example, the post office, on Sunday as well as every day of the week. Isn't that something? That is a remarkable thing. And you know it's long since forgotten this kind of wonderful concern about the well-being. This is Christian, right? The well-being of non-Christians and that we don't want to impose our kind of calendar and our kind of Christian holy days on these people because the government should not be doing that. And this memory of you know just a few hundred years earlier in United States that people in this country have been put to death. It's kind of remarkable you know it's how sometimes some people when they're persecuted when they get the upper hand they do the persecuting and it happened here on this soil where the people persecuted in England came here and they became got into power and they persecuted in turn. And one of the remarkable stories of this is a man named Roger Williams who I don't know how many of you know about him, but Roger Williams was the founder of the First Baptist Church. There's a kind of a theme here about the Baptists and he came over you know back there in the Pilgrim Days to Massachusetts with the what was it called the Met anyway he came over there with John Winthrop, is that right? Winetrup, Massachusetts Bay Colony. And John Winetrup wanted to have this great vision of building a city on the hill. Maybe it was the Boston I don't know where he had where it was but a city on the hill. But Roger Williams was concerned that the hill belonged to someone else and so he wasn't so happy with the policy of just kind of taking from the Indians, taking from the Native Americans and claiming it for the English and building whatever they wanted to build there. So as a result he was exiled from the colony in the January of 1669. Now being exiled from the colony in Massachusetts in January in the 1600s you know they didn't have they didn't have homeless shelters back then like they have now and you know it was kind of like not a very good situation to be in I suppose. And however it seems that the Indians took him in and the Indians took care of him and he wrote then about he actually wrote this very poor poetry about but but but very noble sentiments about how really courteous the Native Americans were to him and how in contrast to this courteous nature of some of these English that he knew and and how they were had just as much nobility and had just as much of you know of humanity in them as the English Christians did and they should be honored for that. And there's something about in the teachings of the Baptists and the early Baptists that was very important for the early Baptists was that of the sacred sacredness of the individual conscience that each individual conscience conscience which is in part each individual's freedom of choice religious choice was a sacred part to who they were and you didn't want to interfere with that by by imposing your particular religious view on that even though your religion you might be the right one you didn't want to impose it because you had to respect the individual conscience because that was sacred. And so Roger Williams then kind of expressed this with in his early Baptist church and it also became a view that the Quakers hold I think one of the beautiful things about the friends is how they have the idea that within each of us is kind of like a divine a spark of the divinity of the divine and so each individual person's voice when it speaks from that divine place is sacred it has some kind of ultimate authority or special or so worth very worthy and so as some of you know the Quakers have meet here on Sunday and they wait in silence until this divine spark gets motivated to speak and then it speaks not from the individual kind of selfish point of view but speaks from that divine divinity that divine's part. It turns out that this Baptist and Quaker idea of the sacredness of individual conscience individual ability free choice was one of the cornerstones maybe all of you know this already more of the cornerstones of the values that went into the founding of the constitution the founding of this country and it was still active enough idea that in 1830 it was very seriously protesting the idea that the post office should close on Sundays isn't that interesting I think that's what happened that it's now closed on Sundays I don't know when that changed I'm going to find out but now I don't know yeah right so that was very interesting too and and the scholars have argued that the whole idea of human rights which is now very very important concept in the world had its source in this early protestant sex the European and American protestant sex like the Baptist and the Quakers who championed the sacredness of the individual's choice of religion and from that first kind of idea free of the human right to religious choice it spread out into all kinds of other human rights that people have nowadays so that what the question I bring all this up because I was then in wondering and looking at this I wonder what is it what is comparable in Buddhism is there something in Buddhism that is comparable to the idea of the sacredness of the individual conscience the individual's ability to choose for themselves for him or herself now one of the things that about Buddhist Buddhist practice and Buddhist teachings is that it puts the individual very much at the center the Buddha said that I can only point the way you yourself have to negotiate the way you yourself have to put this teachings into practice you yourself have to be mindful as you go through your lives and then be conscientious about the choices you make the motivations you have for the actions that how you respond to situations you find yourself in but that's up to you the Buddha only shows the way one of the things that's very sacred I would use the word sacredness context perhaps is in the Buddhist tradition is each person's potential for liberation for awakening for freedom and it's something awakening is something resides only in an individual and it's one of the great gifts and challenges that Buddhism offers to all of us is the possibility for each of us to cultivate our ability to be mindful to have enough clarity of mindfulness in the present moment that we can see mindful enough the choices we have in the present moment that we can actually not only see we can see the choices clearly enough that we can be free of all the choices that are possible that we're not kind of the slaves to whims or slave to habits or slaves to you know strong impulses and desires it's quite something those of you who sit maybe have the sense of sitting you're very very very interesting when you sit to do this but it can happen anytime to feel a desire arise inside of you and then to feel the impulse to act on that desire the desire and the impulse are two different things but the input the impulse to act on it has a kind of a dick sometimes can have kind of an addictive quality or kind of a kind of insistence that says it has to be now or you know it doesn't say what but or else you know has to happen now or else and it can be very compelling and we can feel that we'll have to act on it because you know it's what my i don't know we can justify it with all kinds of philosophies my inner self or it's my deepest sense of self force my true self or it's whatever all it is is a passing whim and to sit there quietly in meditation and to feel the desire arise and pass like a wave and to see that the wave just passes after a few seconds i think that begins to show us show you the possibility of being awakened and free and liberated in the midst of a desire rather than kind of being submerged in the in in the wave when it arises so does it make some sense to you this idea and it happens with all kinds of things with anger to feel anger just a wave that washes through you you have a choice of whether you get involved with that wave or not you have a choice of whether you get involved the wave of desire or not and to see that choice to see there's a choice both to get involved and not to get involved opens kind of a crack in our normal reactivity and it's possible to be free instead of caught up or reactive so buddhism considers the potential to be free as being so central and so important and so special i think the word sacred is a very nice way of talking about it the buddhist might not use the word sacred but in the west we might might do it the buddhist might talk about it as rather than being sacred they might talk about it as a it has a nobility to it there's a nobleness to this potential and possibility within us yes seems seems like just because you realize that there's a choice doesn't necessarily mean that you you can choose seems like for instance smokers generally know that smoking is bad right so how does that fit well seeing seeing have choices is the beginning it's a very important beginning and then through various kinds of strategies you might be able to kind of find ways to break an addiction if the addiction is what's going on and there's many the whole range of strategies that are available that can be very useful you know i'm not going to go through a list of them now but as the mindfulness gets stronger and stronger and stronger the mindfulness provides a kind of a refuge or kind of a source of strength that can be stronger than the addiction itself and so the strength of the mindfulness then helps us choose other other choices and i've known i've known people who've been alcoholics for example and who found it extremely liberating to realize that they can just have the desire for alcohol just arise and pass you know they don't have to get on that wave whereas they thought in the past they thought they it was course of course you had to get on it or or you feel a tremendous amount of sadness or despair or kind of inside of you which is often a source for addiction and people can learn through mindfulness that they can just allow it to be there peacefully that sense of pain inner pain they don't have to let that inner pain trigger itself or fuel an addictive behavior so learning to be comfortable with discomfort is a very important thing if a person wants to become free if you're not comfortable with discomfort you can't be free so this is some small thing to say gene okay maybe say it differently then to be willing to be present for discomfort that's okay with me that there can be kind of a meta comfort kind of i've had tremendous physical pain tremendous physical pain and had a tremendous ease in of mind at the same time so that in that sense be comfortable with discomfort you know discomfort has many forms it can make a lot of a lot of restlessness can be a form of discomfort so sit with a lot of restlessness but but there's a kind of okayness to it i know that when i don't know i'm not okay with my restlessness then i might act out in funny ways but with the mindfulness is possible to be present for it and kind of open the body in a sense so the body completely open it becomes a container where there's restless feeling inside of it just courses freely within me and so there's a kind of comfort or kind of ease or kind of non-resistance to the discomfort does that make some sense gene anything else um the possibility of freedom and the potential of freedom for non-restriction not to restrict ourselves by our addictions or fears or our aversions and all these things but the the contribution of mindfulness practice or the contribution of buddhism to focusing on this wonderful potential we have is that buddhism at the same time will say will point to those that those forces within us that keep us from being free they keep us from being awakened if you those of you who know the four noble truths it talks for noble truths so the four sacred truths this wonderful potential we have points to the possibility of freedom of awakening of cessation of all suffering and the four noble truths points to the truth of what causes the opposite of freedom what causes suffering and so these two things go together because if you only focus on freedom if you only focus on unfettered freedom whatever wherever you want to act it's all too easy for that freedom to be to be confused with our egotistical desires our selfish desires our fears and inhibitions and so people start acting out in funny ways you know i should be free to do whatever i want it means i'm free to make it you know to um you know people have do all kinds of things which end up suffering causing suffering to people around them i went to a car dealership this week i remember last time i went to car dealership some years ago the guy said to me i was driving he was test driving the car and he said you know things are always changing oh the only thing that's constant is change you know and that woke me up you know but that was a justification for that i deserved an air conditioner what does that have to do with it i just you know so when when a tradition focuses on freedom but doesn't have any kind of careful analysis of the forces that keep us from being really free the forces that keep us bound then it's very likely that forces are being bound will act out in funny ways in the name of freedom and so buddhism puts a lot of emphasis on on clarifying and emphasizing elucidating what what is the um forces that keep us bound so talks talks about clinging and desire and addiction it talks about hate and aversion it talks about restlessness and sleepiness it talks about doubt it talks about these things not so we keep them kind of abstractly know about them so that we study them and get to know them intimately in ourselves and because the buddhist teaching is by intimately knowing these things for ourselves those forces within ourselves of desire and hate and whatever and we when they're connoisseurs of them we say over we know they're connoisseurs of them we save them and know them so well we can be the connoisseurs of them then we're less likely to be caught by them and confused by them and to act out them in unhealthy ways if we really want to be free we need to understand these forces um yes i had a thought most of the time when we're young we learn when you put your hand on the stove it's hot take it off and i think that as children we learn to rely on our emotions as keys or as feedback how other people act towards us yes and so this is the analogy is almost like we hop from one thing to another in our reactivity to life and what buddhist talking about is recognizing when that's happening but what happens when you can see it all happening then what are your choices what is your motivating right action right yes yes because it's like you're sort of taking all the pegs that hold you up out oh oh how do you act in the world do you know what i'm saying so i guess what cheryl is saying is that um if if you if your mindfulness is strong enough and you no longer you see the range of choices you have and you see that one of the choices is not to act at all then um that's that's actually a very powerful choice that's actually more useful than we realize not choice not to act but um but if we see that it's all choice and a normal kind of habitual reactivity is no longer acting then what do we base our choices on okay okay so so so the second thing i want to talk about the first thing i said so what is it in the buddhist tradition that can be pointed to is being comparable to the idea of the sacredness of individual conscience and the first i said is that the potential each of us have for being free the second thing that can be pointed to as being kind of comparable thing is our intentionality the intentions there are motivations intentions behind our acts and most of you know that buddhism has this kind of a complicated issue around self you know and we say there's kind of no self kind of but if anything qualifies nothing qualifies itself as a self for buddhist really but the closest thing that would qualify to a self in buddhism would be our intention because everything else is kind of out of our control but our intentionality is something where is where the choice is your choice involves some kind of control somaticum of control at least um our bodies change radically or the world around us changes without our control or we get sick or bank statement goes up and down without our control seemingly but uh stock markets but our intentionality is something we our intention is something we can bring to each moment and there's two things going on for us at any given moment there's what is happening to us and is how we respond to it and part of what we respond and how we respond to it has to do with the intentions we have and it's interesting to me that in the buddhist tradition buddhist psychology um there are seven factors of mind that are present all the time as long as the mind is working and you're aware and kind of there's seven factors of mind that are always present like there's some amount of paying attention there's some concentration there's some directedness of mind there's some energy different things one of those seven is intentionality intention is always there and the more you practice the more your mind wants to get stronger and stronger you it's phenomenal it's astounding how much choice you have when i came back from living at the monastery for three years i realized that i had a choice about how i sat in the chair and that was consequential before i went to the monastery i didn't think i had any choice and everything occurred to me that was an issue of choice you sit in your chair you sit in the chair you know you slouch you do whatever you do but coming back from the monastery where there was where there was so much mindfulness of the body and mindfulness of activity i realized that sitting in a chair was there was a wide range of choices of how i decided to sit in a chair you know cross my legs slouch sit up straight all these different ways and the choices were there whether i knew it or not and often what happens is a lot of our choices are somewhat unconscious or subconscious most of us i mean pay attention tomorrow pay you know most of you are going to sit in your chair tomorrow pay attention how many times tomorrow you find yourself sitting in a chair in a certain posture and you are not aware of the choice they made it or you went into the particular posture you took i suspect a lot of you don't give it much much much much much thought but there is choice there and choice is somewhat subconscious so there's what's happening and it's our response to what's happening the intention and conscience in the way the early founding kind of people of this country talked about it it seemed had a lot to do with freedom of choice but conscience also has to do i believe with our sense of i don't know quite how to describe it but without designing moralistic but it has to do with our sense of a little bit our right and wrong and reviewing our activities to realize you know have is my conscience clear have i have i done anything it makes leaves any feelings of misgiving or regret conscience has to do in buddhist terms our conscience has to do entirely with intention probably one of the close synonyms to conscience in buddhism is karma or an important element of buddhist idea of karma is conscience that the intentions and choices we make today affect our conscience either immediately it's called instant karma we lie and then we feel bad about it right away or maybe it's 10 years later when i was at car dealership it was phenomenal the number of lies that i was told i've never been around someone who i decided that i couldn't trust anything they were saying and i had no sense of that they're aware of any instant karma but i could see you know one of these people his eyes were kind of demented i kind of as soon as i as soon as he walked in you know i was you know i was really fortunate because a general manager was going to come and talk to me about the deal and then he came in and just eyes you know this is a demented man and i proceeded with you know you know you know i couldn't trust and you know i just felt i couldn't trust him for anything unfortunately i realized later that i could trust him for less than i actually did and i didn't trust him to begin with and um so so i say this not to you know i felt mostly sorry for him i thought there was a tremendous amount of pain and suffering there but it might be 20 years later that conscience kicks in and you kind of oh what have i done or somehow there's suddenly the mind kind of veils or the mind lift up and the person realizes what have i done you know i spent this life doing this thing and then hopefully rather than feeling guilty or feeling self-hate or something there's opportunity to wake up and then to focus on the intention and choices we make from their own it doesn't make much sense from buddhist analysis of things to harp regretfully or jealously or angrily on what what you've done in the past we learn from what we've done in the past and then focus on our intentions for the future our intentions are really sacred our aspirations intentions shape a lot of who we are and who we become and and so rather than kind of lingering in the past out of regret or whatever to use the past as a support to try to look into the future how we could do better and our intentions are a tremendous refuge a tremendous source of beauty that all of us have our aspirations it's hard to follow through on our aspirations and our best intentions but to have them is really really significant i'll tell you about a dream i had last night my wife told me to keep it short i was in this kind of like buddhist monastery and there was this uh right-hand disciple of this woman meditation master who was kind of a fundamentalist meditation teacher and this right-hand student of hers uh was kind of arrogant and i was in this place i had this task to do which i had to do with computers and i went to the computer and the keyboard was gone so i couldn't get to the computer so this arrogant kind of right-hand man in this meditation master came up to me and he kind of scrawled and kind of was really angry and he kind of said to me oh you know if you go back there to the garden in this monastery and go out in the row between the beets and the carrots and straight out to where the cliff is and look down over the cliff you might see down there your keyboard it was obvious was you know he had you know he had thrown it down there and so my response in the dream was something like this oh it seemed that there's a lot of tension here between us a lot of animosity i don't really you know i don't really want this kind of animosity between us is there something that i've done in the past or something we can talk about that we kind of somehow try to make things a little bit easier and that was the end of the dream then i woke up and i reflected wow what a dramatic difference and it was really great i was kind of proud of myself you know that in my dream at least you know i hadn't been reactive i hadn't gotten angry or upset or hurt i just kind of matter of factly kind of expressed this intention to try to kind of heal whatever the rift was i had no idea why i was there but i kind of expressed it kind of matter of factly and there was no i wasn't attacking him or being defensive and he kind of softened a little bit so i had came with this intention that i was really great but the other part of the dream was very interesting was this right hand man of this famous meditation teacher he had attained some great meditative state according to that system and he was still his intention was still that of arrogance and animosity and it's possible to have great spiritual attainment of certain types and still the intentions by which a person bases their life on can still be intentions of greed and hate and anger and things like that and it's possible for someone else to have no great spiritual attainment but their intention to live a good life to be generous to be compassionate to be tried to have heartful connection to people can be there in abundance which is more important spiritual attainment or a lifetime of good intent and yes that's a good that's a very good point and a good good reservation about the issue um well it does happen that people attain certain experiences that are very profound in meditation at times and and they're honored by the tradition and all this and sometimes it makes people worse because then there's someone special you know and then they're special they can get arrogant and then all these things so it's a little bit complicated subject and um but it's famous not only in Buddhist circles but in other circles too and you know maybe it's kind of maybe it's not the right spiritual attainments things you know or there's all kinds of things people can attain through a spiritual practice you know it's kind of a very broad term so there's all kinds of things that one can accomplish through a meditation practice and some of them are actually considered to be dangerous because the tremendous traps for the ego the mind is kind of great pristine experiences of clarity of concentration of great bliss great light um great all kinds of things and the person thinking i'm hot stuff you know and everybody else who doesn't have it is not hot yes special sounds like spiritual materialism is a great term so um so intention doesn't answer this so i just i just point to the importance of it and how buddhism puts a lot of stress on it and i haven't asked answered cheryl's question yet about you know which intent how do we decide on our what intentions we do and what intentions you follow through on and we're running out of time we run out of time but i wanted to stress that again that mindfulness it's kind of like it doesn't necessarily mean we have to stop or to pause but mindfulness practice is very closely akin to pausing for a moment rather than acting reactively automatically and in that pause to see that we have more choice than we realized and to see that our choice have consequences and that our choices are flavored by certain intention so it isn't simply to choose to do a certain thing but it had we choose with often with an intention for something else for example um um um you know i might choose to end today promptly at nine o'clock because we're supposed to i might choose to end but my intention to end might be more than that more than we're supposed to it might be that um i don't want people to think that i'm long-winded because then they'll think badly of me and it's important that everybody here keep has a very nice impression of me and you know and all that well then that if that's the intention for ending at nine o'clock that intention then you know is a little bit you know colored then or skewed in a certain kind of funny way right some of you think so so there's many many spins we put in our choices and that spin we put in our choice on our choices is called the intention the motivation and that has great consequences so if we two people can have make the same choice but they put different spins on it one can be a spin agreed another can be a spin of generosity one person can be a spin of of showing off and the other one can be generosity or compassion and these things have effect in our these things help form who we are and they help bring about a it bring about a clear and clean conscience and i think one of the marvelous things that a person can have in life is a clean and clear conscience and i kind of today i've been liking this term a lot because it doesn't to me it doesn't sound moralistic i hope and i don't mean it more any kind of moralistic sense at all but to have a clean conscience is not to go to bed at night feeling regret or feeling somehow a little bit bad about the intentions and choices of the day and and with two quotes george washington carver said how far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young compassionate with the aged sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and the and of the strong because someday in life you will have been all of these then martin lugar king says this is very interesting thing carrying on maybe a theme of of conscience that's been part of this country for a long time in the most difficult moments we can match your capacity to inflict suffering with our capacity to endure suffering we will meet your physical force with soul force we will not hate you but we cannot in good conscience obey your unjust laws however we will soon wear you down with our capacity to suffer and in winning our freedom we will so appeal to your conscience that we will win your freedom in the process the person i met some years ago who was there in mississippi in 62 63 or whatever she showed up in the same place to demonstrate for integration that you stood there and each day these white people came and beat her up you know isn't that kind of dumb show up you know they show up we're going to beat you up i'm staying here they beat her up she comes back the next day we're going to beat you up i'm not leaving you think okay we beat you up the third day she stood there she looked up at one of the people who was going to hit her and she caught his eye and he stopped and it changed him and he stopped and he started talking what's you know he could he couldn't do it anymore something about the person willing to take that abuse reached deep into his heart and stopped him in a way that any kind of political arguing back and forth probably never would have so i'm not advocating we all stand in the way of but it's powerful i think what's what martin luther king said we will win our freedom and in winning our freedom we will so appeal to your conscience that we will win your freedom in the process so to sit in mindfulness to sit quietly peacefully to start paying attention to our inner life and our reactivities our choices to become familiar with our desires and our hatreds our aversions when they arise and are sitting and know the difference between jumping on the train of desire and aversion and letting it go like a wave just passes through and just oh there it is passing through and to be able to cultivate some spaciousness some awareness some calmness around our choices is tremendously powerful and it's tremendously powerful to do that by sitting every day and in sitting every day create a very strong foundation to bring it into our daily life and so then eventually maybe we also can have the inner strength what martin luther king called soul force so we can have that also so when we're really called upon to use our deepest resources in situations that we have them there because we know ourselves well enough so thank you all and now you all and maybe soon i'll answer cheryl's question
