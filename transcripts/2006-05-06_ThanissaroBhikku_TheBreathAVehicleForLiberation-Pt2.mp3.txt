You let go totally only when you don't really need to hold on anymore.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, just hand over here.
Can you get the mic?
Let's keep this one in the lap.
In this section you talked about the five feathers ignorance being one.
What does ignorance mean here?
It means seeing things in terms other than the Four Noble Truths.
In other words, you place an eye or a not eye on an experience,
and the Buddha says that's ignorance.
Ignorance is looking at where is there stress?
Is stress arising? Is stress passing away?
And what's causing that?
Looking at your experience with those questions in mind, that's knowledge.
Ignorance is looking at your experience not in those terms.
Okay.
Let's do a little sixteen steps.
Page two, mindfulness of in and out breathing.
So, how is mindfulness of in and out breathing developing pursuits
to be a great fruit and great benefit?
Okay.
There's a case where monk in the commentary always makes the point
that monk here means any serious practitioner, lay or ordained.
Having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building,
sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect,
setting mindfulness to the Four.
Now that phrase to the Four is one of the controversial ones in this Sutta.
The Pali word is bharde mukhang.
P-A-R-I-M-U-K-H-A-M.
For the dot.
Now literally, if you took the word apart bharde mukhang,
bharde means around and mukhang means either face or mouth.
And some people have interpreted it that you have to focus around your mouth.
Or around your face.
However, there is a passage in the canon where the word bharde mukhang
is specifically used with, it has a very clear meaning.
It means the front of the chest.
However, it seems forced to say that you have to put it either around your mouth
or around your chest.
An idiomatic meaning might also be just bring it to the Four,
bring it to emphasize it.
This is something that's brought up to the Four,
which is why I chose to translate it that way.
Just this quality of setting mindfulness to the Four means,
okay, I'm going to have an intention in mind
and be very deliberate about what I'm keeping in mind.
Because mindfulness is something we have all the time.
You're always keeping something in mind.
It might be the tune to some stupid commercial back in the 1950s,
but you've got something you're keeping in mind.
And for most of it, it's pretty unplanned.
It's the top of the mind and they stick with us.
And then we drop them after a while.
And the Buddha is basically here saying that you want to establish mindfulness.
Be very clear about what you're going to keep in mind.
Be very intent.
Next, okay, always mindful.
Try to keep mindful all the way through the breath.
Always mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.
Okay, what is he going to be mindful of?
Okay, one, breathing in long.
Or breathing out long. You discerns.
I'm breathing out long.
Or breathing in short.
You discern that you're breathing in short.
Or breathing out short.
You discern that you're breathing out short.
Okay, those are the first things you just want to keep in mind.
How's the breathing going?
And you try to analyze it in terms of whether it's long or short.
Now, some breath meditation teachers will say,
well, while you're doing long and short, you might as well do comfortable and uncomfortable.
You can see what feels good.
In other words, you want to be more sensitive to what's going on with the breath.
And here's another case where the word I is okay.
Introductory meditation.
But you notice in all 16 of the steps, the word I is still there.
The Buddha hasn't dropped that yet quite yet.
Okay, beginning with step number three, though.
There's a new phrase. You train yourself.
In other words, you become intent. You're going to do something intentionally.
This is where you begin to see that the development of mindfulness is not just bare awareness
and it's not just acceptance of whatever happens.
You're training yourself. You've got an agenda.
You've got something in mind.
And this is what you're going to keep in mind.
Each time you breathe in, you keep in mind the idea that I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.
Breathing out, you keep in mind I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.
Each breath in, each breath out.
Again, this is another phrase that is controversial.
What does it mean to be sensitive to the entire body?
The commentary, which was written at a time when breath meditation had pretty much fallen out of favor,
is another type of meditation that was preferred and that was called ghasinna meditation.
I've ever heard of this. It's spelled K-I-S-I-N-A, ghasinna.
And it's basically a meditation practice of staring.
You stare either at a disc of different colors or you stare at a candle flame
or you can make a hole in the wall and you stare at the hole in the wall.
The basic pattern of that particular meditation is that you try to lock out all of your awareness of everything
except that little tiny disc of color, that little tiny spot of light.
You stare at it until you get to the point where you can see it even with your eyes closed.
It's gotten that imprinted on your nervous system.
And then you keep staring at it until it turns into what's called the counter sign, which becomes very bright.
And then you try to expand that counter sign to fill all your awareness.
That became the paradigm for meditation practice in the time of the commentary.
So when they were describing breath meditation, the Buddha says be aware of your entire body.
That goes against the pattern.
When you're trying to get focused on this one little spot, the Buddha says, entire body.
And so you get a passage in the commentary where it says,
this cannot possibly mean your entire physical body
because if you try to breathe through the entire physical body,
you have the sensation that your body is made entirely out of beams or out of fat.
You can't get the breath through it.
And so they say instead, what this entire body means,
that you breathe in sensitive to the entire length of the breath,
all the way through the end breath, all the way through the out.
Now to me, that seems redundant with steps one and two,
because if you're not with the whole breath in and out,
how are you going to know that it's long or short?
And secondly, the whole problem with this sense of the entire body,
the only meaning for the word body throughout the text,
and it's used several times, is your physical body.
What's more important is when you start comparing these breath meditation instructions
with other meditation instructions in the canon,
the images for the state of mind that you're trying to develop are full body awareness.
I don't know if you've ever heard of the four similes the Buddha has for jhana practice,
but the first one is they talk about a bathman kneading water into a ball of bath powder.
You might think of kneading water into flour when you're making bread.
You want the water to fill the entire ball of dough.
You don't want to have dry dough, part of it, and wet dough for the other part.
You want everything to be equally moisturized.
And the Buddha talks about when you get a sense of ease and a sense of rapture in the body,
you try to work that ease and rapture throughout the entire body.
For the second jhana, the images of a lake with a spring welling up inside the lake,
so that all the lake is constantly cooled by the cool water from the spring.
There's no part of the lake that hasn't been cooled.
You want the images of taking the ease or rapture from the meditation
and spreading it throughout the entire body.
In the third jhana, the images of lotuses that grow in a lake
and they're entirely immersed in the lake from the tips of the roots to even up to the top of the flower.
They don't come up above the lake and they're entirely suffused by the cool water of the lake.
And then the final image of the fourth jhana is of a person sitting with your body entirely covered by white cloth.
There's no part of your body that's not covered by the white cloth.
In the same way that in the fourth jhana you have this pure, bright awareness.
You let that awareness spread to fill the entire body.
So obviously the Buddha is heading you in the direction of full body awareness,
which is why I think the literal translation here is the best,
that you're trying to be sensitive to the whole body,
all the way through the in breath, whole body, all the way through the out.
Fourth step, you train yourself to breathe in and out, calming, calming, excuse me,
calming bodily fabrication and breathe out, calming bodily fabrication.
Now the term bodily fabrication here is translated elsewhere in the canon as meaning the breath.
In other words, you let the breath calm down.
And if you've ever been breathing, you will notice,
that sometimes the breath is an involuntary process and sometimes it's voluntary.
And the voluntary part of the process is the one that you tend to screw up the most.
I.e. we all have this particular perception or conception of what happens when the breath comes in,
what happens when the breath goes out, which muscles in the body have to contract,
which muscles have to expand in order to get that breath in, in order to get the breath out.
We also have sensations, in breath has to feel like this,
you can almost kind of feel it pulling up in your face.
All of this is actually added stuff.
The breath can come in and out with all this added preconceived notions about what's happening.
And a lot of the calming of bodily fabrication is involved in calming that stuff,
the excess stuff that we put onto the breathing process,
the unnecessary tension, the unnecessary pulling and pushing.
You may notice that when an out breath goes out, you push it out a little bit more
just to make it clear to yourself now, the out breath is out totally.
When you pull it in, you say, let's pull in just a little bit more just in case.
All of that is bodily fabrication.
It makes the breath less comfortable than it has to be.
So what you're consciously doing in this fourth step is to notice whenever you,
now that you've got this full body awareness established,
can wear in the body as any unnecessary tension associated with the breathing process.
In some cases you can see it clearly, other cases require that you
change your perception of what the breath is.
For me, starting with the Ajahn-Lean method in Thailand, the first big block was this,
I mean, the idea sounded attractive.
Breathe in the whole body, all the way down to the tips of your toes.
Sounds cool.
Okay, what does it mean?
What are your breath sensations?
What are not your breath sensations?
Where does the breath come in?
And I immediately thought, well, the breath comes in here,
and I've got one whole breath, I've got to get it down to my toes.
So I meditated like that for a while, and it got pretty oppressive.
Then you start realizing, okay, the breath energy comes in and out of the body from all directions.
You've got the breath coming in and out of all your pores.
If you don't believe that, go watch Goldfinger.
You know the Golden Lady?
Why did she die?
She couldn't breathe.
She couldn't breathe.
Okay, there's already breath coming in and out of your pores.
So when part of your...
These perceptions you have about the breath are like one mind talking to the other part.
Say, okay, now do that breathing stuff because we need more breath.
And how do you know what breathing stuff is?
Well, you already have this little code, or this is what you have to do when you breathe.
How about changing the code?
Think of the body as a sponge.
As soon as you breathe in, there's no obstruction anywhere to the breath energy coming in and going out.
You will also find sometimes that...
Okay, if you think of the breath energy being centered in one part of the body,
as soon as you start breathing in, the breath energy has gone throughout the whole body already.
Otherwise, you couldn't pull the more...
The grosser breath in.
This subtle breath already goes in all the way down to the tips of your toes.
Try breathing with that perception of breath.
And you find that the whole process of breathing gets more and more calm, more and more refined.
Less and less oppressive.
Let's stop right there if you have to.
Any questions on the first four?
Oh, lots of questions.
Okay, let's have a right-hand mic and a left-hand mic.
I find when the breath gets calm, the hardest thing for me to do is say,
What's in? What's out?
I just lose it immediately.
And I've decided to stop losing it.
I mean, to just forget about what's in and what's out.
But I find it's almost a bother to think of what's in and what's out.
Okay, at that point, when it gets so still, what you've got to do is be aware of the whole body.
Take that as your frame of reference.
And think of the breath, again, not only as the in and out, but kind of the energy stasis at that point in the body.
And just be with that.
Because there's a problem that if you're thinking of simply being with the in and out of the breath,
then as you say, it gets more and more refined.
You lose it.
And you don't have a good focus or a good foundation for your awareness.
So what you want to do is be aware of the whole body.
And then when that gets still, you don't have to think in, you don't have to think out.
Just say it's still breath and then stay with it stillness.
And then it's just like a flow.
Right.
Okay, next question right behind you.
When I think of the body and the breath going throughout the body, I have to use my imagination.
Is that what you're supposed to do?
That's part of the training.
So you sort of visual and use a visualization.
So use the visualization as an aid to be more sensitive to what's going on in the body.
Okay, because the breath is not literally in the whole body.
What depends on how you define breath?
Okay, so how do you define it?
Energy.
Oh, so it's an energy.
Right.
So how much of the attention is still on the in and out process and how much is it in the field of energy of the body?
That's really up to you.
You start out with the in and out breath because that's the easiest to focus on.
But when you find that you can be aware of the whole body, that level of energy throughout the whole body, that becomes your frame of reference.
And then you drop the breath or drop the in and out.
You can drop the in and out.
Because what you're trying to do, as he says, you're trying to calm the bodily fabrication, which is this process of creating these bodily sensations to get the air in and out.
You find that you don't need to keep creating them, that the air, you've got plenty of oxygen in your body and you don't have to do the pumping.
So you allow that to calm down.
You're trying to develop this full body awareness, full body sensitivity.
And it's a lot easier to do that with just this idea, okay, this is energy.
And we tend to think of our primary sensation of the body as being sort of solid.
And then there's this stuff called breath that we pull in and push out.
And when you close your eyes, what is your immediate experience of the body?
There's kind of an energy field.
That's what he's talking about.
That's your primary experience of the body.
He's trying to get you back to that level of experience.
And things that you tolerate, there may have been blockages in the energy.
You say, well, that must be a bone, so it has to be solid.
But when you think, even before my experience of bone, there was experience of energy.
If the energy is blocked, we've got to do something about it.
Thank you.
Give it down here.
Ah.
What is the experience of the Pali word for train?
Sikati.
S-I-K-K-H-A-T-I.
Okay, thank you. And also, what if the Suto, the Self, is its own mainstay, its own refuge?
That's in the Dhammapada. I've forgotten which person.
D'Youll, can you remember?
Two Dhammapada translators, and we can't help it.
Thank you.
And the one that's reviewing this Suto of the past couple of days,
which is the patient's coming here, the thing that this is the section
that I've really somehow focused on,
it really, I've already been dealing with the whole thing about fabrication.
I mean, I certainly accept, conceptually, intellectually,
the idea that everything is mental.
In other words, we fabricate everything, our bodies and everything else, all of our experience.
I don't challenge that intellectually.
But when we're going over all of this,
I mean, you can notice it. I can notice it when I'm following the breath out.
Everything, almost every thought that comes up and I have to bring myself back to the breath
has something to do with fabrication.
I just want to be sure that I'm clear about what the Buddha means
with reference to fabrication and say as opposed to becoming.
I mean, I don't see that the natural inclination of my mind
is to accept anything as it is.
If something has gotten nicer, I want it nicer still.
I want it to be a step towards somewhere else, which seems to me is also fabrication.
So is there some distinction there?
The word fabrication, sankara in Pali,
is a huge blanket term.
It covers all kinds of stuff, beginning from simply the process of putting things together,
all the way through any intentional putting together in the mind.
And you were right to say, yeah, our present
experience is all fabricated.
It's either the result of past intentions, or it is the actual
current intention to shape this raw material, and then there are the immediate results of that
current intention.
So all this comes under fabrication. Now there are different types of fabrication,
becoming is a type of fabrication when you create this world.
And then birth is a type of fabrication when you create an identity inside that world.
Birth, the birth of
you know, if you look at dependent chororizing, you've created
this world, but then you decide, okay, I'm going to be in that world. You create a little
identity that goes in and becomes a player in that world. That's also a kind of fabrication.
Birthing is the selfing of fabrication.
That's one of it. Actually you start having ideas about the self beforehand.
And then you move it into a particular
field of, you know, a particular world.
That's the birth.
So what is, is there really a part from fabrication?
Nirvana.
Yeah, that's the only thing apart from fabrication there is.
Any other questions?
There's the nearest floating mic.
Okay.
My question is about
knowing when you're doing this and
noting, noting should
you know, when it's in and out, then when it becomes just
energy, and it's
should you be, and there's a knowing, but should you be
noting each little coming and going of each other,
little energy.
I'm confused about that process.
Okay, when the in and out is obvious enough for you to focus on it as the topic, or stay
with the in and outside. Okay, when it gets more and more calm,
you've got to get to this full body awareness.
Notice here the Buddha recommends you go full body awareness first, then you calm.
Calm things down. So he wants you to get to full body awareness as quickly as possible.
Once you're there, okay.
Remind yourself, okay, whole body breathing in, full body breathing out.
So you're actually noting that as your...
Well, however the breath flows, you want to get the whole body
out as your main focus of awareness, your
frame of breath. Because as the breath gets more and more still, you get so that you can't
follow the in and out. But you still want to do the full body
and just maintain that. That can be the note in your mind, whole body.
And if it's still, okay, whole body still, whole body still.
Try to keep the noting as very light and
unobtrusive as possible.
Right, he's giving a foundation here so that when things change, you've got a place to go.
And you're not just kind of left hanging.
Can you speak into the mic?
The intention to train is okay.
The intention is essential.
Because what the Buddha points out, the main factor shaping our experience
is this fabricating through intention.
And what he's trying to bring this out through the practice. Keep an intention in mind.
I'm going to be aware of the whole body as I breathe in and I'll be aware of the whole body as I breathe out.
That's the intention you're keeping in mind. This is what mindfulness does.
It keeps the intention in mind. And then the alertness
to the body, that's something that grows out of the intention.
Because as you go through the meditation, more and more and more, you're going to find
how really huge a role intention plays in shaping
your experience. Even just your basic experience of the body.
When the thing is as intimate as the breath, intention comes first.
So he's trying to get you in touch with that.
One of the mysteries of the present moment is why do we have this freedom of intention
in the present moment? You've got things coming in from the past
or results of our old karmic baggage.
But we have the ability to shape it and we have the freedom to choose.
Not everything is determined. So freedom in our
experience lies around this issue of intention. So the Buddha is trying to get
us to focus here. And this is one way of doing it, setting up this training in mind.
This is how I'm going to be aware as I breathe in. This will be
how I'll be aware as I breathe out. And just keep that in mind.
Where's the other floating mic?
Is intention identical with volition in the dependent
origination? No, when they talk about volitional
formations in the dependent origination, that's something else.
What is that?
I wouldn't translate it as volitional formations. Just the plain fabrication
is sankara. If you look under namarupa or name and form,
intention is right there.
Is that it?
Question over here?
My first experience with feeling the breath
like that in the whole body and working with it was in training in chigong.
Do you have any thoughts about the utility
of using something like a chigong practice or
yoga, pranayama practice with this work?
It's helpful in getting you sensitive to the body.
I myself haven't done that much. I've got
one chigong exercise that I do.
And a little bit of yoga. And I found that it helps.
I've actually found that breath works get you better at chigong and yoga.
I think both sides help each other.
The problem is in some pranayama exercises, they actually have you control the breath too much.
Because what we're trying to get in touch with there
is what really feels best for the body right now. How are you directly experiencing the breath
and learn how to adjust the breath in line with what you're experiencing.
The purpose of that is to refine your discernment.
Any other questions?
Okay, next.
You train yourself to breathe in sensitive to rapture and you train
yourself to breathe out sensitive to rapture. Sounds good.
Okay, how do we do that?
You'll notice as you're working with this process
of trying to calm the bodily fabrication.
If you think of your body, your awareness of the body, close your eyes for a minute.
And notice, okay, what do you experience of the body right now? Do you experience
salinity? Do you experience the skin? Or do you just have this kind of
fog of sensations?
These sensations are kind of impinging and coming and going away, coming and going away.
And when you breathe in and breathe out, do you ever squeeze any of these sensations?
Do you put pressure on them? Do you try to force them into a different shape?
Do you notice yourself doing that?
Can you breathe in and out without doing that?
Notice which parts of the body you tend to squeeze most.
Or just find one part that you tend to squeeze a lot when you breathe in.
Find yourself, now I'm going to breathe in without squeezing it.
And just stick with that. Keep that
intention in mind. Allow the sensation
just to be. And if you stick with it long enough
you'll find that there's a sense of fullness that develops in that
sensation. It's not squeezed anymore. It's just allowed to be itself.
That kind of sensation is something the Buddha calls a foothold
or a rapture. And the more of those you can get
going and the more continually you can get them going and the more you can connect them
you've got rapture. Now the poly word for
rapture here is bidi. It's related to the word
for drink. It's something you drink in.
It can also be translated as refreshment.
It feels refreshing not to keep squeezing that stuff.
And you will find
again it's one of these things that requires a good amount of concentration in order to
maintain it. It's so easy to slip off and start squeezing it again.
But if you can keep that sense of that squeezed sensation
not happening, that little sensation is just allowed to be there without being squeezed.
And then you find as you get sensitive to that you begin to
realize there are other spots in the body you've been squeezing as well. And you just try to go
through the body and no longer squeezing things.
Some people when they do this get a sensation
that they're about to drown. Because all the muscles they normally
use for breathing are not being put into use.
Trust me, you will not drown. You will actually get
all the breath you need without squeezing these parts of the body.
It's not going to happen and there will be a sense of rapture.
Step number six is to train yourself breathing in and out
sensitive to pleasure.
The word pleasure here, sukha, can also be translated as
squeeze.
Which is a more refined feeling than rapture. It's not so full.
Some people I found actually dislike a feeling of rapture
when it comes up in the meditation because they feel like they're losing control.
And once you've had enough of the rapture
you say, okay, enough. And this doesn't mean that you're going to go back to squeezing.
It means that you're just going to allow things to relax very much.
Whatever part is fighting the rapture you allow
that to relax as well.
And so what this does, dealing with
the calming of the bodily fabrication and being
sensitive to pleasure, sensitive to rapture. I use the word sensitive
here because these things exist as potentials
in sort of the field of your bodily experience. And if you're not
sensitive to them you run raw shot over them. But if you are sensitive to this potential you can give
the space and allow that potential to develop.
Okay, once you've gone through that sense of rapture
and it's supposed to be refreshing.
Because for the most part our sense of the body tends to be starved
of energy. Because we've been pushing around, pulling it around.
Especially when you start thinking about things. Have you ever noticed what happens to your body when you think
intensely? All these weird patterns of tension come in.
And I was reading a Chinese medical treatise one time.
It says people whose jobs are spent in thinking
actually use up three times as much energy as people who've spent their days in physical
labor. Because for the one thing
you're using a lot of physical energy in very subtle ways. And secondly it's hard to
stop. You've got a mental job. You don't leave it at the office you take it home.
And it's there with you almost all the time.
Physical labor when it's done, it's done, you're home relaxed. Have a beer, turn on the TV.
Whatever.
But with mental
labor it's constantly there.
So what you're trying to do here is be more and more
give the body more space. Allow whatever parts have been starved for
energy. Feed them the energy they need. Once they've been fed then you can calm down.
Let them be still. A traditional
way of describing the difference between rapture and pleasure is you've been going
across a desert and you finally come to some water. Now rapture is what you feel
with that first drink of water. And then when you continue drinking
it turns into just plain pleasure. It's not the same obsession.
One of my favorite stories from Thailand
is that a noble man who eventually became king was separated
from his troops one time. And he came across this one house
and it was a young woman in front of the house about 16 years old. And he asked her
for some water. And so she went to the well and she got
a bowl full of water. In Thailand they drink out of bowls. And she filled the bowl
with water. And then before she handed it to him she took a lotus flower and she crushed it
up and sprinkled the stamens of the lotus all across the top of the water. Handed it
to him. Here this poor guy is thirsty and he gets this
lotus crap on his water. And so very
carefully he has to drink through the water so he doesn't swallow it.
As he doesn't swallow the lotus stamens. And then we handed it back to her and he asked
was that a trick? And she said no. I saw you were very thirsty.
And I was afraid you might choke on the water if you drank it too quickly.
He said where is your parents?
Are your parents around? And being a Thai nobleman he took her off to
his army camp.
So watch out when you meditate. Don't gulp down the water.
But you'll find that there are times when you come to the meditation
really, really weary. And this is one way that you can deal with the weariness very fast.
Just think okay what am I squeezing in my body when I think? What am I squeezing when
I breathe? Let's just stop that squeezing. And allow it to be
for a while.
And then once that sort of the need for intense
relaxation is over then you can, it goes to a sense of ease.
Where the body really doesn't impinge that much
on your awareness at all. Then you're able to see
the mind. And this is where we get into
7. I will breathe in sensitive to
mental fabrication. Now mental fabrication here is feeling and perception.
Feeling being the feeling
tone. Pleasurable.
Pleasant. Painful or neutral.
And perception being the way you label things. Once the body gets
sort of the movement of the energy in the body gets more and more calm
you find that mental events come more and more to the
4. You see them more clearly. The analogy I like to use is
of tuning into a radio station. If you're right on the
frequency you can hear things clearly. If you're a little bit off the
frequency then there's a lot of static and you can't hear what's being said.
Or if it's music, the music doesn't sound as nice.
But when you get everything right on
the frequency then it's all clear. In the same way when all this movement
of the energy in the body finally calms down then you can see the mental
side of fabrication which is this activity of feeling and perception.
And so once you begin sensitive to the movement
of feelings and perceptions noticing how one particular
way of perceiving things is more pleasant than another.
One way is more stressful than another.
Then you move on to step 8 which is to calm these
metal fabrications. All the way
through the in-breath, all the way through the out.
In other words you try to find the perception which is the most subtle
causes less stress, less sense of
burdensomeness. So if the feelings are calm and then
the perceptions then become very calm as well.
Any questions on that Tatra?
I'm not sure what you mean by squeezing in the body
like is it like a resistance or something?
It's your idea of what you have to do physically in order to get the breath in.
Are there any parts of the body where you feel a pulling?
So like control?
Yes, the sense that you're trying to control or you're trying to augment
the breath, make it come in faster, make it come in deeper.
Where are you putting pressure in your body when you do that?
And then you try to let up on the pressure and then
keep the pressure off of that spot all the way
through the in-breath, all the way through the out.
As I said earlier, sometimes people will try to put a little
squeeze at the end of the breath or the beginning of the breath. Especially when you're meditating
to let yourself know, okay now in, okay now we're going to go out, out.
But you don't do that, just allow it to have this kind of
pressure. If it's going to come in, it's going to come in. If it's not, it's not.
You just allow those sensations and it's a pattern of tension you may find
that's corresponding to the way you breathe. You just allow it to dissolve and you keep it dissolved.
Try that.
Olivia?
Just a second.
Tetrad means a set of four?
Questions back here.
Can you talk about calming the perceptions? Do you mean
there's a more or less skillful way of actually the language
that you use in your perception? Okay.
Like when you have a pain, if you say pain, pain, pain, that's not a calm perception.
If there's sensation, sensation, it's a calmer perception.
Or with the breath, you can think of again
breath energy just being very refined, kind of missed in the body.
If you just hold that perception in mind. Because perception here
can either be visual or linguistic. Then you find that
there are more and more refined ways of perceiving the breath process.
You just stick to whatever is most refined.
Is the perception
then a recognition of
visual and linguistic?
From what the feeling is or what the feeling means?
And again, you can be either what the feeling is or what it means.
Now many times the feeling means something, if it means
like especially if there's a pain. When you put the feeling
perception of pain on that sensation, it means I've got to do something about this.
If you put the label, it's just that sensation
that doesn't carry the meaning
that you've got to do something about it.
The perception, you might be able to
put it in more for yourself.
Right.
I'm just trying to correlate this
to my own meditation experience. It seems like for me when
I get past the place of the rapture and the
pleasure, there's a kind of less of a sense of the body. There's kind of an
expansiveness. And with that
it sounds like what he's maybe trying to point to here is like well then what
do you pay attention to when you're kind of not so aware of your
body anymore. It's like where's your tether or where's your anchor.
And one thing for me that comes up in that moment is kind of there's almost
a very subtle panickiness to it. It's like well now what
happens to me or where am I now? And so it seems
like he's kind of trying to help you have a sense of mind
observation at that point that's very subtle.
Because you can do, once you get to this point where everything is very, very still in the body
one thing you can do is go for space. But here
he's saying well why don't you try just looking how your perception of the body affects
the mind. Because when he's talking about feeling
it's not just physical feeling, it's going to be a mental feeling.
And you begin to see that certain perceptions will
move you out of that still and this other perceptions will help keep you in. And so you
go with the calmer ones. Just stick with that. So it's getting you more
and more into mind observation, yes. Because as I said you've got all
this energy stuff kind of taken out of the way.
The body feels good, basically okay now we're going to settle down and work on the real
issue which is the mind.
Okay let's move on to the next tip trend.
Step number nine. Years back when Larry Rosenberg was writing his
book on breath meditation, he would call me up and say let's talk about
nine. Nine what?
Then I realized oh okay, step number nine.
It was great for having to memorize these things.
He trains himself, I'll breathe in sensitive to the mind and he trains himself
I'll breathe out sensitive to the mind. Now mind here can mean anything from
the state of your mind to your emotional, mental
activity in the mind.
Also you can just be generally sensitive to just this bright awareness
that comes at this state of concentration.
The first meeting will relate to what comes on later.
The second meeting, when you get to this point you begin to see exactly
how still the mind can get, how luminous the mind can get in concentration.
This gives you something to compare. Because you will then begin to realize
it's not always going to stay that way.
But you have tasted the luminosity of the mind
the stillness of the mind. And now from
that point on you have something to compare all your other mental states with.
Now the Buddha doesn't say when you notice that
it's impermanent, it's okay, it's impermanent, it's constant, just leave it at that.
He says no. Step number ten. I will train myself breathing in
satisfying the mind, without satisfying the mind. In other words when the mind begins to get
a little bit dissatisfied with whatever
its state is.
You learn how to give it some satisfaction. Now this may bring changing
the way you breathe, changing the way you perceive things.
Either bodily fabrication or mental fabrication are your tools here
for helping to keep the mind state as clear and as calm as you want it.
In some cases where it needs a little encouragement
this is what the satisfaction is for. The terms used as satisfying the mind
here can also be used for gladdening the mind. When the mind feels depressed
when it feels low, okay how can you give it some more energy, give it more encouragement.
Step number eleven.
You breathe in and out steadying the mind.
If the mind is not quite as steady as beginning to get a little loose and wobbly
you figure out some way of getting it more firmly implanted on his
object. Again either through the way you fabricate the breath
or the way you fabricate feelings and perceptions.
And then finally
releasing. I'll breathe in
releasing the mind, I'll breathe out releasing the mind. Releasing here refers
to releasing it from a gross or mental state and bringing it to a higher mental state.
If you notice that
the mind has gotten totally out of concentration, okay release it from
all of the hindrances and the other things that keep it out of concentration and you get it
back in. Once it's back in you say this is the state of mind I have
here. Even after I've gladdened it and steadied it to some extent
still has some element of stress, some element of
burdensomeness to it.
Let's see if we can release it from that. Now classically they talk about
when you go from the first jhana into the second jhana
you've released it from the factors of direct
thought and evaluation. In other words you're adjusting the breath and everything
you're sort of working it, you're kneading the water through the dough
and then you realize it's all needed, I don't need to do any more kneading.
You just stop that unnecessary activity and just stay
stay with the breath. Okay that's called releasing it from the factors of the
first jhana and bringing it to a more refined state which would be the second jhana.
And then you can follow that all the way through the different stages of concentration.
So in other words what he's talking about
is once you've got the mind to a point where you can really watch it and you can begin to see
what the mind state is
what a luminous mind of concentration, what that's like
then you learn to master this skill. It's not that you
hit it once and you're done with it. You learn to bring yourself to the point
where whatever situation you're in you can figure out
what you can read your mind basically. What does it need?
Is it getting kind of depressed? Is it getting kind of low in its energy? Well what can we do
to give it some more encouragement? To give it some visceral satisfaction out of
being concentrated.
And then if you find that the mind is too energetic maybe it needs some
steadying. Just to calm it down.
So it is more and more firmly in the object.
And then finally once you've got it firmly there you say okay is there something better than this?
Is there still some kind of burdensomeness? Is there still some stress?
What am I doing that's unnecessary in this particular training of the mind?
A couple years back I was reading a book on
swimming. Learning how to be a good swimmer. And I point out that
when you're doing any kind of practice for sport
it's not just a matter of putting in time but it's also a matter of learning how to do what you're doing more efficiently.
You really observe all the
unnecessary movements you're making in the course of this swim stroke
and drop the unnecessary ones so that you can become a faster swimmer
and it's less of a burden on you to go swimming through the water. The same thing applies
to learning a musical instrument. Learning
how to play those runs on the piano that sound like they're made out of liquid.
It's learning how to do it with a minimum amount of effort.
You learn it to be more efficient. In the same way as a meditator
you're going to learn how to keep the mind centered more and more efficiently
with less and less effort.
Remember one of the people staying at the monastery one time
was complaining about how she was trying to keep with a breath
in the midst of some pain in her body. And I said, well just leave the pain alone
and stay with a breath. And she said, I tried it. In the last five minutes of the meditation
last night it was just really, really painful. I really had to put in this heroic
effort and just staying with each breath all the way in, all the way out.
And I think she was trying to
get me to say, well you don't have to put that much effort in, just be more relaxed.
I said, yeah, that's what you have to do. She looked at me, ah! Is it going to be like this all the time?
No. But when you're learning to do it you really do have to put a lot of effort
into get the mind under control. Once you've learned it keep doing it again and again
and again and get more observant about what you're doing so you do it more efficiently
and it takes less effort. And then you can release the mind from
in this case, release the mind from the unnecessary effort that's
being put into it. So that's the third
TET thread. Any questions on this one?
Yes.
My sense of it is there seems to be a major leap between
all the previous steps in step 12
in that it seems like all the preceding ones are very
active, what you're actually doing. Whereas
step 12 seems to be much more passive. Now you're kind of letting it all go
instead of correct understanding. Well, it's all the way up. You're trying
to find a balance between too much activity and too little activity.
Because, again, that being sensitive to pleasure
and sensitive to rapture, you're certainly doing something but you're also telling yourself physically
don't do these painful
ways of breathing or stressful ways of breathing.
And sometimes in order to observe that you just have to be very, very still
to see where it's happening. So it's a combination of being active and being more
passive. And in this one for
number 12 it's, again, you have to be active in looking at where in the
mind is it still unnecessary effort. But then as soon as
you see that you drop it. So it's a combination of
sort of active questioning and inquiry and then when you see anything that's painful or
unnecessary profit. Question right next to you.
When you say unnecessary effort in the mind, do you mean
our stories or what? Hopefully
we left our stories at the door. But you do have a story about
your breathing.
So the story
about my breathing. I'm not talking about what I'm thinking about
or... As I said, we hope we left that a while back.
It's a hope.
What he's trying to do is, and it's a lot easier to get
out of your stories. If you follow the
Buddha's example in which when he, the night of his awakening
he started out with a story. He wanted to know, have I lived
in the past? And so he started seeing what his story
was and he found out it was a long story. And he goes back aeons.
And if you think your stories are complicated
all the stories of previous
lifetimes. My teacher once said it's a good thing we can't remember our previous lifetimes.
Because then we have lots more issues with lots more people.
But
so the Buddha followed the narrative back. And I once
saw the narrative as interesting. He said, I was born in such and such a place.
I had such and such a name. This was my name. This was my appearance.
This was my food. This was what I fed on. Such was my experience of pleasure
and pain such as my death. That's life right there.
Name, appearance, pleasure, pain, food, death.
And then he just followed it back.
It was all in terms of where I was, where I was at. And I just traced
this eye back as far as we could go. It goes way back.
Freud had nothing on the Buddha that night.
But then he realized, the next question was
is this just me? And then he directed his
question to, what about other beings in the universe? Does this happen to them too?
It turns out, yes, everybody.
He saw beings dying and then being reborn in line with their actions.
Now this performed two very useful purposes. One was
it got him out of the narrative. He began to realize this is a universal pattern.
And again and again and again throughout the Buddha's teachings he points out
that if you can universalize your issues, realize you're not the only one.
It takes a lot of the burden off.
For some reason, like contemplating, I know your mother dies
while everybody's mother dies at some point.
It's for some reason that makes it less of a burden. Because it's not just you.
Why is this happening to me? It's what happens to everybody.
But the second time, seeing that it's universal, then you start looking for the pattern.
And this is where the Buddha said people
die on a reborn in line with their actions, their intentions.
That's what brought him back into the present moment for the third knowledge
which is let's look at intention in the present moment.
And that's where he saw things in terms of the formable truths and gained awakening.
So before you get out of your... before you sit down to be in the present moment
look at yourself, acknowledge your story and then see, okay
is this universal? Is it just me or are there lots of people like this?
Once you get out of the just me then it's a lot easier to settle down with what you've got.
So releasing the mind
I mean if you find yourself entangled in the story, the first thing you should do would be, okay
what kind of story is this? And you try to look at it in terms of the
the Buddha's teachings on the hindrances. Is this
essential desire story? Is this an ill-will story?
Is this a sloth and torpor story? Is this the restlessness and anxiety
story? Is it an uncertainty story? And you see, okay
these are just these plain old hindrances. No big deal.
Then you say, okay I've had enough.
I've seen, you know, this is a movie I've watched lots of times and it doesn't even
start on Big Bo Garten. Okay, enough.
And then you drop it. And then as you get the mind
into states of concentration you find that you stick with a particular way
of relating to your breath and a particular way of relating to your body, relating to your mind.
And then as you get more and more used to it you find that you get
more and more refined, more and more skillful, more and more efficient
in getting the mind to stay down, getting it down, getting it to stay.
Or then when you come out of meditation maintaining that sense of center in the body without losing
it so fast. All this is related to these steps
of steadying, gladdening the mind, satisfying the mind and then releasing
it from anything that's unnecessary.
Because you're already looking at your mind in terms, right here he's having you look at the mind
in terms of the Four Noble Truths. Where is their stress, where can it be
released?
So he's getting you in that direction already.
In fact he's gotten you there from the very beginning, calming bodily fabrication.
You're that, the pulling in and the pushing out and the pinching
of the breath at the end of the pinching or whatever. You're going to, hands off.
Because it's not unnecessary. Unnecessary stress.
And then he has you go deeper and deeper and deeper and say okay where is there still unnecessary
stress even in these deeper states of mind?
And this is getting you used to looking at things in terms of stress, the
cause of stress, what am I doing that's causing the stress? How can I
abandon that? How can I stop that action?
So it starts from the stories
and works in.
Welcome to this question here.
Let's let the mic travel.
Do you have a question?
Yes.
What do you do if you find that
that you slip into the story
in the middle of the breathing?
What do you find helpful?
Just that one thing. If this were a movie would I pay money to watch it?
No.
Or if it's a story about what I have to do
and it's not that pressing
issues. I could die before this ever happens.
In fact I could die right now while I'm meditating. Do you want to
die in the middle of this story?
I would want to be caught dead in this story.
And you've got it.
It's kind of like Miss Mano she had her Kafka relationship reducer.
Miss Mano's Kafka relationship reducer is that
instead of telling the other person that you're going to break up you just disappear.
Otherwise
you don't feel that there are any un...
I've got to tie all these loose ends together before I get out of this story.
Cut.
Enough.
You have no obligation to finish the story.
It's not like a TV show where once you get sucked in you have to see it to the end of the half hour.
But just
try to think of it in those terms. Pull yourself out of the story and look at it as a stranger
might look at it.
Or if again, if the Hulk in the story is, you know, poor me I am
such a miserable person either because I'm such a fool or because
other people are nasty. Step back and say, look there are other fools that are the nasty people
in the world. It's not such a big deal.
And then you can move on.
There's a question here.
You talk sometimes about Jhana.
Are we entering Jhana states where we're in that concentration
can be a little more clear about what you mean? Okay, Jhana is
that's related to the word means to burn steadily.
They have different verbs in Pali for burn.
The one that's related to Jhana is called Jianti, J-H-A-Y-A-T-I.
And it's the burning of an oil lamp, which is very steady
kind of flame, the kind of flame that you can read by.
And they have other verbs for burning in Pali which they also
use for the mind. Like when you're burning with desire, you're burning with
anger. It's a different verb entirely. That's the kind of
fire you can't read by. What you're trying to do is get the mind really
steadily focused on one object. Okay, it's still attached to the object.
But the fact that its focus is steady is that you begin
to see the mind a lot more clearly. Now they talk about four stages
of Jhana in the text. The first one you're focusing on
the object and you keep directing your thoughts to it. And at the same time
you're evaluating the object to make it more comfortable. And then as you get more
and more absorbed in it, it becomes the single object that you're really into.
It's like you're thinking about that
one thing and nothing else. You can
make a parallel with getting really involved in a novel or a book or something
where you're just totally focused on a novel that you're not paying attention to anything else.
But here's the difference, since you're dealing with a sensation in the body. And then you take
that sensation, use it to fill the body. Like if there's a sense of
ease that comes with a breath or a sense of rapture, use that to fill the whole body.
Now those five factors,
direct to thought, evaluation, singleness of
object, ease and rapture, those are the five factors of the first Jhana.
So here we're using the breath as your object and you just get really into the breath.
Everything in the whole body becomes breath. And there's a sense of ease. You work with
the breath so it gets comfortable. So there's that sense of refreshment
and then the sense of ease. And then you just maintain that.
That's the first Jhana. The second Jhana, you can drop the direct
of thought and the evaluation. You don't need them anymore because the breath is full.
It's in the body. You just kind of plow into the present sensation. Just stay there.
The third Jhana, the rapture starts
getting too oppressive. You've had enough of the rapture. So you drop that as a metal factor.
And then there's just singleness of object and ease.
And finally, you don't even think about whether it's pleasant or not. It's just really, really
still. The mind gets really implanted in this sense of full body. And at that point
the breath is stopped. You're breathing through your pores.
Then your brain is still enough so you're not
using up the oxygen that would require you to breathe in and out. So the oxygen
you're getting in your skin is enough. That's the fourth Jhana.
That's what's meant by Jhana.
So by the time we're releasing
the mind, we're in a Jhana state.
You're already, I mean starting with the pleasure and the rapture, you're already there.
And then it becomes a question of mastering it.
Because many people feel, hey, I've got it in the state.
I'm just going to stay this way forever. And the next thing you know is gone.
Because it's one of the easiest things to drop.
And so what you're learning how to do is how to stay centered there
as much as you can. And then noticing how is it the mind loses its center.
Sometimes it loses it's because it's running out of energy. It's not getting any
sort of visceral kick out of it. So that's when you bring in
a little bit of gladdening in the mind. Let's go back for a little bit more rapture.
Or when you find that you're getting too active, okay, let's calm it down.
And then once it's calmed down you say, okay, now in the next state, now that we're calmed down, we're steady.
To what extent is this the most refined state of
concentration I can manage at this point? To what extent can I detect other forms of
unnecessary stress that I'm causing? When you see what you're
doing to cause the stress, then you've got that. So that brings us up to
mastering, Jhana. And that number, step number what?
Twelve.
Yes and that. Oh, okay.
I think you answered part of my question
in the last part that you just said, but I was wondering, when you get
very steady in the mind and you're trying to stay
steady or gladdened in the mind, satisfied in the mind,
there's a tendency to be able to do that for some time, but what I feel
is, depending on how the day went, either one of those
old revocations can kind of get you knocked
off the mind. And you almost have to get back to
step one. Yeah.
Being sensitive to bodily fabrication. So there's a lot of up and down,
not a lot, but there could be bouncing
up and down between these tech threads. Yeah.
It's not that you have to do one, two, three, four, five, six. Sometimes you find
yourself going back to one or three or four or whatever
is needed at the time. That's part of this mastery of the
processes, looking what does the mind need right now.
Then you go back to calming the bodily fabrication, if that's what it needs.
Okay, so calming bodily fabrication,
so you're not, are you satisfied and gladdening?
Why? You're looking at,
your main concern now is the state of the mind. You're beginning to see
the impact the body has on the mind, the impact the mind has on itself.
And sometimes to gladden the mind, all you have to do is just think about a few things and that gets
it gladder. More glad. Gladder.
Glanced. Other times
you have to do some work with the breath.
So what you're doing in this state is, what does the mind need right now?
And then work from there. And then you can pull out
whatever trick you have.
There's a question in the back.
The way that you talk about it in terms of
what does the mind
need now, what am I, the way that you phrase
those, is it sufficient to just
think those in your mind and wait for the answer or is this a point for discursive
thought or a little confused about it?
Part of it comes just through experience. I've seen the mind like this before
and what worked in the past.
And secondly, just looking at it in those terms, how many times
learning how to ask the right question, you've got the answer right there.
I remember back when I was
10 years old, my family moved out to Kansas and the Kansas
newspaper had Anne Landers. I'd never seen Anne Landers in my life before.
And I thought she was really wise. You know, all these people writing questions and she would answer just
like that. And then as I got older I realized that she had those questions
fed to her. I mean, as soon as you see the question, you know the answer.
And for the person writing the letter, the problem was getting the question into a proper question.
Once you've got the proper question, the answer is pretty obvious sometimes.
So in this case, if you learn to see, look at your mind, okay, what does my mind
need right now? Does it need to be gladdened or does it need to be steadied?
Does it need to be sort of calmed down or does it need to be lifted up?
And then the tools you have here in the breath, what are I need
in terms of the different skills you've mastered up to that point? What does it need
right now? And when you learn to bring that question to the mind
and then look at the different tools you have many times over time
you get more and more quick to identify what the problem
is and what the solution is going to be.
I'm not sure if this happens in monastic life
but have you found that an
array of events occur that overwhelm your ability
to be mindful?
Are there ever any situations
or have you heard from lay people
describe it as such that there are sometimes events happen where
you just can't sit and there's a need to
maybe walk away for a bit and take up some
movement exercise such as yoga
or the Chikon that was mentioned earlier. Yeah, that's one of your tools.
So it's not a sin? No, it's not a sin.
To walk away for a while.
No, among the monks in the forest tradition one of these practices that's used
in this case is known as walking to the next mountain and walking back.
You just pick up your stuff and you go to the next mountain
and then you come back. And part of
it's like learning how to be a boxer. First step in boxing
I was taught Thai boxing before I was a monk.
Before I was a monk I was in Thailand for two years and I
was in Thai boxing. Number one step in Thai boxing is retreat.
I think in almost any of the martial arts it's how to get out.
It's a useful skill. Yeah, that's an interesting thought
that's also in the art of war.
There are times that you should retreat. You never made that correlation.
And also
is that one of the ideas behind the walking meditation?
You can't just sit all day.
And you can walk as fast and as slow as you like.
I mean there's this egret walking that they have.
That's not really good for working off a lot of extra energy.
But so you can just walk around the block
walk whatever speed you need.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you for the break.
