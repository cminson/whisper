Supported

A variety of feelings or  conditions can support 
meditation, mindfulness  practice , and concentration 
practice . Depending on the  feelings  you may have , it 
can be very helpful to feel supported when you’re 
practi cing. According to t he degree to which you feel 
unsafe, it’s helpful to feel safe . Or if you  feel isolated, it’s 
helpful to feel connected to others sitting together . If you  
feel overwhelmed by other people, it’s good to have a 
place of silence where you can feel left alone.  
 
Given  all the  attitudes , understandings , or feelings  that 
support this  practice , what I’d like to offer today is the 
idea of feeling supported . Many things can support us . 
Consider how you  are being supported while you’re 
here, so that you don’t have to feel excessively 
responsible for what’s happening  – as if it’s all up to  
you, and you have to find your way with no support.  
 
It can be as simple as feeling the support of the ground 
underneath you. When you sit, feel the support of the 
cushion or chair . Don’t take it for granted  – rather  feel that you are resting there. When  you are walking, you 
have the support of the ground.  
 
You also have the support here of the schedule . Maybe 
a schedule seems like a small thing , but it can be 
helpful to have a schedule that supports you , and 
creates a container for practice.  
 
You are supported by the other people who are also 
practi cing here . You are not practi cing alone.  
 
You have  the support of the teachings , which 
practitioners have been using for thousands of years . 
The teachings a re here to support us . You are not trying 
to make it up all on your own , as if you were the very 
first person who ever had to negotiate life in this way . A 
big body of teachings and understandings are here in 
the background t o support you .  
 
As you practice  today , you might consider how you are 
supported here. What is the support that supports you?   
Don’t do this  because you have to, or because it’s a 
moralistic thing to feel supported , but rather  consider , 
“In what way are you supported here , so that it’s easier 
to relax , and just be present  in a very simple way ? To 
be here in the present moment , this time and place , 
rather than having the mind spin out ?” 
 
This idea of being supported  – you might consider it today.
