The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Okay, so, so welcome, welcome everyone. Welcome to happy hour if you're
joining us on Zoom, in case I get to see your lovely faces. And if you're joining
on YouTube, oh yes, we have folks joining from YouTube also. Hello Dexter from
Bainbridge Island, Washington. Nice, great. And other folks too. So, so tonight's
practice guided meditation for meta loving kindness. The theme is going to be
exploring the element of space. So, okay, what does that mean? So, so for those of
you who've been joining me for the past week and half couple weeks, I've been
exploring meta loving kindness as different elements. So, in the Buddhist
cosmology, there's the idea, which is similar in some other traditions, there's
this idea of the four elements or sometimes five elements, you know, there is
the fire element, there is the water element, there is earth element, there is
the air element. And sometimes there is an extra element, which is the space
element. So, the past few weeks, I've explored the other four elements and
people, the report has been very positive. People loved different ways of
exploring meta kindness care being held in say, healing waters, or, or, or air,
we breathe as being nourishing, healing, supportive, or exploring fire and holy
fire and meta as this fire within. And, and earth, the last time we explored the
earth element, grounding, supportive as mother earth and loving. So, how about
us exploring receiving that, receiving that love and care. So, since the series
was so much fun and it really brought up different aspects of exploring
experiencing yourself, sense of being held in care and in love. I figured, okay,
why stick to the four elements? There are different places in the sutta that the
Buddha talks about the fifth element, which is space. Sometimes it's put
together similar to air, but sometimes it's actually separate. So, the space
element akasa, there's this sense of spaciousness. So, so now you know where
this inspiration is coming from. What I'll be inviting us to explore tonight is
this sense of spaciousness in our hearts, spaciousness in our bodies, sense of
space. Can we feel ourselves held for the sense of space, not tightness,
because, you know, we often, you know, we associate the sense of tightness, lack
of space with lack of safety, lack of love, lack of security, lack of metta, lack
of goodwill. But how about exploring this opposite, the sense of spaciousness.
So, I'll be inviting various imagery for us to explore the sense of spaciousness
in our own bodies, in our own hearts, in our own minds, feeling held, feeling
held in safety, and the goodwill, spaciously. So, so what that is, that's
the plan. And if now with this little introduction, now you're curious, I
wonder what happened with fire and water and earth and, and what was it, water,
did I already say, air, water, fire, any of the other four elements, they're all
on audio Dharma, they're also on YouTube, and you're welcome to go and listen to
them. And I see Glenn is laughing because fire was quite eventful at the end of
doing the guided meditation on the fire element, the fire alarm in my apartment
building went off. So, it was a really funny cosmic joke, as if I had caused
the fire. It was all safe, it was just a burnt pizza, but anyway, so the most
eventful happy hour ever so far. So, we'll see space, I don't know if any
dangers associated with space, but we'll see. We'll explore together. I'm
starting to risk myself, we'll see. All right, everyone. So, I'd like to invite
you to get into a comfortable meditation posture, whatever that might be for you.
Ah, arriving, landing in this moment. Hmm.
Landing in this body. Ah.
Landing this breath. Hmm.
Offering up, letting go of all the thoughts, cares.
Whatever has come before this moment, as if it was light, weightless.
As if you were just simply opening your fists and all the thoughts. Ah,
offering them up. Spaciousness beyond. Seeing them float.
And allowing there to be a sense of lightness.
Spaciousness in your body.
As you land, as you open up in this moment.
Becoming more aware of all the spaces in your body where the breath is moving
through.
Connecting with each breath, each and every breath.
Lightly, spaciously.
Noticing with the entire duration of the in-breath.
More space feels like it becomes available in your body.
Lightly, spaciously.
Lightly, spaciously.
Lightly.
Letting yourself take the light. Enjoy every breath.
Spacious, spacious breath.
In your lungs, your whole body.
The entire in-breath, the entire out-breath.
Can you feel the spaciousness of the in-breath?
Is it possible to connect with the spaciousness of the out-breath?
Is it possible to connect with the spaciousness of the out-breath?
Each breath, calming, soothing.
Each breath, calming, soothing.
Freeing, freeing up more space in your mind.
And if thoughts are arising, this moment maybe see them like dandelions, offered up by the breath, offered up spaciously.
Playfully.
As you feel the breath moving throughout your body, the spaces and the cavities in the body,
realizing that this body is made of space.
According to physics, there is very little matter.
The molecules in the atoms, it's mostly space.
You are mostly space. This body is mostly space.
Open, light.
As if the breath was opening up, allowing more spaciousness in the body,
especially the areas where there was tightness, contraction.
All the contractions, tightness freed up, released, offered up to space.
Space within and space without.
Space within and space without.
Space within and space without.
And if thoughts, judgments, whatever arises in this moment, it's okay.
No problem.
Not doing this practice wrong.
Whatever is arising needs to arise. See if you can ever so gently, lovingly, kindly smile with it.
And in this moment, let it be offered up, released, to spaciousness, with kindness and ease,
not out of duty or ill will. Let them be released.
Offering the thoughts, the judgments, spaciousness. See how that works. Experiment.
Now I'd like to invite you to imagine the limit of your body, the skin.
So a little further out, maybe the perimeter of your body, rather, doesn't end at your skin,
but it's more spacious. Your body is more spacious.
As you breathe, feeling the space inside, easeful, open, friendly, there's a spaciousness,
expansiveness to your awareness beyond the limits of your body.
As if your breath was filling just a few inches beyond the parameters of your body.
Okay.
Okay.
It's spacious inside, spacious outside.
Your body, your heart,
lighting, spaciousness in our heart to be felt, appreciated.
Even if the sound, a voice comes up, oh, my heart is not spacious.
Well, let yourself be surprised, appreciating in ways, ways in which you don't truly know your own beauty,
your own grace, the grace within you, the grace of your heart.
This being that is you whom you think you know, but you don't quite appreciate or fully understand.
Inviting, inviting the spaciousness, the grace, the expansiveness of your own heart to reveal itself to you.
Your heart as wide as the sky.
And first and foremost, holding yourself in the spaciousness of kindness
and forgiveness and care as much as it is accessible and available.
As if now you were breathing through your heart, your heart center
with each breath feeling, expansiveness.
If your heart letting go, letting go of contraction, tightness, ill will.
And embracing the grace, spaciousness of goodwill, boundlessness of kindness, friendliness, warmth and care.
You're welcome to feel yourself in it.
Look at the objectless, just feeling, sense of expansiveness in the heart.
With goodwill, without any objects, any people, just spacious, brimming with goodwill.
You decide what's best for you in this moment, in this way.
Your heart spacious, exultant with goodwill.
Feeling safe, your heart feeling safe in its spaciousness, in its own spaciousness.
Your heart feeling glad, happy, joyous in its own spaciousness,
reveling its own in its own abundance.
Thank you.
Your heart expansive in its own sense of well-being.
Spacious, exultant, abundant sense of well-being for no reason at all.
Just offered to you in your spacious heart, held in grace.
Thank you.
And connecting with the fourth netta wish of safety.
I'm sorry, ease, safety was first.
Ease, ease in the spaciousness of your heart.
How much ease?
Conjuring of ease, offering, receiving the offering in this moment.
The spaciousness of ease, ease of spaciousness.
Staying resting.
Connecting with the spaciousness.
Connecting with the spaciousness of netta.
Goodwill.
We've connected through this guidance.
The sense of safety.
May I be safe.
I feel safe, feeling the spaciousness of a heart safe,
whole, expansive in its goodness.
Again, connecting with exultant, abundant joy, happiness,
spaciousness of joy.
Limitless, like the skies, heart full of joy.
Again, connecting with the third netta wish of well-being.
Sense of expansiveness, the heart, body and mind.
More dimensions of well-being, health and goodness.
Then might meet the eye, physically.
Again, reconnecting with the fourth netta wish.
Keep saying safety, ease, spaciousness of ease and peace.
Getting your whole body, your heart feel, sense of being held in ease.
Connecting in this moment as much as it is accessible.
Now I'll write you to connect with the space inside, space outside,
as if you're offering all the spaciousness of your heart to the whole world.
As if your heart was spacious enough, it is wide enough for the whole world.
All the beings in it.
Lishing safety in all the space that all beings in this world are held.
May all the space around them, space inside, space outside, be a space of safety.
Just as I wish for myself to be safe inside, safe outside, within and without.
Wishing, offering your goodwill, wishing safety internally, externally for all beings.
And as you wish for yourself.
Just as I want to be happy, connect with the spaciousness, abundance of joy.
Wishing all beings abundance, spaciousness of joy, happiness.
Who knows, maybe even a smile shows up on your face with this one.
Offering joy.
And just as I wish for myself to have sense of well-being inside, spaciousness of well-being.
May all beings everywhere have a sense of well-being.
The goodness, all the space and goodness that affords all well-being.
And just as I wish to take care of myself happily and have ease in my life.
Spaciousness of ease in my life, all aspects of my affairs.
I wish the spaciousness of ease and peace to imbue all the lives of all beings.
And for the last moments of this practice, guided practice together.
Again, offering yourself spaciousness of goodwill for however this practice period was or wasn't.
For judgments arising, offer them.
Let them be held spaciously. There's so much room for goodness, well-being, happiness, joy.
The judgments, the thoughts don't have to be squashed. There's plenty of space for everything to be held spaciously with kindness.
Thank you all.
So at this time I usually like to ask if you would offer a word or a phrase as to what's arising for you right now from this practice period.
You can type it in chat, I'll read them out loud or you can unmute yourself.
I think what's coming up for me right now is a sense of joy and happiness. I feel so spacious as if I'm on cloud nine right now with just a sense of happiness and goodwill and delight.
Looking at your faces, I'm even happier now.
And also there's a sense of connecting with you through the space. The space feels more spacious somehow.
You see the space around all of you in your rooms.
Any offerings, any word or phrase you call to offer.
And everything is welcome, whatever worked, whatever didn't. Thank you, Olivia. Vulnerability is arising. Thank you.
Megan, holding things lightly. Thank you.
Nancy, open. Yeah.
And Chelsea says, relaxed. Nice. And Trudy has her hand up. I will unmute you, Trudy, please.
Love is not a gated community.
Thank you, Trudy. Lovely words. Thank you.
Kristen offers parenting and doing dishes with a light heart. Love it. Love it. Love it.
Austin offers slow down. Nice. Victor offers spaciousness of kindness and friendship. Ah, nice.
And this time, time for us to transition to our next practice together in community, which is to hold each other with the spaciousness.
Love not being a gated community as Trudy beautifully brought it up, but a sense of openness and spaciousness that we hold ourselves, holding each other in that spaciousness.
And see what that might be like. Something might shift or move or break in this space, in this vulnerable space.
If you're willing to try, if you're willing to sit with each other, then the prompt is simple. How are you? How are you?
Letting yourself be held and letting yourself hold others as an experiment. And what is possible in humanity? What is possible?
And if it is not appropriate for you tonight to engage in this way, it's perfectly okay. It's fine to bow out also.
And I do invite you to give it a try if you're on the fence. Research shows if you're on the fence, you'll be happier if you did it and stuck around.
But again, whatever works for you this evening is all good.
So I'd like to make the breakout rooms now. There will be a size 3 or 4. Let's see. Here we go.
You can practice. Fishing me well. Okay, here we go. I think I have it. Oops. Oh, wait.
Oh, I know what's going on. Okay, here we go. All right. I'm opening up the rooms. Here we go.
Welcome back, everyone. So we have a few minutes for anything you'd like to share about your practice experience, any comments, reflections, questions, complaints.
All welcome, please.
I would say I was nervous about the breakout room, but it was really great. It was great to talk to a couple other people and share.
Lovely. Lovely. Thank you for that, Colleen. That's wonderful. It's great.
And I see Charlie waving. Maybe approving, agreeing with that, Charlie. Is that what that was? Yeah. Awesome.
Anything you'd like to add or anybody would like to add?
Would you like to, oh, Nancy wants to put a link of a video in the chat? Sure.
Sorry, it looks like part of my message got cut off. It's an older video, but in the light of the pandemic in George Floyd, it was sent to me yesterday, and it's so exquisitely beautiful that I really wanted to share it,
especially with the Meta group, because it's called A Song For All Beings, and it has the Meta practice in it, and so I'll just put the link in.
Yeah, please. Feel free to put the link in the chat, and folks can kind of, right at the end, maybe not right now, I'll give a heads up before we end.
Oh, you can save the chat. Everyone can save the chat and have the link. Thank you for that, Nancy. That's lovely. Thanks for offering that.
Any other thoughts? How was your practice tonight?
Nikki, I just want to say thank you for hosting these happy hours. This is my second time joining you, and it's in the middle of high parenting time for me.
So it's my second practice of doing the dishes and parenting, and just being in the very mundane tasks of my life, and also my life, and just really appreciate getting to practice off the cushion,
because I've been, for the first time ever, having a very serious morning meditation practice, daily practice over these past three months, and that's wonderful.
But it's not the same as me doing the dishes and responding to my kids and scraping stuff off the counter with a spacious heart.
So thank you so much for providing this format for me to practice in. Very grateful.
Thank you so much, Kristin, for practicing in this way and bringing that into the space, offering that as an inspiration for everyone.
To practice that way, to practicing on the cushion is awesome, fantastic. Yes, of course. And bringing that to the daily life, to the, as you call it, the mundane tasks.
Oh yes, doing that with a spacious heart. The cleaning and cooking and scraping is just, ah, we don't get to redo this life again.
And can we do these tasks with spaciousness of heart? So beautiful. Thank you for showing up in this way.
Thank you.
Thank you. That's great. And Kathleen offers some barriers shifted. Thank you so much for this space to occur. Ah, that's lovely. Thank you, Kathleen.
That's a lovely note to end as it is seven o'clock already. So I want to thank you all for showing up for yourselves, for each other, for all beings.
We don't do this practice for ourselves. We do it for everyone whose life we touch as an act of service, as an act of service.
So may we serve everyone in the world, in our kindness, in our goodwill.
Yeah, I'm just touched. I'm just touched by all of your practices and I'm delighted to see your smiling faces. Thank you all. Thank you for showing up. I feel happier.
I feel supported by you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Barbara. Thank you. Take good care.
Now you can save the chat. Did you send it? Wait Nancy, I didn't see the link.
For some reason I can't copy and paste it. So I'll just put the name and the title. You can find it there.
That sounds good. Thanks Nancy. Thanks everyone.
