 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So, what I said at the beginning of the meditation is quite important, or quite useful, say it that way. That meditation is a time to experience our life ourselves in a new way, in a different way than as usual in everyday life. And so in everyday life, kind of the maybe generic version of it is we're doing things, thinking about things, taking care of things, fixing things, avoiding things, concerned about things. And many of that stuff is purposeful, is sometimes thinking about the future, thinking about the past, trying to change something. In meditation, the idea is to have a very different way of respecting our life as it's being lived. It's not to deny anything, but in a sense to be present for it in a new way, and maybe a radically new way. And so as we learn this new way of being present for experience, we have available to us all kinds of new possibilities, new possibilities of understanding, of wisdom, of investigation, of questioning our life in new ways, and new ways of allowing a deep, much deeper processes within us to heal us, to unfold us, to grow us in new ways. So the new way, which is an ancient way, I think can be represented by this idea of meeting our experience with a quiet mind. Maybe a silent mind, meeting our experience to be present for it in a full way with a quietness of a clean window, a dirty window you maybe can't even see out. But when the window has been cleaned, then the window itself is silent. But the window enables us to really then see clearly what's outside the window. So as the awareness becomes quieter, it also becomes clearer and we can see more fully what's here. So in relationship to fear, to really be able to find a wise way and a creative way to be with fear and find our way through fear, this kind of new way of seeing is really useful and important. So when we sit to meditate, ideally we're sitting in a place where here and now is safe. So we're not, the building is not burning down, people are not attacking us. Nothing's going to happen within reason. Now sitting here, it's relatively safe. And the reason to have that clarity about the safety of here and now, it might not be safe if you leave your place where you're sitting, it might not be safe in an hour, what you're going to do. But in the way you're sitting, and you become clear, this is safe right now, here and now. The advantage of that is then you can see, notice that if there is fear, it's not about here and now. And so in a sense, it doesn't have to be figured out. Rather, we want to meet it. Fear is something that we want to respect with our mindfulness, something we want to be present for, not avoid, not fix, not try to attack, but to, it's a very worthy focus of mindfulness for living a deeper life, a fuller life. And so we want to be able to turn our attention. And when fear is salient, fear is the main, is a strong experience or important enough, to learn to bring the attention, mindfulness to feel the fear. And it might be that you're sitting in a safe place, but for 30 minutes, you're doing mindfulness of fear. And it might be time very well spent. Many people don't really stop and look at fear. The bumper sticker now would be, I break for fear, I stop for fear. Really stop and take a good look at it. What is this here? And the principle that I think is very powerful or the practice we're very powerful, we're trying to do with fear, is when we're able to stop and really feel our fear, feel it in an embodied way, that we're trying to help our fear feel safe. So there might be a real cause for the fear. It might be a real fear out in the world. In half an hour, there might be something happening that's dangerous. But here now in this safe place that we're in, how can we help the fear feel safe? How can we allow it to be there? And so it doesn't have the sense that it's wrong or it's bad, or we're trying to run away from it or trying to attack it and fix it, like we're doing the practice in order to get rid of it. If you're doing the practice to get rid of it, if you're going to anthropomorphize your fear a little bit, the fear is not going to be happy. It's not going to be comfortable. It's not going to feel like it has a place. It's going to feel unwanted. It's going to feel unrespected. And so the idea to help the fear feel safe means to allow it to be there as if it now has time, time in the sun of awareness, as if someone's never lived in the sun, it's always been in the dark, and they finally able to come out in the sun, then it's like, oh, now let me take it in. Let me receive it. So the sun of awareness, so as if the fear has never been seen, really, really not gotten to know. The task is to get to know the fear, to recognize it, to see it. Help the fear feel seen. Help the fear feel like it's being known. Just like maybe for you, if you're really anxious one day or really afraid, a friend might come sit next to you and say, I see that you're really afraid. I'll sit here with you. Would you like a companion? I'll just, you know, clear the friend is not fixing you or judging you for being afraid, but they recognize it and they're going to sit and be a safe person for you. We'll just be there with you and kind of accompany you. And having that company makes a world of difference. So this new way is to accompany the fear, to be with it for a while. And what this does is it allows the fear, room, to do what it needs to do, to unfold, to relax. Something begins to shift and change when we give that kind of permission for the fear to be there. And to give that kind of permission for the fear to be there and be known, to be accompanied, it does help if we have a quieter mind. It doesn't have to become completely silent, but a quieter mind that's not ruminating and repeating stories and judging and criticizing and all kinds of things, the extra things the mind is doing. The thinking mind is just almost like saying, they're there, I'm here with you. I see you. I'll be your companion here now. Let me feel you. Or the thinking mind is very gently saying, where do I feel this in my body? Where does the fear live? Because one of the ways to help the fear feel safe and really be seen is to recognize where it's being most activated in the body. Is it in the belly? Is it in the chest? In the hands? In a jaw? Where might it be? And then bring a careful, loving attention to that area. And the image that I like to use for that is cupping the hands together and holding something underneath. So holding the fear. So sometimes I'll imagine my mindfulness, my awareness, is like these two hands that are coming together underneath, wherever the fear is located in the body, and holding it, being with it, as if it is allowed to be there forever. And so this is a radical different way of being with fear than most people know. If in doing that we start to panic, it gets very uncomfortable to fear, then it's not a useful thing to do. And maybe we need to do something to settle the fear, to quiet the fear. Maybe stop meditating and do something else. But if you're able to do that, to come and sit and be with the fear, this allows us now to, as I said, allows the fear to process itself, which is often wiser than us processing it. More often than not, the thinking mind is reactivating the fear and perpetuating the fear. So for the mind to be quiet allows the fear to process itself. And then it also then begins helping us to do deeper mindfulness into the ecology of fear, the different elements of it that are important to also pay attention to besides just the direct experience of the fear. And that'll be the topic for the next couple of days. And I'm hoping that this will also give you kind of a new angle, new perspective in which to look at fear, because the old perspectives often keep us trapped, keep us caught in fear. And fear, anxiety, can follow someone along for decades. And so to learn a new way can be phenomenally useful. So you might try over this next day, if you have some anxiety or fear, pay attention, look for it. If it's easy to find, great, then you're on track. If it's not easy to recognize, then maybe you have to be extra sensitive to recognize where it might appear. And then see if the situation allows for it to just stop and pause for a while, maybe sit down and close your eyes, and see if you spend some time helping the fear feel safe. You have to find where it is in the body, you have to bring attention to it carefully, and then maybe almost like you're breathing through the fear, with the fear, as a way of accompanying it and helping it feel safe. Almost like the breathing with it is kind of like, it's okay now, you're safe now, you're safe here with me. And then see what happens to it, with this kind of helping the fear feel safe practice. So thank you, and now with that as a foundation, I look forward to what we'll be doing the next couple of days. Thank you.
