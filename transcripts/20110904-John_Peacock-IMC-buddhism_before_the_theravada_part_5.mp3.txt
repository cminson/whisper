I'm on my leash again. 
No, I think I'll be alright. 
Okay, good to see you all again. 
Before I start picking up on dependent origination, which is where we finished off yesterday, and I'll do a little bit of recapping, certainly for anybody who's new to today. 
So I'm going to start off with a couple of quotations. 
Might surprise you where they come from, but let me give you these quotations. 
Look another lives beside your own. 
See what their troubles are and how they are born. 
Try to care about something in this vast world besides the gratification of your small selfish desires. 
Try to care for what is best in thought and action. 
Something that is good apart from the accidents of your own lot. 
Try to care for what is best in thought and action. 
Try to care for what is best in thought and action. 
Something that is good apart from the accidents of your own lot. 
The second quote is this. 
The creature we help to save, though only a half-reared limit, bruised and lost by the wayside. 
How we watch and fence it and dot on its signs of recovery. 
Our pride becomes loving. 
Our self becomes a not-self. 
For whose sake we become virtuous when we set to some hidden work of reclaiming a life from misery. 
And look simply for our triumph in the secret joy. 
This one is better for me. 
That's not Buddhist at all. 
It comes from George Elliott out of a novel called Daniel de Ronda. 
Which if you haven't read it, I would recommend. 
She did have Buddhist influences by the way as you probably gathered in some of that. 
Okay, to pick up on dependent origination. 
Well, okay, let me try and recap a little bit. 
Just to kind of set the scene again. 
Dependent origination, the Buddha's most profound teaching, I think. 
Even in the developments of later traditions as we see them coming along really in many ways they don't in a sense surpass what the Buddha has to say about dependent origination in the early texts. 
In many ways, even things like the Tibetan obsession with emptiness is nothing other than an extrapolation of some aspects which are already there within the notion of dependent origination as we find it in these early Pali Nikayas. 
So we've got within the Pali Nikayas a perfect description of the mess. 
The Sangsaric mess or the Sangsara-ing mess bearing in mind it's a verb form. 
If you like, we're engaged in this little activity called Sangsara-ing. 
Rather there being in a place called Sangsara. 
So we very much have to bear in mind this is an activity and although I didn't mention it yesterday, perhaps I'll mention it this time, in many ways the notion of dependent origination covers everything as far as the Buddha is concerned. 
Nothing arises out of nothing. 
There is no, if you like, first cause which isn't caused by something else. 
Everything is caused. 
Now the classic generalized formula of dependent origination at the Buddha speaks about, I'm just going to paraphrase it, is this happens, this happens. 
This ceases to happen, this ceases to happen. 
Now often it's translated as this occurs, that occurs, that ceases to occur, this ceases to occur. 
But actually even that's a bit too linear. 
It's actually this, this, this, this in both of these cases. 
But this is the generalized formula. 
This covers everything. 
When the causes and conditions which sustain a particular phenomena cease to be, that phenomena ceases to be. 
And in many ways, this is a nice little recipe for getting out of Sangsara, or out of Sangsara-ing activity. 
Because if there are causes and conditions which uphold Sangsara-ing activity if we actually eliminate those causes this edifice, this state of being that we're calling Sangsara or I'm calling Sangsara-ing that will cease to be. 
Hence this is a big big extrapolation of the second of the ennobling truths. 
What is known as Samudya, or there is an origin, or something which supports, the actual word Samudya means something which supports Dukkha, actually supports its arising. 
And well we all know because we're going to come round to this in the links of dependent origination, that the Buddha's proximate cause for the upholding or the arising of Dukkha is Tanha. 
And this is a word which we'll speak quite a bit about, but all I want to say really very briefly about this at this stage, is that the word Tanha in Pali possesses enormous pathos about the human condition, which you simply don't get in the word craving when we translate it into English. 
If this is a description of the human condition that it is dominated absolutely pervaded by Tanha, it's pretty sad. 
It's a pretty sad condition to be in. 
Now I don't want to make you miserable by saying that, but I just want to point that out because we don't capture that in the English forever when we translate it as craving or desire, which is often another alternative translation for this. 
Something else which I didn't say yesterday, and I also want to say today, the model that I'm working with here on dependent origination is very much of 12 links all occurring in one moment. 
Now I say that because many of you will know the more I make Tera Vahd in description of dependent origination as being spread over three lifetimes. 
This is Buddha-Gosa's model that you'll find in the Visuddha Marga. 
This has, for example, Bikku Buddha Dasa who's probably one of my few Tera Vahdian heroes actually saying that actually Buddha-Gosa in saying it's spread over three lifetimes is basically a closet Hindu. 
He just can't throw off the idea of something being passed around through different lifetimes rather than this being a dynamic description of the way everything is occurring in the moment. 
Now I'm one of these sad people that toy around with Pali translations at times and spend hours thinking about possible ways of translating terms. 
Although dependent origination is very accurate as a term sometimes it fails to capture what's going on. 
One, I don't use it but I just want to share it with you because I think it's quite useful. 
One possible way of translating it would be situational patterning. 
The way every situation and every moment is patterned. 
So actually things take up a particular patterning in your life moment to moment if something is not done by about it because in a sense there is always something carrying over into the next moment. 
We started looking at this yesterday by thinking of confusion. 
A Vijja, this term that was written up on the board. 
A Vijja is, well the word Vijja where's my pens? The word Vijja is actually related to well this is the Pali and this is the Sanskrit Vijja and actually both of them derive from that word, the word Veda, which means knowledge. 
So literally the word Avidja, when we prefix it like this means non-knowledge. 
What we don't possess. 
And I was suggesting to you yesterday however that it's not simply about lack of the requisite information and I was suggesting also yesterday that you probably have sat here and listened to numerous Dharma talks. 
Actually you should all be awakened by now. 
You've got all the knowledge. 
So in a way we're not talking about, are we, the collecting of some kind of information and knowledge that we supposedly need. 
We have the knowledge but we still don't do anything about it. 
This is the situation. 
So again just reminding you because before we move on that I was saying that this is to do with actually the other dimension of this term, Vijja and Avidja is not knowing but not wanting to know. 
And I mean that on a very fundamental existential level. 
It's pretty painful. 
A lot of what's being spoken about. 
The fact that existence is characterized by impermanence, dukkha and not self. 
That is what existence is characterized. 
I said this yesterday it doesn't get any better than that. 
You know how much wishful thinking we might have it simply doesn't get any better. 
There is impermanence. 
Impermanence is written into that warp of life. 
It's there. 
It's there in our fleeting moments of the evanescence of our mental processes to the world around us that we see changing both sociologically, economically, politically and the world itself is changing. 
There is nothing that is remaining the same. 
It is painful. 
In other words it's dukkha. 
And I was suggesting that the part of it yesterday was that actually because the world is this way it's structurally incapable of ever providing you with ultimate satisfaction. 
If you're looking externally for the world to produce and to provide you with a sense of security, certainty and satisfaction you're onto a bit of a loser. 
It simply ain't going to happen. 
So what the Buddha is really in very much in particular in the early text is suggesting that this has to come from within. 
Instead of looking without to provide you with the certainties and the satisfactions, the only certainties and satisfactions can come from the way that in the sense we process the material. 
What comes to us? However it comes to us be that painful instances or joyful instances. 
In other words we learn not to get into this reactive patterning of simply pushing away what we don't like and trying to grasp hold of what we like and stabilize it and make it certain. 
So we live, but I'm going to use deliberately this term today and I didn't use it very so much yesterday, we live with some degree of wisdom in this world knowing that actually whether it is aversive or whether out of the state is aversion and unpleasantness or even whether it's pleasant it will change. 
It will change. 
And again I will say to you this is not to make you miserable, it's just to in a sense to bring you into the realism of the way things are. 
Now if we don't live with that realism we're always chasing chimeras, we're always chasing illusions. 
We're always chasing phantoms which are simply not going to be there. 
And I think perhaps I ought to say this at this stage because it connects in many ways with the title. 
What I think that the religious traditions have done including the traditions that have grown up on the back of the Buddha's original teaching is they seek to provide you with a degree of consolation. 
A degree of certainties. 
I don't think the Buddha is doing that. 
I don't think the Buddha is into cheap certainties. 
He's not into cheap consolations. 
Just to remind you of those final words which I said that the Buddha quoted in the Mahaparana Bhanasata, absolutely all phenomena are impermanent, now get on with it. 
This is basically what he's saying. 
Because that is the reality of the situation. 
That is what we have to deal with in our daily lives. 
The certainties, if you like, the certainties are of old age, sickness and death. 
Those are the certainties if you want them. 
When I lived in Tibetan society there was used to be saying this in Tibetan society. 
There is one thing absolutely certain, death. 
One thing that's absolutely uncertain when, and then they'd usually fall around laughing. 
So it doesn't have to make you po-faced about this at all, or deathly serious about it. 
But it's taking on board that those are the realities. 
The only peace, tranquility, happiness and contentment that we can find is something that's generated from within not from without. 
When we live our world from within, but we've connected with others, and this in a sense is going to be the theme of what I want to talk about tomorrow, with metha, those boundless friendliness. 
Then we can find and we can seek for the tranquility that we don't find when we externalize and always look for others and for circumstances to make you happy or content. 
If you really want to know what the death knell of a relationship is, you do, don't you? That's what you're supposed to say, yes. 
If you want to know what the death knell of a relationship is, in a sense, make me happy. 
That's like giving somebody an impossible task, an impossible burden. 
Happiness can be generated out or contentment can be generated out of a relationship, but it's not by the demand of making somebody the cause of your happiness. 
That in a sense kills or stultifies a relationship. 
There's another instance of Mara, the killer, coming in. 
These are kind of background remarks to get us back in. 
We have an awful lot of knowledge. 
I often feel, apart from a lot of technical material that I present in talks like this, that I'm not telling you something you don't know. 
I'm not really telling you something you don't know. 
What we don't know, in a sense, is how to practice it. 
That's the key to it, of actually how to practice it. 
This is a pragmatic path. 
The Buddha is not doing this out of intellectual curiosity. 
I will really make that point. 
There is nothing I have ever discerned in a Pali canon which is there for merely intellectual curiosity. 
It's there because it's a practical teaching. 
Something that we can live, something that can actually change our lives. 
I was often saying in the UK to my students in the UK, actually this practice ought to come with a government health warning. 
This practice could severely change your life. 
It's meant to. 
That's exactly what it's meant to. 
It could actually change your life. 
But it takes time and it takes patience. 
It takes the ability to open too often the painful in life. 
The painful is going to come to us anyway. 
We can live in houses constructed on sand but at some point in time the walls are going to fall down. 
No matter how solid the edifice you think is, it's going to fall down because it's based on something which is not solid, it's not secure. 
We can attempt to put a bay the painful in life but it will always erupt through at some point. 
Often unfortunately in things like tragedy in our lives. 
The loss of a loved one. 
This can disrupt whole lives. 
Now in a way what we're doing is trying to understand how we can deal even with those most painful situations which will come to us without turning it into what I call samsaric hell. 
Because that's what it can become so easily. 
Now we'll see that later in the chain because that's to do with craving and grasping. 
Craving and grasping and holding on in a particular way. 
So we start, this is the background, this is the floor, this is the carpet to your experience, a vidya. 
Confusion, trying to make sense of the world. 
Now as I was saying yesterday I do really really want to emphasise this because I think it's such an important point. 
In the West we live with guilt so much of the time. 
Guilt is a huge part. 
So when we start to say actually well the precursor of all this and the reason why you're in this state in a sense is take the most pejorative way of translating this term of vidya, ignorance. 
Then somehow it's your fault. 
No it isn't. 
It's not your fault. 
Unfortunately our conditioning doesn't give us the tools often to be able to cope with life. 
So we go through life trying to do our best. 
Trying to cope with things as they arise but not having the full tools or the full range of skills. 
Perhaps that's a better word. 
The full range of skills to be able to deal with things. 
So I tend to use the word confusion. 
Confusion often isn't under your control. 
So let's take the pejorative sting out of this all together. 
Something about that word guilt. 
This is a particular Judaic Christian thought. 
The notion of guilt. 
You will not find one Asian language other than when they've translated guilt into an Asian language or try to make it up in some way. 
You certainly won't find it in any of the canonical languages of Buddhism. 
You won't find a word for guilt. 
You'll find words for shame but you won't find words for guilt. 
And there's a big difference between the two. 
So this is in a sense our starting place but it isn't the starting place because it isn't the first cause. 
It's the background to our experience is a vision. 
This is the most deeply rooted problematic aspect of our experience which in some senses can only be eradicated when we deal with the most proximate causes. 
It's the most proximate manifestations in our ordinary life which we'll see as we come later around the links, the dependent links as they manifest. 
Now according to the dependencies, the chain of dependencies what is arising next is the Sankharas. 
This is where we finished off yesterday on the Sankharas. 
The Sankharas are of course the volitions, the volitional formations. 
These are, as I was saying, I'm not going to go into too much more detail about these, but these are being formed, something we're actively engaging in through acts of intention and acts of will. 
Now I didn't mention this yesterday, but they are being formed by Chetana, by intention. 
So in many ways a lot of our practice is about beginning to discern, and this is not always easy, what our intentions are. 
Some of those intentions will be using a kind of more Freudian language, unconscious, when they're not immediately perspicable. 
We don't immediately have access into what our intentions are. 
So we're uncovering our intentions behind our actions. 
Now the moment we get into talking about intention, we get we open ourselves up to the minefield of what I call karma. 
I say minefield because this is one of the most misinterpreted words. 
I'll put the Sanskrit first, because this is the word that we normally use. 
The Pali is the second version. 
Karma. 
Well, I say it's the most misinterpreted word. 
It's a very simple word in Pali and Sanskrit. 
It simply means action. 
That's all it means. 
Yet when you think of the layers of metaphysics that get laid on this term, particularly in Hinduism, where it becomes a fatalistic notion within a lot of the cruder forms of Hinduism, not within all forms, where it becomes something which you cannot do anything about. 
And having lived in India quite a number of years, I hear people going, it's my karma. 
And that's passed into our language too, hasn't it? It's very much passed into it. 
It basically means I can't do anything about it. 
It's my karma. 
End of story, almost. 
Now, that's not the Buddha's notion of karma. 
In fact, the proper way of looking at this, and this is where it's much more detailed out, is what's known as karma vipaka, or karma vipaka. 
Let me write this other term. 
Now, that's very simply if you take this literally, action and consequence. 
Or action and fruit, because there's another word that's used as well, which is pala, the fruit of an action. 
Now, the Buddha, living in the time he did, as I was suggesting and kind of sharing with you yesterday, lived in a very agrarian society. 
So he often used the word pala, things fruit. 
And just if you've got an orchard of all different kinds of trees, some peach trees, some apricots, some apple trees, some pear trees, they all have different times of fruiting. 
And if they're young trees, they might not fruit for a considerable amount of time. 
Whereas if they're older trees, they might fruit quite quickly. 
But they're all fruiting at different times. 
And this is the kind of model he's using for how actually actions produce consequences. 
They have different fruiting times in our lives. 
Some of them, for example, do not catch up with us until many, many, many years later. 
I'm not even going to even talk about lifetimes models here. 
Because I don't think that's what's intended at all. 
You're talking about the fruits of your actions. 
Some of them will catch up with you immediately. 
And some of them will catch up with you many years later. 
That is the model he's doing. 
And Buddha is basically saying actually we live in this world creating sankharas because we can't avoid acting. 
Even if I don't act, that's an act. 
In Western philosophical theory we have something called the doctrine of acts and omissions. 
So omitting to act is also an act. 
So here we live in this world where we can't help but act. 
Now we're in the world, we're not sitting up in caves in Himalaya. 
But even sitting up in a cave in the Himalaya is an action. 
Which will have consequences. 
And will have fruits to it. 
We live in this world which has consequences and it has fruits which are related to our actions of thought word and deed. 
Body, speech and mind is the classic formulation of this in most forms of Buddhism. 
So we're acting body, speech, mind. 
But the intentions are generated in the mind. 
Now here's an interesting thing. 
The Buddha is also saying try to, if you like, clean up your intentions but don't be attached to the fruit of them. 
It's very interesting because often if we think we have a good intention you want to see it fulfilled. 
When you give that present to somebody you want to say oh I really like that. 
Or if you do a good deed for somebody you expect them perhaps to be grateful for it. 
In other words you're looking for a consequence. 
You're looking for a particular fruit. 
Now those are very simple examples. 
But actually the world we live in is a complex nexus of causes and conditions. 
So even if we have the best intention it won't always give rise to the fruit that we may want. 
Often good intentions end up with not the consequences we want. 
But if you like what we're talking about in terms of the karma or the vipakka the real consequence is in relationship to your mind. 
That's the real consequence about it. 
It's not just attached to what occurs because of the action. 
So if your intention is clean, if your intention is wholesome then it has a positive effect on the mind. 
So it's not about actually getting everything you want through oh my intentions are really good and I'm really doing my best here. 
But I'm still not getting the results. 
Actually the results are in the mind not in the external situations. 
Because the external situations are often so complex that you don't get necessarily the consequence that you wish for. 
Now that's a long way of coming back to talking about sankharas. 
Because we're actually engaged in this stuff all the time we're actually engaged in it every moment. 
Our intentions are there rapidly. 
Very important part of just doing sitting practice. 
Good place to start is actually examining your intentions. 
What's your intention behind your practice? Does actually, when I briefly led that meditation in the morning and gave you a few instructions, does your intention coincide with your bodily posture? For example, if I'm meditating and my posture is like this, does that actually coincide with the intention to stay awake and alert? Attentive to what is happening? It doesn't. 
So actually we embody intentions as well. 
So intention is a bodily thing. 
It's not just something going on in the mind, but it's reflected in the body itself. 
I'm sorry to interrupt. 
Would you say that the ultimate goal of vipassana practice is to discern the links of dependent origination experientially? That's part of it. 
It's not the totality of it. 
Part of it is in understanding in understanding dependent origination you understand, as I say, the mess but you also begin to understand the way of getting out of that mess. 
Ultimately, of course, and this is something I was referring to yesterday the goal, I think, of the meditation practices that we gauge in, as far as I can discern out of the early text, is very much the attainment of upekha. 
The attainment of poise, balance and equanimity in this life. 
That is, in a sense, the nibbana-ing experience, to have this poise and balance in life, to have a degree of responsiveness or total responsiveness as opposed to reactiveness in life. 
Now, I say that because I think all too often the way the tradition reads things like nibbana and the goal of vipassana practice, we have big words that get attached to it, particularly when they're mistranslated. 
Now, for example, we have this word panya in Pali, which is usually translated as wisdom. 
This is the goal of all practices to the attainment of panya, the attainment of wisdom. 
Well, it's a bad translation. 
The goal, if we even see it in terms of panya, is the goal of understanding, the goal of insight. 
The insight is into the three characteristics of existence. 
That's part of the insight, but having insight into the three characteristics of existence is also meant to leave to equanimity, because that's the insightful way of living with the really understanding of this. 
That's my phrase, the getting on with it. 
Strive on diligently is the actual more light way of putting it, but it's really how do you live with that understanding? Now, normally in our ordinary average everyday lives, we don't live with that understanding, because we're trying to avoid those facets of things. 
We actually don't want to know. 
This is part of the Avijigan. 
We don't want to know about the impermanence, really. 
We don't want to know about this lack of any fixed self within. 
And we certainly don't want to know about dukkha. 
Dukkha is a very unpleasant facet of reality. 
So, it's in the sense of understanding those and really beginning to have insight into those, how do I then live with them? And that's the insight that generates upekha. 
That generates, well, not just upekha, it actually generates all the brahmavaras. 
It generates the ground or the soil of water. 
Now, in the traditions, and I'll say much more about this for those who come tomorrow, metta has been sidelined. 
It's kind of a subsidiary practice. 
I see it as being much more central to what the Buddha is actually teaching. 
In fact, I think any practice without metta involved in it in some way is actually extremely cold. 
It's simply tied into an ideal of wisdom. 
And it's a kind of cold almost slightly brutal wisdom at that. 
So, there's a softness and gentleness that comes with the development of metta. 
And that is part of it as well, because metta is in a sense, I don't translate it as loving kindness, I translate it as boundless friendliness. 
A boundless friendliness. 
Well, if it's boundless it spreads out. 
Literally, one of the etymologies of the word metta means to get fat. 
It means to grow fat. 
It means to grow fat with friendliness. 
And those are activities. 
So, when we say the goal, the goal of understanding all of this, the goal of understanding this is really some of those things I've just mentioned as well. 
It's a big project in a way, rather than just a simple one. 
The nibbanaing experience includes all of those things, but it also includes primarily, of course, the cessation of greed, aversion and delusion. 
Or infatuation, aversion and confusion. 
Put it in a much more way, I think, which is really much more how we experience those things. 
Sorry, long answers, short question again. 
Sorry. 
I have a confused understanding depending on our origination. 
Yes, it is. 
Can you hear me now? Oh, okay. 
So, you're talking about understanding impermanence and confusion, not self. 
But also, then you're saying, you also need to experience those at a profound level, otherwise they remain intellectual. 
But I can experience, say, impermanence and somehow maybe subtly or not so subtly thwart that and decide, well, my nose at it in some way and go for something that will cause suffering anyway. 
And so, I'm wondering if then, if not the ultimate, but one step is experiencing the suffering. 
The ultimate not wanting to know is not wanting to know that I'm suffering because of it. 
And then the meta comes into that too, because if I can really get suffering, then I can get that you are suffering too. 
Yeah, that's very much what it's about. 
It's very much. 
I mean, I explore this a lot more tomorrow. 
But that's very much what it's about because it's actually jumping ahead into Mahayana Buddhism. 
I mean, there's this figure within Mahayana Buddhism called Shantideva. 
And some of you might know his famous text, the Buddha Charavattara. 
In this particular text, he's saying this is exactly what it's about. 
It's beginning to gain empathy with others. 
So in one particular passage, he says it makes no sense to talk about my dukkha or your dukkha, but only about dukkha. 
So we take the personal out of it, stop personalising it. 
One of the aspects, and we have such a short time over these few days, but one of the other aspects of this is actually everything that occurs to us we take so personally. 
Have you noticed that? We personalise everything. 
It's almost like any suffering that occurs is, why have I been picked out? I mean, the alternative to that is why not? But we take it so, so personally, every event that occurs to us, and then that becomes something that we then proliferate or obsess around once we've taken it personally. 
Once we've added in a sense the first person pronoun into our experience, that's become really personal. 
If I can see this, actually there's a lot of this as an impersonal process. 
As an impersonal process, then I am not affected. 
I start to add I, what I call the Royal Inus, into this at quite an early stage. 
Yet as we go through the links we'll see that the links in this are pretty impersonal, up to a point. 
And then it becomes personal. 
Now we haven't got there yet, but I'll get there as we move on about this. 
But yes, this movement out into meta I think is absolutely fundamental movement in the process of this, because actually this is why I say once we even begin to understand Tanta, once we begin to understand the pathos behind the way that we generate pain and further confusion for ourselves, then what can that lead to? Simply friendliness towards it, kindness towards it, gentleness towards it, rather than the kind of castigation that we put ourselves through a lot of the time about it. 
Now none of this, and I go back slightly off your question but none of this is meant to lead you into a position of saying it's my fault. 
Or beating yourself up even further about it. 
Because that's not what it's about. 
It's actually owning up initially to our dukkha. 
That's what it is. 
The only place we can start with is our dukkha, the way that we pattern things at this moment. 
This gives us a clue to that patterning. 
We own up literally to who we are, which includes all of the foibles and the things that we do and the unhappinesses, but the happinesses too within our lives, so it begins to become a full appreciation and acknowledgement of where you are in order to move in some direction. 
Now unless you do that unless there's this kind of owning up process, this acknowledgement process there can't be that movement. 
Because it's not held with kindness. 
And actually I mean one of the things that struck me, I know we're slightly off the point here, but I think it's important to say, one of the things that struck most Eastern teachers about coming to the West, and those who've been brought up in the West and educated in the West and everything, is just how tough we are in ourselves. 
How cruel we can become to ourselves. 
In Eastern traditions, for example, when I was doing metapractice in Sri Lanka, metapractice for yourself was actually fairly small, because most Sri Lankans don't actually have a problem with themselves. 
And in same in Tibetan communities. 
I mean the amount of Tibetans are always telling me how good they were at things. 
They never had a problem with kind of owning up to how they were. 
But in our societies we're not like that. 
We have this kind of big guilt ways of beating ourselves up and actually sometimes the practice itself can be another way of beating ourselves up. 
Of not being perfect at this as well. 
So I think it's important to say that because often we do a Sri Lankan meditation friend of mine once said, he said, when Western people get meditation they make their lives even more miserable. 
Simply because you try to strive for a perfection which isn't really based on the understanding of how you operate. 
What's actually going on now for you. 
And so this is that, this understanding together with metta, helps to soften the kind of more, I would say more realistic, quite painful elements that you see when you begin to look at this operating within yourself. 
When you begin to see, particularly some of the operating within yourself, we need to see dependent origination there. 
Now let's get back to sankharas because I know I'm going to not get finished otherwise you'll be left with wanting to know who did it. 
So the sankharas, so karama is a vipakka actively involved in sankharas fruits. 
Now doing things often enough will produce, if you like, as I said yesterday basically roots that your mind will run down. 
Ways of dealing with problems, ways of being with people. 
These are sankharas. 
They're also narratives about who you are. 
It's almost as if you believe that the sankharas are you. 
All of these dispositions these things that you've built up over the years, your particular proclivities and ways of dealing with phenomena as they arise and situations as they arise, you believe that they are you. 
And you tend to attach yourself to this understanding that you are this particular type of person. 
It comes deeply ingrained, doesn't it? You've only got to think of this, for example, in some translation I suggested yesterday of this, making it a slightly banal is actually habits. 
Now if you want to know how much habits are so much considered to be part of our identity, I don't know if you've had this experience, when somebody challenges one of them. 
Don't you feel hurt? Yeah? If somebody challenges you something, somebody says to you, you've got this rather irritating habit, you know, of doing this. 
And you go, well that's me. 
That's the way I am. 
You get very defensive. 
The moment you see that, you might see how identified we are with habitual formations that we've built up for ourselves. 
Over the course of our lifetime. 
You want to go into traditional kind of more taravadan Buddhist view, but it's over lifetimes. 
But it makes sense to get over this lifetime. 
You spent the whole of your lifetime building up habits. 
Ways of dealing with things. 
This is part of the reason why that we get the same stuff repeating in very similar patterns again and again and again. 
Because we're dealing with them pretty well in the same way. 
The other way of seeing sankharas, it's not the way the Buddha necessarily talks about it, but it's implied in the way that it's detailed out, certainly in Abhidharma material. 
Is that these are kind of narrative structures that we inhabit as well. 
They are the stories that we tell ourselves about ourselves. 
Now, in one particular, I mentioned this novelist yesterday to some of you who were here, which is this novelist Jeanette Winterson. 
There's a particular book that she wrote. 
Some of you might have even read. 
It's called The Passion. 
It's a magical realist novel. 
And in this book, and all these strange things are happening, like people walking on water and doing all sorts of weird stuff. 
But every time something weird happens, there's this little refrain that runs through it. 
It says, trust me, I'm telling you stories. 
Jeanette Winterson. 
And I almost feel this is about the sankharas. 
The sankharas are going to, trust me, I'm telling you stories. 
Now, I'm kind of psychologizing in a certain way here, which isn't necessarily within the text. 
But that is what's implied by this. 
These are patterns that we identify with and we identify them because they're telling stories that we've inhabited for long times. 
For long periods of times that we think this is who we are. 
And the most immediate, let me get rid of some of this relationship that sankharas have is with the next link in the chain. 
One, two, three. 
So this is your third link in the chain. 
Vinyana. 
Cognizance. 
Consciousness and thinking. 
Well, what's the thinking going on? Well, the thinking that's going on is because it's in direct relationship with the sankharas. 
Remember that the image that's being used here in dependent origination is of dependency. 
Not that this is causing that, but these two things exist in a relationship of dependency. 
The one depends on the other. 
So most of these point in both directions. 
It's not as if you can say, well, this is occurring, then this is occurring, then this is occurring. 
These are absolutely dynamically interlinked. 
This is a process, it's not a linear kind of march from a vidya all the way to Jaramarana, which is old age and death. 
These are all intricately interlinked and creating chains of dependencies. 
None more so in the relationship between sankhara and vinyana. 
Between consciousness or cognizance and what is going on in thought here. 
Now, in our experience you can't divorce the two. 
You cannot divorce consciousness from what you're thinking about or what you're aware of. 
That's the intimate relationship between the two. 
So much so that one of the early discoveries of the Buddha was that all consciousness, all consciousness is what he calls intentional. 
This is not the way I was using it earlier on. 
It's very much a philosophical way of using it. 
All consciousness has an object. 
There is never consciousness without an object. 
Again, with the risk of boring you, this is partly in relationship to what was going on in Indian culture at the time. 
Because the composers of the Upanishads were always talking about pure consciousness. 
They talked about artmen as being pure consciousness or Brahman as being pure consciousness. 
This is one of the things that I spoke about. 
The Buddha is saying there is no consciousness without being conscious of. 
Isn't there a text in the canon where the Buddha asks the bhikkhus that he uses the family of light falling on the floor and he says if there's no floor and the light didn't fall on anything they said there's also a type of consciousness that does not fall on anything. 
Then at the end he says that type of consciousness is without dukkha. 
Yeah, as far as I remember, there's only one citation of that in the whole of the canon. 
Which tends to make me think it's again an interpolation. 
Something that's been inserted in the canon. 
I haven't talked about this so far but something I think that goes on in the history of the formation of the canon because remember it doesn't all come together at once, is that you start to get Brahmanical remains, start to be placed into the canon again. 
And that's not accidental simply because a lot of the early converts of Buddhism were Brahmins itself. 
And so my response to a passage like that is not to desperately trying to make sense of it in comparison with all the texts that are saying actually every form of consciousness has an object, is actually probably to see it as an anomaly that's been inserted at some point into the canon. 
Now without going into lots of textual examination of it, I couldn't give you a direct answer about that but I do think it's an anomaly within the canon. 
Yet, and I will say this, many traditions, particularly later than the early texts, will go down exactly that route. 
Exactly that route. 
I mean when you've got these traditions, for example some of the Zen traditions and some of the particular Tibetan traditions like Zogchen and Mahamudra, all of these are talking about pristine forms of consciousness with no object. 
So they're coming out very, very similar. 
Even Yogachara, Chittamatra schools which are very influential in China and the development of Zen, they're all talking about that. 
But that's a much later development. 
This is why I think this is more radical. 
Why I think these early texts are much more radical than the later traditions. 
So a kind of response to your question rather than a direct answer. 
I had a conversation with another Pali scholar a long time ago about the origins of that word, Winyana. 
I've been playing with it, that we is like something about separating or something like that. 
Yeah, divided knowing. 
Yeah, so it's sort of like, is it sort of, would it be unfair to understand it as sort of the act or the mind of picking out something? Yeah, it is, exactly that. 
I mean, there's a bit of Pali for you. 
Anything that has that formulation in it, anything that has that formulation, Janya, Panya, Sanya, all to do with knowing. 
Anything you see with that formulation in Pali is always to do with knowing. 
This is the divisive bit. 
That is dividing it simply up into consciousness and an object. 
So when we're conscious of something, we're conscious of an object. 
So in a sense, there's two, there's a kind of diversive aspect to it. 
Are you saying the we is the consciousness part or the. 
. 
. 
You can't do it as simply as that. 
What's the root meaning of that we as it occurs elsewhere? Well, it's actually a dividing. 
It's saying there is a dividing of consciousness between an object and the consciousness itself that perceives the object. 
That's really what it's saying. 
And you can't say anything other than simply. 
My simple way of putting this is that consciousness is always a consciousness of. 
So it's like saying, if I'm conscious, can I actually be conscious without being conscious of something, even that I'm conscious. 
It's self, so it's always reflexive. 
There's always a reflexive movement within it here. 
And this actually is quite remarkable. 
I don't know how much you know about the history of philosophy in general. 
This thought, which is there in the early Nakayas, that consciousness is always consciousness of, in Western philosophical thinking this doesn't actually even get on the agenda till the late 19th century. 
It's that far after. 
It's nearly 2,400 years after the Buddha's death. 
And it's somebody called Franz Brantano. 
Franz Brantano. 
And through his work with his disciple Edmund Hussle, they founded a whole movement of phenomenology, which was exactly about this. 
Consciousness in its acts. 
And the objects that it had within it. 
But it's quite remarkable that the Buddha already had discerned this at such an early period. 
A couple of questions. 
One is how early in Buddhism does the Pali Canon get so vast? And how early in Buddhism does it develop into these many different schools of thought? That's a big question. 
If you don't mind a simple answer. 
I'd like a simple answer. 
But it's a vast question. 
Well, as we know, I had thought about trying to get a photo copy for you, but there is, I mean I divided a little thing and showing you how the Buddhist schools Well, it may help you if I tell you why I'm asking you because it used to be believed until about 50 years ago that early Christianity had fairly uniform ideas when it was a small movement. 
And now that consensus has changed. 
Now it's widely believed that early Christianity, even in the first century, had many, many diverse schools of thought with each one with slightly different sets of holy books and something. 
So that's been a big shift. 
I'm curious of what the comparable Okay, let's give you a very simple answer. 
I won't go into the technicalities of what's going on. 
Basically what happens is you get a number of councils. 
The only thing that all the traditions can agree upon that there were such councils that occurred after the Buddha's death. 
The first one occurred almost immediately after the Buddha's death. 
The second one about 100 years later. 
And at that point you get the splitting of the Sangha. 
You get a schism occurring. 
But not a schism on doctrine, a schism on vinnia, on the discipline. 
Now strictly speaking that's the only way schism can occur in Buddhist groups. 
It can't occur on matters of doctrine because it's not supposed to be orthodox here. 
So basically it was very pragmatic about can I live with you if you've got a different set of rules to me? For example one group might say well we're not going to eat after lunch and the other group will say hey I want an evening meal. 
It was literally as practical as that. 
This is why you got the first split within the schools. 
And this is the split between what's called the Mahasangika which literally means the big Sangha. 
And the Astiravada which is the precursor of what becomes the Terravada in Sri Lanka. 
At this particular point. 
Now the Astiravada are a bit po-faced and wanted to really really hold to minute points of doctrine. 
And minute points of vinnia, particularly the vinnia very closely. 
And so they split off from the main Sangha. 
And then after that almost like cellular splitting this started to occur many many splits on vinnia within the schools. 
So by approximately 300 years after the Buddha's death you're talking about a minimum of 18 schools. 
And this correlates with the great expansion of the Pali Canon as a collection? The Pali Canon was probably the formation of the Pali Canon as far as we understand it from a scholarly point of view started within the Buddha's lifetime including the formation of the Abhidhamma as well. 
They all started in the Buddha's lifetime. 
Basically remembering and memorizing what was being said. 
The Canon itself probably isn't closed even after it's written down until into the early eras of the Christian eras. 
And finally you said yesterday that there was also in addition to the emphasis on joy and you said it's one of the seven signs of something. 
Worth as one of the seven factors of awakening. 
Seven factors. 
And that's part of the original Buddha. 
Okay, that's all. 
It's a good note to finish on that one. 
There is joy within the Canon. 
What do you mean? PT? No, no. 
Within the seven factors of awakening it's PT. 
But not as it's associated within the Jhana factors. 
It's not the same PT. 
No, it's not samanasa, it's not domanasa. 
It's very different because it has a different connotation. 
It's that which is if you like the energy within the process that's required for awakening to occur. 
And so it's a joyful nature that arises but together with things like tranquility and mindfulness and all of these other factors that are there. 
So the reason I'm trying to say that because it's very emphasized in Jhana practice, the development of PT as being a product of the second Jhana and everything else together with Sukha which is coming later. 
And these are viewed quite differently. 
Now I don't think that's what the Buddha is talking about when he's talking about it as being part of the seven factors of awakening. 
He's talking about something I think far more fundamental and not associated simply with Jhana states. 
It's PT. 
It's the same word. 
But PT has a number of different meanings. 
This is very quick. 
Then we must move on because otherwise we're going to get bogged down. 
You're saying the radical of the Buddha is that consciousness cannot have anything that doesn't arise without an object. 
That's right. 
And yet I've been fooled to think that you can have awareness of awareness of consciousness of consciousness and therefore that's more of a higher practice. 
But I fooled myself. 
I did. 
These get into meditative states which I don't think really the Buddha is talking about as being liberative states. 
That's really what I think from my reading of the canon. 
I do emphasize it's my reading of the particular way I read the canon is that when the Buddha is talking about having genuine insight, their insight to what is arising when consciousness in the world arises together. 
Now consciousness doesn't rise alone. 
This gets much more detailed in terms of Abhidharma. 
When we talk about mind as such, we're actually talking about chitta and chitasakas. 
What we're talking is mind and mental factors or consciousness and mental factors always arising together. 
And these are what colour the world. 
Now in every moment of perception there's a minimum of seven different chitasakas arising with every moment of perception. 
That is, seven minimal mental factors arising. 
Then there are all the wholesome and unwholesome factors that also arise with it, which colour what we see as the object. 
So it's actually quite a complex picture that's going on here. 
And the Abhidharma goes into a lot of detail, I'm not going to speak about it, but the Abhidharma goes into a lot of detail about this. 
But actually it's an aid to meditation, not merely as an intellectual tool. 
It's an aid to meditation of actually beginning to discern what goes along. 
I think from our point of view, I don't usually like Buddha ghosts, but I actually like this particular phrase of him. 
He says, you know, you have to see that consciousness is like a king. 
It never arrives without a huge retinue. 
It always comes with an enormous retinue of other stuff there. 
So this is what's going on in vinyanas as well, because vinyana and chita, these are kind of synonymous. 
It's arising with a whole load of stuff for sankharas. 
What I'm referring to as mental factors are actually sankharas. 
These are, you know, all the wholesome and unwholesome factors that we bring to experience and create the narrative structures that we live within. 
And this is occurring again, and again, and again, and again. 
And it's discerning that process, beginning to discern that process. 
Well, I think you can see that in kind of work I do in Oxford. 
I mean, when we talk about mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, one of the things we say to clients is, suddenly you find that your mind has got a mind of its own. 
You know, because that's exactly, and this is just a common meditation thing, isn't it? When we're doing meditation, when you try to focus on your breath, well, your mind doesn't want to know about that. 
It goes off and does something else. 
It goes off and plays with something else. 
You know, breath, that's boring. 
Let's get out of here. 
Let's go off and do something else. 
So, you suddenly find that your mind isn't as much under your control as you think it is. 
You think it would be a really easy thing. 
Well, just focus on this. 
No way. 
What's the go and often do something else? So, it is actually not under our control. 
So, what we're learning to do in a lot of the early stages is develop a degree of control. 
This is why the image is often used is of training an elephant. 
And what they do is when they train an elephant, they still do this in Sri Lanka, they tie it to a peg in the ground and what does the elephant do? It pulls and it tugs and it tries to pull the post out the ground and run away and do all the sorts of things. 
That's a really good metaphor for the mind. 
You know, and eventually it gets the point that it can't run away and it settles down. 
Now you can start to train the elephant. 
So, I think it's quite a good image, that particular image. 
But in the early stages what you're finding is it's not really under your control. 
Any sense of control is quite spurious a lot of the time. 
Okay, I'm going to move on because otherwise you won't find out who did it. 
So, Vinyana. 
Well, Vinyana itself, of course, isn't just arising on its own. 
It's dependent on Nama Rupa. 
And herein lies the crux, I think, of why we have a three lifetime interpretation in Buddha-Gosa. 
It's in this particular link. 
Literally, Nama Rupa means name and form. 
I mean, that's about as good as it gets when it comes to nearness of Pali Sanskrit and English. 
Nama is name and Rupa is form. 
And what it really stands for is mental and physical processes. 
This is what it stands for. 
Nama is the mental processes and Rupa is the physical processes here. 
So, Nama will include Sanya as well. 
It's worth pointing that out. 
Sanya being, you remember when I did the aggregates with you yesterday, Sanya being the discriminative perceptive aggregate that's there. 
Now, Buddha-Gosa, I think, and this is why I say it's actually better looking at the early text rather than through Buddha-Gosa. 
Buddha-Gosa suddenly sees this as being the generation of actual physical body and mind at this stage, coming into existence. 
Now, if you're talking about this as being as I am, and Buddhadasa and lots of other people speak about this as being a one lifetime process, rather than a two lifetime process, unless you really look deeply and find out what's really going on in Nama-Rupa, we've got a problem. 
Because we've got two bodies being born. 
One born at link 11, no, sorry, link 11. 
And then the other being born at link 4. 
And so the only way of doing that is to say, well actually everything that occurs before that is past, everything that occurs from 3 to 10 as a link is present, and everything from 11 to 12 is future. 
Did people follow that? You've got three lifetimes there as a way of trying to account for the fact that you seem to have two births within the system. 
Now, I think it's completely again spurious what Buddhadasa goes off and does with this material, because actually what the Buddha is indicating by Nama-Rupa is not the birth of a physical body and the mind at this stage, what he's actually talking about is the patterning or the blueprinting of what is going to come later within it. 
So, if you think of Nama-Rupa as being the way in your present that you're actually determining if you like your future. 
So you can still use the temporality, but you don't have to talk about it as lifetimes here. 
You're determining your future by the way that you condition and pattern your mind now and the way that you treat your bodies. 
You're blueprinting yourself up for your future moments at this moment. 
Now, we can see that as being future moments 20 years time or we can see that future moments as being 10 minutes time. 
It doesn't really matter. 
Now, I'm saying actually it's a very rapid process. 
Everything that we're doing now is determining what we're going to become in the next moment and the next moment and the next moment unless we influence it. 
So this is the kind of blueprinting that's occurring. 
Now, why is it occurring in this way? Well, that's because the Sankharas that are formed from forming are dependent on the confusion which is then patterning consciousness and consciousness is part of the Nama-Rupa. 
It's not separate from the Nama-Rupa. 
It's actually in a way, again, we've got a double thing. 
Dependent on consciousness there is Nama-Rupa. 
We're conscious of mind and body. 
We're conscious of the patterning that's going on. 
So this is a very, very dynamic process. 
The Buddha is playing here. 
Again, the Buddha goes, he's completely lost the plot as regards to this. 
And I'd say that actually with a slight tongue in cheek because, again, he hasn't got the philosophical background of India there because within early Indian thought the sense of the real person was the Nama, was the name of somebody. 
The name was intimately tied up with who the person was. 
And the Buddha is taking this and, again, I can't go into detail about this because this would be another half-and-afternoon. 
But he's taking this and playing with something that's there within Indian thought of his own time and, again, saying, no, it isn't. 
It's not the real sense of person. 
These are just the processes that are being patterned. 
This is not the fixed individual tied to some sense of name with a particular form. 
He's actually playing with it. 
So it's, again, part of the background. 
Sorry if this sounds a bit kind of sketchy, but it would take a lot more detail to go into it and we just don't have time, unfortunately. 
But what he's doing is he's playing with the Indian background from which he arises yet again in this instance. 
Now, that poem that I read to you yesterday, the poem of creation, you'll find this going on in that as well. 
When you really begin to analyze the Sanskrit terms and their relationship to the Pali here. 
So he plays so much with the doctrines, philosophies, religious ideas of his time. 
So much so that by the time you get to the formation of something like the Theravada schools we know it, they've actually lost, not the plot here, but they've actually lost the context in which the Buddha was talking about this. 
This is actually one of the benefits I think actually we have in the west of modern scholarship. 
We can actually go back into this material and really begin to correlate what's going on in say Upanishadic thought which is where this is derived from, Upanishadic thought and what is going on in the Buddha's relationship to that thought and these ways of critiquing it. 
Whereas the Upanishadic thought with the idea of the Nama being related to the essence of the person he is basically undermining that metaphysical sense by putting it directly back into a practical sense. 
This is you as you are patterning yourself now through all of this stuff. 
Let's not think about it as being some kind of sense removed about essences of individuals and essences living on another plateau of any of this stuff that was going on in some of this Upanishadic thinking but what's actually going on right now. 
So you should be concerned about the way that you're patterning your Nama Rupa now. 
Can we hold off for questions for a little bit? Yeah, later on but I just want to get through a few more points before moving. 
Venyana, consciousness object, you made that point a big point. 
Now Nama Rupa is that consciousness noticing that the body is a separate object? No, it isn't. 
It's showing actually their interrelationship. 
It's actually their intimate interrelationship. 
One of the points that I was making yesterday in relationship to the Khandhas and I think this is a really important point, particularly the way the body is often undervalued in comparison with the mind is that the Buddha is always talking about consciousness and mind as always an embodied mind. 
It's not a kind of free floating thing. 
Now again the tendency of the traditions has been to actually end up with a duality, a separation. 
We get the elevation of mind over body and then you get all the ascetic practices coming back again or ascetic practices. 
Sorry I always mispronounce this for you. 
But you get those things coming in because there's a denigration of the body in relationship to it. 
Now that's I don't think going on in the early texts at all. 
The mind is an embodied mind. 
This is why this intimate relationship between Namarupa How long have we been going? Can you stand one more point before having a break? This will be a quick one, so let me just write it up for you. 
Salayatana. 
Sense spheres. 
So the mind body has possesses and is conditioned. 
All this is conditioning the way that our senses operate. 
Now in Buddhist thought as you probably well know there's five senses plus the mental sense consciousness as well. 
So these are sense objects plus the consciousness that goes with them. 
So there's a no sense consciousness, an eye sense consciousness, an ear sense consciousness, a body sense consciousness, and a mind sense consciousness too. 
And the job of mind sense consciousness is to cognize mental stuff just like the eye is to cognize visual stuff here. 
And they're talked about as spheres of existence because in a way the eye is something which literally palpates or encompasses the visual field. 
This is why it's called an Ayatana, which is a sphere in Pali. 
And then after this it all starts to get a lot more interesting. 
Perhaps we ought to pause there because the other stuff is going to take a little bit more time. 
So perhaps ten minutes or so? Nine minutes. 
Any more questions?.
