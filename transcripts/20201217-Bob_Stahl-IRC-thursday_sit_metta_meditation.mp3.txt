After the Dharma talk and the walk, I'm going to offer some
inflections, practice on loving kindness, the Brahma Viharas,
the abode of the divine,
the abode of these beautiful qualities of loving kindness,
compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity.
Generally, the one that offers the talk will also do the metha,
and each night you'll hear from the other teachers, J.D.
Tomorrow and Mary Grace the following day.
So these qualities of the heart of loving kindness, and
you can bear with me, and I know some of you have heard this
story before, and I love stories.
The story of the Buddha and his pathway towards awakening,
very inspiring to me, and the story of loving kindness is also a very inspiring
story for me.
Sometimes the word metha, which is the quality of friendliness,
loving kindness, and sometimes can be rendered as that which softens the
hardened heart.
The story goes that many years ago in a faraway galaxy,
there was a group of monastics that were wanting to go into the forest, to a
deep forest to meditate, and they let the Buddha know they were going off
into this forest and to wish them well during a rainy season
retreat, and these monastics left and came into this beautiful forest that
was just an exquisite place to practice.
The way of the geographical area of that practice,
of that place, it really supported deep concentration.
There's a deep quiet there, and there was also a
not far away, one could fulfill their requisites of
going to the householders to be offered food, and there was
stream with water, there was firewood.
A really nice place to practice, and so they set off on their journey there.
And upon arriving, they set up their little
areas underneath different trees to meditate and to begin their practice,
and things went well for a while, and unbeknownst to them, there was a
group of tree spirits that also lived there that were very beautiful and
radiant in their appearances, very sweet smelling
fragrance coming off their celestial bodies, if you will.
And that was actually their forest where they lived.
And when they saw that the monastics weren't leaving,
they were okay for like a little bit of time, but when they
seemed to just be not leaving, they were getting a little bit
annoyed, and getting increasingly annoyed, they began to like pull little
tricks to try to get rid of them. Like a monastic would get a water pot filled
up, and then all of a sudden they'd find that it was turned over,
a forest path was swept clear, and it was covered with leaves soon after
fire was going, and it was all of a sudden put out.
The monastics began talking with one another, do you do this, do you do this,
do you see anything, and no one saw anything, and they were like,
huh, something strange is going on here.
Well, nevertheless they said, we'll just continue to say.
Well, these tree spirits got increasingly
annoyed, and decided to take much dire measures, and they had the magical
powers to transform their beautiful, radiant,
luminous, sweet smelling appearances into very scary looking
images, and emitting from their body was a stinking stench,
and their voices that were once so beautiful
and eased to listen to became very crude, and loud, and screechy,
and so they pounced upon these monastics, and the monastics truly got very
frightened, and they fled realizing this forest is haunted.
And so they came back to where the Buddha was, and the Buddha said,
huh, the rainy season's not over, and what are you doing back here?
And so then they explained what had happened, and then the Buddha said,
I'm going to teach you a meditation, and I'd like you to practice every step
of your way back to the forest, and to practice it in the forest.
They were a little bit hesitant, but they didn't want to say no to the Buddha,
and so they learned this practice, which is called the loving kindness meditation.
So each step of the way back, as they were lifting, and moving, and placing,
they began to not only to repeat these words, but
experience them, and feel them in their hearts, and to transform them.
You can read a few words from the metasuta that is something that they chanted, and
practiced, and embraced, and embodied, into their
skin, and bones, and being. In such beautiful wise words,
the metasuta, the Buddha's teaching on loving kindness, and says, this is
what should be done by one who is skilled in goodness,
and who knows the path of peace. Let them be able, and upright, and straightforward,
and gentle in speech, and humble, and not conceited,
contented, and easily satisfied, and unburdened with duties, and frugal in
their ways. What a beautiful prescription on how to
live life. Able, and upright, straightforward, and
gentle in speech, humble, and not conceited,
contented, and easily satisfied. Now proud, and demanding in nature, let
them not do the slightest thing that the wise would later
reprove, and wishing in gladness and in safety may
all beings be at ease. Whatever living beings there may be, whether
they are weak, or strong, or meeting none, the great, or the mighty, the medium, the
short, or the small, the seen, and the unseen,
those living near, and those living far away,
those born, and to be born may all beings be at ease.
I just love that line, those born, and to be born. It's like,
we got you covered, even if you're not yet born,
we got you covered. We are extending out this goodwill to those
born, and those yet even to being born. What an incredible gift of the heart
extending this love to all beings. Let none deceive another, despise any
being in any state. Let none through anger or ill will
wish harm upon another. Even as a mother protects with her life, her child, her
only child, so with a boundless heart,
one cherishing all living beings, and radiating this kindness over the entire
world, spreading upwards to the depths, and downwards,
upwards to the sky, and downwards to the depths.
Outwards and unbounded and freed from hatred and ill will,
whether standing or walking, seated or lying down, free from drowsiness, one
should sustain this recollection. This is said to be the sublime abiding.
And by not holding to fixed views, the pure-hearted one having clarity of
vision, becoming freed of all sense desires,
is not born again into this world.
There's a beautiful term called metta citta vimuti, that's the pawe,
and that means the liberation of the mind and the heart
through loving kindness.
And why is that? Because it begins to see through the
narcissism, the egocentricity, the identifications that
bound us up.
So each step of the way, these monastics, lifting, moving,
placing, extending their goodwill to all beings,
those born and yet to being born. As they got closer to the forest, the
tree spirits looked out and saw them coming, and they were,
they became, like,
they transformed themselves into even more scarier-looking appearances.
And emitting from their body was a stinking stench that would make you
vomit, and their voices were howling and screeching,
could almost like break eardrums, and they got ready to pounce on these
monastics once and for all.
Meanwhile, the monastics, lifting, moving, placing,
make all beings dwell with peace.
So it's getting closer and closer, and it's kind of this crescendo that's
building up and up, and the tree spirits are ready to pounce on them, and
the monastics are getting closer, but the monastics were so
absorbed in this lovingkindness, they were just emanating it so powerfully,
that their goodwill and spirit just began to just creep
or penetrate or like a wind into the forest.
So I love that translation of lovingkindness, that which softens the
hardened heart, because as that lovingkindness entered into the
forest and entered into the tree spirits, they were so
touched with the powers of goodwill of love,
and their hearts softened, and it's said that they transformed themselves back
into their radiant, beautiful, luminous, sweet-smelling
appearances with melodic voices, and some began to sweep the forest
pathways of those gathered waters, some started a fire and they
received these monastics, and they were so touched with this
practice of that which softens the hardened heart, this
goodwill, this lovingkindness, that they asked them,
can you teach this to us? Can we practice together?
And so it's said that for the rest of the reigns retreat, they all practice
together, and sometimes like in a groom's fairytale, they all
got enlightened, and they all lived happily ever after.
May we never underestimate these powers of love. This is, and we're reading in
between the lines of the stories, may we never underestimate these powers of love.
Martin Luther King says, I've decided to stick to love. I know that love is
ultimately the only answer to the problems of humanity.
I say to myself that hate is too great of a burden
to bear.
You may murder the hater, but you do not murder hate.
Violence merely increases hate. Darkness cannot drive out hate, only love can do
that. So sensing into our own hearts,
that which softens a hardened heart. You're welcome if you like, you can
place your hand on it or not, whatever feels comfortable for you, but
sensing and feeling into our own heart.
Again, this is where the wisdom and the love come together, seeing through these
stories of self-loathing, identifications,
opening into our hearts with great compassion,
kindness, just as we are.
Beginning to reconcile to the times I've been hurt on myself
through this greater understanding of seeing through the conditioning that has
fed that, opening into our own hearts with
wisdom and compassion.
So just sensing and opening into the heart,
these stories of our own self-loathing,
and they begin to dissolve as we see more clearly,
these stories that have bounded us and tangled us,
making peace with our own heart, perfectly perfect as we
all are, being present.
Just feeling the support of the cushion, the chair, the floor, the bed, the sofa,
wherever you are, and just allowing yourself to be held.
This heldness is this quality of being held with great
love and kindness for ourselves, making peace with their own hearts.
There's nothing that we have to try to do or push away, just allowing to receive
and to be held in this heart of loving kindness.

As we invite in this place of being held and taking rest in this heart of loving
kindness, we're welcome to also include with this rest all of your near and
dear ones. May they also find their place of resting
in this heart of compassion, of goodwill, of loving kindness,
to all of my near and dear ones, family, friends, our community,
this this circle of just being held with great kindness to those that are near
and dear.
May our community and near and dear ones experience rest and health,
protection from illness and danger.
Just including this loving kindness that we take rest into, may the near and
dear ones, our community, may this whole world take
rest in it.
May this earth take rest in itself being held within the universe,
subiding with loving kindness.
you
All human beings, all living things, those that live
in or on the earth, those living in the waters, those living mostly in the air,
may all beings find the rest within their hearts, may there be peace.
