I'm attuning to impermanence again in this
in many of the practices connected with insight practice. We don't actually go
looking for impermanence. It can be something that we kind of attune to
from time to time, but it's more something that is revealed as we
practice. And yet we can kind of incline with reflection to be curious about
impermanence. I'll talk about that more in a moment because that feels very
relevant for our exploration in our daily lives. But the value of seeing
impermanence, and when mindfulness and wisdom have the momentum, they can
open us to the experience of impermanence. But that experience itself
then kind of informs wisdom about something more fundamental, which is
it's not helpful to try to cling to something that's changing, that that
leads to suffering. And so that is one way that wisdom manifests in seeing the
impermanent nature of experience at a deep level sometimes in our
meditation, just seeing how rapidly things are changing. Wisdom just gets it
that this is not something that can be clung to, that it will cause suffering
when clung to. And that the very nature of experience as impermanent means
that there's nothing worth clinging to. And this is very freeing, understanding.
And yet the mind does kind of go through a process in relationship to seeing
impermanence. It doesn't simply see impermanence and it's like our habits,
our patterns. Wisdom is supporting us to help us to understand not
the cling to impermanence, but our habits, our patterns and our kind of beliefs around.
There must be something, there must be someplace to learn, there must be
something solid, stable somewhere, there must be something that I can rest on.
Those perspectives don't loosen easily sometimes. And so part of the
unfolding of our practice is to become aware of what our relationship is to
seeing impermanence. And I briefly mentioned in the guided meditation,
sometimes it can be delightful to see impermanence. It's like we begin to see
the facility of the mind to just know one thing after another. It's kind
of amazing and delightful. And other times it feels like things are happening so
fast that we can't kind of keep up with them and it feels disturbing. It feels
unsettling. So that kind of unsettledness is revealing a kind of a deeper clinging
to the wish for things to be permanent, the wish for there to be some stability,
and our path kind of deepens through that more and more deeply revealing ways
that we cling to these misperceptions, the misperception that things are
permanent, the misperception that there's someplace that things might be
reliable, the misperception about there being an I, a me here. And as our mind
begins to see that these are misperceptions, the phrase or the word
that sometimes used there is that the seeing of the impermanent nature, the
mind gets disenchanted with its misperceptions, gets disenchanted with
those views and beliefs around there being something permanent, reliable and
so. And that disenchantment process is sometimes not so pleasant. We like our
enchantments. We like our kind of way of thinking that we can be happy. And so
there's a process and by which we begin to let go of those, the ways that the
mind has been enchanted and the mind kind of begins to attune more fully to what
is true and that truth having a sense of it's like the refuge becomes the truth
instead of something that's stable. The refuge becomes this the truth that
there's nothing stable. And the Buddha did encourage us to actively, consciously
reflect on impermanence. There's a kind of a famous reflection of five
subjects for frequent recollection. It's chanted in the in the Thai forest
tradition. There's a beautiful English translation of the chant. I won't
chanted but I am of the nature to age. I have not gone beyond aging. I am of the
nature to sicken. I have not gone beyond sickness. I am of the nature to die. I have
not gone beyond dying. All that I have, beloved in pleasing, will become
otherwise, will become separated from me. The fifth is a reflection on on karma,
on conditionality. I'm the owner of my karma. Whatever karma I shall do and karma
translates the word that the word karma can be translated as action. I'm the
owner of my actions. Whatever actions I shall do for good or for ill of that I
will be the heir. So four of those five subjects for frequent recollection are
directly connected with impermanence. And the Buddha encourages us to bring
these thoughts into mind with regularity. Yesterday in one of the groups,
this this power of the taking in impermanence at an ordinary level, not
at the kind of dissolving experience in meditation level, but at the
ordinary level, the level of family members being yellow and aging. It
comes into our heart. It touches the the relational side of our practice. And when
we can deeply take that in, it it can be very transformative. We can use these
reflections in a way kind of like we use the metareflections. The metareflections
we start with self and then open to other beings. Our dear friends,
benefactors, loved ones and neutral people, difficult people, and in that
reflection noticing how it lands to reflect that. We do that with metade. We
can do this with these reflections as well. Remembering that your friends,
children, partners all have this nature. To age, sicken, to die. And that
everyone, neutral people, beings that we see, just all these beings. This is
really in it up. The changing nature is very up right now. And this
truth of our own impermanence is on all of our minds, especially those of us
who are over 60. And if we get this virus, or maybe more likely when we get
this virus, because we're all probably gonna have to get it at some point. It's
based on the way we're talking about, you know, well let's just slow down the
rate of transmission so that the infections won't overwhelm the system.
And yet this means many of us will die in the coming few years. And I think this
is true. It's always been true. It's kind of more present. So this is a
way in which the illusion of our continuity of our, yeah, I'm gonna die
someday, but like, you know, that's a long time away. But now it
maybe feels more like, well, you know, maybe it's a month away. Who knows?
That's more up for us. And this is a good thing that we hold this
consciously. Noticing your relationship to that. Noticing your relationship to that.
How does it feel to know that? How does it feel to know that so many people in the
coming months will die of this virus? The death rate much higher right now than
usual. So we can reflect in this way. And in this using the reflective practice,
like we do with Meta, you know, with Meta we drop in the phrase, may I be happy?
And we check in. How does it land? How do we feel about that? What is, what is the
effect that that reflection has on the heart in the present moment? And so we
blend the reflection with mindfulness and awareness. And likewise with these
reflections, I'm of the nature to die. How does that land? What's the attitude?
What's the relationship to that? There's probably more to reflect on with this,
but it's time to stop. So we'll stop now and I'll just remind those of you who
are in the third group of this third small group will be meeting in about half
an hour and see the rest of you this afternoon.
