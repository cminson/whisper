 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. What's on my mind today to share as a Dharma Talk? I'll continue to invite you on the kind of simplicity of a being as you listen to this Dharma Talk. And just bring your body along, bring your mind along, and check in how you are periodically. What I'm offering is not separate from it. So I want to start by sharing a story. Recently you read an article by Lama Rod Owens called, Do You Know Your True Face? And in this article, he wrote about, after his three-year Dharma teacher training program, he had a period of his life that he felt quite uninspired and even used the word breakdown. It was challenging. So he turned towards it, and very quickly he had an insight into what was happening. And so those are the words that he wrote. He said, that my identity as a Lama and a resident teacher had somehow choked my identity as a queer black man. I was privileging the Lama over Rod, and Rod, this being, had many different needs, different roles and different identities. And Rod got subsumed by Lama, the resident teacher. When I read this, I immediately resonated with it deeply and found much humility and wisdom in what he said. I think all of us probably have seen this version affecting ourselves. So in the pursuit of our own ambition, our hobby, our passion, or simply wanting to be who we wanted to be, you know, really wanted to be, very inspired for being this person. And we may have choked, and that's Lama Rod Owen's word, or suffocated other aspects of our beings. And so I want to share a story of my own. I remember some years ago in my work life, I was very busy. And I was doing very well, and I got caught up by the momentum of it. And I remember there was one morning, and that I had to get up to do a presentation that happened at 5.30 in the morning, to a very important client. And I had hoped that my baby boy won't wake up 5.30 in the morning. And he was very young, but you know what? The moment I started my presentation, he was sitting upstairs. Mommy, Mommy! And so, but I ignored him, because I got a very important presentation right now, and I got to go do that. And I finished my presentation and went upstairs to check him. And he was sitting by the stairs very quietly, holding a piece of paper in his hands. And I looked at the paper, and he barely was able to write anything at that time. And it said, you are the baddest mom I ever knew. So, that was a wake-up moment. So, just like Lama Rod Owens, I was privileging a scientist, a career woman, over a mother, a spouse, and the rest of me. And so, it's worthwhile to notice that in each of us, there's a whole community within us, and there's a whole community around us. Our Dharma practice invites us to become aware, there's a whole dynamic of different aspects of our being. When we're not aware, it's very easy that we create favorites, the ones that we really want to be, and the ones that, you know, rather they don't exist. And so, this brings me to a short sutra that I want to share with you today called Kachana Sutra. This is in Samyutta Nikaya, in the chapter around dependent origination. And so, in this sutra, Venerable Kachana is asking the Buddha a question about how to define right view. Many of you might be very familiar with the notion of a right view, which is the first path factor of the Noble Eightfold Path. And in this sutra, the Buddha had a very specific definition for it, which I want to share. But in answering this question, the Buddha first made a few quite dramatic statements. So he began by saying, Kachana, this world mostly relies on the due notions of existence and non-existence. So this world mostly relies on the due notions of existence and non-existence. Then I'll unpack this a little bit and first by maybe unpacking the word, the word world, the world. Often when the Buddha spoke about the world, the world is not necessarily something kind of out there, but the world is often defined as our direct experience through our sense contacts, our six senses, sight, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and our mental activities. And through this, our subjective experience come about, right? We make contacts with the sound, with the smell, and we can directly experience what's happening. And the broader world is kind of experienced through our senses as well. So there is, in a way, there is no world out there but through our direct experience with the senses. So the world mostly, or by and large, relies on the notions of existence and non-existence. What does this mean? And so existence, non-existence in the Chinese parallel used the word becoming and non-becoming. Some of you might be familiar with this and it's often present in the suttas. But if we go back to the stories I told early on, we can see that sometimes we get stuck in the idea of who we are. Our identities are roles. You know, I am so-and-so, and so I must do so-and-so. And when we have this kind of idea, sometimes they are very deep and subtle. We don't even know they exist. Sometimes they may be very visible momentarily. But when they really are in the core of our being, what happens is that we can orient and organize our whole life around this idea. And if you want to be or you are a great poet, then your whole life activities could be centered around that notion. You know, six o'clock in the evening, you might forget about putting dinner on the table, or your child is asking to go out and play in the backyard. No, I'm busy. I got a right to this poem. And so this idea can become a basis or in the notion of we rely on this idea to live our lives. And the opposite could be true also. You know, if some of us may have parts of ourselves, we would rather them not be there. We have certain ideas that maybe I'm just not this material. I'm just not an artist. And maybe that's something that happened very early on in our life. Very young. We had this idea that I'm not good enough for a certain thing. And that get reinforced by culture around us or environmental or in. And then we have a deep seated idea. This is who we are. And we're just not that. So and then with this kind of ideas, what can happen is that we also organize our lives around this ideas. And we may be organizing activities around this kind of activities. Maybe we don't care about this part of us at all. We may even be violent against them when this part of us is show up. And so there is can be this sense of what the Buddha is pointing to relying on non existence and really denying that. And and Lama Rod Owens in this article spoke a bit about this and he said to resist naming our identity. Locations is to commit a kind of aggression toward ourselves and to further obscure blind spots that hurt others. Others are hurt when they're not seen. Invisibility is another form of violence and oppression. And so this is not an existence in a way. It's also pointing at the invisibility that can happen. But because of this ideas are not the reality of our direct experience in our direct experience. You know, maybe we are working on poems or doing some activities for a while being a poet. But the other situation comes up for caring for others and caring for themselves happens. Then the situation change. So can we in this situational transitions, can we recognize that is happening and honor that that is happening in our experience right now. When we don't we hand on to that idea of I am so and so we rub against the reality of the situation and that rubbing against begin to create a lot of stress in ourselves and for others. And this is about being against. So these are not mistakes that we blame for ourselves, but it's pointing to the fact that when we're not aware what is happening, we can live our huge part of our lives based on this kind of ideas and without us knowing it. And we can also see that those are the ideas and that can play at a societal level. Right. Certain categories of people may have certain ideas about being more worthy of their existence. And others may have the opposite. And you can see, you know, a lot of the inequality and conflicts and injustice began to kind of bubble up from this kind of ideas. And they often can trace down to the notions of existence and non existence of becoming and non becoming. So it's quite humbling to see this ideas live and operate in us in quite deep ways. The Buddha continue to point out the deeper phenomenon that exists behind this notions. I wanted to just point out for some of you who might be very geeky about this, the way that I'm choosing to kind of express the unfolding of the suttas based on the Chinese parallel version. They have a different order in terms of how the teaching is presented in the Pali Canon. It doesn't make not a whole lot of a difference in what I'm presenting here. But for me, that ordering seems to make a little more sense in my own mind. But the Buddha continues to say that the world is for the most part shackled by attraction, grasping and existing. But if when it comes to this attraction grasping mental fixation, existence and underlying tendency, you don't get attracted, grasp and committed to the notion myself. You will have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising and what ceases is just suffering seizing. Your knowledge about this is independent of others. And this is how right view is defined. So the first thing the Buddha is pointing out after he spoke about the world, the world mostly by and large relies on the notions of existence, non existence, is that he's pointing out a deeper force that keeps this ideas alive in us. And that is the forces of grasping, claiming, craving attachments. It's through the grasping and attachments that this ideas are kept alive in us. This is something for us to see in our direct experience without grasping the idea, I am a scientist, I'm a career woman. It's just momentary. And it's a thought comes from time to time and it goes just a thought. But when there is a craving to continue to establish this, I like this translation word commit, we commit to it again and again. Now this idea becomes hardened in us more and more. I can almost become a core of ourselves because I am this person. And so it's what Buddha is pointing out is to begin to see this underlying force of grasping and claiming and craving in our meditation. I also offered to maybe see this conditioned nature of our experience directly. You know, this are something so we can see. So we can even do a little experiment right now and then see how the condition, the phenomenon of existence comes to be. So I'm going to tell you all a little secret about yourself that you don't know. Maybe you know, pay attention to what I had to say and see what happens in your experience. So I'm going to say this. You are all such wonderful yogis. Have anybody told you about this? You are all wonderful, brilliant yogis. See what happens in your lived experience. Maybe there's some pleasantness in you, pleasant feelings in you, some recognition. Maybe sometimes there is that kind of a Huff and Puff kind of leaning in. Wow, I am a great yogi. Some of you might say, boy, it can't be me. You know, that can't be me. And so you can see just by hearing something I said, the type can be different responses coming out of it. And sometimes the sense of itself is very obvious. And sometimes that sense of denial is very obvious. And so this is the direction that the Buddha was pointing at. He began to notice that the leaning in are pushing against. And you can see, you know, now if the whole room is telling you the same thing, and then watching this process happening again and again, no doubt I am a great yogi. There's no doubt. And here it is, you know, a great set up for a failure. Right. Somebody just shows up and mildly criticizes as the whole bubble bursts. And so this commitment to this notion keeps this ideas kind of held up, held up there. So, you know, the notion of existence and non-existence can feel quite abstract and high level and philosophical. But this right view, the definition of a right view that the Buddha is pointing to, it's really inviting us to see this directly in our lived experience. I like that the Chinese translation for right view, some of you may know this, and also has a literal meaning of directly see, direct seeing. The second half of the sutta, the Buddha explained how this right view can be established through seeing. So this, here it goes. But when you truly see the origin of the world with the right understanding, you won't have the notion of non-existence regarding the world. So when you see how things comes to be, you won't have this idea of non-existence regarding the world. And when you truly see the cessation of the world with the right understanding, you won't have the notion of existence regarding the world. So there are two things happening here, and let's unpack this a little bit one by one. So a few key words here. When you truly see with right understanding, right understanding here, the Pali term is samma pañña, right wisdom, a clear wisdom. When you see with a wisdom, what do you see? Seeing the origin of the world, seeing how the phenomenon arises, seeing the conditioned nature of arising. So, for example, we are all here in the situation we're in, listening to a Dharma talk and practicing together. And this is arising of the situation, but it comes with a whole host of causes and conditions. You all probably drove, walked, and the schedule happened to be like this, and you and I are all present here. And there's a whole host of conditions that led to the situation we're in right now, right here. And we can't just say, this doesn't exist. We can't just deny, no, this doesn't exist. This is all just a fantasy. No. In our direct experience, we experience this truthfully. There's a truth to this existence. So when we know this, the notion of nothing truly exists, all doesn't exist, that makes no sense. Right? And so that's what the Buddha was pointing at. When we see the conditioned arising of our phenomenon, nothing exists, makes no sense. And then when we truly see the cessation of the world, when we truly see the ending of our experiences, and the notion of a permanent existence, long lasting existence, makes no sense. When we see that the meeting ends, the situation ends, and the things stop. We can't just say, oh, this is going to go on forever. That makes no sense. And so what the Buddha is pointing at is, in our lived experience, when we begin to clearly see the arising and passing, and the conditions leads to arising and passing, we begin to see for ourselves that hang on to this notions of existence, non-existence, totally makes no sense. And we know this for ourselves. And what that entails is very simple direct awareness. And really being present for this arising and passing, because what can happen oftentimes is that we don't quite see, so we just hold on to that notion in our head most of the time. You know, we are meeting ended, but we still think, oh, you know, this would happen again. And, you know, we just kind of have ideas to keep things going. So in this article, Lama Rod Owens speaks about this radical presence that points to this particular dimension of being aware. It says, radical speaks to a sense of remembering and returning to a simple and basic way of being in the world. When we choose this way of being in the world, we feel at home in our own body with no desire to leave it. Because we feel at home in the body, we feel at home in the world. This is a radical presence. And when we know this conditioned arising and a passing of our experiences, what can happen is that we grant fluidity to our identities. It can float depending on the situation we're in. You know, this moment we can be students and teachers. Next moment we might be buddies and we can become fluid and we don't have to carry all these ideas along with us. And the Lama Rod Owens had this sentence which spoke to me deeply. He said, practice grants us a space to allow this shifting to happen and to call that shifting our home. So instead of relying on the notions that seems to be quite permanent and persistent, making that at your home and ground, here we rely on the ever shifting, changing of our direct experience and calling that our home. And so I want to end by sharing the next piece of the Buddha's teaching, which probably really needs another Dharma talk. But I think we will just end with that. And I'll do a quick summary after that. And so the Buddha went on to give the teachings on the middle way and he says, all exists, Kachana, this is one extreme. All does not exist. This is the second extreme. Without a veering towards either of those extremes, the Tatagata teaches the Dharma by the middle. And this teaching by the middle is not in between existence or non existence, but the teaching by the middle is the 12 dependent origination of the dukkha, of the suffering and the dependent association of the dukkha. And usually this link starts with ignorance as condition, volitional formations comes to be with the volitional formations as condition, consciousness comes to be. And then all 12 links all the way to how the whole mass of the suffering comes to be. And so that's you know, there are 12 links of this and then the cessation also follows a similar pattern. But it says something like this with the remainder less fading away and the cessation of ignorance comes to cessation of volational formations with the cessation of volational formations, cessation of a consciousness and all the way to the cessation of the whole mass of dukkha or suffering. Maybe what's more important is not necessarily to kind of remembering this 12 links, but to begin to really pay attention to our lived experience, how the dukkha comes about and how they cease. Begin to see the underlying conditionality in our direct experience because when we know this for ourselves and this suta said that this knowledge is independent for others. No one else can talk you out of it because you know this for yourself. And that began to offer a potential to shift, shift the perspective, shift our behaviors. I want to end with this quote from the activist James Botwin and he said, I am what time circumstances in history have made of me certainly, but I am also much more than that. So are we all. And so when we see the condition, the natures of our experience, we can acknowledge what is here, what is here right now, what is true for ourselves, not denying, not indulging. But when we see this, we also let go of the limitations of notions of who we are. And what this last line that he said point out to is I am much more than that. All of us are. So there is a vastness of all of our beings that is not defined by the limited notions and ideas and beliefs that we have. But that is done through our direct knowing of what is happening. What is here. So thank you everybody for being here. And we we have a few minutes for any comments and questions or sharing. You have reflections you may have. The floor is open. Just one second. Thank you. I appreciated and feel like I got what you just said. Yet I don't I haven't studied and I don't understand independent origination. Do I need to understand that to have understood your main points today? Well, you seem to have answered questions. Yeah. So you have a sense in your own being. And so this talk is pointing at really began to pay attention to what is happening. Maybe when there is a chance to study, we don't have to resist that also and come along. And that's good. But it's not dependent on that. I think what is more dependent on is to begin to pay attention to what is happening. Yeah. Do you have any recommendations for reading for understanding? There's so many. I'm sure even on audio Dharma, if you search on some talks on dependent origination, I'm pretty sure you'll find the talks on this. Thank you. She said, I have a personal question. I heard that you started your I guess path with Buddha Dharma, always Mahayana Buddhism. But then you got drawn to the Theravada Buddhist. This is actually my first time ever in the Theravada type of in a monastery, Buddhist monastery. So can you elaborate on like what the difference may be for it? Also others seem like would be useful. What's the difference between Mahayana and Theravada and why did you get drawn to Theravada? Yeah, I am. I feel a little hesitant to kind of I don't feel I'm qualified to kind of do a real broader perspective. I can talk about my personal perspective and what happened to myself. And I continue to hold both of the lineages with a high regards and deep respect. And I happened to start with Mahayana first because I met Mahayana Sanghas. And I resonated with a lot of teachings there, a lot of the community that I really enjoyed. And but the particular community I was part of, we didn't have a lot of meditative opportunities. And I was very caught up by all the teachings in my head. And I just felt like my head was about to explode if I keep on doing the studying. And I really needed to know this in my own experience. And so when I began my meditative practice, it was in the Theravada tradition. And that's when I began to meditate and that spoke so much to me. And so today I continue to maybe study and learn in different ways in some different traditions. And now I kind of bring along kind of my lived experience and direct experience driven practice with me. And so that helps me understand a lot of Mahayana teachings. I wouldn't say a lot, but understand the certain dimensions of a Mahayana teaching. And this particular suta I quoted, it was sometimes recognized as a seat of the Mahayana tradition because the scholar and the practitioner Nagarjuna had this profound teaching around the middle way. And this was the suta he quoted. So there is maybe a deep roots, deep common roots. Thank you. Just a little follow up. So you mentioned direct experience. Do you mean like direct insight or direct to you, I guess, to clarify? Direct. Yeah, you said like direct experience, I guess, maybe direct meditative experience, direct or direct insight. Like this is insight meditation, I guess. Right. That's the practice that I'm mostly engaged in is the insight meditation practice. So like noting or the or the mindful meditation. What's that? Yeah, that also changed. I've did quite a lot over the years of the practice. And I did a start with Mahasi Sayadaw's tradition and that kind of continued to evolve and shift and change. Thank you. Yeah. Just wanted to appreciate your talk and your being here and to loop back to the beginning of your talk with the experience of your child. I remember that my own youngest child at one point said, I'm going to go on Craigslist and find a better mom. I think all parents have been told that there's one way or another in their lives. Yeah, they're very honest. The truth. Well, it was great to have a mirror coming back. Yeah. Bill, you mentioned the Chinese parallel scriptures. This is just kind of a technical point because I kind of interested in this. But what I've heard is that since the poly cannon is in a language that's close to what the Buddha originally spoke, it must be primary or primal and that the Chinese versions of the poly cannon must therefore be a later translation. And so we can just stick with the poly cannon, right? Because it's closer to the original. And yet I've also heard that there are a number of places in the Chinese versions that are clear or make a little bit more sense. And that perhaps therefore the poly cannon might be a later translation from the Chinese that didn't get the translation done very well. So in other words, it's just not entirely clear if the poly cannon is always closer to the original teachings, whatever they were. Does that make sense? Or is this something you know about? Yeah. Yeah. My understanding is this is an ongoing kind of scholarly study topic for sure. There is no definitive statement to say that the parallels are later than the poly cannon. There may be certain collections that one can make a little more definitive answer a statement than others. So the Chinese parallel comes from Sanskrit collection. So that's translated through the Sanskrit version. But it's not totally clear, actually, that there is such definitive answer about which one is first and which one is later. So this is ongoing, ongoing research still in this domain. When I, for me, personally looking at different versions, I encourage those who have a different maybe either mother towns or different language capacities to do look at different translations. And they do have they can be quite meaningful for me because I'm not I wasn't born here and I didn't grow up here. I came when I became a young adult. I had a very little emotional association with English language. And so the so is the translations, you know, kind of like a lot of words as the emotional resonance with them is kind of learned, you know, taste. But with the Chinese translations, I have an immediate sense oftentimes of what they are and kind of in almost a somatic way. And so this is something for each of us to explore. I mean, looking at the different words, even the English translations, there are different words, different English words that translate on the same poly and poly term. And so they may be helpful. You know, that's a helpful aspect of studying and learning. So, yeah. So thank you for bringing that up. Just a technical note, but but sometimes, you know, the question does come up and maybe it's just best to look at all the translations if you have access to more than one version and just sort out for yourself. What what makes most sense to you? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I know that that may change over time. Yeah, I think we're almost time. So thank you. Thank you for your presence here, for being here and studying and learning and practicing together with a delight. And my understanding is those who are online will have a online zoom handout. But for those who are here and in person, we also have a handout opportunity so we can go to the parking lot and there are voting chairs that you can take to go to the parking lot. You can have tea or just, you know, chat a bit as a community. And that's just about 20, 30 minutes that we can we can be together. Yeah. Okay. Thank you, everyone. Yeah.
