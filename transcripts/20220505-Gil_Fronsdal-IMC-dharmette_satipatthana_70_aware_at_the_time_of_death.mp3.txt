The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So, good morning, and we're coming to the penultimate talk on Satipatana, the Satipatana Sutta.
And after all these months now, over four months of going through it slowly.
And we're coming to the end, and we'll all come to an end at some point.
And this Satipatana practice is considered to be one of the greatest practices to do as we're dying.
And if we wait until we're dying to begin our practice, we won't have developed our practice.
The practice won't be there as a strong resource for us at those times.
And what I've learned through this Satipatana practice and doing it, doing this practice for now many decades,
it generally gives me a very positive feeling about dying.
My relationship to my death is that if I'm lucky to die consciously and without dementia or without too much pain,
that I just anticipated being one of the great things to be present for.
And this letting go that undoubtedly happens there as we're dying is one of the best things going.
It's a really wonderful thing to do.
The experience that I've had of letting go deeply and deeply and deeply,
I now kind of associate that also with dying.
And so I don't feel that dying is so much an end as it is a releasing, letting go, and letting go into, I don't know.
It doesn't matter so much to me what we're letting go into, maybe nothing,
but just letting go is so wonderful, so peaceful, so happiness, so freeing.
So to consider this practice we've been doing all these months,
that one of the purposes for it is to come to terms with, find our peace, find our center, our freedom
in relationship to some of the deepest and most challenging aspects of human life.
And this is why I think this is kind of represented by how the text begins and how it ends.
And the end it goes, so it was with reference to this that it is said,
this is a direct path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation,
for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the attainment of the way, for the realization of nibbana,
namely the four foundations for awareness.
And so in some Theravada countries, or temples,
often there's a practice of reciting the Satipatana Sutta as someone is dying, or after they've died,
because of this very close association with the practice of Satipatana as we're dying.
One of the ways to appreciate this is that as we're dying,
that all kinds of things no longer are that important.
And we're not, our last breaths, we're not concerned about whether or not we need to buy more socks or not.
Or what are we going to have for supper, what is all kinds of things that, and to be able to let go of concerns and thoughts
which are not relevant at that time, to be able to let go of fears, desires, the stress,
to really kind of not have that get in the way of the fullness of the moment, the opportunity of the moment.
And the Satipatana practice teaches us that we have something better to do than be distressed,
something better to do than being afraid, something better to do than being lost in fantasy and thoughts and projections and ideas.
Not that we can necessarily put all those things aside, but our life and interest, the energy, the attention doesn't go there anymore.
We can let go of it and focus on this practice of Satipatana, practice of being aware and being awake, being present.
That is the better alternative than so many of the ways our minds can go.
And to have practiced Satipatana, this practice of mindfulness a lot helps us to see over and over again in a deeper, clear way
how it's the better alternative, how it's the, this is where life is found, freedom is found, peace is found,
more often than what else, the other things the mind is doing.
And the compulsion to certain thoughts and certain ones of our feelings and the attitudes, as much as they might seem important to us,
through this practice we see that there's something better to do.
There's something much more freeing, much more peaceful, much more alive, much more satisfying to do than thinking about our resentments,
thinking about how other people are wrong, thinking about regrets we have over our lifetime.
I mean, all those things can have a place in life, but to realize that they're not the best alternative, they're not the best place,
the most valuable place to be, to not invest so much in so many things which are to our detriment that diminish us,
that are a wind drag for ourselves.
And to know what's the best alternative, to see that being awake, being aware, being present is the best alternative going.
Even at the very beginning, at the very end, this last breath that we have, what's the best thing to do at that point?
Would you know that? Do you have a feeling?
This is how you want that last breath to be.
I hope it's not, you know, wondering who's going to get your socks when you die.
I hope that it's, you know, there's really something there.
And then maybe there's a letting go of the world around you even and the relationships for that breath.
Maybe there's a letting go into being awake, into being aware, letting go into release, letting go.
And so to...
So all these months that we've been doing Satyapetana, it comes to this,
that it's really about some of the most essential, deepest aspects of our life, and death represents that.
But there's all kinds of suffering that human beings have, that human realm is filled with suffering and challenges.
And how do we meet it? How do we address it? How do we find our way through it?
And for the Buddha, this is the unified way, this is the direct way, this is the way.
And I think of it as the simplest, most uncomplicated, unway, all the way through to freedom, to liberation.
So, well, thank you.
And we'll do our last talk tomorrow.
And I look forward to our time. Thank you.
