Dharmette: Meditation as Self -
expression

It’s interesting to look at the approach one has for 
meditation or spiritual practice, and the variety of 
different approaches we could have . One of the 
approaches  that have  been  very meaningful for me is 
that meditation practice is not about attaining anything. 
It’s not about making something happen , or going 
somewhere, or producing some states . And it’s certainly 
not about fending  off something, get ting rid of 
something, or protect ing us from the world. Rather, 
meditation is a form of expression, of self-expression . 
We’re allowing space for something to be expressed 
through us.  
 
Maybe it’s no different from the way an artist would  
express herself through a canvass  or through music. 
You don ’t play a musical instrument to get through the 
musi c as fast as you can. My seven -year-old son is 
learning  the piano . And he chose this little minuet  by 
Bach , which  he wanted to play at his second -grade 
talent show. But his way of doing it was to get through it 
as quickly as he could. So I asked him, “How do you eat ice cream?  When you eat the ice cream, do you l ick it 
and then savor the flavo r and take it in, or do y ou just 
lick, lick, lick,  lick?” And he got it. “Oh yeah, you lick it , 
and then you swallow it slowly and enjoy it, and then 
you do the next one. ” So I said, “Okay, that ’s how you 
should play your notes. ” And then he got it – how to 
slow down. And then there was a little detour fr om the 
idea that you don ’t play the music in order to just get 
through it as quickly as you can – it’s a form of 
expression that is moving through you.  
 
The expression is to  sit quietly, upright, in meditation  – 
and then to have enough trust  or confidence,  that it ’s 
okay just to be here – that you don ’t have to prove 
yourself. You don ’t have to defend yourself. You don ’t 
have to accomplish something. And then you relax 
enough and notice  what is it that wants to come t hrough 
you. What arises in you? ” 
 
Not just anything that comes through , because  if it’s 
anything at all that wants to be expressed , we’re in 
trouble [laughs]. There ’s a lot of greed, hate and 
delusion that wants to be expressed. There has to be 
some way of differentiating between that which is  not 
helpful and that which is skillful . I think that what ’s most 
helpful from a  deeper  form of self -expression – the kind 
that wells up from within – comes  from a very different 
place within us than greed, hate and delusion.  
 When the mind is caught in pr eoccupation , things come 
out of that . It could be tremendous frustration . And then 
out of that frustration, what most wants to be expressed 
is anger, or it cou ld be screaming . And Gil says,  “I’m 
supposed to trust my self -expression ” [laughs] : IMC 
becomes a  screaming house. No that ’s not it . But it is to 
sit quietly and be ab le to tap into some deeper 
wellspring  of wholenes s, integrity, or some  nourishing 
stillness . And out of that stillness , we can  see what 
bubbles up, what wants to be expressed through us.  
 
One of the images that the Buddha talked about  is, in 
meditation , having the feeling  that your body is like a 
lake. The lake has no streams running into it, and 
there ’s no rain filling it. Rather what fills the lake with 
water is a d eep under water spring  bubbling up from 
deep inside the lake. The current of that underground 
spring brings up this refreshing water  into the whole 
lake. So in the  same way, is there a deep well spring  in 
yourself , which you can allow to surface and  move 
through you , and nourish  you, and refresh you in some 
way?  
 
For meditation to be a form of self -expres sion, where 
you’re tapping into  what ’s most deep inside of you, it 
becomes an alternative to the idea that there ’s 
something to get, some place to go, something to 
accomplish, or that you ’re not good enough – the idea is that at the heart of who you  are is already something 
complete, full, healthy . How do we tap into that?  
 
One of the ways is to be mindful enough to be able to 
differentiate between those movements that want to 
come through us that have greed, hate and delusion  – 
those  that come with compulsion  – and those that come 
with a sense of freedom, peace , or stillness.  Peace  or 
freedom is a really important touchstone  or reference 
point for this, because if there ’s no pe ace con nected to 
that inner expression, then it probably doe sn’t come 
from the deepest well spring s within us. If what comes 
up has to be expressed , it’s prob ably not from the 
deepest places . The deepest places of expression 
which  arise do n’t need to be exp ressed . They have  no 
needs at all. It ’s something very simple: vitality, a sense 
of presence – not something we make a decision about , 
like “What career am I going to do with my life? ” It’s 
something deeper – something  much more intimate.  
 
Sometimes when  people hear instructions for 
mindfulness practice, i t can seem very focus ed on 
technique . You ’re supposed to do this and this and this : 
follow your breath , and then if your mind starts thinking 
a lot, then you notice that and come back to your breath  
– a lot of techniques, a lot of things to do. If you get too 
busy with all the things to do in meditation , then it ’s hard 
to let go. It ’s hard to relax enough, or be still enough, to 
allow something to bubble up from within, to allow something to be expressed through you, which comes 
from these deeper well springs within.  
 
What is it that comes through yo u that expresses your 
integrity – the intimacy you have with the integrity 
within? Then meditation can become very satisfying , 
because it doesn ’t require attain ing anything. You don ’t 
have to get anything. You don ’t have to stop your 
thinking. You don ’t have to attain different states of deep 
concentration  or insight . All those things are possible, 
but it ’s really a beautiful thing to experience this  
wholeness – a sense of completedness – here, where 
nothing is needed. You don ’t need to attain anything. 
Just to be alive is enough.  
 
The last thing I ’ll say is that the reason I gave short 
instructions earlier about stillness is that there ’s a very 
close connection b etween stillness – physical  stillness 
and mental stillness  – and feeling, or connecting, or 
allowing  this healthy sense of life being expressed . We 
are being expressed through ourselves.  
 
You might look into that. You might se e, when you sit 
down to meditate and  get settled a little bit, rather than 
trying to make something happen, try to make yourself 
still. And see if you can listen, or hear, or feel, or sense, 
what is it that is coming through.  What is  being 
expressed now, her e?  
 Maybe that will nourish you as well.
