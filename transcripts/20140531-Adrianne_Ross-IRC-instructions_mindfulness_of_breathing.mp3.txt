sense the body softening, being at ease, inviting the places of holding in the body to soften, releasing with each out breath, softening in the face and muscles around the eyes and mouth, softening in the neck, the shoulders, upper body, the belly, sensing the muscles in the back, soft and yet supporting, so the body can be erect and awake and alert and yet relaxed, receptive, muscles in the legs, relaxed, so we can rest embodied, and aware, and as you rest grounded in the body can be aware of how easily sounds unknown, sounds in the room, sound of my voice, without effort simply receiving, and then bring the attention to the breath, experience of breathing, aware of the sensations as you breathe in, as you breathe out, might be aware of the breath at the nose, chest, the belly, wherever it's comfortable, easy, aware of the rhythm of the breath, receiving the sensations of the in breath and the out breath, see if you can allow the breath to find its own rhythm, and then this morning we'll continue to just rest with the breath as a way of guiding the mind, body and heart to stillness, to collect the attention and the energy in, in a relaxed, gentle way, so see if you can keep the attention with the breath, for the duration of the in breath, the out breath, and perhaps the spaces between breaths, and as soon as you notice the mind has been drawn into the stories past or the future, gently returning to the breath, to the felt sense of being embodied. 
Whenever you get drawn into thoughts, stories, you can make a soft note, not now, here, gently returning to the breath, if it's helpful to you, you can make a soft note, in, with the in breath, out, with the out breath, or rising, falling, simply as a way to help you connect and sustain the attention with the breath. 
Notice what's happening in this moment, releasing stories the past or the future, reconnecting with the sensations of breathing, returning to the felt sense of being in a body. 
From time to time notice the attitude in the mind, is there judgment or irritation whenever the mind wanders off, or is there kind of mind attention. 
See if it's possible to welcome yourself back. 
So continuing, resting in the body and receiving the experience of breathing. 
When thoughts come, allowing them to pass through and reconnecting with the breath, so the breath is in the foreground, the direct experience of the sensations of pressure, warmth, tingling, vibration. 
The body relaxed, still, receptive, the mind quiet, spacious. 
Aware of what's happening in this moment, gently reconnecting with the felt sense of being embodied, grounded in the body, and then aware of the breathing, sensations of the in-breath, the out-breath, moment by moment, bringing a kind and curious attention. 
Whenever you're caught in stories, memories, not now, here. 
Not pushing anything away, simply releasing and reconnecting with the breath. 
Relaxed, still, and open. 
For the remaining few minutes of the sitting, seeing if you can be completely with the body and the breath. 
Releasing however the sitting has been so far, whether you've been having an easy moment or a difficult moment, restless one, making a fresh start, being completely with the body and with the breath. 
So today we'll be practicing with the first of the factors of enlightenment and that's mindfulness. 
And mindfulness really of any of the foundations of mindfulness of the breath, the body, feeling tone, thoughts, emotions, all of them are ways of cultivating the factors of awakening. 
And throughout the week we'll be today focusing mostly on the breath and the body and then we'll include gradually throughout the week instructions of working with feeling tones, emotions, thoughts, and so forth, so that all the foundations of mindfulness are included. 
But we progress slowly so that the muscle of mindfulness can build a little. 
And as Gil was mentioning last night, the first day really is a day of settling and so really to be patient and kind to ourselves. 
How many people were sleepy in this set? Okay, how many people were restless? How many people had a busy mind? How many people got frustrated? And how many people were all of the above? Yeah, so that just gives you a sense that you're not alone and that it's really normal in the settling process of a retreat. 
And it really doesn't matter how many retreats we've sat, the settling process is a normal thing to occur. 
And so the most useful thing is to be kind, is to pay attention with affection. 
And so that we can welcome ourselves back. 
So rather than, oh shit, I was gone, oh thank you for coming back. 
You know, welcome home. 
And it makes it a lot more pleasant so that from the very beginning we can just bring the awakening of factor of joy in a little bit. 
So that we're kind to ourselves and we're curious and how can I be with this in a way that it's interesting and light and not grim and endurance. 
And so the other thing that's so useful to remember is that any moment you can have a fresh start. 
So no matter how difficult or frustrating this moment is, as soon as you notice that you're in a really frustrating moment, you can make a fresh start. 
Let go of how the sitting has been so far, beginning again. 
And whenever you leave the hall, you get to leave however the sit was behind and begin again. 
So those are some useful things to remember. 
If you're sleepy, sit with your eyes open. 
It really helps to bring light in, to stand up. 
That's another helpful way. 
It also helps. 
One of the things that happens as we pay attention to the breath is for some people that's kind of soporific. 
Get nice and comfortable with the breath and then gone. 
And so that's happening to you. 
Take a deeper in-breath and a shorter out-breath so that you're activating your sympathetic nervous system. 
You're bringing more energy in. 
So deeper in-breath, shorter out-breath. 
If you're restless, then you want to slow a longer out-breath. 
And that's calming. 
So you can use the breath to help regulate the energy. 
And if you're restless, just to have a sense of giving yourself some more space. 
Those are just some things that can help. 
And we'll be continuing today with mindfulness. 
And really, the encouragement is, when we ring the bell, when you hear the bell at the end of the sitting, it doesn't mean, ah, break time. 
I can stop being mindful. 
It means, please continue. 
So it means, see if you can keep the continuity of being present. 
And as you get up to walk, you're present with the body. 
You're really staying in your body. 
Whatever you're doing, seeing if you can be present in your body. 
And when you notice your mind getting drawn into stories or whatever, as soon as you notice, reconnecting with what's here. 
So that the more continuous we can be with our mindfulness, the more the practice will build and the more the stillness will build. 
But to do that in a relaxed way. 
So it's not, oh, I'm not being mindful. 
I should be mindful. 
But more, oh, what am I aware of right now? Am I present? So remember, in the instruction the Buddha said to notice, is this a mindful moment or an unmindful moment? But not to add a judgment just to know. 
And so that will help support our practice as we continue throughout the day. 
So I'm going to turn that over to Gil for some walking instruction.
