 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome to this evening. We're glad to be with you. My name's Liz Powell, and I am happy to be substituting for Nikki and Diana and getting a chance to practice these wonderful happy hour practices. So, I just want to start here by saying one of the things I really appreciate about the practices that are done on this happy hour time is loving kindness, compassion practice, all of what are called the divine abodes, these two, and also sympathetic joy and equanimity. One of the things I love about them is that they unfold and advance our practice in so many different ways. So one thing they do is they show us all the old unhelpful conditioning of the heart and mind. As we notice what comes up, as we say the practices, may you be happy, may you be healthy, may you be safe and free from harm, may you be free from suffering. Sometimes we notice other feelings, things that are not those feelings, but older unhelpful things in relationship to the person to whom we're extending these kind wishes. And it could be even about ourselves. When we say it for ourselves, that's hard for some people. They notice things about themselves they don't like. Or when we say it for a friend who is a good friend, but sometimes there have been things that have not gone great, or a difficult person, or even a group of people. So we might be saying, may you be happy, but thinking about the unhappiness we've suffered in reaction to specific behaviors, or we might say may you be safe and free from harm, all the while we're so aware of harm that this particular person, whether it's ourself or someone else, has engaged in. So these may be fleeting, just small feelings or thoughts, but it's worth noticing where we're still caught before we return the attention to the loving kindness or the compassion phrases or just the feeling. Because when we see how we might still be, have some old conditioning or some attitude towards someone else or ourselves, it's helpful to just recognize it. That's part of the deconditioning of it or the unconditioning of it, and the movement towards freedom. And a wonderful thing is as we become more free of suffering, more aimed towards these beautiful virtues, this kindness, this compassion, sometimes any negativity we have felt in the past about someone or about ourselves actually falls away entirely. And we can reach a point, this practice develops us to a point where we're able to feel kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity towards others who might have been difficult for us in the past. Another thing this practice does is to develop stability of mind. So it counters the mind's tendency to be distractible, to be preoccupied with what Ajahn Succito refers to as life's floods. And the way he defines that is the feeling of being swept along by events, by the sense of being overwhelmed by and even going under a tide of worries, duties and pressures. So no matter where the mind goes, when it drifts from these practices and goes towards perhaps these floods, we can be mindful when it comes back and mindful that it went there and not make a bigger problem out of it. It's just old conditioning arising. And as we come back and come back and come back, this is developing stability of mind. We get to see the habits and maybe even with greater detachment over time. We don't at first, we're like, ah, you know, there my mind went. And later we just, we just see it. This is what's happening. This is what the thinking mind does. This is what old conditioning does. And when we gently bring the mind back to wishes of loving kindness or compassion, we're cultivating the ability to have the mind be where we want it to go. And the more we bring the mind back to our purpose, the more stable it becomes. This takes us more and more deeply into the state that's sometimes called concentration. When we return again and again to the same object of meditation, in this case, let's say loving kindness phrases, it's a method of settling the mind, collecting it, focusing it. And these kinds of stable collected mental states are the ones that often lead to insight, like, oh, now I see it. Wisdom, especially when they're balanced with the practice at other times of being aware of what's arising moment to moment. And this actually cultivates us towards freedom. Another advantage, so today I was thinking of all the advantages of these practices. Another advantage is that we can take some comfort in the fact that while our minds are focused, while we're really engaged in saying phrases or feeling feelings of loving kindness or compassion, the hindrances are temporarily absent. So there's no greed, aversion, restlessness, regret, sluggishness, doubt. They aren't present when we're fully focused on these intentions and wishes of loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity. And that gives us a taste of what it's like to be free of these unwholesome roots of greed, and delusion. So not only are the hindrances not present, but often we're actually cultivating through this practice what are called the 10 perfections or the paramese. And they are generosity, ethics, renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience, truthfulness, resolve, loving kindness, and equanimity, which are actually part of what we're practicing. So I'm going to repeat them slowly and see if you can touch into that sense of how when you're saying loving kindness phrases, you might actually be experiencing, for example, generosity. Or you might be experiencing letting go of something less helpful in favor of something more helpful, which is symbolized by the word renunciation. As you're saying these practices, maybe you're having an experience actually of wisdom. It's perhaps more wise to wish others well than to wish negativity towards them. These are good examples of a wise use of energy. As we say these phrases, we can experience patience. There is embedded in them truthfulness. So maybe as we're practicing this evening, in addition to extending the kindness, the compassion towards others, we may have an opportunity to see some of these other qualities that we're cultivating as we do this practice. So perhaps as you settle into your body and helpful meditation posture, the feeling whatever is present for you in body, heart, and mind, and perhaps also recognizing the ways in which you're being generous to yourself and to other people by cultivating this meditation, this stability. May I be generous with myself and others. Might allow yourself to repeat that phrase mentally or take it in on a feeling level. May I be generous with myself and others. Helping yourself to feel anything that you've given up or let go of this evening in favor of practicing something that is cultivating an even greater good within you. Having the choice to be here and meditate with each other, you're moving towards something that is creating a positive state and kindness and compassion. May I release less helpful activities or more wholesome activities, cultivating kindness, creating compassion. Perhaps this is part of being kinder and more compassionate to yourself and others. If the mind drifts off as you're meditating and then awareness comes back, if you were distracted and came back, you're practicing letting go of a lesser, less helpful state in favor of a more helpful, more wholesome state of mind. In a way, you're allowing energy to flow from intentions in the mind to the heart. And both from there, sometimes into action, the helpful wish for yourself or for another person. May I allow my energy in meditation to cultivate more wholesome conditions, cultivating kindness and more making things better whatever is arising as you meditate being truthful with yourself receiving and allowing whatever is true in the body, in the heart, in the mind right now seeing things as they are may I see my experience truthfully as it actually is mindfulness itself awareness itself is not judgmental seeing the truth as it arises is kindness, it's compassionate you are not you are not you are not you are not you are not every time awareness comes back and you are mindful of what is arising now you are strengthening resolve or determination coming back to kindness, coming back to compassion again and again may I strengthen these qualities of kindness compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity simply by returning to them over and over so if any of those qualities resonated for you as you say phrases of loving kindness this evening or feel intentions of loving kindness towards yourself or towards another person perhaps noticing the presence of that quality as you wish yourself or another may you be healthy may you be happy may you be safe and free from harm may you be free from suffering extending these wishes in whatever way is right for you very quietly in the mind or as a feeling and in whatever way you'd like to say them wishing yourself or another person these beautiful qualities these kindnesses as we continue in silent meditation you you you and if the mind is distracted knowing that every time you bring it back or it comes back to awareness you're cultivating the pathway towards freedom from suffering you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you as we come toward the end of this meditation in the last few minutes perhaps appreciating any qualities any helpful qualities that came up for you in your meditation appreciating any kind wishes you extended to yourself and to others appreciating that every time you came back from being distracted to the practice you were cultivating more wholesome conditions letting go of old unhelpful habits perhaps appreciating the stability of mind or collectedness of mind perhaps even deep peace or concentration came to you or perhaps you noticed qualities in your meditation truthfulness generosity determination any qualities that you realized you were developing just taking a few moments to appreciate those and if you notice difficulty appreciating that awareness truthfully showed you what was arising here and now and that mindfulness and awareness do not judge they accept whatever is showing itself being mindful of it is more useful than being caught in it No Thanks for watching. Well, it can take time to recognize any of these qualities or these benefits of practice. And for quite a long time, perhaps we just dedicate ourselves to practicing. And then later, some of these things become more apparent as they unfold. But now what I'd like to do is be able to send you into small breakout groups of two or three people so that you have time to discuss and be inspired by one another, be stimulated in hearing one another, you have time to discuss how your practice is going or anything that came up for you this evening that was significant. And as usual, in sharing in small groups, what we'll do is we will just share one thing at a time and listen deeply to the other people without advice, without commentary, just allowing yourself to notice what you're hearing and also what's going on inside of you. And then when it's your turn, share another point. So we'll do this for about 15 minutes and enjoy the groups. Don't worry if you end up in a group alone, in a room alone, I will find you and I will send you to a group that has people in it. So enjoy the time. Welcome back. It's only me because I was in a room by myself. Are you kidding? I'm so sorry. Actually, somebody else had come back. I thought I had found everybody and put them in a room with each other. No. I think the future announced that they leave because I think it's pretty rude that people leave and then the groups get discombobulated. Yeah. Okay. I see where you were in room 10. Yeah, by myself. I'm sorry, Michael, I won't let that happen again. Please don't be. My group was so lovely last night that my happiness seeds were watered for tonight. So it's just like a gentle interaction. Yes. Very gentle. I completely understand. So we now have a few minutes and if you'd like to share, Michael, if you'd like to share any thoughts or questions that you didn't get a chance to share this evening and anyone else who would like to unmute or raise their hand and share anything. Stephanie, please. So my group was great as usual. I was a share. It's interesting that when my mind wanders in meditation and wanders to the negative events of the day rather than the positive ones. Really good to notice. You know, these habits of mind that we get into over decades of time. Right. It's like you come. Well, I come to meditation to try to like, you know, call the mind and body after difficult experiences. And then when the mind wanders, it goes right back. Yeah. Well, I would bet you anything. You are not alone in that. Because sometimes the mind wants to try and solve it, you know, right back to it. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Kate, please. Hi. Nice to be here. I just had a question. I was wondering if you had any advice around this thing that comes up to me, which is sometimes when I bring up a person to practice with, I have a sense of and it often happens if I'm not in a particularly pleasant headspace. I have a feeling of kind of like not wanting to give away, not wanting to give away something good because I feel like I need it for myself. And yeah, I was just wondering if you had any advice for working with that. Well, first of all, you're doing this is really good that you're noticing that. And you know, you may even wish at that moment to alternate, you know, say it for yourself, send the good wish to yourself and then send a good wish to the other person and send that say the wish for yourself and then say it for the other person or spend a little time saying it for yourself first until the heart feels more full and then say it for the other person. Because sometimes, you know, we've been conditioned in such a way that this has been the last person that we've sent kindness towards and it's good to go ahead and do that. So I hope that's somewhat helpful and you can experiment, but your mindfulness is great because you're noticing what's up and then you can work with that. Even seeing that is useful. Thank you. Thank you. And Jamie, please. I have something brief I'd like to say and then a request. And what I'd like to say is I have how grateful I am to have you be part of happy hour and how meaningful this was tonight. So thank you for your teaching and guidance. And the modest request is I thought the quote from Ajahn Suchito was just beautiful. And Neil just does such a magnificent job of getting those into the Google Doc. And I would be grateful if you could help him do that. Yes, let me find it and put it there. Thank you. Yes, you're welcome. Okay. Ajahn Suchito, you are in here somewhere. So just hang out for a moment. Neil doesn't have my. No, hurry. No, hurry. Yeah. Thank you. There we go. Thank you for your patience, everyone. While I copy this. Oh, I didn't mean right now. Well, you know what? It's actually it's fine to do it right now because in a moment we'll be we won't be seeing each other and Neil doesn't have this necessarily. And I mean, he's a very quick study, so he might have picked it up. But here it is. See if you've got it. Got that? Okay, great. So and once again, it's time to unmute and say good night and thank one another. Thank you all very much for your practice. It's been a pleasure. See you on Thursday. Thank you. Thank you. Good night. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Well, thank you. Good night. Good night. Good night, Wayne. Good night. Good night. No, no, no, no, no. Good night, friend. Thank you. Thank you.
