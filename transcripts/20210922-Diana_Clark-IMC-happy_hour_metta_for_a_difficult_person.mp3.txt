 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So again, a really warm welcome, everybody. It's nice to see you all. And tonight I want to talk a little bit about loving kindness for a difficult person. And I haven't really talked about this or taught about it very much, kind of in the way that I was trained and the way that I've practiced. I was really focusing on where it's easy. And then when time is right, so to speak, then when our hearts are overflowing with loving kindness, then we can do it with a difficult person. So instead of trying to force ourselves to do it, just allowing it to... Actually, I do have this kind of idea in my mind, actually, I've kind of got water flows or overflows, so kinds of when matter is overflowing with our hearts because we've been practicing. It's easier than a leak out, so to speak, for a difficult person. But I kind of stumbled upon Tanisaro Biko, Tanjaf Ajahn Tanisaro. Probably many of you know him. He's a well-known translator, right? And I stumbled upon some of the way that he teaches loving kindness, and he has a different approach that I appreciate. And so I wanted to share that with you all, share with this, kind of like maybe just a little bit different take on it. But one thing is that to both approach this with the heart and with the mind, and if we wanted to make these distinctions, and one is to just consider that sometimes part of the reason why it's difficult to have loving kindness or a difficult person, somebody who's caused us difficulties, hurt us, whether it was intentionally or not, is sometimes we feel like, well, I don't really want them to be happy. Maybe that's, you know, just the way it is. Maybe there's a part of our heart that just doesn't really want them to. But if we think about this, if we think about this, that if our happiness, so to speak, so not our complete happiness, but if our preferences, let's just say, we can call them that. If our preferences somehow tied up with these difficult people not being happy, we probably don't have this clearly articulated in our minds, right? If people who come in and are meditators, we don't want people to be unhappy. But it's just a little bit this, maybe not wanting them to be happy. Something that Tom Jeff points out is that, well, if we have, if this is our preference, then of course, it's not going to be satisfied because everybody wants to be happy. So people will be working towards making themselves happy. And if we have this little part of us that kind of doesn't really want them to be happy, then we're going to be disappointed because the difficult person is trying to make themselves happy, just like everybody else. So, oh, okay, so that's one way to kind of like cognitively think about it, is that, oh, this doesn't really make sense. We're, you know, destined to be thwarted, so to speak. But another way is that he changes the phrases for a difficult person. He uses different phrases, phrases that really allow people to not feel like there's any hypocrisy or to not feel, I don't know, too stretched or too disconnected or contrived. And that is, he recommends, first of all, that we kind of think of the word goodwill, as opposed to loving kindness, maybe loving kindness is too high of a bar. Good will, especially for difficult people. And to use a phrase like this, may this person understand the causes for true happiness. And may they be willing and able to act on those causes. So we can find that maybe implicit in this is that these individuals maybe would have an aha moment or learn something new or have a greater understanding in a way that supports their happiness. Maybe supports all of our happiness others as well. So, I thought we'd practice with this today. Because all of us, I mean, like the heart, it just feels better if our heart has a way that it can not be constrained or constricted or only. We have goodwill towards these people but not these other people right that doesn't feel so good. It's better to have this feeling of everybody's invited to our goodwill. Okay, so, a little bit of loving kindness practice I'm thinking, of course, there's always an invitation for you to use phrases that are resonate for you. That makes sense for you. I'm offering these classic ones. I was trained this way, I practice this way. I found benefit this way but you know, doesn't mean it all works for you necessarily. So, but I'll offer in the beginning, kind of the classic phrases and then for the difficult person will switch over to this one but maybe you want to explore using this phrase for everybody. So, just remind you, made this person understand that causes for true happiness. I think, maybe I'll just riff on a moment on this idea, true happiness. To really highlight, it's not about pleasure. It's about some real authentic happiness. And may the difficult person understand that what true happiness is about. So may they understand the causes, and may they be willing and able to act on those causes. So, let's begin just with a little bit of mindfulness, just to connect it to the body, so that this can be a support. If ever it feels like the loving kindness, everything except loving kindness is arising. It's helpful to have been already connected to the body, so that the body can be a support, be a foundation, can be grounding. Maybe I'll say it's especially important if we're going to be doing meta for difficult people. It might be, but the injury is the harm that they caused is still too raw. Maybe there's still a lot of anger. Maybe it's now is not the time to do it, to do meta for them. And if so, can just always come back to this to mindfulness breathing, or do meta where it's easy. Just connecting with the felt sense of being here in this moment. Feeling the body, maybe globally. Does it feel, get us the right amount of energy, not too much, not too little, but close enough to the right amount, so you can stay alert. But not feel itching to get up off the seat. As we tune into the body, we notice the body is breathing. Just resting our attention on the sensations of breathing. When the mind wanders, just with a warm heart, with care, just begin again with the sensations of breathing. Thank you. And then to begin our loving kindness practice, bringing to mind a lovable being, someone for whom it's easy and uncomplicated to feel this warmth, care, friendliness, goodwill, love, benevolence. Choose whichever words resonate for you. And connect with this lovable being. Whether they are somebody in your life that you have a relationship with, a simple and complicated relationship. Somebody who has touched you, inspired you, maybe with their talks or their writings, but you don't necessarily have a relationship with them. Maybe furry creatures, kittens and puppies. Maybe completely imaginary. Just bringing the lovable being to mind. You can start with the classic phrases. May you be safe. May you be healthy. And rest with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. Thank you. Allowing ourselves to feel that warm heartedness that we have for this lovable being. Are there any physical sensations, sensations in the body that go with this warm heartedness? Maybe a sense of spaciousness, maybe a little bit of energy of delight. Maybe some warmth. Perfectly fine if it's not there. But if it is, allowing that to be a support. Maybe some fuel for that loving kindness, for the mental. Just stay here with the lovable being for a little bit. Thank you. Connecting with that lovable being, visualizing them, or maybe there's another way that you feel connected with them. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. Thank you. Thank you. And then to expand our loving kindness, our metta, to include ourselves. Always want to include ourselves. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. Is there a way in which we can settle in to some loving kindness for ourselves? If it feels difficult or uncomfortable, you can stretch yourself a little bit and try to stay with it or you can just go back to the lovable being. There is no particular timetable for any of this. It's an exercise of tuning in to feeling our way with what's best for us right now. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. Can expand to maybe those that you don't know. You have a neutral feeling. Could be somebody that's on this Zoom call that you don't know. Maybe somebody you see in the neighborhood. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May you live with ease. May I be healthy. Now let's do a difficult person. Let's not start with the most difficult. Somebody who's a little bit troubling. Bringing them to mind. May you understand the causes for true happiness. And may you be willing and able to act on those causes. May you understand the causes for true happiness. May you understand the causes for true happiness. May you understand the causes for true happiness. May you understand the causes for true happiness. May you understand the causes for true happiness. May you understand the causes for true happiness. May you understand the causes for true happiness. Whatever's the right place for you today. Thank you. May you understand the causes for true happiness. And may you be willing and able to act on those causes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then to end this meditation. Feel your feet on the ground. Feel the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body. And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes. So this idea of having different phrases for difficult person, or maybe kind of use those phrases for everybody. Kind of really linking the, making explicit disconnection between actions, things that we do, and how it brings happiness. So instead of just saying, may you be happy. May you put in place those things, whatever they might be. That can support happiness. So maybe that's something you can explore for yourself, whether these kind of the classic phrases or for everybody, or to use these different phrases that really add this emphasis on the causes and conditions for happiness. I'm putting those in place as well as an understanding. Right. This is like, may you understand, like me. Often we learn things. This type of thing, right? From our own experience. Maybe people can point us in a certain direction or maybe. I don't remember books or something like this, but. What would it take for people to understand. What would be needed for them to understand. What causes a true happiness. So. I'd like to put you in some breakout rooms where you can have an opportunity to talk about this, maybe this alternative way of considering. And I'm using the word, so that we can, you know, it doesn't have to be loving kindness. Maybe it's just good will or the absence of ill will. Maybe it's just something like this. So it can be helpful just to say one point. And I'll let it go to the next person. And then. They say one point and then it goes to the next person. So that. It's not just. One person speaking for a long time and everybody else looking at the clock, wondering if they're going to have enough time. So we'll meet for. About 14 minutes and here we go. Okay. So welcome back. Welcome back. We have a comment or a question or something they'd like to share or say. How was that? These different phrases, do I love a kindness for a difficult person? Richard. Can you hear me? Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The first thing I said in the, in our little group, which is that. The phrases you, the interest tonight, there are two good to just leave to the. Difficult person that. We ourselves and all of our friends are. Worthy of. Finding the source. The ability to act on. The way that you do that. You do that. You do that. You do that. You do that. You do that. That's nice. Great. I'm glad that you found them helpful. Maybe those will be the new way that you do. I'm a kindness practice now. Fantastic. Thank you, Richard. Malayla. Hi, I'm Malaya. Yes. So I thought that this approach to. I think that, you know, I think it just made me feel like it just kind of interesting towards a difficult person. I feel like it was like more gentle. And more understanding of how maybe different people who are practicing. Might have like, associated with the person who they have are experiencing difficulty with. And I feel like, I feel like what helped like I tried like, I tried at first doing this with somebody who I feel like is a difficult person in my life, but not the most difficult. And then I heard you say, Oh, well, you know, you could also just try to like, just try to dip your toe in or something a little bit with the most difficult person and then just see how it feels. Just try it. And then I did that and I ended up doing it like longer, like with that, that this exercise longer with this difficult person. And I feel like it really helped because it helped me actually like detach more from their actions and how their actions have affected me. And then see how the way that they treat, they treated me, it's more about them than about me. That actually like they need to learn some of these actions, these actions, like and the causes of your happiness. So that way they could be a whole person. Yeah. And then I ended up starting to beginning like a little bit to want that for them. In that direction. Oh, that's great. I'm happy to hear that. So that there was a little bit of a shift. Fantastic with this. Great, great. Thank you for sharing that Malayo. Harry. Hi, I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed those words. They are definitely softer. It's an easier approach to get into dealing with somebody difficult as generally, if that person, if it's been like a recency thing, then I can feel the emotion pull me down, you know, during the loving kindness. So this, this was a nice little elevation from that. And I really enjoyed the fact that it's, it's about understanding and growth. And I can get behind wishing for understanding and growth for anybody. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Perry. Thank you. I like you. Understanding and growth, right? We all want that for everybody, right? Why wouldn't we? I think that's, I appreciate very much what you said. You can get behind that. Yeah. That's kind of was my feeling too. Like, of course we can get it's, I shouldn't say of course, but it's just so much easier to get behind that. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Perry. We're a few minutes over, but I'm willing to stay if there's others that want to share or talk about kind of this different way to, to do the loving kindness or difficult person. If you feel like there's Neil. So loving kindness is like a strange word, right? It's really not a word in the English vernacular. So how much positive emotion do you, you know, right? I mean, you know, is, you know, something more than neutral, loving kindness, you know, or I mean, does it have to be, you know, like a 10 out of 10? I love this Neil. It has to be 11 out of 10 in order for it to count. No, I agree. I think, yeah. So Wayne says yes to go. So thank you, Wayne. Thank you. I know a number of you may need to go. I know it's three minutes after the hour here. I think that I appreciate very much that tennis, Robicu is highlighting just use goodwill. Loving kindness is too high of a bar. Just use goodwill. And then in some ways, we might even think about goodwill as maybe just the absence of ill will. So I appreciate this very much that it doesn't have to be in filled with emotion or intensity. And often you may know this that right mettak practice is prescribed quote unquote as an antidote for ill will. So it's just as a way to cool the flames of anger or this tiny little bit. We want them to suffer because we're suffering so much or something like that. You know, it's just to cool those flames so it doesn't have to be full of emotion. That's my view. And I think that's and maybe I'll just add one last thing there. And we shouldn't expect that we're going to feel the same thing for all these different categories of people too. So even though for the lovable being, we might have one experience. And for the difficult person will have another experience. But we're just looking as a way to create the conditions in which our own hearts might be free of ill will and things that cause it to get constricted and stuck. Is that helpful? Very much. Thank you. Okay, I was I was just gonna say that I said in my small group that that this phrase that you gave us seems to me to be a really great phrase for equanimity practice for somebody I care about. Because I you know, I have this 27 year old nephew who is suffering with the same self hatred and high anxiety that I had at his age. And he's really, really, really suffering. And I feel and I feel and I just and my helplessness, my feeling of helplessness just eats me alive. And this is like a kind of an equanimity phrase. Yeah, yeah. Right. Kind of recognizes that they have the power to make their lives more happiness or less happiness, no matter what we're wishing for them. It's actually their actions that make the difference. Yeah. Thank you, Christine. Thank you. Okay. Okay. So may you all understand the causes of true happiness. And may coming here practice together sharing this practice may be that can help support you in the causes and conditions for finding some happiness. So if we can maybe we'll take in a mute and say good night. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Good night. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
