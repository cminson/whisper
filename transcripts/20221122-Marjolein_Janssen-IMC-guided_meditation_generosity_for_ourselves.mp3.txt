 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So we can settle in to our meditation posture, make any adjustments that you need. This sits in a comfortable way, to your back somewhat straight if possible. Tuning into the body. Feeling what's here right now. Just kind of landing in this present moment. And the feet touching the floor, or maybe touch something else but the contacts there. Feeling the buttocks touching. Let's be needed, chair, meditation cushion, bench. And feeling where the hands touch. Maybe they touch each other, maybe they touch your knees. Aware of touch. You can be aware of the mind as well. What is happening in the mind right now? Maybe there are lots of thoughts stumbling over each other, restlessness. Maybe it's calm and spacious. Just awareness of what is happening. I'm going to invite the body and the mind to relax. May the body relax. May the mind relax. That's just a gentle invitation. Doesn't have to happen. At the beginning of the meditation like this we can reflect on that. Meditating is truly a generous gift to ourselves. Becoming aware of what is happening in body and mind. We're opening to our lives just the way it is in this moment. And we're letting things just be the way they are. A lot of wholesomeness in this is a true gift to ourselves. By cultivating this wholesomeness, we're also generous towards other people and beings. So we can rejoice in the generosity that this meditation brings ourselves and others. This can help us to settle in even more, is rejoicing this generosity and gratitude. May help us to open to also more difficult things. Maybe a difficult mood, emotion, or pain in the body. So let's continue in silence, opening to whatever is present in this moment. Being generous towards ourselves, for opening up to all that is arising in our experience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Let's take a moment towards the end of the meditation to see if there's any gratefulness maybe coming up, some gratitude for taking the time to meditate today. This generosity that we've offered ourselves by being present for each moment. Maybe some gratitude towards the others present here, the Zoom room for being able to sit in community, being able to sit together, supporting each other. Maybe also some gratitude for those who are listening to this recording afterwards, for their practice, their willingness to open to each moment, and those listening afterwards for those present here and now. Thank you. Maybe now that we're still a bit in the stillness of the meditation, we can share some well-wishes for each other here on Zoom and those listening afterwards. From our heart we can send the wish, may we all be happy. May we all be healthy. May we all know peace. Thank you.
