 So again, I have the pleasure of being with you. Always nice to be with this group. I really appreciate the invitation to come here. And tonight I wanted to talk about the meditation practice itself. Just kind of giving a sense, inviting some reflection on what it is that we're doing and why and what it affects over time. I think it's very good to contemplate this. Certainly for many years as meditators, you might find yourself several years after your first meditation retreat just going about, what am I doing and why and what's going on with all this? And that's not uncommon and certainly not anything to be embarrassed about. I think what the Buddhist teachings and practices offer is really a radical shifting in our consciousness, a radical shifting in the way that we look at things. And so you have to know that that is a process in itself and that it's going to take some time to understand what he's talking about and what it is affecting. So we turn to the main teaching on the meditation practice itself, the Satipatthana Sutta. Very important, unbelievable teaching. I think actually from my perspective it's probably the most important sutta in the Pali Canon. In fact, Ajahnamurra said that, I don't know his source for this, but he said at one time that towards the end of his life the Buddha said that he could have taught this teaching and nothing else and he could have spent his whole life just teaching this. It was so rich and so important and so profound. So given that, it merits a lot of reflection. I won't go into a whole lot of detail about what the teaching says. I'm trying to get more sense of the feeling of it and what it's directing in my reflections tonight. But just consider what goes on in the meditation practice. So you sit down and the way he describes it is you go into the forest and sit at the root of a tree, set up mindfulness before you. That's the description. But the essence of that, just feel what's being said in that. In a way, it's an invitation to sort of withdraw from the usual everyday stuff and establish yourself in a quiet place and in a quiet state of mind. Very important because I think we often skip over. When he says set up mindfulness before you, then right away, and I think this is just us as Westerners, I've got to be mindful. I've got to get mindful. I've got to look. I've got to see what's going on. We pick up on that setting up mindfulness before you bit and forget about the relaxing, withdrawing, getting settled, all of that. It's very important to see the relationship between these two aspects of practice. Part of it is getting relaxed and settled and what that affects. Just feel that. What that affects is within a very short period of time, if you're actually getting settled, you begin to notice more. So mindfulness is sort of like a byproduct of samadhi. Mindfulness just happens. You can make it happen. I like to come at it this way. It seems to be more what he's saying. To me, it's a little easier just to settle down, let the fallout fall. Let the events of the day and all of the things that you're thinking about just kind of settle out and relax. Be at ease and then, lo and behold, you're noticing what's going on. One of the first things that you notice is that you're breathing. You can go and pick up the breath too soon before you've actually gotten settled and relaxed and before the awareness has, the mindfulness has sort of arisen of its own accord. Do you know what I mean? So just noticing that can be very, very helpful because I think we have to understand mindfulness and concentration for ourselves very clearly. Don't worry about the techniques and what to do with them. Find out what they even are first. Find out what the experience of being relaxed and aware is and learn how to settle within that. When we do that, and this is where the sutta is so brilliant, I think, you begin to notice that there's things going on in the body, sensations. One of the first things you notice is the breath, for example. You might notice different things that are going on like pain or discomfort, disease in the body. You begin to notice that there's sort of a preoccupation in the mind with things that feel good and things that don't feel good. Pleasure and pain. You know, you can sit there the whole meditation period and that's really all that you're doing is going back and forth between likes and dislikes, you know, pleasures and pains in the mind. You notice that there's a lot of thinking going on. I mean, let's be honest. A lot of meditation periods are just sitting here thinking about things, aren't they? You know, it's just that there's a lot of thought going on. So this is, the Buddha is very clear on this. This is, these are the first three foundations of mindfulness. You begin to become aware of the body, you become aware of feeling and you become aware of thought. That's really all that's going on. That's really all there is. So it's interesting, he's kind of getting that on the table right here, right now. But in the unawakened state or in a state of mind that is just sort of preoccupied with all of this, then what's going on is that all of the experience at those levels is just a huge muddle. You know, it's like we're not even aware of discrete moments of sensation, feeling and thought. They're just kind of all running into each other and creating reactive patterns. You know, we get completely caught up in it. It's a muddle. You don't see how one is leading to the other, to the other. So like for example, one of the rude awakenings when you go on retreat or as you begin to meditate more intensively is that you begin to notice, say for example, one of the big events of the day is the meal. So you go to get your meal and you might have all the great intention of being present and alert and mindful and attentive to that process. But as you approach the dining hall, you smell things, you start thinking about the things that it might be or you look at things and things that you like and then the mind starts to proliferate about all of this. Before you know it, you're at the end of the food line with this huge, you know, it's like where did all this food come from? It's like a building and a proliferating about experience where it's sort of like living life in essence on automatic pilot. What's driving the mechanism is not seeing and discerning the discrete aspects of experience that I smelled something, I liked it and I thought great, let me get more. All of that just kind of blurs together, doesn't it? And we're living life on automatic pilot. Or like, you know, another example might be like if you're sometimes you might notice, for example, or maybe you don't notice that there's some kind of subtle small pain in the body and you find yourself in a grumpy mood, irritated or maybe you didn't get enough sleep, you know, and automatically that's experience of an unpleasant state. And then we go on about it, you know, and the mind is actually moves into a mood about a condition because it's not seeing what's going on, you know? Essentially, in the unawakened state, we're just at the mercy of this constant stream of sensations, feelings and thoughts and the content of the thoughts and a lot of it is greed, hatred and delusion. You know, a lot of it is grabbing hold of experience, hating it, wanting more of it and just ignoring it. So I mean, that's the condition, that's what we find ourselves in. So just with these, with meditation, just consider what this instruction is saying. The Buddha is pointing to these discrete aspects of experience, sensations, feelings and thoughts and inviting a new way of being with that, inviting us to just notice the language of the sutra is see the body as the body, see feeling as feeling, seeing thought or mental phenomenon as that. You know, it's interesting choice of words, but what he's saying is don't make it more than that. When you whittle down experience and separate it out into its discrete parts and just learn to leave it at that, let things take place at the level at which they're happening. So one of the words, one of the language that he uses is to sort of leave it in its own domain. You know, this is a physical event. So yeah, it might be pleasant and yeah, that might make me think I want more, but that's actually not what's going on with eating, for example. You know, eating is an experience that has to do with nourishing the body. It's pleasant. And when it's pleasant, we pig out and then we suffer. So the idea is to kind of unravel that. And you see the different bits that are going on in that so that we're not at the mercy of it. So that, you know, the mercy of our patterns and habits and impulses, these reactive patterns to our experience. So see the body as the body, see feeling as feeling, see mental phenomena as mental phenomena. And just that, I mean, really, if that's what, if that's as far as we go with our understanding of the Buddha's instruction and the meditation, it's huge. That would be huge just to let experience be what it is, you know, without getting caught. If you can just feel that there's a tremendous peace that would begin to be established in our being. You know, you don't, you don't have to go bonkers over things that are unpleasant, not to become piggy or coarse about things that are pleasant, and not to get lost in constant proliferative states, but just seeing them as that much. Now, you know, to me, gradually, over the months and years of practice, you know, even if you're only applying yourself a little bit, you've got to be noticing that there is a lot more sense of relaxed, accepting, easeful moods in the mind. And a lot of it is just coming from sorting out experience at these levels. You know, if you do that, you just, you get to a place where you just chill out and you accept life on its terms. Sometimes it's pleasant, sometimes it's not, sometimes there's this sensation, then it's going to go away. You know, even our own mental state, sometimes we get in these crazy states of mind, but they're just that, they're just a risen phenomenon and they move through the system if you don't grab hold. So, I mean, that's huge, just noticing that. But, and it's interesting, consider what the mechanism that's operating in all of that, what he's actually setting up in this kind of training is the cultivation, the development of a new way of relating to these discrete aspects of our experience. And that way is like to know our experience more objectively, to know it with more detachment, to know it in a more impartial way. Can you feel that? And so that, the interesting thing is, I think a lot of people, we can get crazy ideas about detachment or non-attachment, you know, as an idea in our Western mindset that connotes this sense of like an indifference, you know, or, oh, I'm not attached, you know, that, I'm not moved by that experience, you know. But really, that's not what is being affected at all. Just notice in your own practice what the actual experience of non-attachment is and what it affects, because it, far from being something that separates you from experience, it actually connects us with what's happening. You're actually, what you're detaching from is making more of it than it is. So that non-attachment or detachment, whatever word you choose, the effect of that is to feel it, to be with life, to connect. Can you feel it? It's like you're actually in it more fully. So I mean, that's far out, you know. What he's affecting is a presence, a presence of mind, a capacity to not quarrel with what's going on, you know. Just to let it be, to feel it, to know it, and not have a quarrel with it. I just find that a very good, a very helpful reflection, just that in and of itself. So then consider over the months and years of practice what that new relationship with our experience is going to affect. One of the main things you notice as a meditator is that you are going to begin to free up a tremendous amount of energy. It's like it takes so much energy to be out to lunch, you know. It takes so much energy to constantly be grabbing at things and going on about what's happening and fighting it and resisting it and wanting more of it, you know. I mean, that's where we live most of the time. Let's be honest, that's where we are. So you know, the practice is affecting a release of that pattern, patterning, that way of being with things. And you know, in a way, some people report it's a little scary how much energy you begin to have, you know, because we're not so preoccupied. So you know, just one of the things I've noticed on this is that another way of saying that is that what you're freeing up is self-absorption. You know, what you're breaking away from is the habit of being preoccupied with what's going on with your body and mind. You know, that's self-absorption. Buddha called it self-view, you know, and that is the cause of tremendous suffering in our experience. So you know, you're actually breaking that habit of self-absorption. And it's like the capacity of the mind to be picking up things all the time and caught up in it. So here again, you know, that will free up a tremendous amount of energy. And the effect of that is that you begin to look at the mind from a whole different vantage point. You know, if we're not preoccupied with the content of it, then what happens is it enables a dropping out of experience or being preoccupied with experience so that one can look at it. You know, if you can't stop thinking about things, then you can't know thought. You know, if you can't stop being preoccupied with things that are with pleasure and pain, then you can't know pleasure and pain. The mind has the capacity to know what's going on within itself. This is so far out. This is one of the qualities that makes human birth so incredibly fortunate. You know, the Buddha talks a lot about human birth being extremely fortunate. And why that is, is that it's almost as if we, because of our apparatus, because of the way this mind and body operate, we're hardwired for enlightenment. You know, you've got the hardware. And that hardware is that this mind, it's the weirdest thing, but it has the capacity to look at itself. It has the capacity to know what is going on within its own experience. That's wild. And so what we're freeing up is that capacity, because we're going to use that to reflect and to come to understand for insight. But essentially, as long as self-view is strong, that reflective quality is the same mechanism. It's completely used up thinking about ourselves. It's completely exhausted in that endeavor. So now, through this process of the first three foundations of mindfulness separating out from experience at these levels, we have freed that up. And what it enables, what gets engaged then, it's like the mind starts to go, what's going on here? How did I get in this hateful state? Up until that point, we're not doing that. We're just in it. Hateful states come up, and you're completely at the mercy of it. All you can do is hate. All you can do is be angry. All you can do is be greedy or restless or anxious, stressed out, slothful, confused. The hindrances are really what dominate our experience. But now, if even just a little bit is moved to a more detached perspective, then you will automatically begin to reflect on what your experience is. And that's where the fourth foundation comes in. The fourth foundation of mindfulness is, to me, equals insight, equals reflection, equals understanding. It's happening all along, because the mind will do this, but it's really going to be freed up. The mind will really be freed up to know itself and to understand the more that we're able to be with the body and mind a little bit more impartially. Just consider this capacity of reflection. One of the reasons why I love the teachings of Ajahn Chah is this is the big cornerstone of his teaching. All of the disciples of Ajahn Chah are very, very attuned to, aware of, and make very good use of the contemplation, reflection, this capacity that we have as human beings. And we mean it really in the two senses of the word. You think of reflection like you look in a mirror and you see yourself. That's a reflection. You're seeing, so it's making use of this capacity of the mind to see itself. You reflect, use that capacity. But then also we think of reflection as, in a way, considering, thinking about things, reflecting upon it, so that in that sense then, think thought, a certain kind of thought is very much within the meditation practice. We're not trying not to think, but trying to use thought skillfully. And when it's not self-absorbed, it can be quite skillful. We do this all the time. So it's not foreign. It's not something you don't know about. You already know about this. It's that bit that's sort of wondering how it's happening, how things are happening, and trying to figure things out. It's kind of impartial, has that impartial quality, right? So the practice will engage that. And it will engage it in the interest of uncovering how it is that we're suffering and how to get out of it. You know, that learnt seeing for ourselves the Four Noble Truths. So that in the Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness, the Buddha lists a number of things that essentially we come to see for ourselves. One is the Five Hindrances. And the way that it's described is, you know a mind that is caught in a hindrance. You know how it got there. You know what it takes to get out of it. You know what it takes to stay out of it. And you know what you have to do to prevent it from coming up again. It's so practical. It's so simple. But isn't that what you're doing? Isn't that what we're doing all of the time? Through this process of waking up? Oh man, how did I get so angry? Okay, okay, I see what I did. I didn't like what she said. I went bonkers about it. I couldn't let it go. It just kept feeding itself and feeding itself and feeding itself. And as soon as I saw that and understood it as a phenomenon, the whole thing went away. Or I learned that I couldn't control it. And so I just tried different things like paying attention to something else. Or just trying to push it down in some way. Or just slow the whole thing down. If I could just get a little bearing here. If I could just slow it down, I could see the process. This is all part of the instruction that he gives through various sutas. So he talks about coming to understand that. He talks about coming to see for ourselves the factors of enlightenment, which are these beautiful seven qualities that are present in the mind when we're even modestly awake. So that you begin to see that, wow, when I'm relaxed, at ease, when I'm able to pay attention, when it doesn't matter whether this is happening or that is happening, when I'm interested in what's going on, there's a certain delight in my heart. And I can see clearly. It's not like these lofty states. Just any moment when that's happening, when we're seeing in that way, the factors of enlightenment, they're right there. You can see them. He talks about understanding the sense spaces so that you begin to see for yourselves that how not noticing what's going on, say for example, at the eye, with the eye, can lead us into all kinds of trouble. You're driving down the street, minding your own business, and there's a Pizza Hut sign, and you only vaguely notice that it's there. And then for the next two days, you can't get pizza off your mind. And you've got to, what's the matter with me? I'm obsessed with getting a pizza. But we didn't see it. We didn't see that the eye sees things and the things that we like, and that liking leads to clinging. Didn't see those discrete bits in those kinds of moments. So it's very important to begin to notice what's happening at all the sense stores. And then he talks about understanding the Four Noble Truths. Where it's difficulty, and that there's a way of relating to life when we don't get that, that we're going to make us suffer even more. We're actually uncovering this through our practice, seeing for ourselves very clearly, essentially, what the Buddha saw. That's what's happening. So it's very important, I think, to consider and contemplate the gist of practice. This is what the meditation instruction is, and this is what it's affecting. And the more that we understand that, then the easier it's going to be to do, and the more effective it's going to be. And while we're in the process, perhaps, of garnering that kind of understanding, just to have some faith. Have some faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, which is the fact that it can be done. The fact that people have done this before us. And let that carry us. Let that carry us for a while until we see these things for ourselves. This is very important. So I want to leave some time to see if you have some questions. I have a few more thoughts, but I'm inclined to stop right here and see if there's anything that you want to reflect upon or offer your own thoughts or questions. Yeah? Do you want to do the microphone? They usually pass the microphone for the questions. Oh, no, sorry. Oh, sorry. Okay. That's good. That's good. Yeah. I wonder about personality changes in people. I mean, you know, I've noticed some changes in my personality changes in my personality. And I'm wondering, you know, is that like natural by-product? Is this practice for me to use that people use? Yeah, I guess it depends on what the question is about whether you see personality changes or if it's a by-product. It's funny. I think some of it depends on how you mean personality. I think in a way, aspects of our personality don't change very much at all, you know, even with meditation. And, you know, there's certain like bits about each of us that, you know, I like certain things, you like other things. I don't like certain things, you don't like other different things, you know. And that stuff doesn't change that much. What will change dramatically is what I do when those likes and dislikes come up. So that maybe what you're describing is that when it comes to harmful or extreme likes and dislikes, those soften tremendously, you know, because you see the harm of grabbing, you see the harm of craving and the craving gets overcome. So I think whether it's a personality change or not, I think you see an essential softening, relaxing. So that, yeah, if your personality was anxious and confused, those kinds of extremes are probably going to change. But in terms of more fundamental likes and dislikes and inclinations, those probably aren't going to change that much. Yeah, yeah. I feel good too because I was kind of combining the behaviors with responses to the strategies. Right, right, right. Yeah, like I, you know, I noticed one time, and I think I might have even told this story here, but rather than go into a long story, but just watching over the time of a retreat my relationship with the cups and the bowls right before the food line and like, you know, going through this incredible dramatic change in that relationship, you know, it's like you just at the beginning having to have certain ones because I loved them and they were beautiful and I wanted to eat off of those, you know, and that just a manifestation of what is essentially a piggy nature in me, you know, it's like greedy, I just want the beautiful things, you know. And then, you know, just being at the mercy of that, not seeing that at all for a long time, just, you know, that's the way I want that, you know. And then beginning to see it and being irritated by it. I hated that I was doing that and wanted to make myself stop doing that. So then going through this process of picking the ugliest one, making myself eat off the ugliest thing, you know, which is like me trying to control and trying to do the practice, trying to manage it, trying to make myself be the right way, still off, you know, but a step in the right direction. And then, you know, this is over months, this is over many months, you know, and then gradually just wanting the whole thing to go away, you know, just, oh, I come to the line and it'd be like, oh, here it comes, you know, I'm going to have to go, I'm going to have to listen to this bit again that wants that cup, I'm so sick of this, you know, and you just get sick of the whole thing after a while, you know, oh, I don't care how I am, you know, if I want it, if I don't want it, just shut up, that kind of thing. And then ultimately coming to a place where it's like, I'm more at peace with it. And it's like what I came to in the end was that I like pretty things, you know, it's just a much, it's like, well, that's okay, you know, it doesn't make a problem out of it, it's a beautiful cup, you know, it's why we have museums and, you know, beautiful things, it's gorgeous. But if I have to have it, then I'm suffering, you know, so that's the kind of thing that this change in relationship affects over time. So yeah, you see a change in my manner. But I still like pretty things. Yeah. I'd like your opinion. Would you describe to me how the sutra is? I think 1999, 1999, I understand what the teacher is. I have heard talk about the topic of time sutra. But if you read the sutra, especially the first part of life of the body, we would spend a lot of time talking about the not so pleasant parts of the body and also the contemplation of death. And what's your opinion on not being left out for Westerners? Who are you lifting out of? Well, it isn't left out. A lot of teachers don't leave it out. Some do, you're saying? I'd say all the ones I've heard you talk about. Oh yeah, go to the monastery. They don't leave it out. It's big time. But maybe if that's true, there could be a sense that we don't understand it or it's too harsh. But basically what the Buddha is getting at with that is that if you're really getting impartial towards the body, it's hard. If you want to help that along, then do some reflection on what it really is. So there's this bit in there that part of what gives Buddhism a bad name in some circles, but where he lists what he calls the 32 parts of the body. This is what we're so infatuated with. Bile, pus, feces, urine, blood, and the list goes on, 32 parts. Bone, marrow, all of this. Teeth, the brain. Some not very pleasant. So it's really an invitation. Let's get this thing in perspective here. This is actually what it's made up of. It's very helpful if there is an extreme, particularly with people who have an extreme fascination with theirs or other people's bodies. It's going to help a lot. Just contemplate like that. For death, Ajahn Chas said that if you don't understand death, then life is going to be a real problem. In terms of the body, the identification with the body, and thinking that we are this body. If we're going to believe that, then death is frightening. Included in the meditation practice, there's a process whereby we will come to see that this is not who we are. Part of it, to help that one along, is the meditation bone, the body as it goes through decomposition. I think that we would probably benefit from that, but I don't quite think that America is ready for it. Maybe we'll get that another 50 years or so, that will be taught more frequently. One thing I think sometimes about the relaxing, being able to take a little bit of life is often being really at odds with the culture. I think that's an interesting thing, that you can be as quiet as you can be, as you can be in the culture. You've got to hurry up. Our culture seems to breed restlessness and anxiety. God forbid you should have a moment where there's nothing happening. One of the things I would watch myself with the remote control, that's one of the good ways to see it, sitting there watching the television. That thing has got about two and a half seconds to engage me before I annihilate it and go to the next station. It seems to me that people are tailgating on everything. It seems to me that you could drive some work, but you wouldn't have to constantly be watching something. Now, I think that we should get it at a more slow and focused level. I guess we have centers like this and people like this to balance that. Very good. This is a little off I talked about earlier. When you're trying to break habits that you know are unhealthy, and you can't... The intellectual understanding is very clear, but the practicality is actually giving something about it. It's really worth it. It seemed to me what you were saying, but what you did was actually 40 yourself to let it go. Yeah. So is that a practical way to try to in other venues? I guess a kind of a little bit, but a kind of a mouthful of rhymes around that, giving up on something. I'm trying to then deal with that, when you're not in the situation where you can put down a medicine set. I'm just curious if you have any guidelines on how to manage that kind of... It's interesting because when you have a state of mind or a way of being that is doing harm to self or others, and just if you're suffering a lot with it, then obviously the sensible thing is that we want to get free of it. But I think that the Buddha's practice, while it certainly offers ways to, in a way, make yourself stop doing that, so that there are sort of things that... There's one sutra, for example, where he says, think of something else, or replace it with its opposite, or he offers different techniques for really making yourself stop doing it in the moment. That's especially important when things are very harmful. But ultimately, I think he also says that that is not ultimately going to free you. That the freedom comes through direct knowledge, through direct experience, and so it's coming, whether we're aware of it or not, through being in the experience of it, and being aware within the experience of it. So if it's harmful and we're aware of it, we will start to incline away. If it's good for us and we're aware of it, we'll start to incline towards it. But this is all happening at a very subtle feeling, intuitive level. I've done... Smedo just has a new book out called Intuitive Awareness. It's direct knowledge through direct experience. And that is always how change is actually taking place. But I think it points to a very important thing, like in the meditation, whether you're sitting on the cushion or throughout the course of the day. One of the things that I hear a lot in talking to people about their practice is there a concern that not much is happening. They don't think that change is taking place fast enough. I'm still doing it. I'm still doing it. What's the matter with me? Why am I still doing it? And this is really important to get. If we can get this, it can be extremely helpful. And that is that a lot more is happening than you think. You're sitting on the cushion or you're in daily life and you think, I'm still doing it, I'm still doing it, I'm still doing it. But part of you is not doing it. And it feels like you're completely caught up. It feels like we're completely... You sit here and you can see yourself in that fantasy and you can't stop being in that fantasy and you want to stop fantasizing. Or you want to stop building that vendetta against that person or going over and over again, that difficult situation. Why can't I stop doing it? So it feels like nothing much is happening. But a lot of you is not engaged. You think you are, but you're not. It can feel like you're just feeding it, sitting there in that state over and over again. But the bit of you that knows that you're in it is getting bigger. And I offer just as evidence of this, as a fruit of practice, I would venture to say that virtually everybody in the room has had this experience where all of a sudden, one day, the situation comes up and you're not reacting the same way. It seems like all of a sudden, it seems like overnight you've had some change and it's like a hole in your old way of doing it. You used to always be crazy in this situation and right now you're not. That's how practice plays out. It's almost like the system is tweaking itself even out of these moments where we feel like we're just vaguely aware. It's getting it. The mind is getting it. More of us knows that this is painful than we think. And more of us is inclining away from it than we think. And trust that. If you really don't believe anything else I've said tonight, just trust that. It really is working because what will happen if you don't trust that is then we can give up. Before we've let the practice do itself, before we've let the fruits of practice appear. You have to have a lot of faith in the beginning because you don't see those little shifts. But they do happen. One of my teachers said that he said 90, the practice is about 10% doing and about 90% being done on. And that's it. That's it. And that's sitting there and just enduring the state that we go through. And the 10% doing is more just sitting through it. It's not like making it stop. The 10% doing is just enduring it. And with even just an inkling of awareness. Right? It'll start to shift. Right now. This may be a little off track but I'm doing a program called The Artist's Way. You do a lot of writing and they did it between tapes in the morning and they talked about it as a kind of meditative state. And I noticed if I could do the writing in meditating in the morning it's really great. And it takes a long time for that. So just the writing itself needs to have a similar effect. The writing has the same effect as the meditation? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. You just said it. That's what it's doing. It's like you lose the censor, you lose the commenter, you lose the internal editor, the one that likes and doesn't like everything that's going on and you just do. That's meditation. That's meditation.
