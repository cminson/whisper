Dharmette: Full l ike the Sky

I’d like to read to you a poem from the most 
ancient strata of Buddhist literature. Suppose dly 
it was a poem that contains  teachings of the 
Buddha. People often spoke in verse or 
something close to it , as it was a familiar part of 
the culture.  
 
The verse goes like this in the translation:  
You should know from the rivers that those 
in small channels flow noisily.  
The great rivers flow silent . 
Whatever is not full makes noise.  
Whatever is full is quiet.  
The fool is like a half -empty pot.  
One who is wise , a full lake.  
 
I like this little verse because of the idea of a 
wise person being full. Sometimes in Buddhism 
we have  the idea that you should empty 
yourself, not ha ve a self, not have any desires – 
that it’s better not even to exist somehow. I think that is a misunderstanding or a caricature of 
Buddhism.  
 
Often i n the ancient teachings, people who have 
become wise or ma ture in the practice are 
described in v ery clear ways as becoming full 
and powerful . They are even talked about being 
great selves – mahā  atta – like Mahatma 
Gandhi. It means “great self” in Sanskrit. Here, 
in becoming full, one becomes  silent. If you 
become silent when you feel incomplete, 
insecure or inadequate, it might be more like just 
keeping you down, feeling more inadequate, or 
not having a voice. But you need to have a 
voice. If you become silent after you become 
full, then you don’t need to talk. Not needing to 
talk, you are not being repressed or restricted.  
 
So, a practice that helps you to fill out is needed 
as much as a practice to help you empty out. 
The empty ing out is perhaps emptying the ways 
we limit ourselves, the way s we restrict 
ourselves, the ways we become smaller  or 
hollow . If we have attitudes of self -hating, self -
criticism, greed, fear, of being at war with parts 
of ourselves , all of these things keep us limited, 
contracted, or small. Perhaps in the analogy of 
the verse, more like the empty pot. But to empty ourselves of fear, of self-limiting thoughts , of 
self-hatred  is to let go of them. It makes sense to 
let go of them because they are just activities of 
the mind. None of those things are  inherent in 
who we ar e. Rather,  they are learned mental 
behaviors. We don’t have to do them.  
 
The function of this practice is to recognize what 
is here , and also to relax the unnecessary 
activities of the mind that we carry with us. They 
say that fish don’t see the water the y swim in. 
Some of us don’t see the self -criticism, the fears, 
the self -judgments, the ideas of shoulds and 
shouldn’ts that we’re swimming in because they 
have been there our whole lifetime. As we settle 
into meditation, part of its function is that we 
start to relax the mental constructs  of should and 
shouldn’t – to empty ourselves of these, not so 
that we become less , but because then we can 
become more. We can fill out the goodness of 
our heart. We all have good hearts. The good 
heart can wake up and beg in to flow, to move.  
 
Part of the function of meditation practice is to 
let go of the things that limit us , so that we have 
space to become full. Concentration practice, in 
particular, is a practice that begins to fill us with 
good energy, with joy, with a sense of well -being. To be awakened is not some abstract 
intellectual idea . To be awakened is to wake up 
to our human capacity to sense and feel and be 
alive with the full being of who we are . Our torso, 
our arms, our legs, our whole physical being fills 
out.  
 
It is a paradox because the more it fills out, the 
more it can feel kind of empty in a very nice way. 
Not hollow , but full and translucent and fluid. Full 
like the full sky.  
 
So you might  think about how this little verse is 
useful for you. In what way might it be true for 
you?  
You should know from the rivers that those 
in small channels flow noisily.  
The great rivers flow silent.  
Whatever is not full makes noise.  
Whatever is full is quiet.  
The fool is like a half -empty pot.  
One who is wise, a full lake.  
 
May you be like a lake!  
 
Thank you.
