So that's what I'm going to do now is the guided sweeping practice.
What we're going to do is go over the surface of the body and cover every square inch,
simply noticing whatever sensations you notice in each place.
We'll start with the top of the head.
That's the spot that used to be a soft spot when you were a baby.
It's a few finger wits back from your hairline, assuming you still have a hairline.
And then there's the crown of the head, which is the circle back at the back
where your hair goes in a circle, if it still goes that way.
And I think everything else will be pretty obvious.
So in order to begin, please put your attention on your breath for a few moments.

and put your full attention on the top of your head.

and notice any sensation you encounter as you move your attention along the center line of the skull.
