 And my own interest in this area has taken me into the world of Buddhist chaplaincy, or chaplaincy work. And I've learned in that process that there's a very rich world of hospital, hospice, and prison chaplaincy. A very rich tradition of spiritual care that's been developing over the last some 40-50 years. And that has been very valuable for me as a Buddhist teacher to tap into that and learn the approaches to care that has been developed there. And somewhat connected to the whole chaplaincy movement in the West is also a movement of pastoral counseling. And I've been eager to tap into the wealth of skills and knowledge and understanding that has been developed there as well. And see how is it that can be integrated or included into Buddhism, Buddhist practice, Buddhist spiritual care. So it's something that I've been very interested in myself, a Buddhist teacher. And so how to be a teacher here in the West is a constant concern of mine. And I'm eager to learn more how to do that. And so I invited these people to come and to teach us. I'm delighted. They're here. Welcome. And I'll introduce Steve and then Steve will introduce the rest. And Steve Stuckey is has been a priest at the San Francisco Zen Center since the mid 70s, early 70s. He started there many years were living in green Gulch. That's where I met him in the late 70s. And and then after some years of training at Zen Center and training as a priest, he left said center to go off and start a landscaping business and live nearby in San Rafael. And then he continued both his training and his work as a teacher in the San Rafael area outside of the formal monastic kind of setting of gringulch. And developed his own little temples and center and really was exploring a lot what it means to teach people Zen Buddhism outside of the so-called monastic, grandiose community. And as part of that training, part of that concern, he became interested in pastoral counseling. And so he went and enrolled in a master's program in pastoral counseling at doctoral program. And it says it's under the auspices of San Francisco Theological Seminary. And it's called the Lloyd Center for Pastoral Counseling in San Anselmo in Marin County. So he's done two years. This is his third year, final year. And he's supposed to be writing his dissertation. But there's all kinds of all kinds of people have other plans for him, including having having him come here. And then in February he's going to be installed as one of the abbots at the San Francisco Zen Center. And so he's quite busy and very grateful that Steve has come and grateful for the job for Gail also for coming. And it's really delight. Thank you. Thank you. I will I will just briefly give the names right now. Jakob Kintz, who is actually a Dharma sister of mine. And I'll give a more complete introduction for her a little bit later on when it's her turn to speak. We do have a plan for today and we'll see how it goes. And on my left is Gail Madison, Reverend Gail Madison. And we have a very interesting multiple relationship because she's one of the teachers and counselors at the Lloyd Center where I've been studying pastoral counseling. And I'll say a little bit more about Gail a little bit later, too. First of all, I'd like to just take a moment to recognize that we're all gathered here in this beautiful room. I think it's I've heard Gil tell some of the story about how the insight meditation group here came to this space. And so there's clearly some karmic blessings and in that whole process of how this room is available to us. And the whole notion of a Sati center, I really don't know much about the organization of the Sati center. But as most of you know, the word Sati means mindfulness, Smriti and Sanskrit. So it's usually translated as mindfulness. And when I think of mindfulness, I think of simply being completely present here in this moment, being present, bringing awareness to one's own body, bringing awareness to one's own feelings, bringing awareness to one's own state of mind. And awareness to one's whole inner world. And as as you do that, then you begin to notice the relationship with your own state of mind and your own inner world and the world around you. So as you're aware of your own body, you're aware of the influences. And so I think part of what we'll be doing today is looking at mindfulness in the relationship of oneself and one's own body, feelings and inner world and someone else's and other person's body and their feelings and their their state of mind and their inner world. So it's meaningful to me just to have the word Sati as a reminder of being fully present. I'd like to read a few lines written by Hong Shui Jing Dui, the 12th century Zen Chinese as a John master. And these are just a few lines taken from a book cultivating the empty field translated by Taiken, Dan Leighton. When you have thoroughly investigated your roots back to their ultimate source, a thousand or ten thousand sages are no more than footprints on the trail. In wonder, return to the journey, avail yourself of the path and walk ahead with the hundred grass tips in the busy marketplace, graciously share yourself. So I think for each of us here, the fact that you are here has indicated that you have some commitment to the path and some commitment to sharing yourself and sharing your dharma, your understanding and your practice and your being with others. You've already voted with your feet just coming here today. So I salute you all as wisdom beings, as bodhisattvas. So in this statement by Hong Shui, it refers to a hundred grass tips. And you might use that as a metaphor for bringing attention to each one you meet and each thing, actually, that you engage and encounter. So the practice then, as he says, once you have actually, say, delved all the way to the bottom, he talks about the roots and the ultimate source. So once you have actually some some experience of ultimate source, then he talks about reentering the path and engaging. And the the word gracious, graciously share yourself, actually bringing bringing the grace of your experience. Now, grace is a word that we would usually use in Buddha circles, even spiritual. I know Gil and his introduction was talking about spiritual. And I and I and I was thinking, actually, Gail and Jaco and I talking earlier this morning, noted that the word spiritual itself is something that, you know, it's hard to define. What does it mean? And I myself reflect on probably not using the word spiritual at all for my Zen practice for four decades. And there are many Buddhist practitioners, I think, who probably wouldn't feel so comfortable with the word spiritual. Part of what we'll do today is actually look at some of the connotations that come up for us with with with the terms that we're using in the realm of counseling, pastoral, spiritual chaplaincy. So how do we graciously avail ourselves of the the Dharma in the busy marketplace, both in a more public sense and in a very, say, intimate sense, one on one meetings with people? So today, right here in this room, we have a collection of people. We all have some common, some common interest. And we also have our differences. And we're coming from different different histories, maybe some different cultural backgrounds. We currently have some different range of different, say, styles or forms of how we practice Buddha Dharma. There may be people here who don't identify with practicing Buddha Dharma. And I just want to suggest that that our intention here be to completely include and appreciate the differences. In a few minutes, we'll go around and I'd like to actually have everyone introduce yourself briefly. And in the course of that, just say, in addition to your name, say, what is your Sangha? You have a Sangha practice, a location or a group that you actually are affiliated with or identify with or not. And that'll help us just to see who's here in the room. The other thing I'd like to do is, as you introduce yourself, if you can briefly say something about what is if you have a specific interest here, something that you would like to see addressed and will try to include that in the program today. Would you turn the page? I have I have to hook from this thing to get up. So this this is a general outline for the day that we're we're beginning with open opening and then we'll we'll do our introductions. And I'd like to have a little time of silence. And then the presentation is increased to pastoral counselor. I will talk a little bit about my own, say, trajectory or development. And then we'll have a little break. Gail will make a presentation on the origins of pastoral counseling in this country, which are primarily coming from Christian communities. And Jaco will make a presentation on her various roles as a teacher and a psychotherapist and how she sorts that out. And we'll see how that goes. And each of these will be chances for people to ask questions and interact and identify some things. I think in the morning that we may want to address in the afternoon. In the afternoon, I thought after lunch, we could split in this into several groups, either based on topic or based upon some just having a chance. If we all want to talk about the same topic, we could just break into smaller groups so more people have a chance to interact and identify and develop the questions and thoughts that people have and then come back together for more of an open group and panel with the three of us here. So that's a general idea. And we'll see how it goes. Are there any questions so far? That seems OK. All right. So could we then do the introductions beginning? Let's begin with Lori and we'll go around the room in the back and then come back and fill in with the middle of the room. Is that OK? I'm Lori Wong and I have my the Sangha that I sit with is actually here at I.M.C. with Gil. But also locally, I'm from Modesto. So locally, I also sit with Valley Heartlands and with Grace Sherson on Thursday night. And I'm just here to hear what you three have to present. My name is Helen Hobart. I'm a Sacramento Buddhist meditation group, which is an eclectic Sangha of the various traditions without a teacher leading us. And I'm in my fourth unit of CPE and have a social work background. Good morning. My name is Suzanne Sims. I'm a final year student at the Graduate Theological Union. I've completed my clinical pastoral education training and I sat for six years with the Green Mountain Dharma Center. But for the last three years, I've been moving around too much to have a song that I am attached to. So hope at the end of this year I won't be moving around. I'm Paula Westall and I live and work at Lamb of Medicine Buddha, which is a Tibetan Buddhist retreat center in Santa Cruz. And I also participate in the Santa Cruz Zen Center and I have a background in counseling with children. Good morning. My name is Jill Hyman and I practice with the Pasana Santa Cruz. And I also have another song out, which is at Salinas Valley State Prison. I'm Heidi Renteria and I'm also in the Pasana Santa Cruz. And I'm a volunteer Buddhist chaplain at one of the penitentiaries at Soledad. And I'm here because of interest in Buddhist pastoral counseling for both my home Sangha and also the prison Sangha. My name is Greg Fain. I'm a resident priest at San Francisco Zen Center's city center location. I'm also in the Buddhist chaplaincy program that currently going on leading here. And I also, along with Steve, sit with the Buddha Dharma Sangha in San Francisco State Prison. My name is Vivian Shue. I locally sit with Zen Heart Sangha and also Mercy Center in Bergen Gate and also in Tucson, Arizona with Patrick Hawk Rocha. And my interest of being here today, I think it's put very succinctly by the speakers. I just want to explore how to share myself graciously. My name is Tom Allard and I sit with the Dharma eye and Zen Center and Senator Fowl. My teacher is Steve Stuckey and I've had some pastoral counseling and I have a great appreciation for the way it's entered my life and has influenced me. And I think that subject also is and I'm sure we'll get around to it, but the eight C's, which I kind of check in with periodically to go over those. I mean, my name is Ren Van, a priest at San Francisco Zen Center. And I'm also in the Buddhist chaplaincy program. My name is Maria. I live at San Francisco Zen Center and I'm a resident chaplain doing my first unit of CPA at St. Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco. My name is Trevor Maloney. I'm also a resident at San Francisco Zen Center. I recently moved there from spending some time in Tassajara. Before that, I was studying theology at Boston University, currently in my first unit of clinical pastoral education at UCSF Medical Center. I'm here to figure out what it is I'm doing. My name is Tova Green. I'm a priest at Green Gulch Farms and center part of San Francisco Zen Center. Before my study, I was a social worker in private practice and now I'm reactivating my social work license. I'm also a volunteer at the Zen Hospice Project. And I just really curious about what pastoral counseling is and how it's different from other ways of helping people or working with people. I'm David Cone and I sit here mostly and I have been doing hospice work for a number of years at the Zen Hospice Project Laguna Honda Hospital. And more recently, I've been doing pastoral care at Peninsula Hospital, chaplaincy work at Peninsula Hospital in Burlingame. And I foresee this kind of work as what I'll be doing mostly after I retire in a couple of years. And I'm just aware of what a great opportunity it is when I open the door to a room and go into that room and there is that vulnerable being that I could perhaps bring some some kind of brightening to their to their time there. And when I make the most out of that, so I'm here to find out what more I can make out of those times when I open those doors. Looking forward to sharing your wisdom. I'm Linda Gallian. I'm a resident priest at San Francisco Zen Center. And I'm also in the Buddhist chaplaincy program. I just started as a volunteer chaplain at Laguna Honda Hospital. And I have a background in clinical psychology. So one of my interests in coming here today is hearing more about the differences and similarities between psychotherapy and chaplaincy and spiritual care. Hi, my name is Sharon Brooks, and I'm also in the Buddhist chaplaincy program and I practice at San Francisco Zen Center. I'd like to acknowledge my teacher, darling, Cohen. And I presently have the luxury of being retired. And my primary work now is not exclusively, but mainly in disability work. I work with stroke survivors at Laguna Honda Hospital and other hospitals and stop. Thank you. My name is Carolyn Klebsch. I live in Menlo Park. I've had a Buddhist practice for about 30 years first with Trungpa Rinpoche and Copacino Roshi, my root teacher time at Zen Center. And I'm going to be ordained as a priest by Joan Halifax in Santa Fe in January. So I am here to just explore and deepen my understanding and my skills kind of in this new direction my life is taking. My name is Tonya Takas, and I'm living and working at San Francisco Zen Center. And at some point, I see myself wanting to do more direct service work. So I'm here mostly out of a general curiosity and interest to learn about doing that from a Buddhist perspective. My name is Blanche Hartman, and I live and practice at San Francisco Zen Center in the city center. And I've been ordained as Steve in the same group with Steve and David here in 1977. And I'm still trying to find out how I can be of service to the people who practice with me, which is how I understand what ordination means. And I see big gaps in my capacity and I'm hoping to that I can begin to or continue to try to fill in those gaps. I'll be here. My name is Nisar Sheikh and I'm a regular at IMC here. But Wednesday night, I do try to go to Kenrose Zen Center in Mountain View. And I have probably the least background to be here today. But I do have a connection to Muslim community in the Bay Area. And sometimes I feel I could transmit some of the good things from here to them. So that makes use or motivation to be here. This is Sukin and I'm sitting with Gil here, although I haven't been here for for several months because of due to my my health declining. I have background of counseling and psychology as well. Social worker and and I'm very interested in to know this Buddhist pastoral counseling, if I can help myself and others. Thank you. My name is Terry Lesser and this is my son and has been for about 15 years. I spent also about 15 years working in hospice field of hospice on an administrative side and. I'm here to to learn and to see how I can be of service in this way. My name is Jared Archbold and I practice here at IMC and I am very involved with a company called Landmark Education that I've seen wonderful parallels between their education and technology and a lot of Buddhist teachings. And I'm not sure I'm in line right now to become a leader with them. And I'm not sure if that's a path for me or if I'd like to travel down a Buddhist path and teach in that aspect. So I'm here just learning more about direction and counseling and teaching. Let's pass it around. People see seated here. I'm Margaret Beener. I practice with the San Jose insight and also attend events here at IMC, Redwood City and I'm a member of the chaplaincy class here. And I'm looking forward to hearing what the three of you have to say. I also teach mindfulness in jail and I teach it at a congregational church. My name is Rochelle Peruca and I'm a recent graduate of the Buddhist chaplaincy training program. And I'm identified with this Sangha, but I don't attend very much because of physical issues. And I'm a psychotherapist locally and I'm also interested in more of a distinction between chaplaincy, pastoral care, psychotherapy. I am Bill Hart and I'm a hospital chaplain. And I consider this my root Sangha, though I sit in San Francisco also. And I'm curious what brought me here was to hear your perspective on pastoral counseling from a Buddhist space. Hi, my name is Tintin Chokhi and I live at London Medicine outside of Santa Cruz. And as a resident monastic, I'm called upon to do a lot of chaplaincy and pastoral counseling, even though I don't have a clue what I'm doing. So I'm in this year's chaplaincy training program and scrambling to get skills together to enable me to do what I'm called upon to do. My name is Eric Seifert and I live in Berkeley and sort of sit with the Berkeley Zen Center. And last night I was hanging out with these four year old and this two year old. So I'm interested in to see how that experience relates with this one today. How how pastoral education or pastoral counseling is actually the same as, you know, the experience of working with the joy and beauty that came from these two kids. I'm Jim Bronson and I sit with Gil here at I.M.S. I.M.C. Also sit at I.M.S. from time to time. I do community outreach and education for a nonprofit in Palo Alto called CARA that provides peer support for people that have had a tragedy or a loss. And there I do crisis intervention a lot. I respond to situations where people have just had the tragedy or the loss. And it's a matter of going through the first stages of adjusting to grief. And so that would be my interest today is helping people who are just in the first stages of adapting to an unthinkable experience, something that's very harsh and difficult. And also the other thing that I'm interested in is caring for caregivers. It's one of the big issues, I think, in this field is how we keep our ourselves well nurtured and well sustained because we're asked to do so much. My name is Sandra Winter and I. I'm not sure I have an official song. I do sit here at I.M.C. I sit at the Cannon Doe Center and also sometimes at the San Francisco Zen Center. About eight years ago, I graduated from the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology and. And yet my great love is Buddhist practice. And so I'm just interested in knowing how how these two things can come together. Good morning. My name is Sandy Ewan. I've been practicing with the Koreans and master some of the songs on the last 15 years. And I've been a teacher in school, which is the school for the last six years. And I'm going to be a better person, learn more about who I am, who I am and also more effectively how to help myself and other people and have a more meaningful life for. And for the rest of my. Thank you. I think everyone has. Hi, my name is Cheryl Woodward. I sit here at this song. I've been doing counseling for about 30 years, the first 10 on a psychiatric unit and then the last 20 or so at a community college. And I'm very interested in the overlay of Buddhist practice within the counseling field. I'm Susan as a cow. And I had the great honor of working with Gil and founding the center. And I teach meditation here and co-teach a beginner's practice group. And I fill in for our wonderful yoga teacher, Terry Lesser, when she can't be here. My name is Peggy and I practice here somewhat consistently. I do some work with grief and hospice for the audience and I help this girl. And also help me explore if it's a field that I want to go to further. As far as what might be helpful for me to hear is I consider it sort of a heart practice and I have trouble coordinating that with sort of brain talk. They come in and say, well, I'm Kenji Akahoshi. I'm a Toulusin Chiu Buddhist at the San Jose Betzung. I'm in a career change from a dentist. I'm now a student at the Institute of Buddhist Studies in Berkeley. Invite all of you to our new building that we just dedicated two weeks ago. It's on Durant, right off the Shattuck. I recently got a master's in Transpersonal Psychology from ITP. And I do volunteer chaplaincy at the Santa Clara County juvenile hall. I'm Tony Bernhardt. I host a Sangha in a sitting group in Davis, California and sit on the board of the Satya Center. Roger Sickdermans. I live in Santa Rosa, relatively attached when it comes to formal Sangha. I have my vocation and my education has nothing to do with this whatsoever. But I've done some hospice volunteer work and that and some other experiences kind of driven me to explore practice through service. And so I'm in the Buddhist chaplaincy program and currently I'm going to be volunteer chaplain at Laguna Honda Hospital. I'm Florence Caplow. I've been practicing both in the Vipassan and Zen tradition for about 20 years. I'm a student of Norman Fisher from the Everyday Zen Foundation, who used to be Abbot of Zen Center. I'm kind of a wanderer right now and in a lot of transition. And I suppose my one of my interests in this area is the whole question of working, doing pastoral counseling or chaplaincy work with people who come from more of a God based religion and how that works as a Buddhist, especially as a Buddhist who didn't come from those traditions. So that's one of my interests. I'm Jenny Viva Colison and I've been studying Buddhism for about eight years. I sit with the Sangha and some others in the area. I'm a family physician and finished at UCSF about a year ago. And I have been kind of disenchanted with Western medicine throughout my training but wanted to have come to believe that Dharma is the best medicine for me and perhaps maybe for others as well and have wanted to start my own kind of medical clinic using that but have not really been sure how to do that and kind of exploring those options. So I thought this might be interest. Thank you. I am an engine and I use the city at IMC here in the city today. I was just coming here for some reason and I don't know what. I guess I just want to know what it is all about. My name is Inez and I sit with the Sangha with Gil and I'm managing director here. And I'm also in the spirit rock community Dharma leader program and which is and I'm beginning to teach more. I'm beginning to think about when you the interface between Dharma interviews and psychotherapy and you know where that line might be and how you work with that skillfully. I'm Shinkuan Park and I sit here and I'm a volunteer within hospice project and I consider that my phone as well. Backgrounds also in counseling psychology for many years I was a counselor in psychiatric residential but I think film were drawn to heart counseling. I'm not sure if this is it but I thought I'd explore it. My name is Deanna. I sit here in the Sangha with Gil and with other different teachers too. I taught meditation in New York with the Rikers Island for two years. But I didn't have the teaching the real teaching but this teaching and I would like to have more of that to continue teaching here and also being able to share the wisdom and the knowledge with my ancestors culture which is Armenian to the people and bringing this beautiful knowledge. And freeing people and as Lady there said it's sharing gracefully with every relationship I have. My name is Carol Benjamin. I've been practicing at San Francisco city center in Tassa Hara for 11 years. I did. I just finished the Buddhist chaplaincy training program. I'm in my second unit of C.P.E. at UCSF. I did my first unit at Cal Pacific in San Francisco and I'm here hoping to learn some ways to be a better Buddhist chaplain intern. I'm Hillary Boris and this is my Sangha and I've only been practicing for about a year and a half. But as my children begin to grow older I just want to explore how I can take my personal practice back into the world and benefit others. I'm particularly interested in conflict resolution mediation. I'm Betsy Meehan. I have for six years been sitting here with Gil at IMC. I have a long standing interest in putting the hospitality back in the hospital. It has had several expressions. Most recently for the last two years I'm a hospice volunteer with Sutter V&A. I have quite a bit of interest in the coincidence of sitting with comfort and I like the word graciousness with dying and the myriad ways that healing takes place simultaneously. I'm Hugh McMillan. I sit here and I'm also involved with the monastery and also a teacher at Soledad. I'm Elizabeth Pascal and I also sit here at IMC with Gil and am a volunteer at Soledad and have been a hospice volunteer in the past. And I think I like so many people have said have an ongoing interest in furthering and deepening whatever skills I may have and a better understanding of how to serve others. My name is Mick or Michael Bennett. This is my Sangha and I took the Sati Center chaplaincy program a couple of years ago and Gil has asked me to work with one member of our Sangha who is in life threatening illness situation. And this next week I'll be starting a support group for people with life threat illnesses. I've been working at hospice center hospice out of the hospital for the last four years. And all of this activity, in my mind, is motivated by trying to turn my very cognitive approach to life to a more open hearted approach. Is that everyone or do some of them come in the back? Someone else came in. Hi, my name is under ska and I've come down from San Francisco and I practice in people's style and have started doing some Dharma sharing. I'm interested in understanding different ways of helping people. So anyone else? So what a wonderful group of people you've joined today. Part of the reason for doing an introduction that includes everyone like this, as you may have already noted that I'm going to talk more with that person or that person who shares an interest or has some information or some question that resonates with you. So I'm wondering right now whether we can stay with what we're doing for about another half hour before we take a break. Is that OK? So. So I made a few notes. What I'd like to do before I before I talk about my own path and transition. I'd like to just have us just sit in silence for about 10 minutes. With the intention of just appreciating. Appreciating everyone in the room. So this gets serious. So some people want to get some serious sitting equipment. So please take just a moment to get comfortable with an appropriate seat. So guided meditation, but I just want to make a suggestion beforehand to sit with some awareness of your own, say, inner world and how you have resonated with what you've heard so far. What's your experience of this, the space, the place you're in and with a feeling of being receptive to all that's here, especially everyone else in the room and what they are, what they are bringing to you and your experience this moment. So I'll ring the bell to begin and end a short sitting.
