 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and welcome. We live in a human body that has capacity for pleasure and pain. We live in a human body that has the ability and potential for beauty and that which is not beauty. For inner beauty. We have a world that lives in, has a capacity for suffering and happiness, for war and peace. As we're seeing now in Eastern Europe. So one of the ways of practicing mindfulness is to be aware of it all. Have a certain equanimity for pleasure and pain. The beautiful, the not so beautiful, the difficult and the easy. But to do it from a reference point, to do it from a source kind of within, of a kind of awareness that is based in or settled in the place where we have inner beauty. Or where we have, yeah, we'll call it that for now. And it's possible to be aware of things, for example, physical pain. But to be aware of it at the same time as being in touch with or being connected to inner pleasure, inner beauty, inner well-being. And this makes a world of difference. So we're not only identified, only rooted in this sense world where pleasure and pain exists. But we're rooted someplace else that contextualizes the sense world. So I'll do a kind of guided meditation around this and we'll see how that goes. And I will hopefully point you first to when you're aware of breathing, there can be more than breathing going on. There's also the awareness of breathing and how that is. And that'll be the entry point to this teaching on inner pleasure, inner beauty. So to assume a meditation posture and to gently close your eyes. And some long, slow, gentle inhales and exhales. Especially as you exhale to relax and settle into your body. And then you're breathing in deeply and relaxing as you exhale. And then letting the breathing return to normal. And then for a few rounds of breathing to continue to relax the holdings, the tension in the body. If it doesn't relax, maybe there can be a softening around it. The face, the shoulders, the belly. And then to breathe normally, except the end of the exhale, let there be a comfortable pause. Just long enough not to be uncomfortable. Pause before you inhale. Just long enough so that you feel the gentle pull or desire to inhale. And when you feel that desire, allow for it and allow the body to perform the inhale. Let there be a small pause at the end of the exhale. And when you feel the pull to breathe in, allow it and receive the inhale. So it's not just the inhale you're feeling. There's also a context for the inhale, which is a sense feeling for allowing, receiving. When the exhale begins, allow it to the body to exhale. Allow for the letting go, the release of the exhale. Receiving, allowing, maybe as close to making space for something, being spacious, making a room for it. Pause before you inhale. And whatever feeling you have for allowing and receiving in-breath and out-breath, does it have a pleasant feeling, nice or comforting about it? And if it is, feel the pleasantness, the pleasure of however small it is of allowing, receiving the inhale, allowing the exhale. Pause And maybe you can feel this sense of allowing, receiving, to feel it in that place within where inner beauty lives, inner well-being, a well-being that is not of the senses, but a non- sensual inner place, a non- sensual kind of pleasantness, pleasure, beauty. That informs awareness, which is a kind of a source for awareness, the flavor of awareness as you breathe in and breathe out. If any part of the breathing is uncomfortable, it's okay. Allow it to be received, receive it and allow it from this other place of within, from this place that's not identified with the discomfort, but rather where we are settled in an inner place of pleasure, a well-being, warmth, glow, with which we're aware of the discomfort. Pause Pause Pause Pause Pause Pause If there's something uncomfortable happening that preoccupies you, grabs your attention, see if you can be mindful of it in a receptive and allowing way, so that you're, or something like that, so you're aware from that non- sensual place, non- physical place within, from a place of inner well-being, not rooted or connected to the outer senses of the body, but rather to a place of the within, maybe of the heart, a place within that is the home for inner beauty. Pause Pause Pause Pause Pause Pause Pause Pause Pause Pause If there is any way you feel a little calmer or settled than you did at the beginning, that calmness and subtleness would be considered a non- sensual pleasure, or a pleasure of the inner life. Let your awareness radiate from that inner life, that inner place of goodness or beauty, so you're rooted there, so you're not identified or rooted in the challenges or the thoughts or feelings, you're aware of all of those respectfully, carefully, but you're aware of them from this place of inner beauty, inner wellness, inner calm. Pause Pause Pause Pause Can you touch into a place of inner pleasure, well-being, that is not an ordinary pleasure of the senses? In a sense, it's an inner well-being that's independent of what we see and hear and taste, smell or touch. Maybe an inner pleasure connected to our inner life of inner feelings. And if there is a pleasure there, know it, be mindful of it. And what happens when you recognize it and feel it, know it? Pause Pause Pause And then as we come to the end of this sitting, to whatever degree you know now or other times, a place of inner well-being, calmness, contentment, pleasure, that's independent of what's happening around you. From that place, can you look out across the world, aware of all the suffering and happiness of this world, and wish that you can make a difference to improve this world of ours, to contribute to the welfare and happiness of others, a contribution that begins with the goodwill of wanting others the best for others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. Pause
