 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So beginning with simply inviting ourselves to arrive, taking stock of how we are, acknowledging and allowing whatever is here to be here and to be received with some interest and kindness and gentleness. We can be supportive to invite the body to relax, perhaps scanning through the body and noticing any areas of tension or holding. Just inviting a natural softening, feeling into and relaxing around the space of the head and face, eyes, mouth, jaw, opening the neck, shoulders, relaxing the chest and upper back, inviting our bellies and lower back to soften, hips and pelvic area, just inviting a softening, upper legs, knees, lower legs, feet, forcing anything. Some tension will remain and you can just drop in the invitation, may the body relax. Whatever holding or tension might remain, just being easy with that, not struggling with that, inviting the mind to relax, to soften, to settle, exploring the possibility of the mind settling and softening, even around and with agitation that might be in the mind. Can there be a part of our experience that settles and widens to receive, to receive the changing flow of experience, allowing it to be however it is, whether that's pleasant or unpleasant? Thank you. Thank you. Settling back and receiving this ever-changing flow of experience, body sensations, whether that's pressure or tingling, warmth or coolness, hardness, pulling, warmth, including the space of the mind, and just recognizing and receiving all of the various states that are constantly arising and flowing through the mind. It might be subtle, it might be agitated, it might feel quiet or noisy, tight or relaxed. All of these various experiences, every moment of experience is accompanied by some feeling, some flavor of pleasant or unpleasant or neutral. You can just notice and receive that. Notice the mind's habitual tendency to move towards pleasant, to want to hold on or to try to create pleasant, move away from and try to get rid of unpleasant, and perhaps to just gloss over neither pleasant nor unpleasant experiences, kind of lose interest. This is just the natural conditioning of our minds. We're invited to simply include and observe how our minds are with experience. No need to try to get it right. We need to take ownership of what the mind is doing, we can step back and observe and receive, oh, the mind is struggling against this experience right now. What is this aversion like? If we find ourselves in very difficult terrain, the mind is really stuck and struggling, and it's overwhelming our capacity to receive with some balance. It can be very skillful to intentionally shift to something that's more neutral or pleasant. It is receiving, how is it now? Just recognizing the experiences arising right now is enough. No need to do anything with it or try to change it or get it right or try to stop some unpleasant pattern from happening. We're invited to observe and to get to know, to understand the reactivity in the mind, inviting a softening around that, exploring the possibility that there can be a space of knowing reactivity that is itself not reactive towards it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This includes the comings and gullings of mindfulness itself. mindfulness is a conditioned mental pattern or mental factor. You may notice that the mind will wander off and mindfulness will disappear despite our intentions to maintain continuous mindfulness. When we recognize, when we realize that the mind has been lost, in that moment there is some awareness, there is some mindfulness that's back. Oh, awareness is here again. What is awareness knowing? Those aspects of our minds that tend to be habitually identified with identities, judgments, the invitation is to include those in the field of over-observing. What is arising? I'm just receiving and observing whatever is naturally arising in our experience. No need to strain to try to see anything. Whatever is obvious is just the right object of our attention and meditation. Even if it feels foggy or unclear, oh, the fogginess is being known. Just receiving with interest however it is. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you you you you you
