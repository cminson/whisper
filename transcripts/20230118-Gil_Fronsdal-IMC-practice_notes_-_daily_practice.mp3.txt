 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. The mindfulness practice works really well if you can start making distinctions between things. In fact, the tradition of Buddhism that we come out of, once upon a time, it was known as the Distinctional Lists, the people who made distinctions. It's best to think of this being very simple, rudimentary distinctions. There's a variety of them, but the overall idea is the distinction between what is helpful and not helpful. And just that distinction is powerful because if you know the difference, choose the helpful. Don't do the unhelpful. If you have a nail and you want to put it in some wood, a screwdriver is not helpful. And if you know that, then you probably won't try hitting it with a screwdriver. So you have to know that distinction. So a distinction that I'd like to suggest today is the distinction between being agitated and being calm. And when we're agitated, we're activated. But we're activated by reactivity, kind of an activation which is often not so helpful. When we're calmer, we can be suffused. And being suffused is being kind of filled with a good feeling. When we're activated, we tend to squeeze out our ideas and our thoughts and things like that, feelings and reactivity. When we are calm and suffused, things well up, thoughts, ideas, motivations well up rather than being squeezed out. So there's these different ways of being. So it's starting to become aware of how you are, how in your way you can make distinctions, something like what I'm saying today. Everyone's going to have a differently, different reference point. So we are looking for the difference between a helpful and unhelpful way of being. And one that's different between being activated versus being suffused by something. Coming into the world suffused with calm, for example, or suffused with some sort of well-being, versus being activated by agitation or by contraction or being squeezed, trying to squeeze or force something out of us, like figure something out or something. So to look for distinctions. So as you can do this practice today, not as a way of getting caught up in thoughts and analysis, but as some way you can feel your way or sense your way, maybe even intuit your way, into seeing simple distinctions, maybe one or two, that can support you to stay present in a helpful way through the morning. So thank you.
