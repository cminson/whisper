What I'd like to try to do is to connect this desire to be happy with love. 
This inherent love and goodness that we all have, that we all share. 
Yeah, so I'd like to try to make that connection with you today in this, in a guided meditation. 
So, if you could assume a comfortable position with your comfortable, but with your spine loosely straightened. 
And if you'd like to close your eyes in meditation, please do so. 
And relax. 
Deeply relax. 
Relax all of your muscles. 
Relax your shoulders, your scapula, your upper back that's behind your heart. 
And relax your heart. 
And contemplate. 
If I don't have any worries, who am I? And unhooking from our thinking mind and coming into the body, relax the stomach and all the organs inside the stomach area and the lower back. 
And relax the hips and the thighs. 
The thighs that don't suffer, the calves that don't suffer, unless there's some kind of pain. 
Can't be helped. 
And the feet. 
And relax the whole body. 
Relaxing the face, the jaw, the eyes and behind the eyes, smoothing out the forehead and relaxing all the little clutching muscles in the mind, the brain, behind the forehead. 
And scanning through the whole body and softening the awareness, widening it so that it takes in the entire body in a global way and relaxing into this global awareness that is who you are. 
It's always here with us, this awareness. 
We don't have to produce it. 
It's a natural, big, sky, awakeness. 
And bringing to mind a loved one. 
It could be a pet, a partner, a child, someone who you freely love. 
And notice how you want them to be happy. 
You want them to be peaceful. 
It would even be wonderful if they could be joyous, contented, peaceful. 
You want these things for them and recognize this wanting for them as love, feeling it in your body, connecting this desire for them to be happy, as love. 
And you do not want her or him to suffer this longing in you for them not to suffer. 
It's compassion. 
You long for them not to feel shame and hatred and guilt. 
You long for them not to suffer the pangs of jealousy, pride, benchfulness. 
You long for them to be free of these painful feelings, these sufferings and feeling this as compassion. 
This wish for them not to suffer. 
This wish for them not to suffer. 
It's kind of an urgency that we have. 
And it's part of us, it's natural. 
This compassion, this love is simply a complexion of awareness. 
It's just as natural and part of us as awareness. 
Heat is part of a flame. 
And these feelings of love and compassion give life, vitality to our awareness. 
And now turning toward yourself. 
Noticing that you would like to be happy. 
Every moment that you're awake, you want to be happy. 
Even if you have misguided unskillful thoughts and actions, it's still, they're still born of this love for yourself. 
Just wanting to be happy easily forgiven in this light. 
With every breath you take, you want to be happy. 
With every breath you take, you have love. 
Part of awareness, this open heart. 
And you do not want to suffer. 
You have compassion for yourself. 
You long not to suffer. 
We long for peace, relief from all the self-created sufferings. 
And now imagine that this love that you have, feeling this love that you have for your loved one or yourself, whichever is most accessible, is like a sun in your heart. 
And as if there were a veil in front of your chest, pull the veil apart and let the heart of this love shine in front of you. 
Just with ease, no effort. 
Just pulling the veil apart and letting the love open in front of you as far as it wants to go. 
It's actually boundless and to the right of you and behind you, to the left of you, above you, and below you, opening all the cells of your body and boundlessly beyond. 
Measureless love, abundant love, divine love. 
And now change the complexion in your heart to compassion. 
Maybe more like a sun that is setting, beautiful setting sun, all these colors spreading boundlessly to the east and the west and up and below in the same way, allowing your compassion to radiate in front of you. 
With ease, without effort, this is just naturally part of you, just like awareness to the right of you. 
To the left of you, above and below. 
Relaxing into compassion everywhere, boundless, measureless, abundant, divine compassion. 
And now just relax back into simple, awareness without making any effort to meditate at all. 
Not trying to create or manipulate or become just effortless, relaxed being here. 
Okay. 
You can open your eyes now.
