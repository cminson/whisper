 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. It's fun to realize that in spite of our distance and the spread and the way we just sort of appear as, I appear as a voice and you maybe as a typing or on Zoom as a box, but we're all still breathing together. It's all still moving around. And this breath is so important in our sangha, I mean in our practice, and in our sangha, but in our practice, the Buddha started his instructions and the four foundations with pay attention to the breath. Does it come in short? Does it come in long? How does it feel? And many of us are very intimate with our breath. Sometimes our breath can be challenging and we can go to the places of constriction or places where it's difficult. And I always appreciate the instruction of go to where there is ease and pleasure in the breath. Go to where you can find it, this connection aspect of it. It's so interesting. We start with the breath. We are connected to it. And yet it has this insubstantial, it's a doorway. It's starting to move into this mysterious. Earth is so here, solid, right there, and the water we can touch. And now as we're moving towards the air, we're starting to move into this area of the mysterious. And it's interesting, the word spirit in Greek was breath, wind, and that word turned into our languages into the word spirit. And anima comes from Latin, air, breath, to animate, animal. This connection that has been there in our language is intuitively known by us that the breath, the spirit, the animation, the aliveness, are all so intimately connected. And to let ourselves feel that, this animation that comes, this spirit, in some indigenous traditions, when they talk about the great spirit, that's the translation we get. They're talking, at least in the ones I know, the diné, they're speaking specifically to the wind, to the air, that that is the spirit, the great spirit that connects. The diné say that's the Navajo, they call themselves the diné. The wind within one is in no way autonomous, for it is in a continual process of interchange with the various winds that surrounds one, and indeed is entirely a part of the holy wind itself. It's a quote from David Abrams' book, A Spell with the Sensuous, and he doesn't name the particular individual, so that's why I didn't say. This idea that the spirit is moving around this aliveness and coming into us, and then adding to that, that our breath is our speech, that when we speak, we are speaking with this sacred breath that comes out of us. And what is our speech, this connection, this possibility, this opportunity for truth and beauty, and then how it gets distorted and confused. But we can come back, and this is often in spiritual traditions, and certainly in ours, singing and chanting are part of the tradition. We join our breath together in speaking and feeling the sacred. There's a play here happening, I hope you can hear it, between the seen and the unseen that happens through the breath, through the wind. And we see it all around us, you know, when the leaves move on the tree, we see the result of it. When the clouds move, we see this sort of wind, air made tangible for a moment, and then dissipating or being moved. And we live in this world of breath, in the body as we feel it. And just as I talk even, keep noticing, see if you can feel your breath, perhaps even the words that I'm saying, can you breathe them in? What is that like to let them come in and be felt in your body? To stay connected to this breath. And breath has a lightness to it. In some ways you might say it's the balancing with the earth element. It brings up, and it's often talked about in the Buddhist tradition as having the vibration quality. And I think of that as kind of this aliveness that we feel in us. You know, there's something that it's almost hard to pin down what it is, but when you feel into your body, you can feel a certain aliveness here. This is the air element as we recognize it right here in us. And as I mentioned in the meditation, the thoughts are understood to be an expression of the air element. And that makes sense, doesn't it? The way that thoughts just sort of appear out of nothing. They have this sort of temporary quality, and then they disappear, dissipate into nothing once again. And when we can understand and sense the way the thoughts are this air element, it can help us become less, be less attached, less clinging to them, as if they were solid, right? That's where we get in trouble when we start believing that our thoughts are solid and real and the final word on everything. And instead recognizing, oh, they come and they go. And even the words that we say, they're sacred on one side, and on another way, they just disappear into nothing. And we're doing all of this in communion with the algae, the plants that breathe. A practice that I offer to you that's something that I'd like to do is I go out where there's trees or a plant, and I go out and I sit with it, and I breathe with it. And what is it to breathe with this other being that's so different in some ways than us, and yet it too is breathing? I started out very early on in high school being fascinated with plants and the soma that are breathing and taking in. That's their breathing mechanism. And us too, we're all being breathed. Feel your breath. Let yourself breathe. And I want to end with a poem from Rumi called In Every Breath. In every breath, if you're the center of your own desires, you'll lose the grace of your beloved. But if in every breath you blow away your self-claim, the ecstasy of love will soon arise. In every breath, if you're the center of your own thoughts, the sadness of autumn will fall on you. But if in every breath you strip naked, just like a winter, the joy of spring will grow from within. All your patience comes from the push for gain of patience. Let go of the effort and peace will arrive. All your unfulfilled desires are from your greed for gain of fulfillments. Let go of them all and they will be sent as gifts. Fall in love with the agony of love, not the ecstasy. Then the beloved will fall in love with you. I want to offer today as a practice, allow yourself to feel the generosity of the world, of all the beings that are participating in this breath. The generosity of all the plants. And as you breathe out, as you breathe out, others breathe in. Feel it in your body right now. And whenever you remember today, not just your breath, not just the breath, but that you're breathing with. No inside, no outside, all of us breathing together. Breathing, breathing, alive, animated. Thank you all.
