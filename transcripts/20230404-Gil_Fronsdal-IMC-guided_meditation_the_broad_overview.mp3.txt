The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Hello, everyone, and welcome.
And the topic for this week is Changing Perspectives for Awareness.
So often we are aware, we might be mindful, we're aware with intention or without intention,
but we never question the perspective with which we're aware, the orientation. And some
people are very much aware with their head, with their thinking. Some people are very
somatic and aware with or through their feelings. So without questioning it, I think this is
the way it is. And when we do mindfulness practice, we can begin questioning the way
that we're aware. Not so much to feel that one way is necessarily better than another
all the time, but to have a range of perspectives, a range of ways of being aware, so we can
know how to shift it according to what the need is. So for today, I'll offer you a little
guided imagery to begin this meditation, to maybe give you a sense of a perspective
that's sometimes useful. So to assume a meditation posture...
Gently closing your eyes. And to take a few breaths, deep breaths to settle
in, to relax in, to hear.
And then to let your breathing be normal. And take a few moments here, kind of a broad
awareness of your posture, whatever posture you're in. Be aware of whatever is happening
for you. The experience that's within the posture. Emotions, thoughts, feelings, sensations.
The way you would check in with yourself if someone asks you, how are you? And then to...
And now, imagine the room that you're sitting in. If you're sitting indoors, if you're outdoors,
imagine the location you're in with your eyes closed. See if you can reconstruct a bit.
The location in which you're sitting. The windows, the walls, objects in the room, where
the door is. In your mind's eye, either visualizing it or just with your thoughts recalling the
different parts of this room that you're in. And then as if you have a bird's eye view
of the room. Now imagine yourself sitting in the room just the way you are from a distance.
Kind of seeing the room from a distance with this person in it who is meditating. Maybe
a fly on the ceiling. What it would look like to look down upon the room and see this person
there. And maybe in the room around you, there's stillness. There's no movement in the room
except for maybe you breathing. There's a lot of space around you. Visualize or sense
the space, the distance between objects in the room and you. And from this distance,
imaginary distance of looking down upon the room and you meditating. Recall how you were
feeling at the beginning of the meditation. And what's it like to be aware of yourself
from a distance of like a fly in the ceiling in the context of this room to be aware of
yourself from a distance? Are some things easier to be aware of? Some things more difficult?
But might there be from a distance of the ceiling less identification, less activation
or entanglement? Seeing everything, feeling everything as if seeing it from a distance
with lots of space around it. Or you can imagine that you're a bird high in the sky looking down
in the building you're in. And from that distance, what's it like to be aware of yourself?
Be aware of the dramas of your life, the concerns and fears of your life,
the stories, the events. To be aware of it all from a distance,
be high in the sky. One person among many people
on a great planet, sitting quietly, meditating.
And now imagine that you zoom back into your room,
maybe a fly on the ceiling just close in now,
closer in, aware of this person that's you sitting in the room.
And now to zoom even closer in and settle into your usual way of meditating with yourself.
But this time, maybe with a little bit more openness,
equanimity, spaciousness, non-involvement.
Just allowing things to be quiet and simple, whatever it might be.
A sense of non-entanglement without being bothered by anything,
whatever you're feeling or thinking. Just something else to be aware of
with a kind of maybe ease or distance as if you're aware from far away.
And then as we come to the end of the sitting,
to engage your imagination a little, just enough to imagine that now
you turn your gaze out to the world. Maybe with a bird's eye view,
you're gazing kindly on all the people in your life, in your neighborhood, in your town,
in your province, wherever you are. See if you can gaze upon them
with a gaze that's like rain, gentle rain, that
brings kindness, care, respect.
Seeing everyone as important, valuable, granting everyone their dignity, and
a broad, wide gaze of kindness, of care, of compassion,
the broad view, the bird's eye view,
through which the heart's love can flow outwards, wishing everyone well,
having goodwill for all beings. May all beings be happy, may all beings be safe,
may all beings be peaceful, may all beings be free,
and may we follow the gaze of kindness to be kind in this world.
Thank you.
