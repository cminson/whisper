One of the important aspects of meditation is becoming 
concentrated. The ability to get concentrated is in 
inverse proportion to how interested you are in your 
thinking. The more intere st that goes into your thoughts 
or the images  the mind makes, the less interest there  is 
available for focu sing on something like the breathing or 
loving kindness practice . The more energy that goes 
into thinking, the less energy there is available for 
concentration.  The question is where do you put this 
wonderful, precious resource you have, of your energy, 
attention and involvement? In meditation we ’re choosing 
not to let  the mind go off into the world of thoughts , but 
rather choosing  some place to keep it cent ered, 
grounded , involved. We choose to  get interested  in that 
place , and to stay there the best we can.  
 
Ideally , concentration involves steadying the attention  
on something like the breath, or on phrases of loving 
kindness. Is there a st eadying or focusing in? There are  
many ways on focu sing on the breath . If you ’ve never 
done this before, one way that is  often helpful for 
concentration is to focus on  a small area for following 
the breath , which becomes  the reference point for your attention  – for example: a small area just below the 
naval, or in the middle of your chest, or perhaps the tip 
of your nose – some very small area that you ’re going to 
really hone in on , and surf on, or cruise on, or hang in 
on, or massage , or anything  that will help you stay there 
in such a way that you ’re staying there , more than 
you’re wandering off into your thoughts and id eas. You 
hang in there.  
 
There are a  couple images for staying  put, staying 
present at one p lace, in focus and concentrated . One is 
flying a kite . In order for the kite to fly , the string has to 
be taut. If the string is too loose  or gets slack, the kite 
will fall . If it’s too tight, you can break the string  in a 
strong wind. If a really a strong wind  comes up in  gusts, 
you let the string out , but y ou don ’t let go of the 
tautness; you keep  it taut. If it gets loose, you pull  the 
string in. You do  the same thing with attention – you 
want to keep connected.  I don ’t know  if ‘taut’ is the right 
expression here , but you find  just the right balance of 
attention. You keep the string attached from your mind 
to the point of your breathing. You want to keep it there 
with just right tautness – not slack, not tight as you stay  
with it . That ’s an image I ’ve used which has been 
helpful for me.  
 
Another image which someone else used, which she 
found it very helpful, was  staying with t he breath  like 
riding  a wild bronco  in a rodeo . When she got the idea  that she was trying to hang on and  stay in the saddle of 
this wild bronco , then she was better able t o hang in 
there with her breath . 
 
I don ’t know what works better for you , but the idea is 
that it really hel ps a lot to get steady and focus ed, and 
to stay connected  with one thing  over a long period of 
time. Let the mind hone in, organize, and settle  into the 
process, shed ding or letting go of its concerns, it s 
preoccupations with other things.  Whether it ’s walking 
meditation or sitting meditation, concentration is a 
wonderful way to help the m ind divest itself of some of 
its anxious preoccupations.
