Dharmette: Something about Nothing  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

In terms of a Dharma talk today I was thinking about 
what to say , and reflecting on how I felt . Sometimes I 
feel that it’s a little bit odd, this role being a meditation 
teacher . In meditation when I sit, my mind often gets 
kind of empty , and I don’t have much to say . Why 
should you say anything ? But then as a teacher , you’re 
expected to say something . So, how do I d o that? I 
could try to say something about nothing , and try to 
explain how nothing is significant and important.  I’ll start 
with a few stories.  
 
In the early ‘60s, Suzuki Roshi , a Zen teacher who 
came from Japan , was teaching at the Japanese temple 
in Japan town. And at a neighboring Buddhist temple , a 
Japanese Pure Land temple , there was a young 
Japanese minister name d Reverend Ogui, who had just 
come from Japan and spoke almost no English . And he 
started coming and sitting Zen meditation with Suzuki 
Roshi . This  is very unusual , because in Japan , there are 
different sects of Buddhism that are quite segregated 
from each other . Reverend Ogui came , and did zazen, 
and hung out with Suzuki Roshi for a few years . And at  some point , Suzuki Roshi asked Reverend Ogui to give 
a Dharma talk at the Zen Center . And Reverend Ogui 
said, “No I can’t . My English is not good enough. ” The 
next time Reverend Ogui came to the Zen Center to 
hear a Dharma talk from Suzuki Roshi , this is the 
Dharma talk he heard : “Today is today. Today is not 
tomorrow. Tomorrow is not today. Today is not 
yesterday. Yesterday is not today. Today is today.” It 
was a Dharma talk for which you needed five English 
words , and Reverend Ogui  got the message [laughs] . 
He told me the story many years later.  
 
It might seem like a silly story , but there is something 
profound about , “Today is today .” How often are we 
today? How often are we caught up in the future or the 
past, and never question what is the future , and what is 
the past? We can give tremendous amount of authority 
to the future and the past . Some people live mostly in 
the future . Some people live mostly in the past – ‘live’ in 
the sense of where their mind is . And what is it? There’s  
the future that you’re planning for . How often does it 
occur? I know I’ve have a lot of futures that never 
happened . And those futures that never happened  – 
what were they when I was thinking them? Kind of a 
virtual reality . And so to be here – now – today.  
 
Trudy Goodman – who is a Vipassan ā teacher in Los 
Angeles – told me this story. She went to a convention 
of Buddhist teachers, leaders, priests, monks . I think she said it was in Vietnam , maybe in the 1990s . 
Buddhist leader s from all over Asia I guess were there . 
And Mahā Ghosānanda came to give a keynote speech 
at this big convention . Mahā Ghos ānanda was one of 
the few Buddhist monks to survive the Pol Pot 
destruction of Cambodia . He survived because he was 
practicing  and s tudying in Thailand . After the downfall of 
Pol Pot , he went back to try to help his country , and try 
to revive Buddhism . He was a Ghandi -ish kind of 
person . I met him , a beautiful man: very simple, humble, 
clean man . He went back to Cambodia and became the 
Supreme Patriarch because there was no -one else to 
do it. He was the last man standing . So here , as the 
Supreme Patriarch , he was asked to give the keynote 
address to t he convention . He came up on the podium , 
and he began his talk . I guess Cambodia and Vietnam 
have  a background of French colonization, so maybe 
that’s why he spoke in French . What he did was to 
conjugate the verb ‘to be ’ in French: je suis, tu e s, nous 
sommes – “I am, you are, we are, they are, he is, she 
is.” And as he was speaking , people started to cry. “I 
am, you are, we are ?” I don’t know how many French 
words it takes to give that talk . But what is it that can be 
so profound that people cry in conjuga ting the French 
verb ‘to be ?’ What gets recognized in people’s minds 
and hearts? What do they hear? What do they touch? 
What happens to you, just to be? “I am. ” 
 
This is a story I’ve told sometimes of when I was fifteen . I lived for a while at a boarding school . It was in a very 
beautiful location, high in the mountains . Above us were  
the higher mountains with beautiful snow -capped 
mountains , and below beautiful green valleys . Beautiful 
blue skies ! It’s a beautiful place to go to school , except 
that it was a reform school . And I remember I was 
walking on the dirt roads in the mountains with a 
seventeen year old friend , and I was just in awe of this 
place . It felt like somehow , something inside of me 
stopped or opened in wonder . And I turned to my f riend , 
without really wanting an answer , but just to express 
what I was feeling , and I said, “Why are we here? Why 
are we alive? What is this?” Unfortunately for me , I 
think , he turned to me and said, “Don’t be silly!” And 
something in my heart just close d up.  
 
It took many years for that part of me to open again . But 
why is any of this here? How often do you ask and look 
around? Why is this here, any of it? What’s going on 
here? It’s kind of a miracle . It’s been said that if you 
really want to experience a miracle , follow your next 
breath . To breathe is a miracle ; to have a thought is a 
miracle.  
 
How often do we find some profundity in just being 
alive? How often do we have a sense of amazement? 
Wow ! Why does anything exist? How did this happen?   
 
A very significant moment in my life was on the Bay Bridge in about 197 8 or ’79. I  was driving across the 
Bay Bridge with Mel W eitsman , who was my Zen 
teacher . Back then , he had a 1960s V olkswag en bug. 
He was giving me a ride , and he was asking me about 
myself. What I was up to ? I told him what I was doing . I 
don’t know if I was in the middle of telling him , or had 
finished , but he turned to me and said, very simply, 
“Just to be alive is enough. ”  
 
Just to be alive is enough . And somehow that just 
touched s omething inside of me , and resonated . Or was 
so meaningful that something inside of me just let go , 
and relaxed . It’s enough to be alive ! How often do we 
have to prove ourselves? How often do we have to 
protect ourselves and do something different , or get 
something or acquire something , or be the right kind of 
person , or do all kinds of stuff? How often is just being 
alive enough? How often just being is enough?  
 
And I know from being a teacher on retreats – it 
happened this week as well – I’ve seen that people stop 
their busy lives to sit still for a week, to sit still for half an 
hour: be mindful, be present to meditate, do nothing, 
just be – and it’s boring [laughs] . Why would anyone 
want to do this? And not only sometimes it’s boring , but 
there’s resistance . And the lawyers in the mind come up 
to explain why this is the most ridiculous thing in the 
world to do , because there are important things to be 
done , and important things to think, important things to avoid and to run away from . There’s all t his stuff .  
 
The mind has tremendous capacity to be churning 
around , spinning around , and thinking and planning and 
fantasizing and wanting and averting . I think what 
happens, often enough in some minds, is that there’s 
this momentum that gets set in motio n, which is  self-
propelling . And if you sit down to meditate – to be quiet 
– it doesn’t just stop . The spinning of the mind 
continues . And that spinning of the mind spins because 
it’s being fueled by things like : it’s not enough just to be . 
I have to get t hings . I have to fix things . I have to protect 
myself . I have to have pleasure . I have to have success . 
I have to have a relationship . I have to ; I have to ; I have 
to. There’s a lot of authority in that . And with that 
authority , and with that momentum , and with that 
movement of the mind , and always wanting – it can 
seem that the meaning in our life, the success of our 
life, is at the other end of those thoughts: the fulfillment 
of those thoughts . Often it’s like the gold pot at t he end 
of the rainbow . People look for the gold pot forever , but 
it’s not to be found.  
 
To stop the searching, stop the looking, stop the 
wanting to do with the mind , the spinning of the mind : it 
can be a very difficult transition because the authority is 
in getting and doing and wanting and thinking . That’s 
where the value seems to be . To stop and interrupt that 
can seem very boring . It can seem like nothing , like there’s no value . To have not hing has no value , right? 
Obviously , nothing is nothing . Nothing is less than 
something . Isn’t something better than nothing?   
 
But to sit and discover that having nothing in the mind – 
churning, agitated, wanting, averting, pushing – to let 
the mind come  to rest – to let the desiring mind rest – 
and to open the eyes and see with wonder, with 
amazement, to appreciate each other directly for being 
fellow sentient beings , as opposed to seeing each other 
through the filter of our desires and wants and aversio ns 
and fears and all these ideas we have – it’s a beautiful 
thing.  
 
One of the things that often happens on retreat is that , 
by the end of the retreat , so much has dropped away , 
that when people finally break silence and talk , they talk 
with so much friendship and warmth . So much of the 
usual social ways in which people see each other fall 
away . We meet more as equals . It’s a beautiful thing ! 
 
What does it take? What perspective does it take? What 
approach does it take ? Where am I? Or today is today? 
Or just to be alive is enough? Where does that express 
something really deep and meaningful ? And what 
prevents it? What are the protests that say, “Well that 
can’t be enough! I have important things to do! I’m an 
important person! I  can’t stop  – I have important things 
to do! ”  
That’s all I have for today . I am. You are . And 
wonderfully , we are together.  Thank you for being here 
today.
