Practice Note : Thoughts as Scenery

When people meditate, one of the topics of concern to 
address, to understand , is our thinking. Some people 
think more in words, some more in images. We have 
concerns, interests, preoccupations , and we get 
involved in these thoughts.  As people meditate, they 
begin to learn that it’s not nec essary to live in their 
thinking . It’s not necessary to always be seeing 
ourselves or the world through the lens of our thoughts. 
Some people are so closely wedded to their thoughts , 
that they think they are their thoughts . It seems like 
what they think  is who they are.  
 
It’s also possible to shift  that relationship . Thoughts can 
occur, but we don’t  have to  identify so strongly  with 
them . When we aren’t glued to them, they become more 
like scenery . We can see the thoughts arise , and they’re 
scenery ; they’re phenomena of nature. They can be 
wondrous  in their own way, but we don’t have to feel 
like we’re in the thoughts, that we’re living in them, or 
glued to them.  
 
This ability to step away from thoughts and see them as 
part of the scenery is a very h elpful part of meditation practice. It takes a lot to get the hang of it. In this room, 
we have a high ceiling and big room, and it  may be  easy 
to be more interested in the people in the room , than the 
space. You might be very interested in the people, so 
you’re thinking , “Who am I sitting next to ? Who’s here ? 
What’s going on ? How do I fit in? ”  
 
It’s also possible to look around and notice that there’s a 
lot of space in the room , and especially if you look up, 
you feel the space and have a very different r elationship 
to the room  and to what ‘s going on . It’s more spacious . 
We’re not so fix ated on the people.  
 
Or there might be sounds , and we might be very 
concerned with the sounds, but the sounds are a part of 
the scenery, and actually simultaneously  there’s a lot of 
stillness – a lot of silence.  Our interest focuses on the 
sound, but the open awareness sees the sound just as 
scenery . There’s actually a lot of silence around it. It’s 
the same way with thinking . If you look beyond the 
edges , or on the other side, or i n the space around your 
thinking , you’ll see that there’s a lot of space within 
which thinking occurs. If you think in wor ds, if it sounds 
like an inner voice, or a noise, and there’s actually a lot 
of silence on the edges , around it, below it, above it.  
 
If your thinking is agitated, then beyond the edges of 
that agitation, there’s actually a lot of peace. So, what 
you might  try to do today, is to see if you can become aware of what’s outside of the boundaries, the limits of 
your thinking.  
 
I guarantee that your thinking doesn’t fill the universe – 
the infinite cosmic space into which yo ur thoughts go 
out. And they don’t  fill your mind either. The mind is 
vast. So see if you can get the  hang of how to step 
away from your thoughts, to see beyond them, to the ir 
edges. What’s just beyond ? What’s just below ? What’s 
just above?  
 
And you’ll probably find a very different relat ionship to 
yourself, to your thoughts, and to the world when you’re 
aware of all the space, stillness, peace and silence here 
as well.  So I hope you enjoy this morning .
