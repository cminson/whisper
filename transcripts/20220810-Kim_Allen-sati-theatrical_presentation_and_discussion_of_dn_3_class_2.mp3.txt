 Okay, so welcome to our second session on the Ambhata Sutta, DN3. And we'd like to start, as we often do in these classes, with a chance for any questions from you about the previous one or about the Sutta in general, anything on your mind as we get going today. Do you want to give a little review about what we did yesterday, Kim? Yeah, so we talked yesterday about, or say yesterday, but of course it was Monday, about the storytelling nature of the Dhygma Kaya suttas, is that many of them are long, the long discourses, and they're long because they have these kind of elaborate stories. The stories are often set up that way as these narratives, usually of the questioner talking with the Buddha, as well as some other characters supporting, kind of as conversion narratives, and we'll see more of that as this goes along. It was positioning the Buddha's teachings relative to other teachings at the time. Now the Buddha didn't arise in a vacuum, and so there was, so we talked about that aspect. And then in our dramatization, we saw something about this character, mostly we saw the character Ambhata being respectful to his teacher, Pope Arasati, who's a very well-known senior Brahman, and in that case he was, you know, just told to go look for the 32 marks, and so he did. He said yes, I will, but then when he actually arrived, he remembered the time that the Sakyans insulted him, and so he had a big self come up and was not respectful to the Buddha and his monks, and so we had some tension there because he ended up calling the Sakyans riffraff three times, and that was where we left off, and we'll continue with that today, but we're curious about any, if there's anything coming up. Maybe I'll say something that's interesting, is that Kim, you're using this word, this dramatization, but really we're just reading the sutta, you know, with each of us having characters, so it's fascinating that the sutta itself is providing the script. You'll see, especially today, we kind of like, we're not going to go through every single thing in the sutta, so we cut some pieces out, but it's fascinating that the sutta itself has this drama, and we might consider like, why is that? And further, and again, if there are no questions or reflections, I'm just looking around to see if there are any hand raised. Feel free to use the little hand provided by Zoom, but also just raise a hand, wave it around, but I just, sort of building on Diana's point, part of our exploration here for the four of us as teachers, is to better understand how the oral culture that preserve these texts, so that we can benefit from them, had a different character, had a different feeling, that even read in voices somehow, the characters come alive, and our idea is that so too do the teachings. In other words, there's something about this way of interacting with the, what are now texts, interacting with them as part of an oral tradition of thousands of years, actually very forcefully frames the teachings, advances the teachings, maybe creates a way for the teachings to enter that's different than when we read a text or hear about it or see it quoted. So any thoughts, any questions? Catherine has her hand up. Catherine. When I heard about calling the Buddha's clan and him, Rifrath, I felt like I could relate, not that I would want to call the Buddha Rifrath, but that I might not know what the appropriate way would be to greet and act with teachers. And since a lot of my interaction has been with the teachers, you teachers on Zoom, I'm not asking have I been respectful, but I wonder if there isn't some way that, well even when I was going to the center, I heard reference to, you don't leave the room before the teacher or you don't speak over the teacher, those two things, but that's not much. And I wonder if today there are rules of respect that I might not know. It's a good point. And there is a certain kind of culture that's developed in the insight tradition, at least, and to the point where some centers have guidelines for beginners or something on their websites that include things like remembering to take off your shoes before you go in the meditation hall. Sometimes they mention the Thai tradition of not pointing the feet at the teacher, things like that. And these are things that wouldn't be known necessarily. And having been involved in developing some of these at certain centers, there's also kind of a sometimes a mixed feeling about posting them or somehow communicating them. They simultaneously serve to settle doubts and anxieties, and they can also incite some irritation from people. So it's a balance and probably you can't ever please anyone, everyone, shall we say. But humans have these protocols. And for the most part, they're useful. Yeah. And maybe I'll just add, it's the usual thing that you would show to anybody who is talking the usual stuff, not showing up late or not getting up in the middle when somebody's talking or when the teacher is talking and leaving, you know, these kinds of things I would throw in there. How about Susan? Well, I want first to say that this is just delightful. So thank you for putting this together. Thank you, Susan. And I think the observation that it's different when you're experiencing orally is true. And it's also different, of course, that it's written in a different style, written as a dialogue, which makes me experience it in various ways. I noticed early on when Ammita was disrespectful to the Buddha, I found myself wondering from the perspective of the Buddha, how will I handle this? And really being curious to see how he would handle it. So it's a whole different dimension because it's a dialogue. And because it's slowed down, I guess, by being moral instead of reading. I just get dashed through and see how he handled it. So it's cool. Thank you for putting it on. Yeah. It does give that flavor. Great. Yeah. And they are dialogues. You know, for the most part, the Buddha taught through the dialogue with somebody asking a question. And the context often matters. And so we're getting a lot more of that in these story-like ones. All right. So with that, I'll pass it on to Diana. So I'm going to do a little bit of meditation. And maybe this is for the four of us, for us to be a little bit called before we about to embark on this, but also just an opportunity for us to kind of like finish arriving, so to speak, to arrive into this space. So and what we're about to do together. So we'll begin by just taking a meditative posture, one that has some alertness, some uprightness, and has some ease and relaxation. And then checking in with the body. How is the body at this moment? That might mean noticing the pressure against the body wherever sitting, pressure of the chair, the cushion, the couch, wherever we might be. Noticing the body in the sense of to sit and know that you're sitting. Checking in if there's some places that have some obvious tension or tightness or uncomfortableness. Can we invite that into our meditation too? And though it might not be what we wish for, it is here. So with a sense of acceptance, openness, can we allow the present moment experience to be as it is? And of course, the body is breathing. Can we tune into that experience? The movement of the chest or the belly, the stretching, and the return of the stretch as the body breathes. And with that same attitude of allowing, just noticing that when the mind wanders, this is what minds do, just very gently bring the mind back. Begin again with the sensations of breathing. We don't have to make a big story. Just very simply begin again. Think after that silence. allowing the rhythm of the sensations of breathing to be a support for a softening letting go tuning in to this moment that we are in the information age so much information readily available can you imagine what it might be like if the only source the single source of information is what somebody has told you what you have heard from others is the only way you would learn anything know about anything confirm anything this only about dialogue no reading no writing no recording of any sort what people say is if paramount importance can you imagine you back from that imagination to feeling grounded connected to this experience you thank you Diana for settling sit and I wonder maybe just to follow along but Diana said and towards the end this oral tradition where you know there is no texting and messaging and emails and social media and what have you and so in that backdrop as a background you can see the words how they are say said what words are chosen to be said can carry a lot of I'm gonna say fire in them right so in our next reading I want to just tee up a little bit that there are some challenges in this reading I want to point out maybe just to orient our mind and heart a little bit this next piece of reading the different translations use the words that can be challenging triggering for many people especially given the modern-day context that we are living in here in America right and so I just say a few of those slave slave girl and the Pali term is Disa black boy and that's Sujato's translation that Pali term kung-ha goblins you know well texting the text message goblins so Pali term of peace a ka you know even when and the teaching team looked into different translations we were all kind of like and so we wanted to just acknowledge this and the teaching team recognize the potential difficulties because of the context we're in the associations we may attribute to them and so in our reading we actually came up with something that we felt to be more true to what is expressed and that is not necessarily Sujato's translation or other people's translations doesn't mean that this are better translations but it's really just really offers some care in terms of those words that are being used and they are rather significant in this piece of the teaching that is unfolding as well so we did spend quite a lot of time in working with this challenge challenge as part of the teaching team I also want to acknowledge that this is not necessarily just a translation issue they are challenging issues at the time and they are challenging issues now where we are right and so as a teaching team we also felt like simply avoiding it kind of bypassing this piece of a conversation hmm you know as we practice as part of our practice and learning maybe what is needed is to offer respectful recognition of this and a learning and it's driving to skillfully relate to this piece of a text and see what the teaching is conveying here so then maybe that's the invitation that I will offer as we listen to this or watch and listen to this next piece of a dramatic reading which started after an ombata called the Buddha riffraff and the whole Sakyong's riffraff three times so here we go this next tea piece this ombata puts down the Sakyong's too much by calling them riffraff ombata what is your clan I am a Kanhanyan master Gautama ombata in former days according to those who remember the ancestral lineage the Sakyong's were the masters and you are descended from a slave girl of the Sakyong's the Sakyong's regard King Okaka as their ancestor King Okaka had a slave girl named Disa and she gave birth to a black baby named Kanha when he was born the black baby Kanha said wash me mother bathe me get this filth off of me I will be useful to you whereas these days when people see goblins they call them goblins in those days they call goblins black Kanha the Sakyong said he spoke as soon as he was born from that day on the Kanhaianas were recognized and he was their founder that's how in former days according to those who remember the ancestral lineage the Sakyong's were the masters and you are descended from a slave girl of the Sakyong's master Gautama please don't put ombata down too much by calling him the son of a slave girl he's well born he's a gentleman learned a good speaker astute he's capable of having a dialogue with master Gautama about this well students if you think that ombata is ill-born not a gentleman uneducated a poor speaker witless and not capable of having a dialogue with me about this then leave him aside and you can have a dialogue with me but if you think he is well born a gentleman learned a good speaker astute and capable of having a dialogue with me about this then you should stand aside and let him have a dialogue with me yes ombata is capable of having a dialogue with you will all be silent and let ombata have a dialogue with master Gautama well ombata there's a legitimate question that comes up you won't like it but you ought to answer it anyway if you don't answer but dodge the issue remain silent or simply leave your head will explode in seven pieces right here what do you think ombata according to what you have heard from elderly and senior ramans what is the origin of the Kanha in us and who is their founder when he had said this ombata kept silent and so for a second time the Buddha put the question to ombata and for a second time ombata kept silent answer now ombata now is not the time for silence if someone fails to answer a legitimate question when asked three times by the Buddha their head explodes into seven pieces there and then now at this time the spirit Vajirappani holding a massive iron spear burning and blazing and glowing stood in the sky above ombata thinking if this ombata doesn't answer this question a third time I'll blow his head into seven pieces here and now and both the Buddha and ombata could see Vajirappani ombata was terrified shocked awestruck looking to the Buddha for shelter protection and refuge ombata sat down close to the Buddha what did you say please repeat the question what do you think ombata according to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahman's what is the origin of the Kanha in us and who is their founder I have heard Master Gautama that it is just as you say that is the origin of the Kahun yans and that's who their founder is it turns out that ombata is ill-born not a gentleman descendant for Masakian slave and the Sakyans are ombata's masters we disparaged the refuse the recuse Gautama thinking he was not speaking the truth these students put ombata down too much by calling him the son of a slave why don't I get him out of this students please don't put ombata down too much by calling him the son of a slave that Kanha was an eminent sage that Kanha was an eminent sage who later married the king's daughter what do you think ombata suppose the Brahmins for some reason were to shave a Brahmin's head inflict him with a sack of ashes and banish him from the city would he receive a seat and water from the Brahmins no that Brahman would not receive a seat from the other Brahmins Master Gautama hmm and would the Brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors a sacrifice or a feast for guests no those Brahmins would not feed the banished Brahmin and would the Brahmins teach him the sacred verses or not no the other Brahmins would not teach that banished Brahmin the sacred verses and what do you think ombata suppose the aristocrats were for some reason to shave an aristocrats head and inflict him with a sack of ashes and banish him from the nation or the city would he receive a seat and water from the Brahmins yes the banished aristocrat would receive a seat from the Brahmins Master Gautama and would the Brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors a sacrifice or a feast for guests yes the Brahmins would feed that banished aristocrat and would the Brahmins teach him the sacred verses or not yes the Brahmins would teach the banister aristocrat the sacred verses aha so at this point ombata that aristocrat has reached rock bottom with head shaven inflicted with a set of ashes and banished from the city or nation yet still the aristocrats are superior and the Brahmins inferior Brahma Sanankumara spoke this verse the aristocrat is first among people who take clan as the standard but one accomplished in knowledge and conduct is first among gods and humans now that verse was well said by the Brahma Sanankumara not poorly said well spoken not poorly spoken beneficial not harmful and it was approved by me for I also say the aristocrat is first among people who take clan as the standard but one accomplished in knowledge and conduct is first among gods and humans but what mr. Gautama is that conduct and what is that knowledge ombata in the supreme knowledge and conduct there is no discussion of ancestry or clan or pride whoever is attached to questions of ancestry or clan or pride is far from the supreme knowledge and conduct the realization of supreme knowledge and conduct occurs when you've given up such things so that ended this long zigzag conversation between ombata and the Buddha I want to offer a few reflection words on this piece as you can see you know after hearing this kind of back and forth between and the two one thing that occurred to me was that this pedagogical teaching kind of style or device that contrast and highlight the teaching of the true Brahman that the Buddha read in the end the Buddha or Kim read in the end the Buddha conveyed in the end but it didn't just happen you know it was after a long back and forth between ombata and the Buddha and partly because on put a showed up with certain kind of attitude and that he just wasn't ready and so the Buddha had to do kind of preparation work and by speaking in the terrain that ombata understands using his language using what his mind is associated with and before this last piece of a teaching is conveyed so I wanted to just share and this one slide to maybe highlight a little bit of this back and forth that was happening so let's see okay so so in this back and forth see if it's loading here ombata showed up full of himself and they started calling riffraffs to the Buddha and that in this conversation between ombata and the Buddha the Buddha first had to settle a little bit of that full of himself by using his knowledge of ombata's clan the lineage and pointing out that you are coming from the son of a slave girl and kind of a pudding in his mind said that oh your lineage actually has something that isn't said and he pointed this out and in order to kind of kind of temper down a little bit of ombata's mind but what happened in this drama is when this was said the Brahman student made an uproar kind of like what this can't be true but it was true and you know even Vajrapani as little spirit came up and so that actually pushed ombata to this totally miserable kind of a domain and the Buddha had to re-establish his kind of state of being a little bit by pointing out well it's not all like that and here ombata also has a heritage of being a sage has a certain qualities and that worthy of respect but then towards the end after all this drama and settling Buddha's mind the Buddha now had to establish himself in this social setting that ombata is ombata cared about by pointing out that a risk at a risk rats are actually higher than all that you cared about and there is this interesting debate that we're going back and forth that Buddha was I guess Buddha was including partially because the Brahmins are also trained in this form of analysis so Buddha was still using the kind of a style that ombata was a familiar with but then in the end that the Buddha quoted the Brahman a Brahma quote in order to establish the true Brahman teaching which is based on knowledge and conduct based on the inner quality rather than all this social constructs and external external qualities so you can see and there's a teaching style that that pedagogical style that the Buddha used so much has to do with establishing that connection with the audience in such a way that they can connect with what the Buddha had to say and then in the end the teaching kind of in a sleight of hand was offered conveyed so maybe that's a little visual and that I'll offer and then I'll just say a few words about the little piece that showed up in this exchange is this a spirit of Vajrapani and there's a spirit that only the Buddha and an ombata saw and the context of this there's a spirit that showed up was that the Buddha asked the ombata questions three times in this tradition usually the three times of questioning is quite significant and so we see that exactly how do we relate to the presence of Vajrapani of the spirit and do we take them take the the presence as literally or do we believe that this is simply not true because this is just a drama that got inserted I invite maybe for some creative way of relating to this for me personally you know instead of completely believing it's true or dismissing it I wondered about whether there are some ways that we can relate to this that could be interesting and supportive for example for me some of this kind of a mystical dimensions coming in in the sutta also evoke a sense of heart quality and maybe people who are composing reciting this pieces have some deep love and devotion to the Buddha and its qualities and we don't quite know and as I was reading some of this pieces and they don't know mind comes in you know we don't have to know and maybe it has some space in our heart in our mind and that offers us something that's a supportive at sometimes maybe other times it may not and so I want to just invite to some creative association with things like this in the sutta so with that I'm gonna pass on to David thank you ying thanks for being about your epony to with the the sword and flames fairy and mask yeah great yeah so we'd like to just open it up now before proceeding to a next reading to just see if there any questions questions or reflections on this comment we've got time for just a couple questions or reflections if anybody's if anybody has anything to share Jerry I have a reflection and sort of a question maybe I'll just do the question I'm learning slowly I always suspected but this is the first time in this in my hearing so this is the question Buddha was because I think all religious leaders are sort of revolutionaries to their culture that this made the first I mean we studied it before but it seems like this future could be taken and I'm asking very much as a as indictment or at least that thinking exercise regarding the caste system I see now for the first time he uses their logic and then turns it around of this is really what's important so is this revealing the Buddha's true deeper position on caste it's a great question Jerry and it runs through here and I think you know the simple pat answer would be yes or yes perhaps and it may be more complicated than that it's not just cast right it's anything that has to do with things that we attach to that we become attached to itself so it's cast and more so the revolution maybe goes deeper than than just sort of a so that runs through the teachings but yeah she pointed something quite interesting and I would just say there's a really wonderful Aikido here where the Buddha establishes in this using the rhetorical devices of Brahmins establishes that he actually comes from a pure lineage and then he says that's not important so it's a it's a one-two punch and and more that's Steve sorry I don't think it was mentioned in your commentary but in that last piece the Buddha before the final teaching the Buddha says that the katriyas and the aristocrats are katriyas right isn't that right so are the are are of higher respect than the Brahmins but and that and ying I think you said that establishes the Buddha gives context to where the Buddha is coming from and you didn't mention that that the Buddha is a member of that class but that is true right yeah that's important point thanks yeah absolutely right and also say thank you for pointing that out in fact it's the Brahma who says that because the Buddha quoted the Brahma so that credibility you know you can see this Aikido move that kind of like put this words back to the Brahmins the Brahmins realm but they said that the Buddha Buddha's clan is the highest so it was even a more a more sensitive teaching because he said him he gave himself the authority and then he demolished even his own authority in the worldly sense yes yes yes and we have time for one more will I see your hand out the Brahman that the Buddha quoted is he one of the ancient Rishis the to whom the Vedas were attributed or is he another Brahman good question I'm gonna let Diana feel that yeah he's a he's a higher than a Rishi he's a Brahma which means he's like one of the Creator gods or so the absolute highest authority in the Brahmanical tradition thanks question will that helps establish him and the previous question the Buddha kind of in in a broader context and I like to just mention one small thing here that's implicit but maybe it's helpful to make it explicit by the Buddha saying you know actually on but you know your ancestral lineage is not exactly like you've been saying it is he's kind of saying that on but and some are not telling the truth have not been telling the truth and this has so much implications right when everything depends on what people say to kind of like undermine on this way is really a big thing it's a really a big thing and we'll get to it in a moment but I would just following Diana's comment the gentleness with which the Buddha does this makes it almost it makes it almost it makes it quite difficult to see because of the many ways that one could move this direction the Buddha is very careful in his approach we'll talk about that in a moment so now we'd like to move to another reading which I'll set up briefly with just a couple comments and then I'll put on the narrator Ananda's hat and and we'll move back into a reading but as we just said by invoking Brahma and then reaffirming it with his own voice the Buddha forcefully reframes the debate for Ambat and for all present and for us revealing what's really important in the spiritual practice what makes a true Brahman or a true holy person or true follower of a spiritual path knowledge and conduct or something he calls knowledge and conduct so it's interesting that here Ambat starts to seem curious in a way that he wasn't at the outset and he seems to open up a bit and he asks the Buddha to elaborate it's the first time he's asked sort of a question of the Buddha of this sort what what do you mean by this knowledge and conduct tell me more now I'm interested whatever the Buddha has done in his approach it seems to have landed a bit with Ambat in this kind of opening of the mind to something that he's wasn't previously interested in and with that there's a little bit of dropping the self some of that pride and prejudice has been softened so in the reading that follows the Buddha does tell him something about this knowledge and conduct in the form of something called the gradual training without putting in a plug for the four of us we did a whole course on the gradual training a couple few years ago and it's important to notice that we did a whole course it's very detailed in some of the other suttas here it's abbreviated and yet the implication is that the audience would have known about unlike Ambat they would have known about the gradual training and so it can be just mentioned and so you'll hear little corners of the development of ethical action sila samadhi the cultivation of meditated centeredness and collectedness of mind and panya seeing clearly the wisdom that comes the insight that comes from our practice they're mentioned briefly here but the implication is that a longer a longer description was actually involved so I'm now donning the head of the narrator if I'm really quick about this I can change my name to narrator and slip back into the action so we join Ambat and the Buddha after the Buddha has again reframed the argument with this this passage in the supreme knowledge and conduct he tells Ambat there is no discussion of ancestry or clan now we're into something new ancestry or clan or pride have nothing have no place in the realization of the supreme knowledge and conduct but what master Gautama is that conduct and what is that knowledge Ambat it's when a realized one arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed he teaches Dhamma that's good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end and he reveals a spiritual practice that's entirely full and pure a householder hears that teaching or a householder's child or someone born in some clan they gain faith in the realized one and go forth in the monastic Sangha having trained in ethical conduct sense restraint and mindfulness a resort to a secluded place aroused compassion for all living beings and meditate quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first Jhana this pertains to their conduct further they enter and remain in the second third and fourth Jhana this too pertains to their conduct this is that conduct when their mind has become immersed in Samadhi like this purified bright flawless reed of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbable they extend it and projected toward knowledge and vision this pertains to their knowledge they understand there is no return to any state of existence this too pertains to their knowledge this is that knowledge this mendicant is said to be accomplished in knowledge and also accomplished in conduct and also accomplished in knowledge and conduct and amata there is no accomplishment in knowledge and conduct better or finer than this having said this the Buddha came out of his dwelling and proceeded to begin walking mindfully and amata did likewise while walking beside the Buddha but to scrutinized his body for the 32 marks of a great man he saw all of them except for two which he had doubts about whether the private parts were covered in a sheath and the largeness of the tongue the Buddha knowing this use his psychic power to will that amata could see his private parts covered in a sheath and he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils covering his entire forehead with his tongue correctly screwed to my possesses the 32 marks completely like a nun well now sir I must go I have many duties and much to do please amata go at your convenience so I gotta take my hat off I'm back to David this is a short but quite important passage that sets up the denouement the climax of the action that comes Friday the Buddha's expertly constructed set of rhetorical devices drawn from the Brahmin's own traditional formal debate has allowed him to turn the tables and make amata and we can sense maybe the whole audience a little bit more receptive to his teachings even though I'm but I was clearly checking her watch and you know not not entirely tuned in there's a there's a different a greater receptivity of the teaching it's really fascinating that the Buddha perceives on but this pride and prejudice not as an impediment but as a vehicle for often a shift of perspective the Buddha's whole focus is on the teaching and in umpit his views he sees a bigger picture right he sees clinging selfing suffering and the way to freedom how did this transformation happen we might suggest that part of it has to do with wise speech we can perceive throughout wonderfully portrayed by Kim in the role of the Buddha the Buddha's use of wise speech there's no anger offense taken vindictiveness or hostility in the Buddhist speech his speech we can sense comes from an open heart has an eye on freedom it's truthful and it's spoken at the right time the marks of wise speech keeps his eye on the big picture the opportunity in this setting any setting any set of conditions to teach and to open minds to the teachings so he lays out this gradual training the path toward the knowledge and conduct that makes for a true Brahman and importantly as came up in the question just a moment ago it's open to anybody regardless of birth caste class or religious tradition interesting and really important given what comes up on Friday is that the Buddha describes the gradual training to umpit he doesn't actually lead him through it and he doesn't lead him to the final teaching of the gradual path the Buddha seems to discern that even though there's some softening and opening he can tell from the Buddha that I'm but this checking of the watch and looking around board that umpit his mind isn't fully prepared it's not ready there's some opening we can wish on but a well perhaps maybe he's on a path to greater openness but his mind is not fully ready although his mind isn't fully ready we can see at the end of the passage that he can perceive umpit can perceive that the Buddha Buddha is an enlightened being although it's only after he's been thoroughly thrashed in the debate and received a description of the knowledge and conduct he does look to do he does do what his teacher asked him to do first he looks to see for the he looks for the 32 marks too late turns out he could have could have checked them earlier we he would have known the Buddha as a great being a great man an enlightened person in this case but we wouldn't have had much of a story it's interesting it pointed out the other day by Diana as we talk just that here we see I'm about to walking mindfully alongside the Buddha the Buddha emerges from his dwelling walks mindfully and I'm about to joins him so here again there's a sign that although his mind isn't fully prepared for the teachings he's now open to the Buddha in a way that he wasn't previously and he's treating him with respect with is a big change again it's not enough he's not ready and yet there's some movement in the direction of freedom I'm going to now depart to report back to his teacher and we'll pick up that action on Friday I think though we can have a feeling that he's in for a scolding not having followed his feet at teachers instructions and having made some something of a fool of himself in the presence of a of an enlightened being Diana thank you thank you David so now I'd like to open it up for you guys to have a chance to talk amongst yourselves a little bit about what you've seen so far and we might say that one of the key developments in the or the point at this point in the story is that Ambeda was first you know so concerned about who respects who and what is the protocol and etiquette and clan and ancestral lineage and then if we have this shift to a concern about knowledge and conduct and even Ambeda asked well what is that knowledge in conduct even if he doesn't really hear the Buddha's answers at least he asked about it so we have this shift from Ambeda being about clan and pride and and then she well what is knowledge and conduct so maybe this is something we can all relate to that initially we might come to these teachings with some idea of what we want what's important and what is the most important and then as we practice maybe there's a shift as we've been exposed we might even say to the Buddhist teachings there's a shift to something else that seems more important or maybe what we thought was the most important starts to become less important so we'd like to put you into some breakout groups will be like three or four of you in a group and you'll be there for about 12 minutes and that is to talk about have you had a shift where what you've been concerned about or considered most important then through practice you realize maybe that isn't as important for example maybe like working with a particular personal suffering and then maybe you could see things a little bit bigger more people than just about yourself I just offer that as an example and it's helpful when you're in these small groups to not say everything you know about this topic or to tell your deepest darkest secrets there's 12 minutes and there's three or four of you so maybe just make one point and allow it to go to the next person they make one point goes to the next person they make one point goes to the next person they make one point so in this way everybody has an opportunity to speak and maybe an opportunity to learn and share from others often sometimes the extroverts will want to go first right this is natural of course so almost the definition of extroverts so in order to kind of make sure that the introverts getting there too why don't we go in alphabetical order within the groups okay so with that said yeah here we go you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you Oh, I'm happy. Steve predicted what's going to happen next. Great, great. Yeah, so welcome back. And this is a period where we can do a deep breathe for Q&A or share. And I also want to invite for those who wanted to put some comments in the chat box and see how you're feeling about this way of teaching or this way of reading and studying sutta and or any other comments that may be jumping out. So feel free to use the chat box. Okay, so, Steve. Well, I had a question, Diana, about the, I'll use the word theatrics, which were very convincing. And I wondered if they seemed extreme to me. And I wondered if that's if it would have taken that very intimate, mindful walk with the Buddha. It seemed to me that was a very significant thing. The two of them walking together mindfully seemed very intimate somehow to me. And would he have done that had he been truly as eye rolling as you portrayed him? That's why that's my question. Yeah, yeah. I think this is a legitimate question. But we can, for me, I'm struck by the Buddha gives us like incredible teaching. And all Ambatara cares about just whether he has the 32 marks that Ambatara doesn't acknowledge that the Buddha gave this. He just wants to see if he has the 32 marks. So we could say he's walking mindfully with the Buddha because he wants to see if he has the 32 marks that one of the marks is how he walks. So I don't know, and I was exaggerating this. But so but then I wanted to convey the point that it just bounced right off of Ambatara. He wasn't checking it in. Yeah, thank you. And Wang. I'm wondering if you can somebody that knows is more scholarly than me. What are these? Where does the these 32 marks come from? Is it part of and, you know, I know a lot of this wasn't written down for, you know, many, many, many years after the life of the Buddha. Is this part of the culture of the time? Or is it like a poetry or is it? What what are these marks signify like the thing about the ankles looking like something where did that come from? And what part of the culture does that come from? Maybe I'll say a few words. So the Buddhists point to the Brahmins and say it's only ever Brahmins who ask about it, who are concerned about it. And the Buddha obliges them sometimes by showing those two marks that aren't really seen. But a Buddhist or a wanderer never asks about them. But so that's kind of like the assumption that the Buddha, just like we've seen him earlier in this, is meeting on the to where he is and knows that he's concerned about these 32 marks. But this having been said, there's no we don't know in like the Upanishads at that time, there's no mention of these 32 marks. So it's not really clear where it comes from. And I will say that there is also a sutta in which each mark is associated with some skillful thing that the Buddha did in a former life. So the Buddhists did kind of take this on and say that there's a reason why Buddha has these 32 marks. But I think this is something that there isn't a clear answer for. I don't know, Ying, Kim, David, do you guys have some more to add? I would just I'm just sort of intrigued by your question, Wayne, part of your question that said, is it poetry? And I would I would just say, yeah, is it a question back to you or back to us? I do think we're because we're looking at this in a different way, you know, that it's that's that's a really interesting and legitimate question. Just how does it function in the oral presentation? You know, how does it how does it land in our in our ears? And again, if we if we kind of try to analyze it, as Diana said, we don't really we can only go so far with what we know. But I like the idea that it falls as a way of for me, it's had this sense of it's about recognizing a great teacher when you're in that presence. And you know, these this might not occur to us. But I think we do have ways that we refer to that. We may it may be poetic that one of the things I used earlier this week was the idea that this isn't poetic, it's something that younger people than I say, but it's it's he's the real deal. You know, and maybe maybe this is a way of sort of communicating that that that's what's being assessed here. So anyway, I really like that idea of yours that possibly there's poetry here if we if we attune our ears to it. Thanks for that. Thank you. Yeah, maybe I'll just say that what struck for me was that there may be a sense of the broader popular culture still really just cares about cares about the appearances in various ways. And maybe that's also a way of contrasting what the Buddha was teaching. Yeah, and that just came to my mind and I realized, you know, remembering the commentary of speaking about Pokhara Sati. So much is about his appearances, the color, the beauty of this Brahman senior Brahman. So well. I'm trying to get unmuted there. Yeah, this also shows up in that in your earlier narratives or at least, you know, about the Buddha's birth, you know, the person that comes up with a prophecy that he'll either be a world turning monarch, wheel turning monarch, or he'll be a great spiritual teacher. So that appears in that context as well. Yes, they don't specifically say the 32 marks with those two possibilities. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, thank you for pointing that out. And James Allen. Yeah, I think it's interesting that our team of teachers has had two strategies, one to explain to us the sutra, to us the way in which the Buddha has done his pedagogy. And I'm interested whether that was a deliberate decision. One another or to bring out. Yes, James, you're cutting out a little bit. I feel like we're missing some important words that you were saying. I think you were asking whether it's a deliberate decision in terms of how we were teaching. Is that right? Yes, I think that's the basic question. Yes, I would say yes. For us, we were definitely experimenting this as a way of teaching what the sutas were conveying. And yeah, maybe I'll just invite other co-teachers to say a few words. You have any? Yeah, I could add that. There is a question as to whether art should stand as its own and do you kill it by explaining it, something like that. But we felt like both approaches would be helpful with a teaching such as this that might be hard to understand some of the nuances of it, like the Brahmanical culture. So I think some of that is easier to explain outside in order to understand what's going on in the teaching. But yeah, I didn't write. David, you had a comment. I think Diana did as well. But I would just add too, I think I maybe heard a little bit more of the question I did cut out. But I would just say that we're kind of revealing our pedagogy, which is fine, no secrets. But we also leave a lot of room for improvisation, and we have, you can't see it, but in various ways we each are looking at a carefully script minute by minute, three minutes for this, eight minutes for that. And as I look at some of my colleagues' notes and they talk about it, they go off script. That is, they move away from their notes to kind of respond to what's come up already in the questions, for example, or the discussion or things we talked about or thought about overnight. So it's free in that way too. I just want to think it would be unfortunate if we gave the impression we have sort of a canned idea of what we're getting ourselves into when we start. We don't. Maybe I'll add one thing. When you guys went into a breakout group, we went into our own breakout group and we were laughing and smiling like, oh my gosh, I can't believe we pulled that off. We're also having fun. So kind of in this new way of exploring and sharing the suta in this way. Yes, in this way, we're both the students and we're teaching at the same time. So I saw there are lots of comments in the chat box. So thank you for sharing them. They are nourishing and just happy. So just a couple of notes before we sign off for today, maybe in preparation for Friday, we like to joke about assigning homework. We say homework with air quotes around it. But if you feel so moved, you might read this section that we've come through today. I believe, checking my notes here, that it's up to the end of section four or up to section four in the Sujato translation. But I'd be really interested to know, and maybe you're interested too, to see how it reads as text after we've gone through this more orally oriented reading of it. We commented in our breakout room just a few minutes ago, how much more we see what's available in the text. More is offered in a way, how the teachings come through in different ways than we do when we just read it. We've read this many times. It's different to hear it, to say it, to speak it. So you might try speaking a little out loud, read a character. Some of you here have read some of these characters. And I would just say to sort of watch for the teachings to come bubbling up now. The whole purpose of this exploration is to bring us closer to the teachings and use this novel way of presenting them or exploring them as a way into them. So just look for that, the wise speech of the Buddha or the gradual training or our attachment to self. All of these things may start to be alive in us a little bit more now as a result of this exploration together. So anyway, take care till Friday. We look forward to seeing everyone again on mute and say goodbye for now if you feel moved to do so. And take care. We'll see you soon. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Thanks again. Bye bye. Bye bye. See you on Friday.
