 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning, everybody. My name is Nancy Yamahiro. I was your check-in person today. I'm also a board member here at IMC. A warm welcome to all of you. Thank you for your practice. Thank you for being here. And a warm welcome to our guests today. For those of you that don't know, they're all from a group called GRIP, an acronym for Guiding Rage into Power, which is an intensive year-long trauma healing and accountability program, serving about 500 incarcerated people each year in California, state prisons, many folks serving licenses for serious or violent crimes. It is a model for restorative justice in the state and, I would argue, around the country. In the last 10 years, more than 1,200 students have graduated from GRIP. Of those, 528 have been released and come home to their communities. The restorative visit rate is less than 1%. In other words, a success rate of 99%. I'd like to introduce Kim Gross-More, who is a student of IMC and the Sati Center Chaplaincy Program. She subsequently trained as a GRIP facilitator and then became the executive director in 2019. With the support of IMC, she led the expansion of GRIP to the correctional training facility in Soledad, where she continues to facilitate today. A strong believer in the principle, the first revolution is internal. She considers meditation and the Dharma as the foundation of her work for justice in the community. I'll turn it over to Kim and let her introduce our other guests. Welcome. It's okay to take off my mask, is that right, to speak? Okay, thank you. Thank you, Nancy, for the introduction and good morning. I'm going to introduce my colleagues briefly and then say a few words. So I'm so happy to be here with a team of folks from GRIP. Actually, my boss, PJ Boray I, is on the board of directors of GRIP, and he's here with us today. He's been here before. Bernard Moss is a senior facilitator with GRIP on our staff, and Chuy Cortez is a facilitator as well, facilitated for several years inside Avanall State Prison and now lives in San Francisco. And they'll have a chance to share more of their stories in a minute. But I'm just so happy to be back here. I was driving up this morning, so my daughter just started high school and last night was the homecoming dance. And all the anticipation and flurry and nervous excitement of that as I was driving up her, I realized, oh, this feels like a homecoming for me to be here. It's been about four, three, at least three, maybe four years since GRIP was here at IMC, and we really do feel like this is a home for us. And so I first just really want to thank you all and express the gratitude that is in my heart and that we feel when we come here, because Gil and the IMC community, so many of you who have come up to visit GRIP at St. Quentin or down at Soledad or elsewhere or have just been supporters over the years, is really just wonderful. And I don't think GRIP would be where it is today without the support of this community. So much gratitude and thank you. And I feel that sort of nervous energy and excitement of homecoming as well. So just being here and when I actually first met GRIP, learned about GRIP when Jacques Verdin, the founder, brought some folks to sit up here, and I was sitting there. And that was my first introduction to GRIP, and it was a transformative experience for me. And I was in the Chaplaincy Training Program and got the chance to go up and visit the program in St. Quentin and then train as a facilitator and then help to bring GRIP into CTF Soledad where I still facilitate. So as Nancy said, she said everything that I was going to say about what we are and the stats. If you're interested in the data of impact, we have been quite successful in supporting folks inside the state prisons to turn their lives around and then become peacemakers in the community. And we're going to share some stories today. That's what we do best, is share stories. That's the real impact that we have. So I'm going to turn it over in a minute to my colleagues really to take it from here. And then we're hoping that we'll have a little bit of time after some story sharing to actually share an activity that we do inside the prisons that builds a sense of common humanity and empathy. It's called Struggles in a Hat, and so we might ask for a few volunteers to participate with us to do a little activity. So I think maybe I'll just â€“ one other thing I'll say before inviting my colleagues to speak is that our curriculum is grounded in a course book that Jacques Verdun, the founder, wrote, and it's called Leaving Prison Before You Get Out. And I think that's really kind of the common cause we have here with IMC, that there's an understanding that we're on a common journey. We're engaged in a common practice of freeing ourselves from whatever that prison is between our ears, right? And whether you're incarcerated or whether you're free, ostensibly, geographically, and able to come to a place like IMC, there's still the kind of practice that we all are doing to learn how to free ourselves from suffering and be able to be of service, be able to open our hearts and experience true compassion and love and connection in the world. So much of what I do as a facilitator in GRIP is really about that shared journey, my own practice, my own healing work that I do, and accountability work that I do in tribe, in community, inside the prison with others who are engaged in that same practice. So we consider it very much a shared and common journey. It is a program that's mindfulness-based. We bring tools and practices into the prisons, but really what I hope today will be about is an understanding and an experience of how much of the Dharma is coming out from the prisons as well. The wisdom and the experience and the living examples of transformation that we can learn from folks that have been incarcerated. So with that, I'm going to invite, I think I'm going to start from that end and invite Chewie to start and then make our way this way. Good morning. I want to share with you guys how GRIP has impacted me. But before that, I'll briefly share where I was before GRIP. Before GRIP, I was 15 years incarcerated at the time, and I was in the shoe, what is known as isolation in prison, not knowing why I was angry, not knowing why I was so prone to be reactive. And when I got introduced to GRIP, I did so by a commissioner of the Pearl Board. She says, you might want to look into some programs. She directed me on where to find these resources. And the first program I participated in in 2016, I learned about anger, but it was still leaving a lot of gray areas with educating myself about myself. And in 2017, I came across GRIP. And I remember getting interviewed by the founder, Jox, and he asked me, why do you want to be part of GRIP? And I said, well, I've done some work, but there are still gray areas and I don't understand why I'm so angry all the time, why I'm so reactive. I spent 10 years in isolation. You don't spend 10 years in isolation because you're a good person, right? And for me, what GRIP allowed me through the curriculum, it's not just curriculum, it's a guide in helping us educate ourselves about ourselves through the curriculum. And what I was able to learn, I was able to learn about the trauma and understand how the trauma was manifesting itself in my life, which was a dysfunctional expression. And the work through the exercises that I was able to do, I was able to learn of how powerful this trauma was. Just learning about the amygdala, the part of the brain that is always on alert. And it's like a security guard, you know, vigilant, paranoid. So when I started learning about that, I started seeing myself. And that's me. I'm very reactive. And when I started understanding where these triggers were coming from, what trauma was connected to, then it allowed me to actually acknowledge it, make peace with it, start to make peace with it, heal and have compassion for myself. Then it opened up the door for me to have compassion for my father, for my mother. And what it did is it replaced the anger, the resentment that I had for them with empathy and compassion, because I was able to have empathy and compassion for myself. So the work that I've been able to do and grip alongside other men has been very rewarding, has been something that has been life changing. And it's not only for me, I'm witnessing these men in there have those realization moments, those realization moments that it's like a light turning on. Right. And when that light turns on, there's accountability, there's complete ownership, and there's transformation. I'm an example of that. So I'm just so grateful and honored to be here. Thank you, guys. I know I have to share the mic here. Otherwise, I'd like to be speaking in the full time, but I can't. So with that, I thank you, guys. I need this. I think I'm off. I can talk in this. Okay. Hello, everybody. My name is Bernard Moss. So this is my third time here. So thank you for welcoming me back here. So my journey, I spent 28 years in prison, California State Prison, was convicted in 1988 of crime of attempted murder. In 2002, I arrived at San Quentin and I met Jock for then. And I participated in his first program called Catargeo, which was that San Quentin. And I just thought it was the most silly thing in the world to sit in a room and to meditate and to just talk about your feelings and your emotions. And I would not bite in. I wasn't a bite in for the group. But I stuck with it because he stuck with me. And some years later, 2011, we transformed over to GRIP. And I was chosen to be one of the first participants to participate in the GRIP program. And I sat in and I went through the program and I graduated. And after graduation, they came to me and they asked me to come back and facilitate. And I said, me? You know, like, really? And they're like, yeah. So I was like, yeah, sure, I'll try it. So I came back and I started facilitating GRIP. But the tools that I learned from the GRIP program are invaluable. We talk about one of our tools is called CETA, practicing our sensations, emotions, our thoughts and our actions, and being able to connect and recognize those things. And it was something I never was able to do before. I was sitting here this morning and when I was asked to guide the meditation, I immediately realized how nervous I was. Right. I'm like, I'm going to guide a meditation with people who meditate all the time. And I'm nervous. So once I started guiding the meditation and we got silent, I said, oh, I forgot so many things. Right. And I'm sitting here and I'm like, well, this is a silent meditation, but I really want to say some more things. But I'm not going to say anything. I'm just going to sit here and go with it. Right. But yeah, but thank you all for just bearing with me with that. I appreciate that. But yeah, yeah, this has taught me how to reconnect with me. Right. And to be my true authentic self, we sit in a room for 52 weeks. Right. Meet once a week for two hours for 52 weeks. And we really get to cover four areas of stopping our violence, developing emotional intelligence, cultivating mindfulness and really understanding how our violence affects our community, our victims and survivors of our violence. And it's so, so powerful. Right. And just meditating and just sitting. It's so it's so it's one of the main tools that help us connect with our inner self and our inner being. And it brings so much peace and harmony to people who are inside a violent environment. Right. So you have all of the people from different gangs and different cultures and, you know, different races who sit in this room. But it's a room full of peace and harmony. Right. And we sit there with each other for some of my class. I facilitate here on the outside now. And one of my classes is two hours long. And then I do a weekend class that's eight hours long. And this just peace and harmony throughout that day with each and every person that sits in that room. And it's powerful. And I can't stop doing this work because I sit in that room. And at the end of the course, I have men who have sat on death row for 20 years and are now on the main line of the prisons who tell me. After doing this work, I feel again, I honestly have feelings and emotions again and I can never hurt another human being. And that is so powerful. I can never see myself not doing this work and I can never see myself ever doing harm or hurting anyone ever again. So I just attribute that to grip, right? And being a part of this program, it's life changing. And I think people like Kim and Jack that come into the institutions and they provide programs like this and IMC for supporting people like myself and PJ and Chewie who made bad decisions in our life when we were young. And now we got an opportunity to participate in a program like this to help us go back to being our true authentic selves, the people we were truly intended to be before our lives in prison. And it's just something to be so grateful for. And now I get an opportunity to be a grandfather and a husband and a father and an uncle. And it's something that I never, never imagined. And I get to make all these new friends, people that we used to sit on the yard and we used to look at each other and want to kill each other. And now we get to be best friends. And today me and Chewie met each other for the first time personally. We've been on Zoom calls before, but today we first met each other personally for the first time. We drove over today from San Francisco and we were just talking and our stories are just so similar. But we wouldn't have realized that on a prison yard before Grip, right? Because we probably would have been pent against one another or we wouldn't have had that opportunity to just sit down and get to know each other on a personal one on one basis. And we're both humans, right? So programs like Grip help unite people into realizing their humanity before they're released from the belly of the beast, right? So I just want to thank all of you just who support efforts like this and programs like this. Yes. So thank you. And yeah, it's just powerful. I appreciate you all. So with that, I'm going to shut up also and I'm just going to pass the mic over to PJ. Thank you, Benar. I'm not sure what I'm going to talk about. I think about it. I guess I have a lot of like a lot of stuff. I just flies through my mind. He's doing a meditation and a lot of stuff comes up. I want to say thank you all for a lot of gratitude to be back here again. I was here four years ago. I think it was my first few months out from my IC detention center after serving 19 years in prison. I was detained by ICE and I was there fighting my case. They were trying to deport me to a country I never been to before where I have no relatives, where I have no ties. And it was a very scary time. And I think I found a lot of comfort and support when I got here and balance. So my life has changed a lot since then. And covid happened and just the world has changed and just really, you know, like, brought me to a different direction. So happy that at least at this point to be able to do this work again, actually live it right. I think I guess what I want to say is one thing I want to share is this thing that I always it's in a group curriculum that I've always been part of my life. And I was born into it by this call I'm more fatigue, which is love your faith. And as a Buddhist practice practitioner, I grew up into Buddhism. So my mom, our Buddhist, my dad, a Buddhist, a whole culture is Buddhist. I'm Cambodian. And so Buddhism is just not a practice that we do, but it's a way of our life. I've been born into a voice in the culture, within the language, in the mannerism, even in some of the food that we eat. And my mom always tells me, you know, like, she always shared a story about how she survived the genocide with the Khmer Rouge and the committing mass genocide. She shared about the hardships. She grew up what it was like for her as a farmer starter. And then, you know, crawling through landmines from hundreds of miles, getting to the border of Thailand so that so that I can live until my brother can live. And so she can live. I was born in Thailand, so I wasn't born yet at the time. But, yeah, and I think like coming to the United States, resettling, and feeling the hardship of living in the Polish community, a lot of violence, a lot of gangs, experiencing school shootings, you know, just bullying. That led me to joining gangs myself and then getting to incarceration as one of the youngest juvenile lifers in the correctional system. I was 14 at the time. And I've gone through all this hardship, and I've always had this thing in my heart. It's like my mom always say, like, you know, you can all like when I say more for tea, I love your face. She said, it always sticks to me. She said, like, you can always make things worse for yourself, you know, like you could make things better for yourself now. Make the best of what you got, no matter what it is, or you can make it worse. And then I think about her. I think about her like in a refugee camp, you know, walking from sunup to sundown, starving and then getting beaten at the same time and having to witness the people you love get tortured and killed in front of you. I'm like, how do I love that kind of faith? You know, it's a really hard thing to swallow until you actually live through it. And I remember, you know, sitting in prison, I was in the shoe at one point and I was really hot and I was like, I feel like I was dying because there's no air conditioning. It was like summertime, you know, I was for concrete wall and was so miserable. I couldn't sleep. You couldn't like, I was, I think it was the sleep deprived for some, for some point. And my cellmate, my best friend was in the top bunk and he was like, dude, just let's stay on the floor, you know, and we try to flood the cell, but they fixed the water so you can't really, you know, one of the thing we used to do when it gets so hot, you flood the cell and it cools the cell down. But then they, some people would flood the cell and made a mess. And so they would shut the water off so then you can't really get cool. Right. So, and I remember like that's in my head and I, when I went to ICE, I had the exact same experience. I was, you know, after 19 years of incarceration. So my journey with grip was that I, I was, I had an opportunity. I was a young, young man, you know, like trying to prove myself. I was really afraid, you know, in prison because I was one of the youngest person there. Right. I knew it. I knew I was young. I knew people, you know, look at me a certain way. I know I don't have like same kind of status. I want no one else have. So I would always try to assert myself more than the next person in front of me. And I was trying to make myself bigger, scarier, you know, like that was my mentality. And it's because I, ideally, I think that if people are afraid of me and people think that I'm not a easy person to victimize, they can leave me alone. And they're going to show me some respect. And so I lived that lifestyle for many years in prison. And one of the elders actually told me, man, you need, like, that's not you. Like, we can see it. It's not you. You know, I think, I think it shows in my upbringing from, I guess, part of my being with my mom has really made me a better, a good person. And I never see that. And I never thought myself to be a good person until I went to a program called the Red World Program. And actually, I was the chapel. I was spoken at chapel at the time. And one of the Native American practitioner invited me to a ceremony. And so he said, like, man, we taught a talking. He said, man, Cambodian, you guys, you know, like indigenous way is similar to ours. You know, like, I really wanted you to come to a ceremony. And it changed my life forever because I sat in the ceremony and it was dark. I was in the Nipi. It's called the Lodge. And you can't really see nothing. Right. And it's between you and the creator, between you and Mother Earth, between you and yourself. You know, like, no one there to judge, no one there to see you. And I was singing this really cultural, spiritual song. And it just like really echoes through your whole body. You can feel yourself and the hot rocks and the steam. And it's almost like a sauna, but the steam, which is really like it represents the breath of grandfather, which is supposed to cleanse you. Right. And so I was I was cleansed. I felt the hardship of the heat was over one hundred, one hundred forty easy and coming out of the lodge after like maybe a couple of hours of being in there. And I felt it's supposed to felt tired. I'm supposed to felt drained and exhausted. But I came out of there like a new person. I thought I was reborn and everything, everything that that I've in my life that didn't make no sense off, start like crashing on me. And all the teaching my mom had taught me all the stories you told me about her experience, about where our people come from and a stroke all came back to me, which I have forgotten all those years because I was so deep in my own pain. I never really look at no one else. And so when I was coming for this renewal, this moment in my life, I just I was really open now. I was really open to anything like because then I was so close, had a big old wall in front of me. I was hurt so many times. I was abandoned so many times that I didn't accept anything like any like opportunity. And so I didn't really love my experience. I never made it better. I made it worse the whole time. And so when I was invited to do this program from through through the the Spet Lodge, they were like, hey, we have a Red Roll program. We want to attend with us, you know, and which is do some healing. And so I joined the program and it was strange because I was youngest. I sat there in a circle with eight men, been in prison for more than three decades, have done everything in their life, the management of the ball. And they were so vulnerable. They were sharing so deeply about the experience and everything that they have said, I have lived through. And I feel like I can relate in so many ways. It's almost like a cycle. You know, this is a cycle of how can you be so much older than me and still live the same cycle I have gone through. And I think what I connect at the time is not the experience, but our emotions, our feelings. You know, like I felt what you felt, you know, and I think I can relate to you. And I remember my facilitator and it's the moment that just totally changed my life forever and made who I am today. My facilitator shared how he lost his daughter to crime. He lost both of his daughter. And he was crying, he was shaking. He was reliving the moment. And I connected with his pain. And I think I connected with his pain because I was so open. And I connected with his pain and I thought I connected with other people in my life's pain and I connected to the person of harm and Mrs. Escob and her family. And I was ashamed. You know, first time I felt like I did the same pain to someone else's that I did to my facilitator, my friend Martin at the time who was sharing this. And it rocked me to the core and I just was so guilty. I was so ashamed. And I was at that moment, I think I pledged my life to like never allow anyone in my life to ever experience that again. And so I dedicated my life at that moment to the change and I walked away from the prison yard pretty much. I walked away from the prison yard, almost started a full-scale riot because people were like, you're not a person politic. You can't go by yourself. You can't do what you want to do. But I had a lot of elders who thought that if I was sincere and they cared for me enough to give me a chance and they told me like, we'll give you a chance. Anyone who will try to harm you in this yard, we will respond accordingly. And I was allowed to practice, continue practicing the Native American spiritual so-called ways. And then their ways were so related to mine that it allows me to find my core again, who I am as a person. And I started to see myself. I remember I'm a good person. Like what happened? And that journey led me to restorative justice. I went back to school. I became a counselor and I started doing a lot of work in the prison. And then my counselor was like, man, you should go to San Quentin because there's so much opportunity. Like you could grow more. And at the time they were doing like a prison realignment. They were changing the facility. We changed the process of how things are working. And I end up going to San Quentin and that's when I met Jock for my first month. And actually I was in the program because I just got off the bus running and I was like, I wanted to learn. I had this insatiable desire to learn, to grow because I found myself for the first time. I knew who I am. I knew where I wanted to do. I knew where I wanted to go and I just wanted to do it. And I want to get involved in everything so I can learn. And I feel like if I have more knowledge, I have more tools, I can provide more services and I can do more. Because I didn't know. And I think one of the facilities, Kevin Penn at the time, he was the violent prevention facilitator who was working with Jock before, this was before we were calling it grip. And Kevin was like, dude, like you have a great spirit. I can feel it when I'm around you. He's like, you should come to class with me to sit with me in the class and say, why would I want to do that? He said, well, because we're teaching people how to be peacemaker and we're teaching people, it's related to domestic violence, but we also want to teach people how not to do violence and how to prevent violence. So he said, I think you would be good for it to be one of the facilitators. So I invite you to come just sit with me and find out. And so I came to class and I see Jock with his hat. I thought I kind of laughed inside of my mind because he reminded me of the guy, Krakataw Gandhi. And I was like, what does this guy have to offer? Right. This white guy come over and he's going to offer me some knowledge about being a peacemaker. And it was so strange because I talked to him. He talked to me. It was like the first time, like, this dude is so calming. I was like nervous, but I was like excited and I was like just curious, but he just like talking to me and he just calmed my nerve right away. So welcoming. And then I sat in the circle and I was really quiet and I just watched Jock the whole time and the way he taught the classes. And I at that moment I realized this is what I want to do. That's the person I need to follow that need to take note from. And so Jock started talking about the curriculum. He started teaching about grip and about the ways and a lot of the stuff that when I think about grip, I think about a way of life. A lot of stuff that came back to me about the more fatigue. I remember just sitting there and just meditating and just thinking about, man, I can't believe my life has gone from a kid who was bullied, who was put on, who was pushed around, who was shot at on multiple occasions, forced for being Asian and then being different. And to a prison yard and now I'm in a class and I'm teaching and it's just so surreal. I'm like, this can't be right. And then I started to really think about that more in depth and I start to meditate on it and I just realized it was my energy. I willed it to happen. Like my mom said, like, love your faith, make the best of what you got and put that out in the world because you can always make it worse or you can make it better. And I think your energy, my energy was creating this environment for me and I was able to do the work and I was able to touch people's heart and I was able to make so many friends. And actually, minus the harm I've created, if someone asked me, would you go back to prison and live your life all over again, I would say yes. The reason why is because I've met so many beautiful people through that journey. I would not have been here with Benar or with Kim. I would not have met Tui. I would not have met Jacques and I would not have met a lot of people that I love today that I call my friends and my brothers who have gone through. And I think my life was forged through fire and hardship. And I think it was forged before me. My mom, my people, so I became very proud of who I am, who I've become. And I'm proud that I can sit, would you all be vulnerable, share deeply, and just appreciate the moment, you know. I can never do that before in my life. So I think when I look back at my life and I think about my journey, I mean, I'm still stuck in immigration, I'm still dealing with the court process. But despite all that, I think there's beauty, you know, I think there's beauty in growth and beauty in going through, like they said, that the lotus flower growth was very beautiful, but it grew from a very dark, muddy place. So I think GRIP, all work is beautiful. I think, I mean, we build leaders and teachers so far. Everyone I know who graduates from GRIP who's out now is doing a great thing in the world. And I think they're doing great things because not just the tools that they got from GRIP, but because the growth and the transformation. I think they have changed, transformed their own journey, their own life. So I just love your faith. I think that's kind of my teaching today. I'm all for tea. Thank you. Maybe we can just take a minute. One of the things we do in GRIP is we put one hand on the heart and one hand on the belly. And it's a way that we hold the emotion in the room together because we know when one person is doing the work, we all are doing the work. So thank you, PJ, for sharing your journey that we all are holding with you. And thank you, Bernard and Julie, also for sharing your stories. Do we have time to do how much more time do we have 10, seven minutes, Bernard, can we do a very quick version? OK. All right. So I'm going to pass. So can I ask for maybe. And they don't know each other. They don't. They don't. They don't trust each other. They don't know each other. But we have to find a common bond. So do an exercise called struggle in a hat. So we ask people to write down something that they're struggling with currently and they write it on a piece of paper. So if you can write down something in your life that you're struggling with and it can be anything and just think for a second and write it on a piece of paper and then just ball up that piece of paper. My head under the chair. All right. OK. Thank you. And don't put your name on it. Don't put your name on anything. So what we're going to do, we're going to drop them in the hat and we're going to go back around and you're going to pull it out and you're going to read it. And we're going to ask you if you ever struggled with that, how you dealt with that. If you've never dealt with that situation, how would you personally deal with it by not giving advice but just talking about how you as an individual would deal with that situation. And just use an I statement. If I had if I was encountered with this situation, I would. And that's as simple as this exercise is. So you're going to put your you're going to put your struggle in the hat and then you're going to pick out somebody else's struggle and speak as if it's yours. Right. So just ball it up. You can ball it up or fold it. Yeah. There you go. And just drop it in. Thank you. And then we'll come back around and you'll pull somebody else's out. If you pull your own out, drop it back in. And we'll do it real quick. And this is a way that we kind of build a bond in our circles to let people know that we're all right. Right. We're not as much. We're not so much different than we think we are. We've been sitting on this prison yard looking at each other, pinning each other against one another, wanting to harm each other, kill each other, stab each other. But you're just like me. You go through the same things I go through. Oh, I can trust you. Right. Our our cultures are somewhat the same. We you know, we come from the same place. Right. We're all human. And this is a real way of building a bond within our tribes. And this is what we call our circles. We call our circles tribes. And this is one of the first steps to building that tribe and building that bond within that tribe. All right. And you can whoever like to go first and just say your name and read the struggle that you pulled out of the hat. Thank you. Yes. And that's how much I appreciate you all. I'm missing the raider game right now. So whoever would like to go first, you can read the struggle. Who would like to go first? Okay. There you go. You should say your name and read it out. My name's Alan and the card says worrying about my health conditions. Yeah, I'm getting I'm getting older. So there seems to be a lot of a lot of little things that come up. And I can imagine that they're a lot worse than they might be. And it's not only is it worrisome that they will affect my the way I live and be painful and but also financially. Yeah, I often I really get afraid that, you know, something if something's really bad enough, it could ruin me, you know, because, you know, it's very, very difficult to pay for medical care. So I actually avoid going to the doctors and I try to manage most of what I can on my own and and not worry about it too much. But it's not always easy. And I also struggle with that. Thank you. Thank you. Someone like to read the next one. Mine says saying goodbye to someone I love. So I when I saw it, I wasn't really sure what it meant. Does it mean that someone broke up with you and you're ending your relationship with them or someone you love is dying or moving away? And I guess my response would be different for whatever the situation is. But if someone I loved was dying, I would just want to let them know how much they meant to me and make sure that I told them how much I love them and what they've added to my life. Because I think it's really important to be real with people. If it was someone that was dumping me, I guess I would just it would be done internally. I might tell them the truth depending on how safe it felt. But otherwise, I would just appreciate them in my head and maybe even I'm taking this course called A Year to Live. And one of the things you do is people that you have unfinished business with you meet them in your head. They may not be alive or they may be you may not be able to talk to them and you tell them what they meant to you. So to me, that was like a really amazing process because you were able to do the healing around it without actually having to talk to the person if they're not available for you. So I guess that's what I would do. All right. Thank you. Beautiful. I want to read the next one right right behind you. I just retired. I'm struggling. How to live the rest of my life in a way that is true to to my beliefs to make peace. If I if this was something that I am facing, I would drop the question to my mind and wait for it to come to me. And so I would say to myself, how can I live a life that reflects truth and integrity about my beliefs? How can I make peace? Thank you. And then the last one. So this is a yearning for mothers to have a voice to make herself known to people who care about her. There's one word I couldn't read, but I think that's the gist of it. I think for me, the key to helping people have a voice is to is to listen, which I've learned over the years is not as easy as it seems to become a good listener. But I think that if you can listen deeply to somebody and respond in a way that makes them feel heard, that will give them voice and strength. So that's that's my thought. Thank you. And I appreciate that. Yeah, this being heard and appreciated is so powerful. So thank you all. Just for participating. I know we're running short on time and I want to let everyone get to where they need to go. So just thank you for participating in that. And that's just one of the ways that we build a community and our tribes and just to help people that we all go through some of the same struggles in life. And hopefully some of you all can relate to those struggles and see how it relates to our lives. Thank you. I just wanted to thank you all for being here today and for sharing and being so open with us. Really appreciate it. Abraham runs a group here that supports grip. And so I wanted to give him a chance to just see me after all of this, if you want to do some volunteer work around the group program. Thank you. We'll also be having a tea out in the parking lot. Set up some chairs if you'd like to sit around. I don't know what your time frame is if you're available, but we can get hot tea and take it outside and there's chairs out here in the hall that we can take out and put in the parking lot. So.
