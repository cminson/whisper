It's not raining currently. It has been raining a lot.
If you have an umbrella and it's raining, then you can stay dry.
There are ways in which we can go through the life, and this practice protects us in a certain way.
And to appreciate the protection that the practice gives us can be quite useful.
Some of you know that this week I've been emphasizing in the early morning teaching that being mindful, being aware,
having attention to what's happening in the moment can be variable.
There are many different ways of being aware, many different ways of being attentive to things.
So to give some examples, you can be aware mostly through your eyes.
You can be aware more from sound.
You can be aware more tactically, but touch.
And depending on the situation you're in, you'll go to choose one or the other one.
If you're walking in the dark, you might want to just touch with your hand, the wall, and know where you are.
If you're trying to listen to some bird sound or something, then you listen.
That's the vehicle for attention. That's the medium for it.
In some situations, the attention will involve some kind of cognitive function.
What is that? And maybe there's even some kind of processing.
Maybe it's a silent processing. You're not thinking about it exactly.
But what is that? And there's some clarity.
The heater is on. You hear the hum of the heater's fan.
And so it might not be obvious. You just hear hum.
And then there's like, what is that?
Oh, it's the IMC heater that's on.
And that kind of recognition of what it is is helpful.
We just had a little go ahead, this car horn going off. Kind of an alarm horn, I guess.
And if you're sitting here peacefully and just like, don't ask yourself, what is that sound?
You might not then put one or two together to realize that's my car.
That has a role, that kind of cognition.
But if you didn't come here with a car and you're sure it's not your car,
maybe what's interesting is to feel somatically what that car horn was sounding like.
Maybe a little vibration or something.
And I'm sitting here right now at IMC when some of those cars go by that had this big boomboxes in it.
I kind of, now I look kind of like what happens.
There were times where I was a little bit annoyed. How could they do that to us?
But now the boomboxes have this deep bass.
I kind of love it. Okay, here comes.
And so then the attention is somatically kind of feeling my body.
So there's more, I could say, about the how we're aware.
But I wanted to give you enough sense of the different things.
And then knowing all these different options, we can choose at different times.
And we do choose without being consciously doing it.
But we can engage our capacity to be aware, not just to be aware always the same way.
But we can also engage and kind of feel our way.
What's the right way to be in the present moment with this experience?
Do I use my eyes, my ears? Do I just sense it, feel the experience?
Do I kind of watch it cognitively and kind of a little bit study it,
kind of a little bit more up in the head and observe it?
That might be appropriate, especially if maybe, you know, you have to do something
after you've studied the situation.
And like, you know, you're a pedestrian who's going to cross a very busy street.
So the kind of attention you want there is you want to kind of like really study
and take in like, oh, how many cars are coming, how fast they are,
where the gaps in the cars are.
Because if you're going to weave in and out like you do in some third world countries,
I've been to them, but there's no, you know, it's a great art to go across when they call.
People don't stop for you, so they expect you to kind of be part of the dance.
So the engagement in this process, staying fluid, staying involved,
kind of like, oh, how do I pay attention here, now I pay attention to this, now I'm here.
Keep that alive a little bit, the sense of, I'm practicing here, I'm moving.
And rather than feeling like it's work, it's closer to a play,
or it's like playing ping-pong or something, you know.
It's more like you're engaged in it.
And the more you're engaged in this process of finding your attention, using your attention,
being attentive, it becomes your umbrella in the rain, it becomes your raincoat.
Because as you're engaged this way, there's less kind of room for your thoughts,
your feelings, your desires, your aversions, the things that are happening around you
to penetrate deeply to get stuck.
Or it's more difficult for, maybe it's a raincoat for the inner rain that's going to come out of you.
It's protecting you from your own things happening,
that you get stopped by the attachments, the fears, the desires,
get stopped by the judgments you have about it, because something keeps going.
So it's kind of like you're walking in a city, and you really love walking,
and you're really engaged in walking.
And there's no danger of stopping to do window shopping,
and then worse, going into the store and buying something you don't need.
Because you're just walking, the walking is protecting you from, you know,
doing a lot of shopping, because you're committed to walking, walking,
and you see things and all kinds of things come, but you just keep walking.
So there's a wonderful way that the engagement in the practice,
the relaxed but ongoing engagement,
is a kind of protection from a lot of things in life that normally we get stuck on,
or get impacted by a very big way.
And this is one of the reasons I want to teach this right now,
is that we want to be able to find a way to be present for our life
where we're not unduly impacted by it, where somehow it comes in and it gets stuck in us,
or it comes in in a way that touches maybe some place inside where someone else is suffering,
it feels like now it's our stuff, my suffering.
Is that the best way to be with someone who's suffering,
to suffer worse than them because of their suffering?
I really feel you're suffering and, you know, I'm too miserable to help you.
How do we find a way to live life openly, fully, engaged in an honest way
where we don't get kind of tripped up or stuck by what comes along?
And one of the ways sometimes is to have this wonderful Dharma raincoat,
which is simply not just being aware, but staying engaged in the process of being aware.
Don't just be passively aware, and some people are too passive in their awareness.
They're present, but they're not aware because they're present
that maybe the way they're being impacted by what's happening around them
is not the best influence on them, it's not the wisest way of being impacted.
We have different choices to make about how we're present so it's effective and meaningful and useful.
And playing with that and working with it and finding a way with it and staying on track
is like walking down the street and not getting sidetracked by the shop buying things you don't need or something.
It's just like an umbrella that keeps you dry or keeps you going nice.
So one of the ways of practicing is to begin appreciating all the different modes of awareness of attention
that you have available to yourself and just be engaged and kind of make it second nature almost,
that you're navigating and following your way in a certain kind of way, always fluid,
always moving, always engaging with what's happening.
Sometimes the rhetoric of meditation is just be calm, be relaxed, be subtle, just be open, be present.
But if that's too still, and sometimes we talk about being still,
but there's a certain way that that could be overdone.
And I'll end with this example that I've used now a number of times recently,
is that the most relaxed ways the eyes can see is if the eyes can float in the eye sockets
and they move gently around and you don't fixate on something.
But if you're looking at something, your eyes are kind of scanning it,
kind of moving here to this side of it, to that side of it, to the middle, to tracing the edges,
and relax fluid eyes, the eyes can be relaxed.
But if the eyes are fixated, I said, then they're not relaxed and they get just a strain.
So there's something about awareness, keeping the constant engagement and questioning,
like, how do I do here and what do I do now, can be in that kind of very nice, soft, relaxed way
like the eyes that are floating in the eye sockets.
It doesn't have to feel like work, but it is a protection.
So, thank you.
And, uh...
