Dharmette: Rhythm In Practice  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

Good morning. I think a useful approach to meditation 
practice – or even to a spiritual life or a human life – is 
to notice how things happen in rhythm , and to tune into 
the rhythm of things. There are rhythms to how things 
occur : how they pass away, occur again , and pass 
away. There are a variety of different types of natural 
rhythms that are a part of life. It’s part of the Buddhist 
teaching that all things are impermanent. But this  
doesn’t say too much about what happens when they’re 
impermanent , or what way they’re impermanent. Some 
things that are inconstant are impermanent because 
they’re in flux – they come and go , and they come and  
go. They don’t just disappear forever, but they come 
back, go away , and come back. There is a rhythm to it.  
 
Some people think in absolute terms : this way or no 
way. It’s an absolute way: yes or no . Something that’s 
present is really present; something t hat’s absent is 
completely gone. But instead , you can  have a sense 
that there is a rhythm to things, and learn to be 
gracious, to flow with the rhythm , to allow for it, to be 
patient with the rhythm, and not to be absolute about 
things.   
There are all kinds of rhythms  of life , which we are a 
part of. The big rhythm of the day is sleeping and being 
awake. There’s a rhythm to getting sleepy, going to 
sleep, w aking up , and being awake. At times I’ve 
struggled with that rhythm , thinking that I was supposed 
to be in some different place in the rhythm. I’ve thought 
that there’s only supposed to be one  way – completely 
alert, awake , and I’m never supposed to be  tired. That’s 
silly. But now I realize that I’m in that part of the rhythm , 
or the oscillation , where I’m going towards sleep. I’m 
tired now. Then I’ll change and come to another part.  
 
There’s the rhythm of eating. We eat, we’re satiated to 
some degree, and then after a while we get hungry. We 
go in and out of that rhythm. There’s the rhythm for at 
least some people of work and rest, or engagement and 
activity , and resting. It’s useful to have that rhythm. If 
you only rest , then you tend to get lethargic. If you only 
work, you get exhausted. It’s important to have this 
rhythm.  
 
So where are we in the rhythm? What part is needed in 
the rhythm? It’s important to tune into  it. Sometimes I 
can feel it. I’m doing activities , and I can feel my interest 
and energy be ginning to wane. I realize that the energy 
is there, and now  the rhythm is changing. There was 
energy for doing it for a while, and now that it has 
changed . I need to change gears. The job’s not done, but it’s time to tak e a break and do something else – 
participate in the rhythm  – and wait until the rhythm 
swings back again.  
 
There are rhythms in conversations with people. There 
can sometimes be very intense, fast conversations, and 
then at some point you  feel that the energy, emotions  or 
topics have chang ed, and so the conversation becomes 
quiet, maybe with lots of pauses. You and your friend 
may ac tually not talk for a while. If  you’re uncomfortable 
with periods of silence, then you may fill it up too 
quickly , and do something artificial. But then you realize 
that there is a rhythm. I’ve been with my friend for the 
last couple of hours , and now we  have a need to be 
quieter . We’re still connected together, and that  rhythm 
will probably change at some other time . It’s part of the 
rhythm of how things are.  
 
There  are all kinds of rhythms in meditation practice . 
There’s the rhythm of sitting and not sitting. But within 
the meditation , there is the rhythm of the breath – the 
breath comes, the breath goes. We tune into tha t 
rhythm. It’s a changing rhythm or oscillation in what 
goes on.  
 
There’s also a rhythm to getting  distracted. “ Oh no, I’m 
distracted and lost in  my thoughts. This is terrible; this 
shouldn’t be. I need to come back , and reall y stay 
where it’s important , and b e back with the breath.” That kind of thinking sets up too much tension and 
oppositional feeling about what’s going on. But if you 
relate to it as a natural rhythm, then it gets easier to 
work with. What you’re doing in mindfulness is you’re 
working w ith the rhythm , and harmonizing or aligning 
yourself with it in a way that’s  helpful in the long term. If 
you consider that the mind produces thoughts , and that 
there’s a rhythm to getting p ulled away or lost in 
thoughts , and then noticing it, then your co ntribution to 
the rhythm is to come back. After a while you’ll go away 
again. This is the rhythm – you go away and then you 
come back.  
 
When you go to the beach and play in the waves, you 
don’t fight the waves. You get into harmony with the 
waves . Especially  with big waves, you better find a way 
to surf them, dive under them , or do something with 
them. But you don’t fight the waves. So it may be the 
same thing with the mind. You don’t have to fight the 
waves and rhythms of the mind. If you appreciat e it as a 
rhythm , and your contribution to the rhythm is to come 
back, then it’s gentler – you’re coming back. Every time 
you come back, you’re doing your part of the rhythm. 
Slowly it’s like a massage , and slowly you begin to 
settle down. The length of ti me that you have with the 
breath becomes longer, and the length of time that you 
wander off becomes shorter. But you can’t expect that 
it’s going to work just like that. Of course it’s going to go 
off. You’re going to go off and come back, go off and come back. As you keep working and massaging that 
rhythm, you’ll find yourself staying more and more in the 
present. The idea of it being a rhythm makes it more 
nonviolent and non -conflict ual. It’s just a rhythm that I’m 
a part of. I’m just supposed to work with the rhythm so 
that I slowly work in the direction of being present.  
 
There’s a rhythm of strong emotions that arise. 
Sometimes there can be all kinds of emotions that come 
up. Emotions have rhythms of their own. It’s really 
remarkable how quickly emotion s shift and change if 
you’re paying attention and not locked in to some story 
or idea. People sometimes come to me with intense 
emotions and feelings they have to deal with. Recently I 
talked to a man whose  wife had died. Sometimes when 
someone is having s trong emotions, it occurs to me that 
I don’t have a clue about what to do or to say to this 
person. Then my refuge is that I’ll just stay present. I’ll 
just stay here with the person , and let them talk , and 
see what happens. If you have presence and attent ion, 
it’s remarkable how quickly things shift for the person. 
People don’t get stuck if you’re present for them , or if 
they’re present for themselves. So I don’t have to know. 
I just have to stay present , and things with shift and 
change, because there’s  always a rhythm and a 
change.  
 
There  is a rhythm to grieving , and then not grieving. 
Grief comes back again as a wave , and the re’s a  rhythm to that. If you have a sense that there is a 
rhythm to these things – that things are always 
changing and flowing – then there doesn’t have to be an 
opposition to them. Rather , appreciate them for their 
rhythm. If you fall into what I call the delusion of 
permanence, you think , “Oh, this is it ; I’m grieving and 
I’ll grieve forever. I’m stuck.” That’s not very useful . 
Instead , recognize that there’s a flux, a flow, an 
oscillation, a rhythm here. Now it’s this way in this part 
of the rhythm , and the rhythm will  change at some time. 
Something will happen and shift back and forth.  
 
While there is the rhythm of being distracted and 
coming back, there is also the rhythm of being really 
fully present for things , and then not being so fully 
present. So we’re here, and then we’re not quite here 
anymore. So you can  appreciate that it’s a rhythm – 
“Oh, that’s what it is , and so my contribution is to come 
back and be fully present. Let me offer  that – come 
back. ” Then  at some point you lose it, and you come 
back.  
 
Concentration has a rhythm – I’m concentrated, and 
then I’m not. There’s a time to get concentrated, and be 
concentrated , and at some point concentration has a 
lifetime, or a half-life. At some point , you re ach the half -
life of your particular concentration for that time. I know 
I’ve been on retreat or meditating and had some idea of 
what it’s suppose d to look like to be perfectly concentrated. I get somewhat concentrated , and then at 
some point the conc entra tion slips and fades away . “Oh 
shoot, I blew it. Terrible Gil . Now I’m not meditating 
properly. I have to huff and puff and get back there.” It 
turns out it’s just the natural lifetime. With all the causes 
and conditions that were present for that time, th e 
concentration had a particular strength , and it lasted a 
certain length of time. Then the power or energy behind 
it was gone , and so it faded away. Now that I’ve learned 
there is a natural rhythm to getting concentrated and un-
concentrated, I’m more gracious , and just go with that. 
When I notice that I’m no longer concentrated, it’s 
because I’m on the other side of the wave. I keep doing 
mindfulness practice the best I can. I’m not going to 
beat myself up, because I’m on the other side of the 
wave. I just caught the wave for a while, and if I’m lucky, 
I’ll catch the next wave.  
 
Getting concentrated also has a rhythm. You focus on 
something, you start to get settled, stable and 
concentrated on something, and then you fall off. You 
realize that that’s a rhythm. What I’m supposed to do is 
work the rhythm , as opposed to being locked in . Let me 
come back. Let me stay there and hang in the best I 
can. And then when I slip off the concentration, I know 
that it’s just a rhythm and I come back. It’s gentler , and 
you’re not  dealing with a conflict.  
 So there are all these rhythms. You might see as you 
practice , if you approach what’s happening as if it’s an 
element or a phase in a rhythm of things, whether that 
doesn’ t make it easier to b e with it – and you’re  less 
conflict ual, less forceful, less reluctant , less resistant, 
and more willing to just go  with it . Difficult emotions or 
things can arise , and when you appreciate that it’s a 
rhythm , then maybe it’s okay to ride the wave. See if the 
idea of rhythm can open up and make things more fluid 
and easier for you to have some confidence , to stay 
present , and to contribute to the rhythm in a way t hat is 
helpful and supportive. K eep showing up.   
 
Getting into the rhythm of practice is a good thing. So 
thank you all, very much.
