 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So hello everyone and delighted to be here as usual. Thank you for the opportunity. So, I'm using the opportunity these days to emphasize the knowing quality of attention, that our capacity for attention or awareness has many different faculties, many different ways in which it operates and they can all come together and work in harmony. And so there's the more cognitive knowing where we recognize something for what it is. There's also feeling it fully and kind of being with it experientially in the body where the knowing might not be as central, but just the embodied feeling is what's central. And there's observing, there is kind of a clarity of awareness where things just arise. So a variety of things. And so we're emphasizing knowing because it's useful to get a sense of the richness and the possibilities, potential of this knowing faculty we have. And for today I want to say that it's possible to know something with some intentionality, with some choice to really just know this, let's be clear about it. And to know it, and as we know it, it might be in a word, it might feel just the in breath is in, and we know it as an in breath. But it might be a word in the mind, it might be a little bit of an image where people think more images perhaps, a nice image to have is the image of itself, the chest moving perhaps or the belly moving. And so what I want to emphasize today, because it's a little bit intentional, no matter how else you might be feeling, engage in the knowing in a calm way, calmly know. And even if you're agitated, take a little time to calmly recognize agitation is here. And sometimes the mind maybe is racing or is fast or is energized, or maybe it's really dull and sinking, all kinds of ways in which the mind can be. And it's very common for us to let the mind's mood or state influence than how we use our attention. And this is an exercise to kind of take hold of your knowing faculty and use it with a certain kind of clarity and intentionality. Consciously use it, and as you use it, do it calmly. So in a certain kind of little gentle lovingly determined knowing the in-breath, knowing the out-breath, knowing a sound that's coming in, knowing a warm tingling in my belly, knowing an itch, knowing the itch some more, back to the in-breath, out-breath. So let the knowing be calm. And so it's a little bit like the story I like to tell of my son in preschool, that this wonderful teacher, and he would, the kids were playing, as preschool kids do, in the playroom kind of noisily and happily and running around. And when it was time to do something different, tell a story so they could take their nap or something, he would stand in the middle of the classroom and start talking softly. And as he talked softly and calmly, over a few minutes the kids would begin gathering around him. And like the pied piper, kids would all gather around him and sit down and look up with great delight and expectation as he could prepare to tell a story. So maybe that kind of calm knowing that he's not trying to fix anything or do anything, but it becomes a little bit of a reference point for your psychophysical system to maybe finally relax as well or calm down. So beginning with a meditation posture that for you represents or allows for a combination of being alert and relaxed. So alert, alert and calm. And then to take a few long, slow, deep breaths, beginning the movement of being calm by how you calmly breathe, maybe three quarters full breath, nothing that is a strain. And a calm, long exhale, long as it doesn't strain you, relaxing as you exhale. Breathing in, breathing out. And then to let your breathing return to normal. And perhaps there's a little margin of adjusting that's natural enough, easy enough to breathe a little bit calmer. Maybe by relaxing the belly. Maybe some there's a softening in the chest that's possible. Maybe you're not breathing in deeply, but there's a gentle intentionality to breathing in that allows you to breathe in calmly. Breathe out calmly. And as you exhale calmly without much ambition, soften in the face. And as you exhale calmly soften the shoulders. As you exhale, softening the belly. And then settling yourself more fully on the body's experience of breathing. Experiment with knowing, inhale calmly. Experiment with a clear knowing when you're exhaling, you know you're exhaling. Whatever grabs your attention, gets your attention that's different than the breathing. Explore the possibility of calmly knowing it, a calm recognition. This is what's happening, a sound, an itch, a thought, a feeling. In a sense things are always changing. Stay in the flow of change with calm recognition. When you're calm you're not going to know it all, recognize it all. But just be content with what you can calmly know moment by moment. And whatever seems appropriate, center yourself in knowing the breathing, calmly knowing the experience of breathing. And just be content with what you can calmly know moment by moment. And remember, you're not going to know it all. So stay in the flow of change with calm recognition. And remember, you're not going to know it all. So stay in the flow of change with calm recognition. So stay in the flow of change with calm recognition. Right now. What would you need to know so that you're more in the present moment? What experience would you need to recognize to arrive here with what is happening? Calmly know it. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. Without our capacity to know. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. Taking a few moments to. Continue knowing calmly. Whatever is happening in the present moment. Recognize it calmly. And recognize it in what's how it's obvious. Without searching for the right word or. Sometimes it's not clear what's happening. It's enough to recognize it as something. The last minute or so here. See if you can get a feeling for what it's like to calmly know. Kind of like you're imprinting. So. And then. Bring to mind. People in your life. Strangers you know. Neighbors colleagues friends. Mail carriers store clerks. And what is it like to think of one of them. And with this calm knowing. Just calmly know like imagining them in front of you. And perhaps the calm recognition. Can be the channel through which. Your goodwill. Can travel. Calmly. Having goodwill. Well wishing. And perhaps your goodwill can have some of the same qualities of calmness. Tranquil. Well wishing. And when that well wishing spreads out widely in all directions. We might say to ourselves. May all beings be happy. May all beings. Be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And they all beings be free. And then I'll bow and that bow will be the end of the sitting. Thank you.
