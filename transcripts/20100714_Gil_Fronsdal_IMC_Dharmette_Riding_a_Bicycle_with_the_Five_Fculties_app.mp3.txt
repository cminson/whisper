Dharmette: Riding a Bicycle with the 
Five Faculties  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on July 14, 2010  
 
 
Today I’d like to use the analog y of learning to ride a 
bicycle . If you don ’t know how to ride a bicycle , then you 
can still obsess about where you ’re going on your 
bicycle . “Oh I’m going to ride the back roads of Nap a 
Valley. ” “I’m go ing to go ride along the beach. ” If you 
don’t know how to ride the bike, thinking about where 
you’re going to go is an interes ting exercise , but still a 
waste. You could also be thinking about the bike you ’re 
going to ge t. I’m going to get this super -duper $800 
bike. I hear they have bikes even more expensive than 
that. I’m going to get that one  – the one that ’s $2000. 
It’s shiny  and black, chrome ti res, 52 gears  [laughs] . It’s 
interesting to think about the different bikes you ’re going 
to get , but if you don ’t know how to ride a bike, it ’s kind 
of silly . 
 
Or you could think about how people are going to love 
you so much if you be come the perfect bike rider. You ’ll 
be the best, most praised person on your block, for your 
bike skills . People will love you so much , and you can 
go around very proud , and get one of the se bicycle uniforms people wear  [laughs]  – tight pants . And then 
people  really know that you ’re a bike rider, and they 
treat you with the respect you deserve. [ Student: “You’ll 
be able to shave your legs. ”] Bike riders do that – they 
shave their legs? [“Yes.”] I guess you can do that be fore 
you learn to ride the bike  [laughs] . 
 
It’s possible to obsess about  these things so much that 
when you ’re finally going to learn how to ride the bike , 
you’re thinking about where you are going, not about 
the riding the bike , and you fall over. You ’re thinking 
about the bike you finall y got – you have thi s $4000 bike 
you don’t know how to ride , and you fall over [laughs] . 
Or you think about how all your neighbors are going to 
praise you no end because you ’re the world ’s best bike 
rider – you’re thinking about that and  you fall over.  
 
There are  all these concerns which you need to put 
aside if you ’re going to learn to ride the bike. To learn to 
ride the bike, you have to focus on your abilities. What 
do you contribute to this situation? You have to focus on 
the skills that you need to dev elop. You have to focus on 
learning balance , on learning how to get momentum 
going so that it ’s easier to hold your balance. You have 
to learn how to shift gears , how to navigate the 
potholes, how you handle the bumps . There are  a lot of 
skills you need to learn. You have to focus on that 
internal world of skill building in order to  learn to ride the 
bike. There are  a whole series of internal things we monitor, which we keep track of  as we learn to ride a 
bike. They  get developed  over time. There has to be 
some ong oing monitoring of these things – these  inner 
psychophysical qualities  – in order to be able to ride the 
bike.   
 
In the same way , meditation  requires us to monitor 
something internal. It becomes second nature after a 
while, just like riding a bike becomes second nature. It 
requires us to monitor something  – but it’s something 
which is not a thing. It ’s not a what; it ’s a how.  It’s how 
we are , and it ’s in process. We have to be interested in 
this inner process of what ’s going on . And it has to 
become more interesting than our interest in where 
meditation is going to take us. It ’s has to be more 
interesting than having the right shaped  legs for 
meditation  [laughs] , or the right uniform for meditation  
[laughs] . It has to be more important than the identity 
you think you ’re going to get from a spiritual life. 
“Everyone think s I’m enlightened. People love me so 
much  more. I’ll be the hottest person at IMC ” [laughs] .  
 
There are  a whole series of things that are not  helpful to 
focus on. What ’s necessary to focus on are the inner 
processes – and to be interested enough that we can 
start riding the bike, s tart learning what goes on, taking 
responsibility, monitoring , and keep ing track of it.  That’s 
one of the reasons w e let go a lot in meditation . Not only 
is letting go good because it hurts to hold on, but if we are preoccupied with all these other things, we  can’t 
learn to ride the bike. W e can ’t focus on what ’s going 
on. What are some of the qualities we need to deve lop 
inside ?  
 
What I’d like to focus on today are five qualities. In 
Buddhism they are  called the Five Faculties: 
confidence, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, 
discernment  (sometimes called w isdom ). These are five 
processes within us that come into play when we ’re 
learning to meditate, when we ’re engaged in the 
spiritual life. Are they there in adequate form? Are they 
operating together in an approp riate way? These five 
faculties  are relevant for any endeavo r that people 
become  involved in, not just for meditation. They ’re 
relevant for riding bicycles.  
 
You have to have an adequate amount of c onfidence  to 
ride your bike. If confidence is lacking, you ’re probably 
going to have a much harder time learning. You have to 
have an adequate level of effort, persistence , 
engagement – otherwise  you can ’t ride the bike well. 
You have to make some effort. There has to be some 
mindfulness . You have to be able to track and monitor 
what ’s going on, to be present for what ’s going on in 
some careful way. And there has to be some inner 
stability. If we ’re agitated , it’s hard to do any of this. If 
you’re agitated and restless, it ’s hard to stay properly on 
the bicycle. There has to be some inner stability . The primary function of concentration  is to really create this 
inner ballast – a foundation that allows us to hold our 
ground, to be still, to be here. Then there has to be 
some capacity to be discerning . Discerning here means 
the ability to monitor what ’s going on, which is 
mindfulness, and t hen be able to see distin ctions  
between all the different things going on, and to know 
which are useful and which are not useful.  
 
For example, bicycle riders are constantly being 
discerning. You have to discern what ’s going on with the 
terrain. Is it a slope? Do you need to adjus t? There is a  
hill coming up , and you adjust your pedaling  
accordingly. You change gears; you go uphill;  you 
change your breathing. A  lot of things change 
depending on the terrain. The distance you ’re going to 
bike affects the pace you want to set. If you go a short  
distance , you can bike faster than if you ’re going really 
far. If the road is wet, you ride the bike different ly, more 
carefully, than if the road is dry. There are  all these 
different things t hat you adjust to and take care of . And 
if you ’re a good bike rider , it becomes second nature – 
you don’t even think you ’re doing it.  
 
It’s the same thing with meditation. There ’s a pro cess of 
discernment. And that discernment is : Is there enough 
confidence here? Or do I lack confidence in the 
practice, in myself, in the path? Is there enough 
persistence? Is there enough discipline to keep doing it? Do I need to apply myself more?  Or am I applying 
myself too hard and making too much effort? Am I 
bearing down too tightly? Do I really understand 
mindfulness? Is the mindfulness really mindfulness?  
 
Some people think that think ing about things  is being 
mindful . Mindfulness has some really be autiful qualities , 
which are inherent to mindfulness. T here’s freedom or 
independence in a clear moment of mindfulness. So 
some people think they ’re mindful , but really their 
mindfulness is entangled with other associations and 
ideas and approaches. They might be entangled with 
thinking , or with grasping, or with expectation , or with 
self-identity. The mindfulness is not pristine. It ’s not just 
simple in and of itself. The practice is t o look at the 
quality of the mindfulness , and readjust a little bit. Ca n I 
be mindful without expectation? Can I be mindful 
without measuring myself?  
 
And then is there stability?  Are we present in a stable 
way, or are we agitated ? Are we spinning our wheels 
with our thinking?  
 
These are very simple questions that the function of 
discernment looks at. One of the things discernment 
looks at in meditation is how are you being discerning? 
If you ’re being discerning so your mind gets more 
unstable, more agitate d, more restless, then 
discernment  is not useful. So can you discern – can you use your wisdom – in a way that ’s supportive of 
becoming more peaceful, more c alm, more still, 
suffering less?  
 
What I ’m pointing to here is a series of five processes 
which don ’t exist unless you use  them . They  don’t exist 
unless they ’re activated. They have no absolute 
existence , but they come int o to play  in any human 
endeavo r. They come into play with meditation practice. 
So how we monitor this i s an important part of practice.  
 
The primary point I  wanted to make today is that you 
have t o have confidence and interest  that monitoring 
this inner world is a valuable thing to do, as opposed to 
having confidence in other things your mind is caught 
up in. The mind can be caught up in many, many things 
that take you away from the present moment. Even if 
you are in the present moment a little bit, the mind can 
be preoccupied with things that are not very useful: you r 
identity , or where you ’re going ,or a variety of thin gs.  
 
So can you learn that shift?  Medi tation requires a shift 
of switching our attention from preoccupations  – from 
things and ideas  to processes. It ’s these inner 
processes that we’re paying attention to. Once we ’re 
paying attention to processes, we ’re paying attention to 
something that is dynamic , in flux and moving  – like a 
river. We learn to flow in that river of change of the 
processes , rather than being stuck in the ideas we have, the fixations we have, the concepts that we reify 
our reality with, and reify ourselves with.   
 
The last thi ng I’ll say about this reification process, this 
solidifying, being caught around concepts : it’s like taking 
a bucket down to the river and filling it with water and 
walking away saying, “I have the river here in the 
buck et.” You don ’t have the river in the bucket. You 
have water in the bucket. Onc e you ’ve latched onto a 
concept  that this is how things are, then you ’ve removed 
yourself from the flow of processes. Once you start 
thinking about what had ju st happened  a minute ag o, 
five seconds ago, a day ago, you ’ve pulled yourself out 
of the river.  
 
If you want to meditate, you have to put yourself back in 
the river of these processes, which by their very nature 
unfold only in the present moment . To step out of the 
world of thin gs and concepts, and into the world of inner 
processes is one of the things that are  necessary in 
order to enter more deeply into this world of meditation.  
 
I hope that is helpful. If not, leave it here.
