Greetings friends, greetings to you.
From wherever in the world, we are joining each other in this moment in time.
I hope you are well and delighted to be exploring practices in compassion cultivation this week together.
So as I mentioned on the first day, and as many of you know, cultivating compassion happens.
The practice is offered in growing concentric circles. We start with ourselves, then the next category where we expand our heart is benefactors and dear friends, which we did that yesterday.
We put them together, those two categories.
And then the next category, which is a very important category in this exploration in this growing, expanding our heart is the category of the neutral being, the neutral being.
And basically this category is someone we don't know very well, and when we cultivate compassion for them, we tune into a sense of compassion for someone we don't know very well.
And the significance of this is that this person will become the stand-in for all of humanity.
And this category actually some people find it easier sometimes than the other categories even because we don't have any history with this person.
So it might actually turn out to be easier.
So you'll see for yourself.
So let's practice together. Let's begin together.
Ah, landing in this body. Notice if you need to shift or move to be more comfortable, to sit upright.
What does your body need in this moment to be comfortable?
You feel grounded to feel here.
Feeling your feet on the earth, your legs on the earth if you're sitting on a cushion.
Feeling your sit bones, your bottom on the cushion.
Connected to the earth.
Thank you.
And connecting, receiving the breath, receiving the breath in the abdomen.
Let us receive three deep diaphragmatic breaths to help us arrive, arrive fully and settle.
Maybe breathing in in five counts, holding in for three counts and letting go for five counts available.
Here we go together.
Counts this time breathing in, one, two, three, four, five, holding, one, two, three.
Releasing the breath, one, two, three, four, five. And one more time in your own timing.
Now letting the breath be natural, but continue to connect with the entirety of the in-breath, the pause and the out-breath.
Breathing embodied.
Thank you.
And now bringing to mind, bringing to heart, someone.
Bringing to mind, bringing to heart, someone.
You've seen, you've met, perhaps you have even interacted with, but you don't know very well.
This person could be maybe someone who works at a grocery store, or a barista who's made your coffee, or maybe even a neighbor you've seen walked around.
You've seen them, but you haven't interacted perhaps past just seeing them or saying hello.
Bring this person to your mind and see them as clearly as possible, or feel them as much as possible having had this interaction.
Maybe the receptionist at the doctor's office, if you're still going through the list to find someone.
It's okay to have a little bit of liking or tiny bit of disliking, it's fine.
It doesn't have to be completely neutral, this neutral person, but someone we don't have a lot of history with.
A relatively neutral person.
Bring them to mind.
Now this person, just like me, their life is dear to them.
Just like me, they have a very compelling internal life, the life of the mind, likes, dislikes, thoughts.
Just like me, they have hopes and dreams, aspirations.
Just like me, they suffer, they have suffered.
Their body aches because they have a body, their body ages, gets sick, has gotten sick, they've had pain, they've had loss in their life, just like me.
They might have lost people they love, had disappointments, defeats, they felt lonely, sad, depressed.
They've also felt joy, happiness, just like me, their people they love and hold dear.
And this being is an object of affection of someone else.
Someone really loves and cares about this person.
They might even like something we like, if we like particular vegetable or flavor of ice cream.
Let's imagine the two of us liking the same thing, just for the sake of imagination.
Or frozen yogurt or whatever it might be or food.
We are not so different, this person and I.
We are not so different.
And just as I wish to be happy, just as I wish to be happy, this person just wants to be happy as well, they don't want to suffer.
Just like me, they don't want to suffer, they want to be happy.
For the purpose of this particular practice, it's okay to use our imagination for a moment, perhaps imagine them suffering in the same way we have if we've had an illness or disappointment or loss.
Maybe we've lost a loved one and they too have lost that loved one. We both grieve together in the same ways.
Just as we want to be free, we want to have ease and peace and not suffer, we wish them well.
Just as I don't want to suffer and have ease, I wish you freedom from suffering, I wish you ease.
Just as I wish to have peace and strength and resources to ease my challenges, I wish the same for you.
I wish them in mind, connecting to their image, to their sense, their humanity, just as compelling, their life, just as dear to them, to other people, just as yours is.
They are a dear person.
And knowing that they too suffer from that place of goodwill and acknowledging difficulties and pain, wishing them well, may you be free from suffering.
May you have ease and peace in the midst of your challenges, your difficulties. I wish you well.
And continuing to engage the goodwill of this person, compassion for this being, using your creativity and imagination to create a sense of acknowledgement and connection.
Without getting lost in stories, stay with the feeling.
I wish you well. I wish you ease.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you ease and peace to face challenges of your life, difficulties and pain.
I wish you freedom from sorrow and suffering.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
Beaging with compassion feels good, feels wholesome.
Gladdening of the mind and heart to hold someone else with care, acknowledging their challenges, see if you can tune into it.
Subtuning the radio.
Subtuning the radio.
Subtuning the radio.
Subtuning the radio.
Subtuning the radio.
Subtuning the radio.
Subtuning the radio.
You notice your mind gets lost or distracted.
Stay with the image of the person.
Stay connected to the phrases.
Stay connected to the feeling of kindness and goodwill.
I wish you well.
I wish you peace.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
I wish you well.
Can the heart feel expansive? Its own expansiveness. It is available.
Bearing our goodwill.
With a fellow human being.
Care for their challenges.
As we bring this sit to a close.
Appreciating this being who is me.
Appreciating ourselves for showing up for practicing.
Cultivating kindness, compassion.
Or inviting our hearts to feel expansive. Feeling its own goodness.
Its own capacity of goodwill.
And sharing that goodwill and care kindness with ourselves.
Others in the Sangha.
And sharing the goodness with all beings everywhere.
May all beings everywhere have ease.
May they be free from sorrow, suffering.
May all beings including myself be free.
Thank you for your practice everyone.
And as we take a moment to transition to the dharma and transition to recordings.
If you feel moved and called to put a word about what's arising for you after this practice.
Thank you.
