The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So thank you for coming out on this dark and rainy night right after the New Year.
I'm particularly happy to be here.
And when I was driving down from Berkeley, I was kind of wondering if I was going to be the only one here.
So I decided to talk about the topic of death tonight because the tsunami was three years ago this past December 26.
And as perhaps some of you know, I happened to be in Thailand at the time practicing meditation.
And I went down to offer my psychological services to the survivors and people who were looking for family members and friends who had vanished
in hopes of finding and recovering their bodies.
So it was my responsibility, the responsibility I took on to sit with people while they were going through literally thousands of pictures and trying to find numbers
so we could go into the morgue and go through literally hundreds of bodies to see if the picture they saw perhaps matched the body in the morgue,
which was a meditation hall transferred into a morgue.
And of course dealing with the shock, the grief, the despair, the utter anguish of life being ripped away in a matter of seconds.
And probably for me the most astonishing thing I've ever seen in my life was just going into the morgue and seeing all these people in bathing suits and bikinis
and waiter uniforms and tennis outfits and they thought they were just going to have a day.
They thought that they were going to have lunch and then within a minute they were dead and lying on a floor in a morgue.
And we never think this is going to be the day that I die.
It's just not something that's high in the myriad of thoughts we think about every day.
But in Buddhism we particularly learn that reflections on death is one of the most liberating reflections we can have.
It's the door into the notion, the truth of selflessness and impermanence and that eventually one of the reflections in the monastery is if there's a meeting, there's a parting.
And you just never know when that's going to happen.
But if there's a meeting, it's built into the meeting that there will be a separation.
And another reflection is that everything that's precious to me and my whole beloved and that I consider mine someday will be otherwise.
And this is what we're asked to reflect on every day.
And it's not to bring up, to make us depressed or a downer or get us bummed out.
It's not for any of those reasons.
In fact, for the opposite, it's the intention.
It's supposed to sober us up out of the illusion that this goes on forever and that we have time and that we can take things for granted and we can hold grudges without resolving them.
Or we can just have these mad thoughts running around in our minds and hearts without any sense of the urgency that they could actually come to an end and we can liberate ourselves from suffering, which is the explicit goal of Buddhism.
So, you know, why would death play such a central role in those teachings is what I want to talk about tonight.
And, you know, the romances that we'd like to think that everybody lives to a ripe old age, right?
And that they, you know, get some kind of illness and they linger on, they get to have these kind of romanticized goodbyes in tearful scenes and then, you know, the person dies with their loved ones all around them.
And, you know, they, you know, quote, they were ready to go anyway and it was a blessing and, you know, I'm sure you know that kind of romantic litany.
And great, if that's the unfolding of one's life, you know, that's considered a very, you know, positive way to make a transition.
But it doesn't always happen that way, like in the movies, you know, sometimes, like in the tsunami, there's absolutely no advanced warning.
It's you're alive one second and, you know, gone.
And the next, young people die, babies die, you know, teenagers, you know, all through the life cycle, people are dying.
And we, and if you don't, you know, if people don't have that more romantic, you know, it's the end of life anyway.
It was a blessing, you know, the scene of family around, you know, gently holding their hands and going off into the, into the, you know, to heaven or whatever.
We think, you know, there's something wrong.
It was terribly unfair.
It shouldn't have happened and life shouldn't be this way.
Well, you know, the one of the great meditation masters of the 20th century said if it shouldn't have been that way, it wouldn't have been that way.
But, you know, we're left with an indisputable fact of life, you know, that all of us, you know, live to the time we live until the time we die.
And we never know when that's going to be.
And it's a total mystery.
And we've all heard of people who, you know, go into the doctor's office and everything's fine.
And then they walk out with a, you know, a diagnosis of, you know, a terminal illness.
Or I've heard this many times, somebody just goes to the doctor for something routine and gets a blood test.
And, you know, just for something routine and, you know, they get diagnosed, never, you know, never had, never having a symptom.
I mean, there are just endless variations of the process of dying.
And so in the monasteries, we're asked specifically to spend times of reflection every single day on the fact that if there's a meeting and there's a parting,
that the death is certain, but the time of our death is not.
Can't be predicted, even if you're dying, it can't be predicted, you know.
And that we will be separated from everything that we cherish and find precious and we consider ours.
There will be a separation.
We're also encouraged to reflect on the parts of the body, the 32 parts of the body as not self.
You know, if you, one of the reflections I was encouraging to do is called the gamutangha. It's the five, five reflections.
Kaisaloma nakadantatacho, so hair of the head.
You're on your walking path, for example, and you just, you imagine taking off the hair of your head and putting it on the side of the path.
Then you imagine taking off the hair of your skin, you know, the hair of the skin and putting it on the side of the path.
And then your teeth, you know, taking them out.
So you're basically deconstructing the body, you know, then taking off your nails and then finally your skin, you know.
And the question is, you know, where is me? Where is myself? Is it in the hair? Is it in the toenails or the fingernails?
You know, is it the hair on my body? Is it, you know, my teeth? Who am I really, you know?
And that we learn through these continual daily processes of reflecting on the body and eventually disintegration of it
and the truth of our, you know, existence of being impermanent, that really this, it's a sack, you know.
It's a sack and it has all kinds of disgusting things in it, no matter what we do, you know, no matter what we do to our bodies, right?
There, you know, it's set up that it's not going to work, right?
So if you get to be my age, you start kind of looking more seriously at these ads that promise, you know, that your wrinkles are going to vanish
and, you know, that, you know, your eyelids, if you buy this for $110 or something, you know, something's going to disappear
and your skin's going to get tighter and more firm and, you know, you start kind of paying attention
and because of your Buddhist practice, you say, well, you know, not only is it a lie, but it's completely unnatural.
It's not, it doesn't reverse. It doesn't go in the opposite direction. It's a one-way street, you know?
But they're not going to tell you that because, of course, they want you to buy their product, right?
So, but it's interesting how, you know, we get seduced, you know, into, you know, my hair is going to be shiny
and they're going to color it somehow. It's like, well, you know, coloring it is a choice, for sure.
But it's not going to have that luster that you see in these young girls on the street or young guys on the street
because that's the nature of aging is that, you know, things fade. They don't get brighter.
The only thing that can get brighter is the best thing, which is our minds and our hearts.
That can get brighter. But the conditions of our body, you know, are set up to deteriorate.
But the conditions of our heart and mind, you know, are such that we can be sobered by the realities of life,
the realities of death that bring us a brighter state of seeing clearly a greater sense of stillness,
a greater sense of calm, you know, that gives us a deeper core of being
that leads us to ultimately the end of suffering and liberation.
Okay, so this is a more reliable quality, you know, to spend our efforts on
than it is to kind of like look at a magazine cover and it's like, well, maybe it's true.
You know, maybe if I did visit the Revlon counter, you know, that something could be disguised
or changed or whatever, you know, but, you know, it isn't, and then they don't get my money either.
So, you know, it's a wake-up. Well, I can clean my mind. I can clean my mind. I can clean my heart.
And it's the opposite. It's the opposite of living out an illusion or trying to buy an illusion.
You know, we can't buy it. We just, we can't buy it. It's not the nature of life.
The nature of life is death, you know, and it cannot be sustained.
And it's, you know, beyond a financial agreement, you know, it's not something that you can pay somebody off.
It's not a product. And just going back to my experience, you know, I was down in Phuket, which is in Krabi,
and these are, you know, the most picture-perfect places I've ever been on Earth.
I mean, it's like the pictures are exactly, you know, as stunning as the reality.
So they're not airbrushed, you know, the sky, the color of the ocean, the mountains coming out of the sea.
You know, it is stunningly magnificent, right?
And there's a wide variety of people who go to these particular places that were hit by this tsunami.
There are resorts, and I kid you not, that cost $2,000 a day.
You know, they are so fancy, but I wouldn't know.
But this is what I'm told.
You know, people have individual swimming pools, and you get three massages out.
I don't know what includes. I mean, it did.
But it cost $2,000 a day.
And then there are these kind of hippie beach shacks, you know, where young kids go from all over the world,
you know, to surf and all that kind of stuff where, you know, you can rent a beach shack for, I think, $10 a night.
So the whole spectrum of, you know, of economics, you know, economic, you know, embodiments are there, you know.
And so, you know, death doesn't say, well, you're rich or you're young, you know, and only paid $10 on the beach,
or you're, you know, older and affluent, we're going to, you know, skip you.
You know, or you're a child with a life ahead of you, or a grandparent, so we might as well sweep you away.
It's completely, you know, it's completely irrelevant.
And so that was another stunning thing that I got to see, which was that, you know, I was in two places.
And helping people who were hospitalized, paralyzed, broken those, broken that, waking up,
not knowing where their husband, wife, mother, daughter, sister, brother, friends were.
So, you know, along with whatever physical ailment, they were also having nervous breakdowns.
And also, as I said, going in and out of the morgue with people.
And what was amazing to me was that from the Western perspective, you know, this should not have happened.
This should not have happened.
It was, you know, the biggest injustice.
How could this be?
And while, you know, the Asian population, the Thais, thousands of the Thais died together, died as well,
who were basically in the service industry of serving all these, you know, hippies and up-to-wealthy people.
You know, because of being in a Buddhist country, really had the sense of, you know, this is part of nature,
and it's completely uncontrollable.
Now, this is not to say they weren't in grief, and sad and shocked and all that.
But the layer of anger, and this should not have happened, was really absent, you know.
This is, you know, this is the real thing.
This is what the Buddha taught, you know, that we're destined to die and we don't know when.
So the added layer of outrage, the added layer of, you know, the unfairness,
you know, really makes you realize, really, you know, it was like a stab in my heart of, you know,
just what we do to ourselves when we don't meditate on the fact that suffering is inevitable.
You know, it's part of the package, and this is the way it is, and you can't buy yourself out of it.
And I was looking around the morgue, and you couldn't tell who was rich or poor.
You could not tell the hippies from the, you know, the aristocrats and socialites.
You know, it was completely indistinguishable.
And what difference did it make? You know, what difference did it make?
Nothing. It didn't make any difference, you know.
It was completely irrelevant.
And it was so striking when, you know, some people flew their private jets in and, you know,
somehow demanding that, you know, they get to the front of the line in terms of, you know, identifying their loved ones
or having to pay, you know, that the forensic teams or even me would, you know, pay special attention
because they were special and they needed to find out about their kid or their mother or their father,
their brother, their daughter, their groom.
And, you know, those norms don't operate in those kind of situations. They're irrelevant.
Now, you can't, those aren't kind of demands that are going to be met.
We can't buy our way out of it, you know.
So that was something that, you know, struck me in such a profound, you know, visceral, you know, sensory way
because the smell of all these corpses rotting in a tropical country, you know, you don't forget that too often, you know.
So, again, when I would look around, when I, you know, when I came back to the United States eventually
and, you know, I saw and experienced, you know, the great efforts that we take
and keeping our bodies fit and trim and beautiful and clean and all that.
It's like, yeah, I mean, we should do that, but we also should never forget, you know, that we are a sack.
It is, you know, smelly and repulsive.
I think that's the, there's a line that the Buddha says, you know, our bodies are a sack of repulsive things.
You know, that's what the Buddha says.
And it's like, you know, you're supposed to do this every single day.
And so, you know, as I said, Revlon or Clinique's not going to tell you that.
So, you know, that's the effort that we spend time reflecting on, whereas when you're given this full dose of, you know,
a dead body smelling, rotting, whatever, you know, that person doesn't raise their hands.
But, you know, I have all this Chanel makeup at home, you know.
You know, or I, you know, I played so often on the tennis court.
My body, you know, shouldn't be rotting and deteriorating that way.
That's just the way it is.
And so I just want to say a few things about, you know, the, you know, even though death is unwanted, you know, you know, it comes.
And there's grief and there's a choice or it's different when, you know, we've had the opportunity in meditation
from a sense of debilitating grief that includes outrage to really healthy grief, you know, pure grief that comes from the fact that, you know, life ends
and that people we love die and that it isn't fair, you know.
And there's something, and don't get me wrong, when I say beautiful about the purity of grief, because I don't mean beautiful in a physical way,
but just the, you know, a pure, you know, just heaving cry of grief, you know.
There's something, you know, in that just, you know, that we don't have control and that people we love, we're separated from.
That's very different than the raging anger of, it shouldn't have happened.
Why me? You know, my kid was such a wonderful person.
You know, those thoughts come and go and it's not like we shouldn't have them.
But as meditators, we see that it produces a whole different level of grief and the kind of grief that lingers on and on, because, you know, anger is a poison.
You know, anger is a poison.
And so, you know, and that gets fed and fed and fed.
And meanwhile, if it shouldn't have happened, it wouldn't have happened, but it did.
It did and it can't be changed.
You know, a young person can't exchange places with an old person. It doesn't happen.
You know, that's just not the way it is.
And parents would say to me, why wasn't it me instead of my son or daughter?
And why wasn't it, you know, that's not a question, you know, that anybody could answer.
You know, you know, I said, you know, why didn't you die because of your daughter?
You know, because you didn't.
You know, there's no other, you know, just that's the way it was.
So what what can these reflections, you know, really give us, you know, these reflections really help us stay focused on what's important.
And I'm assuming that everybody here has had the experience of people dying and then when that happens, there is a sobering feeling of all these trivial things.
Or am I, by the way, is there anybody who hasn't had these experiences of what I'm talking about yet?
So many of the frivolous things that bug us fall away.
You know, we just, we realize how stupid it is to spend so much time, you know, fretting about things that really don't matter as they say, don't sweat the small stuff.
Okay. And then the illusion, you know, the delusion comes back in and we start getting irritated.
And then, you know, something else sobering happens and you say, well, you know, I was just, you know, lost in the fact that, you know, we're supposed to split dinner and it didn't come down the middle because this person had a glass of wine and I didn't.
And you get stuck in these like kind of, you know, obsessive thoughts and then something happens and you say, wow, who cares?
You know, does that, does that sound familiar as people have that experience?
Or something shakes you up where the frivolous things just fall away.
And the things that bugged you once just don't bug you anymore because you've been sobered.
You know, you've been, you know, a dash or a dose, you know, has been, you know, like throwing water in your face and you're alive and you say, like, you know, that was really no big deal.
And people that, you know, come into focus, people that, you know, you found irritating, you know, suddenly you just see, you know, they're just people like you and me and I probably irritate them too.
And you see them more clearly. You don't see them as an irritation.
You just see them as, you know, people struggling like we all do in life.
And so the bottom of that is just feeling more compassionate towards people and realizing we're all in the same mess, basically, the same boat.
And so reflections on death allow more compassion to arise because you think every single person I meet is going to die and we don't, and every single person doesn't know when.
And for every single person when it happens to people that they love, it's going to be sad.
You know, so it's hard to get really angry at people when you know that what's ahead of all of us, right?
And so that's a really beautiful outcome of reflecting on death.
Another is, you know, forgiving ourselves and forgiving others.
Whether you believe in a next life or whatever, it doesn't matter.
It's like, who wants, you know, who wants to be angry, you know, at the moment of death, which we don't know when it's going to come?
Who wants to be holding a grudge?
And even if you don't believe in a rebirth or a next life, it's like, you know, at that point, if you're lucky enough to be able to relate, you know, do you really want to be holding grudges and, you know, yelling at somebody on your deathbed?
I don't think so.
I mean, maybe.
You know, I'm not speaking for every single person.
I mean, there's certainly angry people when they die.
But, you know, when you think about it, wouldn't it be a lot more peaceful and and satisfying to say I love you rather than, you know, I never wanted to go to camp when I was 10 and you abandoned me and I felt like a jerk.
And, you know, I mean, whatever the complaint is, right?
I mean, you know, you know, and just letting the litany of resentments of your life, you know, rule off your tongue.
But, you know, so it gives us the the sense of, you know, do I really, you know, how do I want to end, you know, or tie up the package?
And the fact of the matter is we can type the package at any moment.
You know, who do we want to forgive ourselves above all?
You know, do we want to forgive ourselves for something that happened with our kids or our parents or at work or, you know, the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened or any humiliation?
You know, can we forgive ourselves for, you know, being under the swing and sway of greed, hatred and delusion, the free poisons and we, you know, we do, we do unskillful things in our lives.
And can we forgive ourselves, you know, every day?
And there are practices that we're encouraged to do in Thailand and, you know, monasteries that say, you know, I forgive myself for any ways I've hurt or harmed myself today.
And I forgive everybody who has hurt or harmed me today.
And I ask them for forgiveness for hurting, harming me in every, in any way. And I let go, you know, of those grudges today because you don't know, you know, do you know you're going to wake up?
My brother, who was 44, died in the sleep of a heart attack.
I'm sure he, I mean, I, I don't know what he thought before he went to bed that night, but I can pretty much, you know, surmise it wasn't that he wasn't going to wake up the next day.
So we don't know. So, you know, who do we need to forgive? What do we need to forgive?
And the time is now, you know, for forgiveness.
It's not, you know, it's some romantic, you know, time.
And how nice that, you know, we can forgive ourselves.
We can let ourselves, you know, take ourselves off that hook and say, okay, you know, there were many unskillful parts of my life.
And then there were many, many, many, many, many skillful things.
It's another reflection we're asked to do in the monastery because the Buddha understood that we're our worst enemies, you know, and we're really good at beating ourselves up and amplifying the lousy things about ourselves.
And being able to, you know, turn around to tell somebody, you know, all the terrible things you've done, you know, from day one.
But what about the good things? So we're asked to reflect on those as a way before we go to sleep at night, you know, think of the good things you've done that day.
You know, to kind of, to put your mind, you know, lighten it up. You know, so when you go to sleep, you're thinking, well, you know, I made an offering to one of the monks.
You know, I stepped aside when somebody, you know, wanted to get ahead of me and align or, you know, on the path to the dining room, I, you know, let somebody go in front of me.
And you start thinking of all these little things. I folded some of these laundry that was on the, you know, that was dry.
And they all seemed so stupid, right? That's like, so what? That's not going to, you know, really make me happy. But you do, you're about to do at least 10.
And then, then you go, wow, it wasn't, you know, that was pretty good. And so then when you started thinking, well, you know, I shifted too much during meditation or I really, I got off my walking path earlier.
Those don't, you know, it's like figure ground. Those don't seem to be as important when you say, well, all those little things are pretty good considering I was in the worst mood I've ever been in today.
You know, so you think, oh, okay, you know, all those things add up. And at least I'm going to bed with a mind filled with things that were skillful, no matter, you know, how insignificant they seemed.
Okay, it's better than going to bed with a mind filled of, you know, you know, I'm a worthless person and, you know, I have to keep it a secret, you know, what an idiot I am.
And, you know, who, you know, I don't need to suggest things to say to yourself, but, you know, anyway, the other thing I want to talk about is, you know, just the common human tendency of procrastination.
You know, we think there's going to be tomorrow. So we don't, you know, we don't forgive somebody. It's okay to let another year go by or month go by, you know, before, you know, writing the letter or having a cup of coffee.
We just, we say, you know, it'll happen tomorrow. And it's like, you know, I wish, you know, damn, I wish I had said I'm sorry.
Or, you know, I wish I expressed more appreciation. They're gone, you know.
So it goes both ways. You don't have to say, I'm sorry. You can tell people, you know, how much they mean to you and how much you appreciate them and how much they've taught you, admired, blah, blah, blah.
So, you know, procrastination covers a lot of territory, because if you wait, wait to do these things, we don't know. I mean, when I was in that work, I thought, you know, what were all, what was all the unfinished business of every single one of these people, you know?
What did they go to their deaths with in their hearts and minds? You know, I believe me, I prayers with the hearts and minds were cleaning clear.
But because we're human beings, we let these ways of delusion, especially in the, you know, Christmas time and, you know, you're out on the beach and you're playing tennis.
It's like, it's not a time, it's not a sobering time. It's like, you want to get, you want to forget about the truth of your permanence. You know, you want to forget, you know, the natures.
That's why you go on vacation. You just want to, you know, like, forget all these truths of life. You know, you're not there to remind yourself of them.
And so, you know, probably, I don't know, but my guess would be a lot of people died in the state of delusion. I don't know. You know, not having expressed gratitude or appreciation or admiration to themselves and other people resolved conflicts.
And when I came home, I was just a lot better at doing that. You know, when I did, and I didn't know it until about a month later that somebody I knew was killed in the tsunami and I was absolutely, just completely devastated by it.
And she was somebody who practiced with me. Your name was Kwan Dao, Thai woman. And she had said to me, we had met up at a monastery, a different one that we had practiced and together.
And she said, you know, make sure you call me before you leave, because I was leaving from Bangkok. And she was from Bangkok. And I said, I will. I promise you promise.
Yeah, promise. And I was leaving Thailand. And that day, you know, I called and I said, well, I'm going to fulfill my promise to Kwan Dao. And I'm going to call and I called.
And I spoke to, and I was speaking in Thai, so I spoke to somebody and she said, you know, Kwan Dao, Kwan Dao, Dai Lao, which means she's dead.
And like, like, I knew her mother was sick. I said, I'm like having this conversation. No, no, no, you know, that, you know, you mean her mother. No, no, no, Kwan Dao, Dai Lao.
So I'm thinking, well, let me speak to her daughter. I didn't know who that person was. I asked in Thai to speak to her daughter.
Luk Sao, Dai Lao, Dai, her daughter died too. So now I'm thinking, well, maybe my Thai's not so good. You know, maybe I'm not getting this.
I said, I'd like to speak to the husband. I knew all these people, by the way, because they used to come to the monastery to visit on Sundays and make offerings to our teacher.
And we speak to the husband, Dai Lao, Dai, that too.
So at this point, I'm like screaming to my monk friend of mine, like, get on the phone, like, you know, something's wrong.
And so I asked about her granddaughter and her granddaughters. She went alive.
So then I said, you know, was it the tsunami? And she said, yes. So my friend died, her daughter, her husband, and the only person left was this young girl.
Like, I think she was four or five at the time.
And, you know, even after seeing all these dead bodies in the monastery and, you know, practicing death meditation, it was still like, my friend, you know, it was still, you know, still you realize how far there is to go to really make these insights.
And my mind was like, she was such a good person. It was all the things that, you know, she was such a good person. And why did she die?
She was such a committed Buddhist and she made all these offerings and she was the most generous person. And it's all true, but so what?
You know, then I had to kind of like kind of sober up, you know, her too.
You know, her daughter too, her son-in-law too. And then this girl gets to grow up with no grandmother and parents.
That's the truth. And it's not ugly or pretty or anything. It's just the truth.
Thoughts, you know, arise and pass away and so do people. And, you know, I was getting on a plane that day and, you know, it's like a 17-hour plane ride home.
I was just completely in a state of shock and I'm thinking, you know, but this is what I, you know, this is what I was spending, you know, almost two years doing.
You know, because so it bites, you know, death bites us and we don't know what our reactions are going to be.
But at least when we meditate, we have a chance to kind of wake up to those thoughts that, you know, are pumping at us and pounding at us that, you know, it's not fair and it shouldn't happen.
You know, we can wake up and say, well, this is what the Buddha taught, everything's impermanent, but rises passes away, you know, when we meet we part.
And so, you know, sobering out, you know, having that tragedy and, you know, sober me, you know, stop that train of thought that where was it going to go?
It was just going to make me more miserable. And, you know, so it's not that they don't show up these thoughts, it's just depending on how we're going to relate to the thoughts, you know.
So, you know, in America we're pretty isolated from death.
You know, it's not around us all the time like it is in Thailand.
You know, people in the poor areas of Thailand, you know, people like hammer together this coffin and it's some cheap wood and they put the body in it and they just have these two.
And cement blocks, they put the coffin on it, they put in like a plastic tube, there's gas, you know, gas tank, gas pours in, somebody likes a match, that's it.
And in more wealthy areas Thailand they have, you know, the cremation thing and you don't see that, it's under cover.
But it's there, but in these poor areas it's like really shocking.
But, you know, everybody's there, kids are there, everybody's there and that's what they see.
And then you can see the body right away when the wood goes up, there's the body. So it's just very different, you know.
So these are reflections I offer to you as I said not to bum you out or depress you, but to help you have a more meaningful life and to help you not torture yourself.
But to sober up and to be more appreciative and more forgiving and to eliminate those procrastinations.
And to really appreciate above all, you know, the precious opportunity of meditation and to embody what the Buddha taught us, you know, as a form of liberation.
That these reflections, you know, make our life richer and deeper and clearer and, you know, you can't buy it.
You just, you know, you can just develop it. So those are the reflections tonight and I wish you long, happy and healthy lives and come what may.
So are there any questions or reflections or anything?
You mentioned sobering up when dealing with death in family or with friends or good friends.
You shared your experience.
Does it not take away the emotions and the feelings that you may want to still be with for a bit before you take that route or that part?
Yeah, that's an excellent question. And I'm happy to have the opportunity to clarify it because, you know, there, there will be grief.
But there's layers of grief.
You know, again, that pure layer of just that, you know, sadness that a life has ended versus the, the more complex layers of grief that's added on suffering that we say, you know, when we say things like it shouldn't have been that way.
So the grief is is very focusing, you know, it's and it's not linear. It takes a long time to work through and it's, you know, huge road to compassion.
It's really hard to be cold when you're grieving.
It just it just rips your heart open.
You know, so grief is a huge part of life.
And oftentimes we're scolded out of it.
It's been six months.
What's your problem?
You know, it's, it's very humbling, you know, how long it takes.
And it's not linear, like one month, you're better and second month, you're it's not like that at all.
You see some I've seen people, you know, where, you know, 1520 years, you know, in some, you know, wave of grief comes over.
And, you know, it's our we have to be responsible to that grief and really, you know, experience it and not fight against it.
And also not to make trouble with it.
You can't beat it up.
It's there, you know, so it can't be matcha with grief, you know, doesn't doesn't it'll it'll just knock you over.
And there's a softening that comes with grief, you know, we've seen people who've really had these, you know, cries, you know, huge, you know, kind of chest heaving cries.
And, and then there's this, this like softening.
It's kind of never over.
It's never really over, you know, I'm over that.
And that's ridiculous, isn't it?
You know, when, when the Buddha, one of the Buddha's attendants died, the Buddha said the sun and the moon are out of, you know, are like, it's like the sun and the moon are out of the sky.
You know, so it's, it's not like there's not grief.
It's, you know, how respectful and kind you can be to it and not shame it away or, you know, beat it up or, you know, the sun and the moon are out of the sky.
Yes.
So if I understand what you're saying, it's that when grief hits you, I mean, it's, it's natural, it's a natural human tendency to feel, you know, just as if the universe has just been torn in half.
But it's your reaction to it.
You can add layers of complexity by feeling angry at someone or something.
And that can cause more suffering. And what you're saying is that it's not, I mean, it's common, it's human to read, to feel that, but it's your reaction to things that can cause more suffering.
Yeah, that's well said.
And then through meditation, you know, and appreciating impermanence as one of the characteristics of all phenomenon, we can wake up sooner to that anger or and say, you know,
this, this is adding to my suffering. Sometimes it's easier to be angry than to grieve.
Do you think you might be able to share just, I mean, I know it's years of training you've had.
But like for me, the one thing that I know that would be very hard for me not to be angry about is like losing my two year old.
Just because children, I mean, for me, sometimes are, you know, they're, they're this awakening, you know, I feel like I've become this different person and I've had so much insight after her and then to even, even fathom losing her,
which it is part of life, you know, I may lose her before I go, you know, but you know how they say it's harder to watch your children go before you go.
Because then you think life isn't fair. And so I don't know if you can share any type of meeting, parting meditation you've learned to work on that.
Yeah, I mean, probably the biggest, you know, pain in life is, you know, would be the pain of losing a child and certainly if you're going to any feelings of unfairness that would trigger it.
And reflecting on death helps you appreciate every single second with that child because there is no guarantee.
And it helps you wake up from the feeling of being, you know, that this is taken for granted.
You know, the fact is we don't know who dies first. And if you take for granted that it's going to be you first and your child later, that's, that's a setup.
That's a setup because we don't know.
So it makes things more precious. When you really could sit with, don't know mind, I don't know, then every interaction has more power to it.
And then every interaction you say like, I'm not going to hold on to that because this could be our last moment together.
So, yes.
I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the relationship between clinging and grieving.
And I mean it in this sense.
There's awareness here. There's awareness there.
There's nobody home.
And someone dies and as human beings, we naturally grieve about the loss of those we care about.
And there are other things that we lose things that we lose that we may or may not cling to.
Talk about that a little bit, please.
You know, this is the, this is the dilemma of being a human being because loving people, there's a price.
We get attached to them and then we lose them.
You know, there's healthy clinging and healthy relation, healthy, you know, bonding and clinging and then there's unhealthy.
And the unhealthy is the kind of clinging where it's laced with that delusion, you know, that this isn't, this is going to always be this way.
It's never going to change.
You know, I'm always going to have this person to cry on their shoulder or whatever.
And the healthy relationship is that this is so precious right now.
I'm not going to take it for granted.
And a lot of times, you know, the healthy and the unhealthy, because we're not liberated, you know, it's a mixed bag.
That's why it's, you know, so hard to grieve and it's so complicated.
It's so hard to let go of the judgments.
But the Buddha said, you know, it's clinging.
That's the cause of suffering.
But, you know, there's skillful clinging.
You know, we're interdependent, we're related.
You know, we do depend on people.
And the unhealthy side of that is thinking it's going to last forever.
And that's when the grief really knocks you out.
Thanks for your talk and the topic.
My mother was 87 when she died.
It was sort of one of those perfect, the kind of perfect deaths that you describe in a way is,
you know, she's had a long life and we knew ahead of time and people were able to complete and she wasn't afraid of it.
And a good number of us were there when she passed.
And I always said that it was the biggest gift that she ever gave me was to be able to go through that experience of the last,
you know, few months of her life and what we all, what we all went through that and there was grief.
And there was anger at what was going on too, you know, there were things that weren't,
that were hard to deal with the hospital and stuff.
But the whole thing was really profound.
And as you're talking, the thing I realize is a couple of things.
First of all, as you forget, you know, that experience of things falling away that aren't important.
Well, it isn't, you don't remember it forever.
You know, you kind of got to be reminded all the time.
And the other thing is watching her pass, the thing about being a sack, it was so,
and I've been with animals and other people that have died too.
The difference between being alive and being dead, you really get clear that the being,
whoever the person is, is not in the body.
It is just a sack.
And that, that for me was really profound too, to realize that she wasn't there.
You know, her beingness was there when she was alive and it wasn't in her body when she died.
And we actually had the opportunity to have a picnic when she was being cremated and, you know, celebrate her passing.
And we actually were allowed to go in to the crematorium and see what was left of her bones
and that was really, it was a strange experience, but it wasn't a negative experience
to see just the calcium that was left of the ribs and the skull.
And it was so clear, this whole cycle of life is so different from whatever the minerals are
and the water that makes up our bodies.
And there was something really profound about that as well.
So, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'd just like to end with encouraging you to reflect on the preciousness of this moment
and some of the things that you'd like to resolve with yourself and others,
letting your own self off the hook, forgiving yourself,
forgiving grievances with other people and encourage you to reflect on not putting off anything
and really doing it now while you can, while you're healthy and able to meditate.
So please keep meditating.
Please keep cleaning up the only thing worth cleaning.
And happy new year.
