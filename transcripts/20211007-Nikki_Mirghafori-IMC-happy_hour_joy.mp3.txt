 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. So hello, hello everyone. A warm, warm welcome. So for today's practice together, I wanted to invite us to turn our hearts, our awareness, to a metta which is tinged with joy, with delight, with the sprite quality of happiness, which is so nourishing, so supportive for us as human beings. And every, I mean, whatever the conditions of our lives are, whether we're going through a period of ease, yay, joy can support us in making it brighter and being of support to us, ourselves and others. And also, if we're going through a tough time, also, there can still be space for joy. Joy can still actually especially be supportive if there are challenges and difficulties, so that sorrow, pain, dukkha, doesn't become the entire measure of all that we see, doesn't just suck the air out of the room, it doesn't become all there is, but we notice that actually, yes, maybe challenges are here, but yes, joy can be present too. There can be different guests present at the same time. There can be joy, there can be sorrow, etc. So with that, the invitation to turn towards joy today. And whatever you need, I will share with you during the guided meditation. So as you know, no experience, no previous experience necessary. Ah, so let's begin. Let's begin our practice together. So arriving, arriving in our body, arriving. In this moment, as always we begin with settling the mind. Inviting ourselves to arrive gently with the breath, with embodiment. Nowhere to go, nothing to do, but to just sit or lie down, if that's what the body needs. And connect, become aligned, unified. Feeling our bottom and the cushion. The contact points, really connecting. And letting our spine be aligned, our vertebrae. The sense of integrity, be uplifted from our sit bones. The more stable and wide our base feels, the more connected we feel, the easier we can sit upright, tall like a mountain that is well connected, well rooted to the earth. As if there is an internal, vertical pull, aligning us, aligning our heart, connecting our heart to our head, to our belly, feeling connected. The breath enlivening, this verticality, this vertical pull, connecting us to the earth and the skies, well rooted to the earth, uplifted to the skies. Allowing each breath as it moves in, to fill out, to fill out space of the heart, the sense of alignment, energetic alignment. The sense of presence, verticality needs more energy, if you are feeling a little too flighty, or unsettled, scattered. attention to the lower part of this verticality, the earthiness connected to the earth. You're feeling heavy, tired, sleepy, maybe more energy to the uplift of the chest, the upper parts connected to the sky. You're feeling heavy, tired, sleepy, sleepy, maybe more energy to the sky. You're feeling heavy, tired, sleepy, sleepy, sleepy, maybe more energy to the sky. You're feeling heavy, You You You You You I'd like to invite you now While you stay While you stay embodied Feeling Your bottom on the cushion Your feet on the earth Your legs on the earth if you're sitting on the cushion Breath in the abdomen While we feel Continue to stay embodied, connected Aligned in this body To break the mind To break the mind Someone who's Easy for us to feel happy for Something that is going well in their lives That we naturally feel happy for them Choosing someone easy Or it doesn't bring a sense of envy, could be a child Could be a pet you think of Or a friend or a relative or anyone Or you genuinely celebrate, you feel happy, you feel glad, you feel glad for them You feel glad for them There's something good in their lives Anything Maybe they're healthy after Not having been healthy or Any other areas of life There's a sense of well-being, gladness that they have Appreciation they have for an area of their life Or even if they don't feel it, they're not so conscious In the case of pets, but you, you're glad for them You're happy for their goodness, their good fortune they're enjoying You're glad that they're glad, you're happy that they're happy It could even be someone you barely know as long as it doesn't bring up envy Maybe they went on a trip recently Maybe you saw the photos, say on social media, and you're just glad for them Even if you're not going on a trip right now, you're glad Yeah, somebody in the world had a lovely experience Tapping into the generosity of the heart, generosity of your heart I'm happy for you, I'm happy that you're happy I'm happy that you're happy I'm happy that you're happy May you feel nourished by your happiness May your happiness continue May it increase, may it never end I had a friend today describe their hiking trip where they so delighted in the fall foliage The colors of the leaves, the brightness, the beautiful display of the leaves, of autumn Their description, their happiness made me so happy Vicarious delight, vicarious joy See what might come up for you This shared happiness, shared gladness This interconnected web of humanity Bringing gladness in our heart as if it was our joy, our joy We experience it right here in this moment Aladdening our heart Letting yourself relish delight in someone else's happiness, vicarious joy Sympathetic joy We feel happy for other people's happiness The sense of generosity of heart, generosity of spirit So much gladness our heart can swim in, can delight in Imagining relishing this goodness, this blessing, how happy they are Allowing yourself to rejoice with them, for them Sharing, sharing their joy And happy for your happiness Thank you for watching! Thank you for watching! Joy is joy Neurobiologically Our brains don't distinguish between vicarious joy One, the joy we experience for happiness of others And as if we experience it ourselves, it's the same nourishing joy Happy making, see for yourself Thank you for watching! Thank you for watching! Retuning into a sense of generosity of heart That feels happy with others' happiness Breathing in their joy as if it's ours And as if it's not our heart, lighting up our heart Thank you for watching! If you wish you can stay with others And if you like now you can turn to yourself, this being who is you Aspects of your life, this life, something, what are the blessings in your life? The gifts that you can feel happy for your own good fortune, your own happiness Let your heart relish and shine, this is no time for feeling small or ashamed of your wellbeing or good fortune Let yourself relish what is good And you'll discover there is more than you knew, perhaps, or you acknowledged Thank you for watching! Thank you for watching! Thank you for watching! Thank you for watching! Focusing on the abundance that is also present in your life We can choose to focus on what's challenging and we can choose to focus on what is good See what happens if you make this choice Does your heart feel more full with gladness, with ease, with delight, with gratitude Thank you for watching! Thank you for watching! May my good fortune continue May it increase, may it never end, or simply I'm happy for my own happiness Thank you for watching! Thank you for watching! Thank you for watching! I delight, I take joy in them Thank you for watching! See if your hand, the palm of your hand wants to be placed on your chest, your heart center, middle of your chest, connecting with yourself The goodness, the gratitude for these blessings Not to make darkness, only darkness, the measure of our existence, but our light, our good fortune, our goodness Thank you for watching! Thank you for watching! Notice if this practice of joy for your own joy transitions naturally to gratitude For the last moments of this practice period Appreciating our good fortune for practicing together, for having met the Dharma Such good fortune to be able to practice, cultivate our hearts, our minds in this way What a blessing! To get in touch with our own goodness, inner goodness, our inner Buddha, the benefit from the Dharma, the way things are The teachings, awakening teachings And sangha, the good fortune of sangha May all beings everywhere have blessings in their lives, be happy and joyful May all beings be free, including yourselves Thank you all, thank you for your practice Well, I don't know about you, but I certainly feel lighter and more joyous than when we started I feel a sense of delight and joy, both for others good fortune and for my own And as I was saying, you know, neurophysiologically our brains don't distinguish between gladness or gladness And for our own gladness it's just joy, it's the same stuff, it's the same neurotransmitters And we can feel that, we can feel into that actually when we experience just happiness, joy, gladness So I would love to hear your reflections, what did you discover, what came up for you Bill says, that felt good, thank you Nikki, you are so welcome Bill, I'm glad, I'm glad, yeah, so glad And yeah, you're welcome to raise your hand or type your reflections in chat What did you discover?
