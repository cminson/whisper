Is

It’s probabl y fair to say  that for many people there is a 
very strong drive  or desire  or preference for feeling 
good . That’s good in and of itself , perhaps . It can be 
innocent,  and healthy , and appropriate , but there can 
also be  a lot of attachment  and complicated  assigning  of 
meaning s to this idea of feeling good and how important 
it is. 
 
Some people orient themselves way t oo much on 
feelin g good and whatever that means. T hey have some 
idea that it’s  supposed to  be cheerful,  or joyful . There is 
a pursuit of just feeling good . For some people that 
desire to be comfortable  or feel good takes precedence 
over a lot of other things . There is not an appreciation 
that human life involves  a range of feelings , some  which  
maybe would not be categorize d as feeling good. There 
may be more profound ways of being present in life  
besides  always feeling good , or pursuing comfort  or 
pleasure.  
 
In this practice y ou want to be able to be careful that you are  not always oriented to wards  being comfortable , 
feeling  good, or having pleasure in the pr actice , as if 
that is the measure of how deep the practice is . The 
measure of the depth of practice is  more from the 
satisfaction that comes from being present for what is . 
There is a way of being present for discomfort, for pain, 
even for feeling bad . There is a way to meet it and  be 
with it where  we are not avoiding it , not lea ning toward  
the good , and not leaning toward the bad.  
 
There is a deep satisfaction in being willing  to be with  
what is happening , and say, “I am here  in a clear,  open, 
present  way to take a good look , to experience this part 
of life , and then find my way through  that to whatever is 
next.” The discovery of the deeper satisfaction comes 
from really giving time to what is happening , from not 
being in a hurry  to fix it , or make it better in order to 
make yourself feel good again . 
 
As you practice here this morning, you might consider 
what your orientation is , and how  often you  may be – 
subconsciously  even  – inclining or measuring yourself  
or feeling f rustrated  around this whole complex of 
feeling good, pleasure, or pain.  Can you discover  some 
deep inner sense of satisfaction of how right  it feels just 
to be present  for what is  as it is ? There is some freedom  
in being  able to do that.   
 
And I hope you enjoy the day – even if it’s not good.
