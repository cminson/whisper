 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Opening to how you are in this moment, arriving with yourself, remembering the intention for this time to be present with whatever is happening, with some interest, interest in what this experience is as a human experience. Just a simple experience of sitting right now, aware and sitting. And remembering, relaxation supports this capacity we have, this very natural capacity we have to be with experience, to be aware. It's a human capacity that we all have. And yet with our practice we are encouraged to have that awareness be simply interested in this moment, not what it can do for me or how I can get something or get rid of something, but just what is this experience, more like a naturalist might be in nature. What's this that's arising right now? What's here? And curious. And relaxation supports that capacity to be present and curious. So supporting relaxation perhaps with consciously scanning through the body and relaxing areas where you may notice tension. Perhaps the head and face can relax. Maybe the neck and shoulders can relax. The arms, the hands. All the muscles around the rib cage, the chest and upper back. Maybe a deeper breath might support relaxation in that area. All of the area across the stomach and abdomen, sometimes there's some subconscious kind of holding there, kind of habitual tension. So can that area relax? Middle and lower back, the hips relax. Legs, feet. Maybe two more deeply inside the body. There can be a softening. Maybe the inside of the throat can relax. Maybe the heart can relax. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. This is more of an invitation. We often don't know how to relax that area, but sometimes if we just check in with the invitation, maybe, maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. We'll feel a softening in that area. There may be a relaxation, but not always. So just be available if it's possible, if it's available to relax. And perhaps too, the mind can relax. Perhaps using the analogy that Gil sometimes offers to relax the mind, as if the brain were a muscle, maybe the brain can relax. And again, more of an invitation. Maybe the brain can relax. As the body and mind soften and relax a little bit, this capacity to recognize the present moment experience becomes more available. And so turning to that possibility of what's here in this moment, recognizing that there is awareness, even though it might not be obvious how you know that, just recognizing, yep, there's awareness. And what is awareness naturally already aware of? Relaxing. You don't have to find it. It's kind of like we let experience come to us. Awareness will be aware of something. Let's relax and see if that can be revealed. Sometimes it's the obvious sensations of the body that are easily available. The experience of sitting or breathing. Or particular sensations in the body. Pressure, contact points of hands or feet. As I name areas, you may just naturally notice them and that's the way conditioning works, that's the way the mind works. As I name the areas, you might notice, for instance, a breath. And perhaps it's easy to notice a breath when I say that, oh, there can be a breath. There can be the recognition of body sensation, maybe a broader sense of the body sitting. Or perhaps hearing is what's happening for you, hearing the sound of my voice or sounds in your environment. And maybe there's a kind of a blending or interweaving between body and sound. We don't have to try to hold on to any particular experience. Awareness may shift from one experience to another, a little while with the breath and then with the sound, and then a body sensation, another breath. It may feel like awareness is shifting from one experience to another, kind of like a lens or a spotlight picking up on one thing and then another. Or it might feel more broad, like a wide angle lens taking in a landscape. Maybe there's body sensations, feeling like many things happening at the same time and hearing too. That can be the way it feels, the way it seems it's happening. We don't have to try to make it seem otherwise. Just receiving. What does experience, what is experience like right now? Aware of what is obvious. Relax and receive. We also might at times be aware of moods or thoughts, emotions. Thoughts will often slip in under the radar and carry us away. But it is possible to be aware. A thought has arisen. Just as it's possible to be aware, a sound has arisen. There's a thought happening. And then a body sensation and then a sound. Yet at some point the thoughts will carry us away, something will carry us out of the present moment, we'll forget about being aware. This too is quite natural for our minds, very habitual to forget about mindfulness. And equally, naturally, there will be a moment when mindfulness returns. That moment. We often think, I'm lost, but in that moment we are already aware again. If we come aware that mindfulness has re-arisen, that we weren't mindful a moment ago when we are now, that's what's actually happening in that moment. And so can you be curious about what's here in the moment when mindfulness returns? It's useful to be very curious and open in that moment because quite often things have happened when our mind wandered, that we'll have created something that wasn't so obvious before the mind wandered. And so if we're open and available, we might see that new thing that has been created. It might be a reactivity of some kind if our mind wandered off into a confusion or reaction. And really useful to notice if what's happening as mindfulness returns is connected with some kind of a hindrance. No wanting and not wanting. But sometimes when mindfulness returns, and more often than you might think, after the mind has wandered, sometimes what has been shaped as the mind wanders is a little more relaxed. More relaxation, more ease. And so that's sometimes available to be recognized in that moment that mindfulness returns. Mindfulness itself can be curious about whatever is here. Mindfulness. Wise mindfulness doesn't judge what's here, it just reflects and is interested. Oh, this is what's happening right now. Relax. Remembering relaxation supports this capacity to be mindful, to be aware. And receive. Relax and receive. What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? What's here? dime, and others to do
