The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood

There. Okay, so hello and welcome everyone. Welcome to this rendition of
Happy Hour. It's lovely to be with you, to feel your presence from so many
different time zones joining these different mediums, different media.
So, so for today's Happy Hour practice session together, I'd like to
invite us to engage with the practice of, of, of Mudita in the form of
appreciation. So what is Mudita for those of you who may not be familiar with
the term Mudita, the poly word for vicarious joy. So basically turning
towards joy, whether it's joy for our own goodness and blessings or, or the
gifts of other people. So it's, it's a way to really just relax, relax and
savor goodness, relax and savor goodness. And the gift of this practice is
especially important because our minds tend to gravitate towards challenges,
towards dukkha, towards trauma, towards what's hard, what's difficult. Ouch! And in
order to me, in order to feel resourced, to remember, yes, there is goodness here.
There's so much goodness here. This practice allows us to open up to
goodness in our lives, to goodness in our lives and the lives of others,
especially when there is difficulty, especially when there's difficulty in
our lives and when there's difficulty in the world. It's not a way to, to put our
heads in the sand, not at all. It's not scapism, but the way to open the heart, to
really fill up our fear of experience with, with the fullness of life, with the
fullness of life. So, so we've practiced joy, opening to joy, gratitude, look at the
different ways. And tonight I want to get into it actually slightly differently,
differently than I usually guide it, because as you know, I always like to,
to invite, explore in different ways and invite you to explore your heart, your
mind, these, these spaces through different entry ways, because as we enter
through different doors, we end up in different chambers of the heart, like, oh
wow, I didn't know this was possible. As many of you have shared and reported as
we try different doors, different windows, not always the same thing, but
just creativity, this practice of the Brahma Viharas, the heavenly abodes, which
metta, loving kindness, and with Ditta, vicarious joy and gratitude are a part of
our creative practices, our really creative practices to, to plant seeds. And, and if
you happen to be new to this practice, what I like to say is, whatever arises is
okay, don't feel like you're a failure just because you cannot generate joy or
you cannot connect with gratitude and, and in order to be successful at the
practice, it doesn't work like that. It does not. As long as you turn towards
whatever arises with kindness, even towards difficulty with appreciation, I'll
talk more about this because it's like, what is she talking about towards
difficulty with appreciation, but it can become available. Then you're doing the
practice right. Then the practice you're planting seeds, it doesn't have to look a
particular way. In fact, this, this practice amazes us, it surprises us in
ways that opens us to the dimensionality of our humanity in ways we don't quite
know ourselves. We take ourselves to be this limited, little two dimensional
being, and then these practices open up our heart to so much possibility. So let
yourself be surprised. So, so I wouldn't say more about how we're going to enter
so that we just enter through a different path today, maybe. And whatever
arises again, turn towards it with kindness. It's all okay. So I think I
have said enough to set the stage. So I would like to invite us all now to
enter into our meditation posture, landing, landing in this body. And if
you need to lie down or stand, the different postures that Buddha has
taught, that's perfectly fine. If you're sitting for a moment, maybe move your
shoulders, move back and forth, reconnect with this body, see what this body
needs. And land in your sit bones, land with your feet, land with your breath,
breath in the abdomen, breath in the abdomen. Let it be received. And breath
in the abdomen. And just spending a few minutes being settled, connecting,
letting your awareness connect with your body, your feet on the ground. As if your
breath is moving through your feet, into the earth, connecting, deeply rooting,
feeling the sensations of your hands on your lap, releasing, relaxing. In your
bottom on the cushion, releasing the weight of your upper body under your
sit bones.
And as thoughts arise, as they will inevitably arise, it's okay.
See if you can attend to them, know them. Not with judgment, but
appreciative. This mind, this brain works. Thinking is happening. Oh, thinking
about this. And then with kindness, with a smile, saying thank you and not now. I
appreciate you. Please come back later.
Let's just settle, settle in the body and relax. Nothing to do, nothing to
accomplish in this moment, nothing at all, nothing. No doing. Just let the body,
the heart relax. Just be breathed, taking refuge in the simplicity of doing
nothing.
And can you enjoy, just really enjoy having no agenda right now, no agenda, and just to
enjoy being in its mysterious simplicity?
Just opening your awareness to joy, delight.
What's nourishing in the body, in the heart, maybe you feel some buzzing in your body.
Maybe with each out breath, there is more letting go and settling.
No nourishing contentment.
Sometimes we forget what it's like to just sit contentedly, always need to do to accomplish to be
even when it comes to the Dharma, to the practice.
Radical, radical simplicity of letting go.
It's like a free fall where there is nothing to fall onto.
It's safe.
Just enjoy.
Enjoy the release.
Thank you.
The thoughts arise.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Ah, is this right?
Simply smile and release.
No need to believe all the thoughts.
You are doing it right, whatever doing there is in this non-doing.
Release and open your heart to enjoy.
Providing all the flowers, the birds, the deer to come to the watering hole.
Wait, wait long enough they will show up.
The bird song of the breath, maybe you notice it's enjoyable.
A sense of heaviness in your body after a while.
Wow, how nice.
Be patient, release and enjoy.
As we wait long enough, our attention becomes more subtle.
You can take a while.
Be patient.
Release and enjoy.
There is so much.
It will become clear.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
At the beginning we put more emphasis on the release.
There are more thoughts, more doing, wanting, release and enjoy.
And when you notice your heart has settled into refuge in this moment,
then open wider to enjoy.
When we look, when we perceive through the lens of enjoyment,
we notice more joy that we hadn't noticed before.
Maybe the sensations of the breath.
A particular way to go to a place becomes a source of joy and enjoyment.
Or sensations in the body or sound.
Or maybe there is nothing and that nothingness
becomes a source of contentment and joy and ease.
Your mind, your heart can enjoy.
What is subtle more than you give yourself credit?
Open up to that possibility.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Relax and receive the joy of the present moment.
Relax, release and receive the joy of the present moment.
Relax and receive the joy of the present moment.
Relax and receive the joy.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
You can stay in this subtle present moment embodied presence.
Treating the subtle contentment with the subtle.
What is?
If you like, you may drop in, still in this subtlety, but like a dropper that picks up a drop of color.
Drop in one goodness, one blessing in your life and let it reverberate.
Maybe it's friends, family, health, roof over your head, something that's personal to you.
Drop it in this reflection.
Not to think about it, but drop it into your body and let yourself savor, enjoy.
Take delight in.
See your heart fully open in this goodness and this blessing.
Relax.
Relax.
Now you can drop another dropper full of something else, another drop, another blessing.
Let it be appreciated, enjoyed.
Relax.
Not thinking about it, feeling embodied, just relishing this goodness.
Maybe now another dropper, another drop of something else, another goodness in your life, drop it into your body.
Relax.
Now as we've been taking this dropper, taking a drop of our own life's blessings, and now take a drop.
It's the drop of color from someone you care about, the blessing in their life, something good in their life.
And drop that drop of color into your sphere of experience.
Let yourself savor, appreciate, be happy for, enjoy.
Their blessing, their cause for happiness, as if it were your own.
Let yourself feel it in your body, in your heart.
Your body relaxed, released, just enjoying your heart savoring this deliciousness of this goodness, as if it were your own.
Relax.
And not every aspect of their life may be happy or blessed, but this one drop.
Now another drop, same person or another person in your life.
Drop it into your heart, this blessing that let yourself relish in an embodied way.
Relax.
Relax.
Maybe for example, this person is enjoying sports and it's very athletic.
As you drop the joy of the sports in your body or heart, as if it's your joy, your body feels a light with gladness, appreciation, happiness, energized.
As if it were your own.
Relax.
Relax.
As we bring this practice period to a close, let there be appreciation in your heart and your body, contentment for whatever arose or did not arise.
And if there was one moment of goodness and appreciation, yay, planting wholesome seeds, gratitude, appreciation, offering our goodness, offering our gladness as a gift of generosity to all beings everywhere.
May all beings everywhere know to savor, to appreciate, to delight in the goodness in their lives and those of others.
May all beings everywhere be happy and free, including ourselves.
Relax.
Thank you all.
Thank you for your goodness, for your practice.
We have some time. If you'd like to share reflections, you'd like to raise your hand to share a reflection of what came up for you, maybe something new you're welcome to.
You can type it in chat. If you type it to me privately, I won't read your name.
You can type it to everyone. I'll read your name.
Yeah, what was this like for you?
Any aha moments, any challenges, any gifts? Don, I see your hand, please.
Nikki, thanks so much. It was really interesting. I was pondering, enjoying, I'll call it suffering or pain, and I was just, that's a slippery one for me.
And every once in a while I sort of go, oh, that's really interesting. That's really cool to sort of just seeing a pure or feeling pure sensation.
But it's tough. And I was just curious kind of your, your reflections on, you know, observing difficulty.
Yeah, yeah. Sir, appreciate you bringing that up. And don't mute yourself just yet, darling. I see something here. I'll say more about what I mean. And yet, I think there's something very important here that you're raising from your own experience.
It feels like something opens up for you in the way of, oh, actually, there's maybe there's gratitude or, or, or openness to Dukas, to suffering seen a different way.
And then it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, this is slippery slope. This is not safe. This is not okay. Is that how it's showing up? Or actually, let me hear from your words.
Oh, this slippery part is it just reverts to suffering. The sort of, excuse me, sort of, I'm not, I'm not sure it even makes any sense, but just sort of observing the pure sensation and is sort of, yeah, I can enjoy that.
And, and sometimes it's suffering or it could be pleasure. But in the case of suffering, oftentimes it just reverse to, oh, wow, this is really painful. And, and so there isn't that, that joy.
And, and I heard at one point you mentioned that it would sort of be patient. And, and yeah, that's the part that's like, oh, okay, how patient do I need to be?
Right, right, right. Yeah. So, so very interesting. So what I'm hearing in your own experience, it seems like maybe, and also sounds like you're talking about physical pain, because there's so many different types of suffering, but you're talking about physical pain.
It sounds like both physical and mental.
And maybe there is a moment of opening up to, oh, to seeing perhaps a different perspective on suffering and then reverts back. So, so, so I think what I mean by that, again, it's this is not, it's not meant to be, it's not at all a masochistic way of enjoying pain.
It's not that at all. It's furthest from that. So I just want to say that at the very beginning. But what, what it is, is that our perspective can shift our perspective to what, what we take to be reality or experience, what's good, what's bad.
It can shift. And sometimes it can be surprising. And there can even be the sense of, and maybe one way that's easier to see that sometimes not enjoying suffering, but maybe the word gratitude for suffering.
I think that might be more present for people that might be the way to enter not so much enjoying it. So I'll drop that for now, because that that's a little could be more obtuse or weird. But let's let's work with with appreciation for suffering.
And that I think that can be more accessible. Because sometimes you can actually see the goodness, you can, you can see the bright, the silver lining in the suffering that's that's intertwined with it. So there's a sense of gratitude for it.
Because of this, there is that. And yet sometimes the perspective shifts so much that it's not just the silver lining, but it's like, wow, even suffering, this is grace to be human, to have the choice to even have the sorrows.
This is, this is amazing. This is grace. The mind, the heart can open to that perspective. And, and yet don't push it. Just knowing that that can be available.
That, that can be possibility. Does that, does that help, Don?
Yeah, thank you.
Great. Thank you so much for bringing that in.
Any other reflections before we turn to practicing community.
Anything else that opened up for you today in this way of getting into this practice of Mudita from a very different way. I'm really curious about that. If you notice the, there just relax and releasing and enjoying and then just drop her full of your own enjoyment then drop her full
of somebody else's enjoyment into your life like, wow, this is another way to feel, feel joy for others, joys.
Marie-Christine, oh my goodness, I see you in Bodhi, Bodhi.
Bodhis, all of a sudden very loving, joyously licking your face.
I don't know how to do that, just talk.
Sharing your joy, Marie-Christine, I love it.
Thanks for your joy. Is it that the suffering gives us, are we grateful because the suffering opens an opportunity to explore? Is that what you're saying?
Or are some understood?
Yeah, I think that's the first stage of it. I think that's what I'm talking about. That's the first stage that that can be more accessible for people that it's through the suffering that a lot of growth.
And there's so many studies about post-traumatic growth, et cetera, that we wouldn't be the people we are if it wasn't for the challenges we have in our life.
So that's an easier accessible. So yes, I'm saying that and I'm saying another level to that, which is above and beyond that.
Thank you from Bodhi and I.
Thanks to both you and Bodhi. Oh, so sweet.
You got so cute.
Any other reflections? A quick one, perhaps.
Again, how this different way might have affected you, impacted you entering this metaphor of the dropper full of appreciation for your own or somebody else's.
I don't share since I don't see any hands or rich reflections. I mean, for me, again, this is another way to get into it and it's instead of going into like imagine somebody else's happiness and feel happy for them.
This really brings it home. This really brings it in this embodiment of happiness, joy for ourselves, delight, appreciation.
For them, it's just such a physical and and what I was sharing at the end, for example, imagining what came up in my mind was someone that I know who's very physically active with sports and and just imagine taking a dropper full of their energy and their joy to all these sports and dropping
it like, oh, yes, it's as if it's my own. There's such a sense of embodied appreciation, embodied muddita, vicarious joy, which is different from a heady appreciation.
That's what I was hoping you would you would tap into. That's my hope for how very much that was possible. Anyway.
So, dear ones, let's turn to to holding each other with with detail with appreciation with with with joy, and I will create the practice discussion rooms.
Another couple of people invitation always is to just share from your own experience. And the next person will share from theirs will say past just hold space. You don't want to speak that's fine holding kind space for each other.
And then the next person then comes back to you, you'll go around and around a few times, it will be short monologue each person, not into no interruptions asking questions just sharing from your own experience, not facilitating the group either just showing
up, letting other people show up in whichever way is safe and comfortable for them, and holding each other with kindness.
So, tonight you're invited to say if you like something about how this practice was for you, maybe something that you're grateful for it is the dropper full for of your life or somebody else's life that brought you the sense of gladness.
Opening the rooms, take care of yourselves, take care of each other. Here we go.
Okay, all the rooms are closed everybody's back. And any final last quick reflections before we close the urgent anything that you like to say to feel complete.
Okay, going once. Mario Christine, make it quick. Thank you. Could we explore this topic a bit further next time, please?
Yeah, yes, I think it'll be explored at some point. Yes, it may not be next time, but yes, I appreciate it.
Mario Christine, take good care. Well, thank you all. Thank you so much for your practice for showing up for cultivating your own goodness for your own sake and the sake of all those whose lives you touch may all beings be well, may all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thanks everyone. No.
