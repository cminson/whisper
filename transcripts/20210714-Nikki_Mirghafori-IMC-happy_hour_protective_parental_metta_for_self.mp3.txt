 So okay, there. So hi, hello and formally, welcome to happy hour. Now that it's being recorded for audio drama. So so for the theme of our practice together today, like to invite us to explore in another dimension of meta, which is fierce meta is fierce is energetic. meta can feel soft and soothing and tender and calming. And they can also feel fear she can also feel strong and energetic. They're different ways and, and, for example, in the metta sutta, in the metta sutta, in the line where it says, even as a mother protects with her life, her child, her only child, so the boundless heart should one cherish all living beings radiating kindness over the entire world. So I want to bring your attention to this metaphor. Even as a mother protects with her life, her child, her only child. So that that image of a mother protecting her child, to me, that can also bring up well, with metaphors, of course, there are a lot of different things that metaphors can can bring up and and refer to and conjure up. One thing that this metaphor can conjure up is the fierceness. If a mother is protecting her only child with her life, her life, I suspect there will be a sense of fierceness is that love it's the love is big, it's huge, it's powerful. And there's a fierceness about it. So can we conjure up that same sense of love for ourselves for the only child? That is us, our inner child, the child that we take for granted, we we beat up usually are not good enough, you're not working hard enough, not not not this being that is us. What if we had the sense of energetic, powerful, this mother protecting with her life, her child, her only child. So both the sense of love, mental care, being profound, but also the sense of fierceness, it's there's a strength to this powerfulness. There's a powerfulness to this love, a powerfulness. Can we explore that for ourselves? What does that feel like? If we explore that for ourselves, does that bring us more energy, more aliveness, more recognition of our true nature of the goodness within? So let's explore, let's explore together and see what we discover in this way of practice, being scientists of our own mind. So with that as the preamble, let's settle, let's arrive. Landing, landing, arriving. And this body in this moment in time with a sense of uprightness, whether you're sitting or lying down, can there be a sense of uprightness, a sense of integrity in the spine and the body posture? So noticing perhaps that you're uplifted, uplifted vertebrae by vertebrae as if there is an invisible string connected to the top of your head, giving you an uplift. You don't have to try, you don't have to force. In fact, your body can relax, your muscles can settle in this sense of integrity, this uprightness is maintained on its own with this invisible string. Your bones uplifted energetically, the breath, the aspiration uplifting you. While connected and deeply rooted in the earth to the earth, feeling the touch points of your feet, your legs, your sit bones, your bottom, the bottom connected earth deeply rooted as if you both have wings uplifted and you have roots deep into the ground. And the breath nourishing, nourishing the natural breath, uplifting, energizing, energizing especially around your heart center, your chest, the middle of your chest, and laboring awakening, both awakening and soothing healing at the same time. Both energized and calmed in this moment, rooted and uplifted with the breath. The earth element rooting, connecting, settling the air element uplifting. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Settling and arriving. A few more minutes before we turn our attention to Nitta. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now continuing to feel embodied, connected to the earth, rooted to the earth, feet, sit bones, legs, while uplifted, the spine uplifted, open with aspiration, both figuratively and literally aspiration, the breath, the filling, the body, energizing. Now bringing to mind if you would, if felt sense and image of yourself, of this being that is you, at a younger age, any age is fine. Might be that there is a photograph or an age that you can really connect to, to parent, to re-parent this younger version of ourselves, to protect, to love, to care for. Bringing this image, this felt sense, of connecting, taking time to connect in ways that work for you, in loving ways that work for you. Maybe you have a vivid image of a photograph, or how this child moves, talks, maybe plays with their favorite toys or activities, whatever it might be, connecting, connecting, conjuring up their image, and as if, just as it is said in the Metta Supta, even as a mother protects with her life, her child, her only child, as if this child, this younger version of you, in this moment in time, is your child, your only child, to love, to protect, to cherish, to soothe, to comfort, and as the mother, as the parent, as the parent of this child, as the parent, you have more resources, you're stronger, you're capable, as you breathe in, you feel, the energizing of the heart center, your heart with care, compassion, love, energy, both a tender and fierce love for this child, protective, protective. Connecting at first with image, with felt sense, holding, protecting, sense of uprightness and energy, strength, fierceness, and Especially if the child is hurting in some way. Whether it's hurt, or maybe ill. If that feels relevant. And feeling your strength. The strength and the power of your love, your metta. This body well rooted into the earth. Your breath energizing and holding caring for this child. In this moment, your only child. You are the only one. Radiating metta, radiating. Using fears, loving metta. Protective, protective loving metta. You are the only one. And if you'd like to add phrases of metta, you're welcome to. Or use your own phrases. I'll offer some alternatives. The traditional, typical phrases of metta. May you be safe from inner and outer harm. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you have ease. Or alternatively, I love you. I care for you, I'm here for you. Thank you. You are loved. You are cherished. You are okay. You are beloved. Whatever phrases work for you. To share. To shine your protective, fierce parental metta. For this younger self. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Continue with your younger self. Or see if your mind, your heart would like to treat yourself, your present-day self, as your child, your only child. No difference. See what your heart and mind need in this moment. And if you do choose to move to your present-day self, try the phrases of metta if you wish with I. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I have ease. It can also stay with you. Feel free to experiment. See what works for you. Expression of fears. Energetic metta for yourself. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And what if the one loving and being loved, the fierce, powerful, metta-filled parent and the child, the self, are one and the same? They melt, they merge. What if? See what might arise. Thank you. This bright light of fear, metta, shining outwards, it touches you first, it shines out, touching. All those you care for, all those you know and you don't know. Radiating, radiating kindness over the entire world. Spreading upwards to the skies and downwards to the depths, outwards and unbounded. Thank you. Thank you. May all beings wake up to their true nature. May all beings be free. Thank you. Thank you for your practice, everyone. So, we have a few minutes for reflections. You can either type them in chat, like you discovered, like you noticed, questions, comments, or raise your hand. Bill, please. Hello. Hi. I got tripped up over the word fierce and it just raised connotations in my mind and it's like once I started to think about that, I couldn't put it down again. And so I didn't do that well. Without making this too long a story, I think in one of earlier sessions you said that you could have metta in terms of like falling asleep and calming. And I related that I did not experience that because of a level of excitement. For us, my mind indicates intensity, excitement, and therefore not sleep. I'm sorry, my mind has hung up on this, but I just can't get past that. Sorry. Yeah, so what I'm hearing is a couple of things. One is that the word fierce was you have connotations with it and the mind got tripped up with that. So with that, what I would suggest is use a word that works for you, Bill. See what works for you. Protective. I was trying to offer some alternatives. Protective. This protective loving image. If that works for you, use that. So tune out the word fierce. And also what I'm hearing is that that brought up some energy for you. So if you sometimes fall asleep with the very tender, soothing, calm, gentle, easeful metta, this was an energizing. So part of that, you're chucking up the energizing to the confusion of the fears. And also part of it could be that this practice, and I'd love to hear from others, is more energizing. Is really awakening. This is not the type of metta that makes you fall asleep. It's really enlivens you. You feel powerfully loving. And so that's the aspect I think you're talking about, right? I think so. So you're saying there's different types of metta. Yes, that's exactly what I'm trying to say. Not all metta needs to be sleep inducing. That's exactly right. Okay, I'm good. Thank you. That's exactly right. We were exploring a different kind of metta tonight. That's exactly it. It's a feat. Well, if you don't like the word fears, it's an energetic, energizing, protective, powerful metta. Maybe the word powerful. A parent that's really lovingly powerful, like a lioness. Powerful, loving. Yeah, that's exactly it. Bill, you got it. You got it. You're welcome. You're so welcome. So let's see. I see reflection. I see Fred's hand. I'll ask you to unmute in the moment here. Yes, there. While I also read from Nicholas, was metta for an intentional pun or did I miss here? Oh my God, that's hilarious. That was not intentional, but I love it. Metta for, I love it. Metta for, that's good. That's good. Nicholas. Good catch. Neil says that was lovely. That image of loving and protecting my younger self was so dear. Oh, that is so touching. Thank you. Thank you for that. That is dear. That is dear, Neil. Thanks for sharing that. And friendly greetings from Ireland, from Gergel. Thank you, Nikki and Sangha. So nice you're joining. Gergel and Graham also, and Tulip and others, Roel for joining from Belgium. We have a parallel Sangha joining us on YouTube. Very sweet. So please, Fred. I found that very powerful. I was able to envision myself as a teenager with real clarity. And perhaps because I had just finished walking around like Merritt with an old friend that I knew as a teenager. We sort of rekindled a friendship during the pandemic. But I could see myself as he probably saw me when we were kids. And I was able to embrace that self with all the parental energy that I would want to bring to it. Not particularly fierce. That didn't really feel quite the word, but adult and protective. And I could feel my younger self confident in the embrace of my older self and getting a lot of solace from my presence and advice and encouragement. Thank you, Fred. I am so touched and buoyed by that. Ah, beautiful. Thank you. And protective. I appreciate this. This trust, this trust of this this protective parental care and love that you connected with a name. Thank you. Yeah. Great. That's great. So. Okay. Lovely. Lovely. Oh, girl says this fierce lioness locos nicely with my Latin blood Brazilian in Ireland here. Oh, that's sweet. I love all these met meta force as though as Nicholas pointed out. I love it. Oh, dear ones, let's turn to practice in small groups together with this protective loving, energetic, energetic meta. I think that's what I'm trying to really tune into. And for me, there is this sense of really feeling awakened energized. There's this powerful meta that that can shine onto the world from this practice. The other practice, too, from the gentle soft what Bill was calling kind of like the sleepy method. I like to call it the gentle method, but also this this this energetic meta can also be very powerful. This power, this kindness radiating over the earth. So just tuning into these different frequencies. It's not one thing. It's not one thing. Let us surprise ourselves by the capacity of the human heart and mind every time we practice meta. Instead of just doing the same thing, may you be happy, maybe healthy. Let us surprise ourselves with just this capacity, this humanity. So so with that, let's join each other and explore and speak about what we discovered, support each other in this exploration, in this experiment of being human. Sangha practice is so precious. So creating the rooms now and let's start with 15 seconds of silent meta. OK, all right, here we go. We've got a couple. We have a couple of minutes for reflections. What did you discover practicing together, especially in Sangha? If you haven't reflected, commented in a while, you're especially welcome to share your reflections. So what did you notice? What worked? What was challenging? It's all good sharing your practice for the benefit of the Sangha. And if you want to raise your zoom hand, that's better option because I won't see your physical hand if you raise it. Oh, Jerry says I like my adult life much better than my childhood. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And it's and it's wonderful to be able to reparent ourselves in this way. Yeah, it's it's very powerful practice, actually, this protective parenting, reparenting, very powerful. We can fill our own cup and hence not need others to do that. Bill says same same for me, Jerry. Marianne says my 13 year old self was very happy to get the attention. Oh, that's sweet. And Sue Jung. I just want to share that I was able to revisit the moment that I was so scared. And when I was young and when I was a child that I really wanted to have some someone who's protected me, but I never had it. Maybe I had it some point, but most of the time my son and I wasn't able to go back that moment. And I was just parenting myself, which is I was doing it before. But this time was like, oh, my gosh, it's just like such a crap practice. It was just precious moment. And I actually share with one of those in a small group and the other person also share his experience. And I just want that person's child, like when it was child, I really wanted to hug that person, that kid so much. And it just brings me a tears. Yeah, thank you for sharing that, Sue Jung. Yeah, both reflections. One is that how powerful it is to actually to connect to these tender moments in our past when we wanted protection and to even going. It feels like going back in time and offering that to ourselves and also being able to see the child in each other. There's something precious and beautiful that the heart opens up the heart opens up as you're talking, you wanted to hug the younger version of this person. Yeah, beautiful. Thank you. Thank you for that. Yeah. And Morgan says, protective meta could be a way to fight back from self judgments imposed by society. For example, internalized isms. Yes, yes. Right on, Morgan. Yeah. Very, very astute observation. This is really powerful practice for self judgment, because there's the sense of protective ourselves protecting this part of us that's, oh, that's hurting. So, very powerful practice, very powerful practice. I have more questions for you, but it is seven o'clock. So let's end. Let's end. And as I always like to end by thanking you for your practice. Thank you for showing up and cultivating your heart, your mind for the benefit of yourself and all beings everywhere. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free. Thank you all.
