Dharmette : Expectations

One of the areas of the mind that is interesting to give 
attention to is how the mind is capable of having 
expectations. Expectations are believing that something 
is going to happen and then waiting for it to happen. 
There are many kinds of expectations that people can 
have. We can expect things to go wrong or come out 
badly, or we ca n expect that things will turn out the way 
we want them to be , and to be looking forward to it and 
anticipating it in a nice way. The  problem with 
expectations is that sometimes if we really want a 
certain outcome and it doesn’t happen, then we can be 
very disappointed. There can be a lot of grief . 
 
It’s a common phenomenon for people to have an 
expectation of an outcome in meditation – to go on 
retreat and have an expectation of an outcome, and be 
disappointed that it didn’t turn out the way that they 
want ed. And  when we are  living t hrough the lens of 
expectation, i t limits us , like having blinders on. It limits 
our ability to really see what is happening. Everything is 
measured through what is supposed to be happening . 
And sometimes a meditation ret reat has all kinds of 
blessings  and wonderful things can unfold , but we don’t see them because we’re so focused on our narrow little 
window of expectation, of what’s supposed to happen , 
or what we want to happen, or what we believe should 
happen.  
 
A common inst ruction when you meditate or go on 
meditation retreats is to not have any expectations, but 
rather to trust the pro cess – to show up and be mindful 
of what is, and  to let it show itself : to be with what is 
going happen , rather than expecting anything in 
particular. I think that’s a useful thing for life in general  – 
to be very careful with expectation s and our attachment 
to them,  because sometimes expectations can really 
derail us and cause problems.  
 
Another place that expectations can be problematic is if  
we expect people to behave in undesirable ways – for 
example , someone treated us badly today , so we 
expect them to treat us badly , and so we’re kind of 
prejudice d in our approach to them and don’t give them 
the benefit of the doubt , or see where they are now. Or 
they have treated us well yesterday , and so we expect 
that now. W e’re tuned to get ting more of the same , and , 
who knows, maybe they have  a headache today and 
they just don’t have the bandwidth to notice that we ’re 
alive, but we ’ve got this expectat ion. The fact that now 
they don’t treat us nicely stands out and is highlighted; it 
becomes much more of a big deal. We can go through 
life with a lot of expectations, a lot of beliefs about what should happen, what is going to happen , and it can trip 
us up quite a bit.  
 
So, is the solution to have no expectations at all? I don’t 
think that is realistic. There are simple , innocent 
expe ctations that are predictions. I e xpect can be the 
same as I predict , as when there’s a seventy percen t 
chance it will  be sunny tomorrow , and so you expect it 
to be sunny. In your mind, you’ve translated it as 
predicting.  
 
The important thing for people who do mindfulness 
practice is to be able to s ee expectations as they 
operate:  to recognize them, ident ify them , and learn to 
recognize if we’re attached to them . And if there’s an 
over-involvement in expectation , does this put blinders 
on us? Are we depending on things to work out a 
certain way? Are we resisting certain outcomes? What 
is our relationship t o it? 
 
To see it is very important because it’s probably not 
possible to live without expectations . But here’s an 
approach to life th at can make things a lot easier. I think 
for people who practice mindfulness or being really 
present here and now , we have  expectations for sure, 
but we should expect anything – anything at all. Expect 
the unexpected to happen.  
 
You’ll leave here after this sitting , and you could be drivin g your car and you get a flat ti re: “Oh, of course!”  
[laughs] Expect anything – of cour se! You sit and 
meditate , and your mind has a mind of its own;  it picks 
up thoughts, concerns and emotions, and the  body 
aches in ways you’ve never ached before , so you say 
“Of course.” Y ou expect anything.  
 
If you can expect anything , then it lets a cert ain kind of 
ease in to your mind. T hen maybe you’re not resisting, 
or depending on a particular thing , but rather you’re 
expecting anything . It’s a kind of openness and 
relaxation, a willingness to receive into your own 
awareness what is actually happening.  Then we can 
decide what to do about it or how to respond to it .  
 
But the genesis, the beginning , is the place where our 
responses and actions to the world occur  – in how we 
receive things into our awareness. If our attention can 
stay relaxed and open , then we can receive whatever is 
happening in a way that enables us to be much more 
effective in coming up with a response to deal with it.  
So, when you sit to meditate, I encourage you to expect 
everything and a nything – just whatever happens. L et it 
be, “Oh, this too.”   
 
Of course , you can’t plan what’s going to happen. More 
could happen tha n you could ever  think about , but just 
have a blank check to expect everything and anything . 
So whatever comes , it’s “Oh, ok, ” and then continue from there in the wise st way you can, depending on 
what it is. Use your mind’s capacity to h ave 
expectations to expect well. A nd you expect well if you 
expect anything.  
 
 Thank you .
