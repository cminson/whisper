 So as our time of practice continues, allowing yourself to settle in, touching into the energetic sensations of the breath in the body, allowing that to be the home for the mind. Sensing into the whole body. With the mind that is whole. With the mind that is whole. And allowing the mind to be touched by the simple joy of presence. It's good to be here. With whatever is here. Inviting tranquility. Gently stepping back from entanglement with any agitation that may be present. As air is to the natural well-being, stillness. Joy and calm have a natural resonance, each supporting the other. Their energies are different, but they have a common source. Like the in and the out breath, different but intimately connected. Joy and calm have a natural resonance, each supporting the other. Joy and calm have a natural resonance, each supporting the other. Joy and calm have a natural resonance, each supporting the other.

So we're moving now into a longer break. And for those in some time zones, it's lunchtime. But even if it's not your meal time, you'll have a meal sometime. So I wanted to say a bit about calm and joy in daily life activities, like cooking and eating. The Zen Master Dogen wrote a text called Instructions for the Cook in 1237 in Japan. And it's about using cooking as a medium for spiritual practice, meaning for embodying the Dharma. So I'm taking some inspiration from a commentary that was written in the 20th century on that text. It's called How to Cook Your Life. There are many wonderful principles illustrated in the book. And I'll read just one for now, which is to pour all your life energy into your everyday work is called Joyful Mind. So you can sense that this doesn't have much to do with the regular pleasure or happiness that's defined kind of conventionally by society. Instead, it has, to my ear, at least kind of a completeness that feels satisfying in a different way, just to pour all your life energy into your everyday work and to call that Joyful Mind. So we may arrive in the kitchen to do our lunchtime practice. And, you know, we could just say, all right, now I'm going to get all stirred up. I was so much enjoying that sitting, but okay. Or it's possible to just with complete composure, open the refrigerator, pull out a few things, get out the cutting board or a pan, whatever's needed. And just be right there with that. Just with the bell pepper that we're chopping up, or with the soup. And to not have a need for the mind to be straying off into what's going to happen next or the thing I forgot to do before signing on this morning. Just be with what's unfolding. Or if the mind is running off and wanting to be distracted. That's kind of interesting too. We can pour our life energy into feeling a busy mind. Wow, I'm so conditioned to start thinking, well I cook, I wonder if I do that all the time. That's interesting. There's a way to be with that also with ease and joy. One thing illustrated in the broader context of this text is that there's really no fixed recipe for human life. It's much more in the process. The stories have available the joy of mindfulness this subtle, somewhat subtle joy of being in the present moment. Even if it's unpleasant. And even if it's pleasant being present with that without letting it ramp us up. Just that simple joy. It's like this right now it's like this. Tranquility doesn't necessarily mean that we're moving very slowly. We could move at whatever pace feels like it goes with pouring our life energy into our work. The insight teacher Greg Sharp says that we can move at the speed of mindfulness. I think that very much because it includes some self awareness. Now what is the right speed for the way my mind is right now. Is it moving at nearly a normal pace. Being right there for it. With joy. Or if the mind is feeling very calm somewhat sensitive. Yes moving very slowly. Feeling the coolness of the refrigerator handle as we open it. That's what feels joyful. There's a whole world in cooking and eating that I usually breeze right past because I'm just getting it done. Eating itself. There's so much so many sense experiences seeing it smelling it tasting it. You're hearing it feeling it in the mouth. Maybe thinking. So just being with all of that. With all of our life energy. Even even feeling how the food entering the belly even by the end of the meal it's starting to. Enliven the system. Life energy. Some of it comes from food. Some of it comes from the mind but some of it comes very basically from the nutrition that we take in. Can you be with that energy. So considering the ingredients that you have to work with going forward next hour body speech. Maybe speech thought action. Touching into how they convey our deepest intentions how they can be an embodiment of our understanding and our practice. And how things are. So may it be a time of nourishment. And I'll see you back for another six in an hour. Sorry.
