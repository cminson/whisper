The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org for expression.
And so that's a segue to move into a guided meditation with this exhibition of Brahma Vihara.
And I just say a few words before we go into that.
I think there's a sense of different flavors that we've been talking about in the last class and this class,
and for the next class on Saturday.
And sometimes we call it the qualities of a mind and heart.
In the Brahma Viharas, sometimes we refer to this kind of equanimity as kind of a heart quality.
And it's kind of a challenging to really have a clear definition of what a heart quality might be versus the mind quality.
In fact, the Chinese translation uses the same character, but people kind of interpret it a little differently sometimes associated with mind a little more versus heart a little more.
So for me, there's a heart quality maybe is having a little sense of in between mind and body where it carries some emotional tone in this.
As David was saying, there is this expressions in us that may be quite beautiful and that we can feel as we engage in the practice.
So that's what we will do. And I also say that there's different flavors of equanimity, whether it's awakening factors or as heart quality Brahma Vihara or Samadhi, they're not mutually exclusive.
In fact, they blend into each other and they really support each other.
And so as we meditate, we may kind of feel like we're moving in the whole territory of this different flavors of equanimity.
And that's all good. So let's meditate.
Take a sitting posture that's supportive of meditative practice.
You can close your eyes if you wish.
For the first few moments, just settle into a posture. Maybe that's supportive.
We enter this into this body as if we're entering into a temple.
The temple of this body.
Our bodies are made of the same material as the temples and houses.
And we enter into this body with some care and some reverence.
Maybe there is a little bit of inner bowing to this being, this body and this mind.
Mentally take the seat in this body.
Connecting with the floor.
Being supported by Earth.
Maybe there is a sense of gratitude arising in your heart.
Attitude towards the elements. Earth, water, fire, air, space, consciousness.
That offers us life.
Simply feeling grateful without any reason.
Soften the body and mind into this field of wholesome heart quality.
There is a stillness in the body.
Maybe stillness in the mind.
There may be a hint of nectar, love simmering in the background.
Around the heart area.
Feeling some tenderness and warmth.
The absence of the ill will.
Notice any stability in your experience.
Stability in the body.
Maybe rooted in your seat.
Maybe there is a hint of a balance of the mind.
Allow there is a hint of stability and a balance to come to the foreground of your experience.
The mind is unmoving, unwavering.
Maybe to small degree or the big degree.
Unwavering in the midst of pleasure or pain.
Desire or aversion.
You are entering the house of equanimity.
Divine abiding.
Allow this equanimity to grow or expand.
Permeating in all directions.
The house of equanimity has no walls, no boundaries, no roof, no ground.
The heart is open.
All experiences can arise and pass in the field of equanimity.
Maybe the mind is bright or soft.
This is the peaceful abiding.
Allow yourself to savor in this beautiful quality.
Like enjoying the delicious curry.
Soaking.
You are entering the house of equanimity.
Thank you.
For some this place is deeply healing.
Maybe healing in the body, in the heart, in the mind.
For others this place may be deeply nourishing.
For yet others this might be deeply purifying.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Being the divine abiding of equanimity.
There is no lack of love.
Love for truth.
Being the divine abiding of equanimity.
There is no lack of compassion.
One is committed to non-harming.
One is committed to non-obstruction of truth.
Being the divine abiding of equanimity.
There is no lack of joy.
Peaceful abiding.
Peaceful abiding.
In the vast field of equanimity.
There is no center found.
But the heart is full.
Peaceful abiding.
Peaceful abiding.
