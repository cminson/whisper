There. Okay. So,
the technicality is out of the way. So, let's start sitting together.
Let's start sitting together, and I'll say more.
So, I'd like to invite you to arrive, to arrive in your seat,
in this moment in time.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Inviting awareness to be bright, to be bright.
And expansive.
Not as something you do. Awareness is always on.
We don't do awareness.
Not as if.
Not as if.
You're landing, you're sitting, you're resting.
In knowing of what is here already.
Aware, knowing your intention.
In this moment, why am I here?
Aware of this body.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing the body.
All the nooks and crannies.
And if and when awareness knows sensations of tightness,
holding.
It engages with the intention to release, to relax.
To let go.
Knowing that a relaxed body allows for a relaxed, spacious mind.
Letting there be bright awareness of the breath.
Being received in the abdomen, calming, soothing, settling, stabilizing,
connecting and rooting us to the earth.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
And heart.
All of the mind and heart are actually being performed.
And remember thoughts are actions of the mind.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
And if we realize that intentions or actions of the mind in this moment are not what we really would like to create for this being who is me.
What we want to create, form, make, form formations.
Our only chance is through awareness, through mindfulness, to know, to understand, to see.
To see.
And pause and make a new choice.
A choice that can shift and change this karma.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
Awareness infusing.
We fashion ourselves.
In the future moments to come.
If in this moment challenges are arising.
Can we be kind? Can we choose to be kind?
Can we choose to be accepting, allowing, non-reactive, spacious, gentle, loving?
Loving.
Loving to this body, to this heart, to this mind.
And with whatever arises.
Gentle, gentle.
Precious awareness.
Loving.
Releasing.
Forming wholesome formations.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
If you find your mind has wondered, perhaps thinking about thoughts, you don't really want to be thinking about.
Not in this moment, not period.
Becoming aware and maybe dropping in the question so lovingly to yourself, oh sweetheart, what are you creating?
What ossified patterns of the mind are you creating in this moment, darling?
Let go, sweetheart, let go.
Let's create wholesome moments.
Wholesome formations.
Let go, sweetheart.
Let go, sweetheart.
Let go, sweetheart.
Let go, sweetheart.
Let go, sweetheart.
Let go, sweetheart.
Let go, sweetheart.
Let go, sweetheart.
Let go, sweetheart.
Let go, sweetheart.
Let go, sweetheart.
Let go, sweetheart.
Let go, sweetheart.
If you want to create patterns of kindness, then be kind.
If you want to form formations, patterns of wisdom, then be aware.
Not sleepwalk in this moment.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
As we approach the end of the sitting,
can we connect with a desiring, with an intention or kindness, generosity towards ourselves?
Without judgment, for whatever rose or did not arise, we've done our best,
given the causes and conditions passed out previously.
Can we create wholesome karma in this moment?
By being kind to ourselves, appreciative. Thank you.
Thank you, dear me, for showing up, for practicing in Sangha, doing your best,
and really connecting with this mental act of kindness and generosity,
relishing it.
So many other things I could be doing with my life, and this is what I chose to do with my time.
Yay.
Appreciation.
Not attachment to outcome.
Offering with generosity again, connecting with generosity.
Our collective, our collective practice, our collective goodness,
sharing it with all beings everywhere.
All beings in all circumstances around this world.
Those who are well and happy, those who are in neutral state,
who are suffering, grieving in war zones, etc.
Or any other challenges, offering our goodness, our care,
to all beings everywhere, including ourselves.
May all beings everywhere be safe, happy, healthy, and have ease.
May all beings everywhere be free, including ourselves.
Thank you for your practice.
Thank you.
