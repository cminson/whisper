 Well, I'm delighted to be here. I'm delighted that Gil invited me to talk about a topic which I've been exploring, like many of you, which is, which I call the Dharma of Difficult People. And some of you may not have known the theme for this evening. But what I want to do this time and next time is to encourage you to see yourself as being in spiritual training with the difficult people in your lives. And so what I want to do tonight is to give a kind of introduction to that theme and probably talk about 25 minutes or so and leave about 15 minutes for questions and discussion. But in my 25 minutes, I want to give you some guidelines for if you so choose to take as a theme of practice in the next week, your interactions with difficult people, should they appear? And probably it is the case that even if you don't have difficult people seem to appear, you yourself may sometimes be a difficult person for yourself. So that should cover it. So if you so choose to work with this theme, we could then talk further next week. And also could be some impetus for working with this theme, hopefully over the next two weeks in a way that could bring this dimension of practice further into your own repertoire. That's my hope. So what I want to do is to talk this evening about three aspects of taking difficult people as your practice, as our practice. And first I want to talk about the way that it's possible to take our encounters with difficult people rather than as a starting point for cursing and blaming, but rather to take it as a moment to say, oh, time for spiritual practice. I want to talk about that theme first, then I want to talk about what we actually find when we look closely at our experience of difficult people. When we bring mindfulness to our experience of difficult people, what do we actually find? And then thirdly, a few guidelines for working with difficult people as practice. But first, I'd like to do a very brief guided meditation. And I'd like you to reflect just for a minute or two on any difficult people that you might have encountered recently. And you can we'll, we'll leave difficult undefined for the moment. But I think you know what this means. People that you that are actually difficult, they bring up different difficult experiences for you. So just reflect if there have been some recent difficult people and what that dynamic is like. You might have an image of the person, maybe of concrete situations. Maybe also look at what the particular dynamic is that's difficult for you. So let me talk first of all, using this guided meditation, somewhat as background to talk first of all, about the shift that happens when we start to take difficult people as starting points for practice. And I have to say that the reason that I'm interested in this topic, and the reason that I've actually excited by it, is because of my own experience learning with difficult people, never by choice. That's how it is, right? And so I've been particularly interested in the last five years or so. When I've had some encounters with people that have been particularly people in my experience with people who are in positions of power in relation to me that were quite difficult, that were that basically, I found myself being triggered and reactive. And yet, with help from several mentors, and these were sort of long term experiences, and I was thinking, I'm thinking particularly of one relationship that lasted over several years, where I was in a position within the power hierarchy of an institution, I was considerably lower down. In fact, this was the president of an institution. And I found myself interacting with him, and it being very difficult. I believed that he was not listening to me. Other people corroborated that at times. But nonetheless, nonetheless, what I experienced was that I would, when I wasn't being, when I thought and felt that I wasn't being listened to, something happened internally, that it seemed to trigger something, you know, perhaps old, where I tended to think, this person is not listening to me. Why is he president? And so forth. And because, of course, the institution had these very idealistic mission and value statements, and they seem to be connected with one would presume with an ability to listen, partly concerned with the training of therapists and so forth. So I'm not naming any names. And so I would become somewhat judgmental. And I, as I explored this more, I found that I tended to be judgmental and withdraw, really withdraw from the interaction, even though I was still there, with a presumption of moral superiority. A few of you may know this, this tendency yourself, some of you probably, intimately. And so I found myself doing that. And I, when that happened, I would be judgmental. I actually wasn't able to function that well. You know, I would, it would sort of be paralyzing, you know, if you know that kind of situation. And over the course of a number of months and years, I tried to explore that dynamic and found myself over time, able to really use that experience as a starting point for learning, and a way of really inquiring into what was happening internally, what the patterns were that were underneath the reactivity. And over time, I grew able, or more, I should say more able in that dynamic, to not be so reactive and to come through to be able to still see what I was seeing, but interact more fully with the person. It was a difficult situation because there was power involved, because it must have triggered something very basic. And most of our difficult people experiences do something like that, I think. They are difficult for us because they trigger something that's quite deep in us, and they are chronic. They go over, they happen for a certain amount of time. We find ourselves typically reacting in the same way. Well, I'll get in a moment to what we actually find when we look more carefully, but I just wanted to establish that for me this has been important because it's been a powerful kind of learning, and I can also think of many other situations of learning from interacting with difficult people. Of course, this goes against the normal tendency, which is to somehow think that difficult people are the problem, and the solution is to actually get rid of them, rather than to inquire. In Buddhist tradition, there actually is a long tradition of seeing difficult people as being important for one's spiritual practice. In the Majjhima Nikaya, some of you who study this may know the simile of the saw, and there's an amazing story in there where the Buddha tells a story about a maid named Vedahekha, who has, no, I'm sorry, the maid is named Kali, which should be a warning a little bit, but the maid is named Kali, and her, in the text, it says her mistress is named Vedahekha, and Vedahekha has this reputation for being very kind and gentle, and Kali starts to wonder, is this just because I do good work? And she says, perhaps I will test my mistress, and so she starts getting up later and later, and sure enough, Vedahekha starts getting angry, and as the Buddha tells the story, within a few days, Vedahekha, Kali keeps saying, well, perhaps my mistress is actually nice, not so kind and gentle, and then she keeps on extending the test, as it were, of her mistress, and by the fourth day, the wonderful Vedahekha, who had this reputation in the community for being kind and gentle, is running after Kali with a rolling pin, and actually smashes her in the head. At that point, the Buddha intercedes and says, okay, okay, why was I telling this story? And he basically says that he was telling it, because it's very important to see one's practice as including tests, that you can't really know where you are spiritually, unless you're tested. And what do difficult people do? They test you, involuntarily. So what the Buddha says to the monks and nuns who are listening, he says, some bhikkhu is extremely kind, extremely gentle, extremely peaceful, as long as disagreeable courses of speech do not touch him or her, but when disagreeable courses of speech touch him or her, then it can be understood whether that monk or nun is really kind or gentle. He says, I don't call a monk or nun kind and gentle unless they've really been tested. And so I think that's and so I was thinking that a friend of mine named Minduk, who lives not far from here, who is a teacher in the Vietnamese community in San Jose, for many years, even though he was a monk and the main teacher in this community, which is called the Dukh Vyank temple. Some of you may have may have been there. And Minduk said that, well, for many years, he had worked with teenagers in trouble, even though he was a monk and the community might have supported him. But he went on he was just he's a beautiful person who should visit here, I hope, I hope. And he even he would work 30 hours a week working with teenagers, and he would give his paychecks to the temple, kind of the reverse of the usual relationship between monks and nuns in the temple. And he is he's a Dharma heir of Thich Nhat Hanh and Thich Nhat Hanh came through once. And he said, you know what, you're going out with these kids. They don't know who you are. They don't they don't care. They don't, you know, they don't care whether you're a monk or what or a Buddhist or whatever. They don't even know what that is. They just care whether you're kind and wise and so forth. And Thich Nhat Hanh said to him, you know, he hadn't said this publicly, but as you know, a lot of the monks and nuns that are at our monastery, they think they're wise. They think they're really developed spiritually. They haven't been tested like you have. I think you're really doing a very powerful practice of being there in the in the world and being with difficult situations. So it's a way to sort of reframe our practice, to really see that the difficult people can be tremendous resources for us. There's a wonderful line in the book, A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life by the Mahayana teacher Shanti Deva. This is something that the Dalai Lama takes as his main text. And in this book, there's a lot of material on what Shanti Deva calls taking one's enemies as the basis for spiritual practice or part of the basis for spiritual practice. Shanti Deva says, this is from the seventh century. Therefore, just like treasure appearing in my house, without any effort on my behalf to obtain it, I should be happy to have an enemy for he assists me in my conduct of awakening. I should be happy to have an enemy for he assists me in my conduct of awakening. Now, what do we find when we actually look to the experience of difficult people? And this is something that I'll also invite you in the next week to actually bring mindfulness so that when a difficult person appears in your life, you just say, oh, time for practice. Let's look at what's here. And so what do we actually find? Now, I want to say before doing this that before going in detail that I think that working with difficult people is somewhat of an intermediate practice. I don't know if it's a beginning practice. I would say it could be a more intermediate or even advanced practice because we need to have a certain foundation of mindfulness to work with difficult people. Even though I think it's very possible to work with difficult people when one considers oneself at a beginning level. I think I did that kind of unknowingly at the beginning of my practice. I was working with Joseph Goldstein as a teacher and he gave me a line that said, if there's suffering, where's the attachment? And I worked with every, I was excited, oh, oh, I can work with my suffering and look at it. But there's something about this practice of working with difficult people that is an invitation for us to do something that's not what we usually do, which is to take some of our difficult experiences, even our suffering as a starting point for mindfulness, it's a starting point for practice, to take our, even our distress and our suffering as like a wake-up call. So that at a certain point in our practice, we actually have a certain interest in our suffering. It's a little bit of a reversal. Sometimes when we start meditation, we do meditation to get away from our suffering. To have peace, to have relaxation, understanding. At a certain point, it may be when actually we're not suffering so much. Then we can take the moments of our suffering as interesting, as something to investigate, because when we go into them, we actually can know some of, more carefully, some of the patterns that actually bind us. So what do we actually find when we look at our experiences with difficult people? First of all, we find that what's difficult about difficult people is our experience of them. That's an important fact, that what's difficult about difficult people is that we have difficult experiences with them. Difficult experiences like anger, frustration, impatience, fear, and so forth. And with difficult people, we have them on a regular basis, somewhat chronically. So that when we're with, so this is a very important, because what it means is that it's possible to look carefully at our experience, because it's really our experiences, that's what's difficult about difficult people, in a deep sense, it's not the external person. And that doesn't mean at all that the difficult person doesn't bear a significant degree of responsibility for our experiences. But it's important to see that we can actually take what's difficult about them as our experiences of being with anger, or a sense of betrayal, or a sense of not being listened to, or whatever. Again, it's not to say that there's not responsibility on their part. But it means that we can actually, as part of the work with difficult people, look at our own reactivity. So in many ways, we could say that being with difficult people is in part an invitation to study the patterns of our reactivity, because that's what we find with difficult people. We find the reactivity that leads us to basically get lost in some way, to get lost in anger, or fear, or confusion, or whatever. And that's what we seem to experience with difficult people. So we could say that our experience of difficult people, when we take it as practice, is an invitation for us to look deeply at our patterns of reactivity. It was an invitation to look for me to look at what there was that happened to me when I didn't feel listened to. And again, I want to say that looking at my own reactivity might be part of the long-term way of working with difficult people. There might also be interpersonal or even social responses to the situation. But a key part, and the part that we can really examine in our own practice, because often difficult people are not wanting to have dialogue with us, right? A lot of times, difficult people, when you say, well, I'm having a difficulty with you, would you talk about it with me? It's an invitation to further difficulty. But in the best of situations, we have people that we can both do our inner work with, and we can also communicate and talk about the relational dimensions. But here, I want to focus particularly on the personal work that we can do with difficult people. So we can see that what's difficult are the patterns of reactivity, and that our encounters with difficult people, in a way, are invitations for us to become experts, further experts about our own reactivity, further experts about what happens when that person doesn't listen to me. Now, this takes a lot of mindfulness, because what we seem to be able, what we seem to be able, what we seem to need to do is to study exactly what happens. So here, I want to shift to the third part, the last part of my talk, which is to say, how might we practice with difficult people? And I want to name a few aspects of that, and also weave in a little bit more about my own experience, and some of the question of what actually happens with difficult people. And I'll be saving some material for next time. So the first thing to do when we're with difficult people, or when we think we're going to be with difficult people, is to form the intention that the situation could be a learning situation. I used to go to those meetings with this unnamed president every two weeks. After a while, I used to take those days as my retreat days, seriously. And I used to say, okay, today I am going to be challenged. I'm going to be given certain kinds of stuff coming out of me that will tend to have me lose it. I will approach this with my maximum mindfulness. So I actually used to say, okay, you're eager to have more time for meditation. Guess what? This is your time for meditation. So I used to, I had to take the BARD system to go to the place where we would have these meetings. I would be on the BARD, I would do mindfulness practice, I do loving kindness practice with the people in the BARD. I do walking meditation for the 15 minute walk from the BARD to the office. And after a while, I mean, this is after I had already studied myself how I was losing it a lot. And I did have the benefit of an extended relationship with a difficult person. But what I found myself wanting to do or doing was forming the intention that I will take this as a chance to learn. I will take the situation as a chance to learn. And furthermore, I will try to keep those intentions strong. I will remember that intention prior to the meeting. I will strengthen my mindfulness. I will do what we could call building a kind of container that gives us some support for being with a difficult person. For you, this might be to talk with friends about the dynamic. Not to analyze why the difficult person is so difficult, which a lot of us spend a good deal of our time doing. But rather to form the intention, how can I learn from this? How can I in particular develop mindfulness? Because I think what we have to do is to learn how to start recognizing the trigger that brings our automatic reaction. And this is some of the most difficult part of this work because we have to somehow be really attentive and study in detail our patterns of where we get lost. And typically in these situations, we will find that there is some trigger. The person not listening to me, that leads me to suddenly just go off in judgment with that particular situation. We each have our own variety of that. Someone will do something or say something and we will just go off. The way that someone might give a sarcastic comment. And we just immediately give a sarcastic comment back. A lot of our time is like that. There's usually something happens and immediately we go off in reactivity. What we have to do over time is to slow down the process so that we begin to see how the reactivity starts. That's why our own regular mindfulness practice is totally necessary as laboratory training to study our own reactivity. Because we have to be able to study our reactivity so we can actually see trigger, being triggered, and then the reaction. And study that so that we can actually find that typically when there's a trigger, like the person not listening to me, there's actually some pain that I feel. But typically I'm unconscious. I'm not aware of it. There's a trigger, I feel some pain, and then I instantly go into what we could call a defense mechanism. Some kind of reaction. We have to slow it down. I have to slow down my interaction so I could actually say, I could actually feel I'm not being listened to, ouch, that hurts. And then to be able to study the way that I usually react to that to the point where I could feel the pain and then know, oh, I have a few choices here. I can go off in reactivity or I can do something else. And I found that the key to this was actually being in touch with the experience of pain that happens with difficult people. Because normally I think we're not. Normally we're in a kind of automatic state where someone does something difficult and we just go off like a billiard ball, just bouncing off a corner. And so to bring mindfulness, we slow it down. We begin to be aware. And my experience is this takes a lot of repetition. We have to just do this over and over again. This is not a one-time practice. After the end of this talk, you will just go out. Maybe some of you will have an encounter with a difficult person this evening. Maybe you will go home and your significant other will say, you went to meditate and hear a talk and you didn't do the dishes or some version of that. And all the wonderful peace and perspective and wisdom will be in the past. And you will find yourself reactive. And over time, that's why it's so fortunate to have a difficult person with whom there's a long-term relationship. Because the only way to study this is to do it by repetition. This is what we do in this mindfulness practice. It's perhaps not advertised outside. But we watch the same patterns over and over again. And we don't learn by seeing it once or twice. We learn by seeing the same pattern like 100 times or even 5,000 times. So if you don't like that method, go find another one. Because that's what we do here. And it works. That's the thing. That attending to the patterns over and over again and particularly trying to see all the different steps that lead from trigger to pain to reaction, particularly seeing if there's some pain with our automatic reactions, we start to disentangle everything. And we then start to be aware. It doesn't mean that there's not pain, but we start to have a movement from pain to reaction, not the automatic and unconscious. That's why this practice works with this. It stops being automatic. And I can be there and not feel listened to and say, oh, this is, oh, and I can feel, oh, it's painful. I'm sad. And I can start responding in different way rather than withdraw. I can start saying, I'm not sure you heard what I said. Or something like that. That's not a reactive response necessarily that can come more out of compassion for myself or the other person and some wisdom in our response. So I think I'll stop here, open it up to any discussion. And then there's some more things that I'll talk about next week that can be done on this foundation. So thank you very much. Please. Yeah. changes his or her ways without sort of knowing what's going on. Just, it's like going up to somebody and saying, boo, and if you don't write to them, you get tired of trying. And you might find another way of relating to each other. No, I think you're entirely right. It's not at all guaranteed. But you're right. In a certain sense, it takes two to tango. And it's actually pretty interesting because it can tell us that even though we may, as it were, be the person who receives aggression, we still have a part to play in the conflict, which is a significant fact. And yes, it's been my experience often that if I don't give a reaction, that it's very hard for the other party, as it were, in the conflict to continue in the same way. You could say it's a kind of unilateral disarmament, something like that. And it's very interesting. It's very interesting what can happen. And the other person can actually shift, the behavior can shift without them knowing what's going on, simply because we're not feeding whatever it is on their side. Yeah, it's a great point. Please. You just broke up? Yeah. Oh my. I just lost all my opportunities. Even my confidence did happen. But I do have to say that that relationship is probably what pushed me deeper into my life, without knowing. Maybe it was because I wanted to just prove that I was knowing. So the more I meditated, the better the person I was to do it. It's a great time. Thank you. Thank you. I think I have one thing to say, which is both good news and bad news. There's someone else out there for you. Please, in the back. I was wondering if you could make a comment or two on where that limit is. I mean, you have to put a lot of energy in there. Hang in there. It turns around. One of the other things about mindfulness is to watch for your own suffering. And it's not just yourself. I'm thinking specifically about the plastic situation that occurs over and over in the country, the domestic violence. And I've worked sometimes in the domestic violence centers. So I hear this story again and again. I love it. On the female part of it, if they do exactly what you're saying, what am I doing? How can I change? And they stay in a situation where really they don't belong. Because they cross the line. But they continue to stay in it sometimes for years. And it just causes so much damage on both sides. So could you talk a little bit about that line? Yeah. Well, it's a sort of further nuancing of the talk and discussion to go into that issue. And it's an important one for me, working with Buddhist Peace Fellowship and looking into questions of social change and responding to oppression. And I think it's actually very relevant for what you, the example you give, and also wider social change issues. Because I'm not sure if the people that you're referring to are actually doing the practice that I'm referring to. Because that would, because it's not so much the outward behavior that is what we're looking for, but it's the inner work of really looking at one's reactivity. And so it's really to see how am I, so it could be, it could be an unconscious, automatic, reactive pattern with a difficult person, just to let that person have his or her way. And not to actually respond. That I think would be one somewhat automatic, unconscious way of working with a difficult person. So I don't want to equate what I'm saying with a lack of response, but perhaps a lack of very full response, which could mean ending the situation, or in the case of social change, could mean actually responding with a movement to change a situation. But the key is whether there's the inner reactivity. And that's something that one can investigate. And in some situations, maybe another nuance would be, in some situations where there's violence or where there's something very, not just difficult, but overwhelming going on, then I think I want to make that distinction between a difficult person and a situation that's overwhelming. And where there's an overwhelming situation, I'm not particularly suggesting this practice. Then the best thing might just be to get out of that situation. There is a lot of internal thinking that goes on. That's what goes on. When they say they sit there and analyze how did I react? How did I do that? If you're allowed to, change the thought to no more. That's what you need to help get out. You're welcome. Please. I think relating to what she's saying, I noticed that a lot of people tend to slip back and forth between this practice that you're describing and a practice of all of themself and saying, what can I do wrong? What's wrong with me? And I think the Christian blindness, I'm just saying that, and just examining and requiring what the feeling is. No, it's a similar point, really. I don't mean at all to suggest this practice as a reason for passivity, lack of response, or not acting in a strong way. Actually connected with Shanti Deva, even though he says it's wonderful to have an enemy for one's practice, also in the Mahayana tradition, there are many, there are actually some of the bodhisattva vows are actually to intervene where there are difficult people, or destructive particularly, to intervene in destructive situations and actually change the situations, part of the bodhisattva vow. But you're really asking how do we look at the subtleties between doing this practice and tending to blame ourselves or to maybe, I don't know, be overly inward? It's certainly a danger of this practice. I think the key would be, I mean this is where one has to study it, self-blaming is a form of reactivity. Again, just as I think that trying to rationalize a situation can be a form of reactivity, because I think it's a form of covering over. The key here in what I'm talking about, as a form of practice, is actually to be very careful about what we could call the different kinds of defense mechanisms. Because I think that most of these are a cover over of a certain kind of pain that we're feeling. Rationalization is just as much a defense mechanism as blaming oneself or blaming others. The key is to actually start to see how there is actually pain beneath the reactivity. But the reactivity can take, I think that, sometimes I like to think that when we have painful experiences, we're reactive, and reactivity takes two broad forms. One is blaming others and the other is blaming ourselves. And both of them are forms of reactivity. Please. A very different view of experiences clearly is different on the different relationship with that typical person. Dealing with a broad base of people in a large healthcare institution with people who are in crisis sick, tired, and after about 20 years of taking care of difficult people in difficult situations, I don't blame them, I don't blame myself for listening. And sometimes that long-term listening after multiple sections or 20s or whatever turns around and they begin to listen. It's not taking it personally else, but it is different than a long-term personal relationship. It can be wrong. I just find not to blame. I think the dynamics would be pretty similar because it's a long-term relationship with a type of difficult person that you meet. And maybe most of us have something like that in our work. Take one more question and then I think we're at about nine. I think I could go on for another long time, but I've been told that we should probably end and those who want to stay could stay. I just wanted to speak for myself mostly, recognize that it's a really different thing to cool out and take time and think about what is the right choice to make here when in fact you've already hooked me. And I'm angry or I'm feeling very defensive or very blaming that my ability to think straight is seriously compromised. And it certainly seems to me has to be one of the first things to recognize is that this is type. Yeah. Yeah. That's helpful because really what I think what I'm suggesting is if I were to have more time, I could go into more detail. There's kind of a developmental sequence when we do this work and you're right near the beginning. We may just notice that we're lost and that may be what and that's big to say I'm lost when I'm lost is major mindfulness practice really because there's a development. There is a developmental sequence and it first to set the intention and maybe this is a way to summarize somewhat first to set the intention then again. It depends on the intensity of the situation. Some things that are less forceful. We may actually notice more easily but something that I think everyone could identify with what you're talking about that a lot of the situations with difficult people. We will only notice that we're reactive after a while but I think if we keep sustaining that and keep noticing it that's sort of that's a major step. Another thing to do that I recommend that is used often in raising children is to take time outs is to actually have the consciousness when we're feeling ourselves reactive just to. Take a time out I do this as a major practice when I go to meetings and I get I find myself reactive I go to the bathroom and it's okay to do it multiple times in a meeting no one really checks they don't. They don't. It's not socially good etiquette. They're going a lot to the bathroom in the meeting and it's a wonderful technique. Actually I'm actually both humorous and quite serious that because it's the principle. This is sort of a way if you wanted to know how do I work with this. Okay. There's someone who triggers you take it first notice that you're triggered first have the intention notice you're triggered. If you notice yourself triggered and you have the option take a time out and come back sent to yourself somewhat and come back and see if there's another option and then just keep studying it in that way and over time and also I mean there I could say more there individual practices that one can do. Probably if you're having a difficult experience with someone it will probably come up in your meditations. Okay. And you will there though you have suspended the link with action and you can actually you'll but you'll still notice yourself angry in the meditation and you can actually do something that would you can actually take you know you notice yourself angry and spinning out reasons why the other person did that and why the other person should be in touch with you. And you can actually do a practice of saying let me feel my heart what's actually happening right now when there is anger or something like that and sometimes one can feel oh. I felt I didn't like how I was treated I felt sad I felt I felt hurt or whatever whatever the language that we would use is and you can study that in our meditation so maybe that's a fourth aspect you know intention notice when you're lost take time out study the same dynamics in your in your practice. And over time and also use help use mentors use groups to help sort of disentangle and I don't want to at all suggest that this is because the fact that we're doing this for two weeks that this is a two week practice. I think you get that this is I'm describing this is any difficult people are there because this deep stuff for us and it's going to take some time. So as they say in some of the cartoons for meditation bring a sack lunch. And really be there for the long haul but it's really possible to just make these few interventions and each of them will have an impact but check with friends discusses with mentors and teachers you know and it's it's a beautiful it's a beautiful process to engage in and I think over time and it may be we may be talking about years. One can really learn tremendously not be such a difficult person one so let me let me stop there do we end with some kind of a dedication let me let me just end with one minute to do an ending that will help be a transition for next time. Coming back to one's body one's breath. Letting be present what has been most helpful or important from the evening from the sitting perhaps or the talk and discussion. Not too many things maybe the one or two most important things and if there any intentions that come out of this evening and in particular any intentions for working with this theme in the next week. Then let that intention let that intention be set right now make an intention to yourself. This is what I intend to do you might even think concretely how will I give support for this intention might be to remember the intention every morning or remember the intention before you're about to engage with the person who might be difficult. Finally let us dedicate the fruits of the evening and of our practice to all beings knowing that we practice not just for ourselves but for other beings may we give the fruits of our work the fruits of our practice to others for their benefit for their awakening for their healing. For their freedom.
