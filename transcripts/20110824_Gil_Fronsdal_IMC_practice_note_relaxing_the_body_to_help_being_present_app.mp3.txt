Help Being Present

The entry point from which mindfulness practice grows 
is our ability to notice what’s happening in the present 
moment. If you join that with a capacity to be 
concentrated so that you’re  really focused on the 
present moment in some penetrating way , then you get 
the most out of  mindfulness practice. While different  
things are useful at different times in supporting our 
ability to be present and concentrated , perhaps the 
single most useful thing is to relax.   
 
Generally the forces that take us out of the present 
moment can be cha racterized as not being completely 
relaxed. Forces such as agitation, concerns, pressure 
and tension propel  the mind t o be concerned with other 
times, other places , and other things. The way the mind 
is caught up in its concerns, relationships and reactions 
to what goes on around us is often expressed in our 
body. Different  muscles  in the stomach, chest, 
shoulders, back, legs, hands, in the face, and around 
the eyes tighten and tense up .  
 One of the things you might consider as you practice 
today is that when you find yourself not in the present 
moment as fully as you’d like  to be , scan through your 
physical and psychological system to see if there are 
ways in which something  can relax and soften. And s ee 
if that helps you to be more present. It’s a little bit of a 
trick, because as so on as you focus on what’s being 
held or where the tension is , you’re in the present 
moment. If you’ve been focusing on  relaxing , you’re still 
in the present moment.  
 
Relaxing  creates good  conditions for being able to be 
present  and concentrated. It’s an antidote to the 
tendency some people have of trying harder and 
tightening up in order to be present. It may seem  
counterintuitive that what’s needed is to relax. But you 
might soften and relax , and see if that’s a greater 
entry way to being present.  
 
It’s fascinating to look through the body. The way we 
hold tension in our body can be very subtle  – not just in 
big muscular groups, but very subtly  around the jaw, 
cheeks, eyes, nose, and fingers . So go through the 
body and see  where you can  relax  and soften.  In doing 
that, the physical body  becomes a more comfortable 
place within  which to do the practice. Unless you fa ll 
asleep, the  more comfortable the body is , the easier it is 
to be present because it’s nicer to be present if it’s 
comfortable.   
So see if relaxation can help you with being present  
today . Thank you.
