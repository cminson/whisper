The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Today we are going to start with a new topic, which is called the Four Real Nobles. It is a huge topic, extremely important for Buddhist teachings, and it is a very big voice for someone who is coming for the first time.
Take it easy. Whoever is here for the first time, who did not take the introduction course, do not be a fan.
Just see what they can absorb. This is gradually internalizing.
In itself, the concept of the Four Real Nobles is very simple, what it is about, but really capturing its ramifications and how we apply it to life is so difficult.
What they can absorb now and gradually, over time, are clarifying things.
It is said that the Four Real Nobles contain the essence of Buddhist teachings.
In the sense that what does not enter within these Four Real Nobles, if it does not enter at all, it is considered that it is simply not part of the teachings.
We do not take them as a belief. Remember that Buddhism does not believe this, but as a guide.
Now, the classical instructions for meditation that Buddha offered are the Four Real Nobles for full attention.
These Four Real Nobles are basically what we cover in the introduction course.
We start with the breathing. Then we go to the body. In the Four Real Nobles, breathing and body are one thing.
The Four Real Nobles are the body that includes breathing, emotions, which is something tremendously important that we always need to learn a little more how to deal with our emotions,
thoughts that include activities or mental states. This is the third one.
And the fourth one is called Dharma. Dharma is a word in Pali in the language of Buddha, which does not mean more than teachings.
But in this context, it refers to the teachings, how we apply them to our daily life.
For example, you have now experienced something very beautiful, a certain tranquility.
Little by little, you will start to know how to bring this softness, this stability, this well-being to your daily life without having to be sitting and meditating.
So, this is what we are looking for. What we are discovering here, as in a laboratory, which is meditation, is to take it little by little to the quality of our life.
So, if you remember when we saw in the introduction course, these four foundations are based on each other.
The body, the emotions, the thoughts, and the teachings.
And this, in turn, this structure of the four foundations culminates in the Four Realities.
Ok, now let's see what the Four Realities are.
Simple, simple. Number one, Buddha says, in life, there is suffering. Simple, isn't it?
I think we all have had pain, diseases, losses, disappointments.
Now, I explain something. When Buddha says, in life, there is suffering, he uses the word dukkha in Pali.
From this moment on, I am going to use the word dukkha instead of suffering.
For the simple fact that dukkha is a much more interesting word than suffering. Dukkha is a whole range of suffering.
That is, from the most insignificant irritation, like when you bring a stone to the shoe, to the deepest suffering of having lost a loved one.
So, that is why it is interesting to be able to use this term, dukkha. It is not just suffering, suffering is quite large and dramatic.
It is also an irritant, something uncomfortable. Ok?
So, number one, in life, there is dukkha.
Number two, it focuses on the causes of dukkha.
So, if we suffer, why do we suffer? Let's see what are the causes.
Within this number two of the causes, there is another interesting term in Pali, which is tanna.
And this, literally translated to Spanish, would be ser.
It is a little strange to think of ser, but what seeks to describe this term is this mind that wants, that wants, that wants, that ferries on things.
That is why it is quite a skillful term, because it is very descriptive.
Let's move on to number three, a little bit of good news, which is, if there is suffering, number one, two, we observe the causes.
Number three, there may be end to suffering, the cessation of suffering.
We have to be aware of when, how and why we get to the end of suffering.
And the fourth point is, Buddha recognizes how difficult it is to get to the point where we are able to free ourselves from suffering.
It is so difficult that he said, I better leave you a guide, a way to travel, to have this help of how to get rid of suffering.
And this is a wonderful theme that we will cover when we finish the four real nobles.
This path is called the noble octuple sender, which is a path that has eight parts.
And in those eight parts we will study how to have correct vision, correct thinking, correct speech, correct action, correct way of life,
that is, how you earn life, correct diligence, correct attention, correct concentration.
These are the four real nobles, and down here there is a cordon that opens, and there are the eight points of the noble path.
These four real nobles are presented as the first teaching that Buddha gave after his enlightenment.
And this discourse is called the discourse of the movement of the wheel of Dharma.
The name is a little strange, but now we are going to investigate why this name is a little original.
Dharma or teaching is compared to a wheel.
And this is an interesting symbolism because it has several different meanings.
One is that a monarch of the ancient India, or a ruler or emperor, was called the one who put the wheel in motion.
The mythology is based then on a symbol of power of the empire, which is the wheel, and which derives from the idea of a war carriage.
And now let's see why that idea comes.
We are seeing here an era in India before, supposedly, that there was the wheel in India, that is, more or less four or five thousand years ago.
At that stage the invaders who called them Aryans from the Russian steppes arrived and brought these war carriages.
Thanks to these war carriages, they have this power and are able to conquer India.
From there comes and from there remains the symbol of the wheel as a symbol of power.
Now, according to the myth, when Buddha was born, two prophecies were made.
The Buddha was either going to be a monarch who was going to put the wheel in motion,
or, as a second prophecy, he was going to become a monk and he was going to reject the mundane, the mundane life.
His father, who was a monk, tried to evade the fact that he became a monk.
He wanted to become like him, a monarch, but obviously he did not succeed.
So, instead of conquering India, Buddha chose to conquer himself.
And he conquered the truth of the primordial truth.
And that is what we are going to discover little by little with the four real prophecies.
So, this is how the Dharma comes to be symbolized by the wheel,
or sometimes by a flag with the wheel in the center.
Now, this historical introduction is important because it is descriptive of something very powerful,
something that can conquer what needs to be conquered.
The Buddha talked about possibilities of this practice in very powerful terms.
The possibility of involving ourselves in the practice in a very diligent way and with the spirit of guerrilla.
They guerrilla in the sense of hostility, of doing harm, but in terms of discipline, of constancy.
The Buddha was not only trying to reduce stress, but he had something in his mind that was much more noble.
And that is why this is called the four real prophecies.
Sometimes these truths are called the ennoblesing truths,
because it is considered that the human being ennobles himself when he really starts capturing these truths.
Now, a structural antecedent for the four real prophecies, which is important to understand,
is that from the point of view of the Buddha, everything in life has a cause and condition.
That is, everything is conditioned and transitory. I give you an example.
For a being to be born, there must be certain previous causes.
There must be a woman, a man who is conceived, there must be a woman who takes care of her body,
who takes care of her health so that the embryo can grow healthy and then give birth to a baby.
That baby who is born, we know that sooner or later he will die.
There is in a brief example the causes, the conditions and the impermanence.
Now, what the Buddha is telling us in relation to the four real prophecies,
is that if we stick to the causes, conditions or the fact that everything is impermanent,
there is suffering, there is dukkha.
There it is as in summary.
Similarly, this cause and condition can be observed with mental activity.
Mental activity, naturally, arises and passes.
When a mental activity or a thought remains with us and gives the impression that it is permanent,
in reality what is happening is that we are feeding it and strengthening it constantly.
Some idea that we have, constant, constant, constant, is there because we are giving it the cause.
We are giving it life. If we do not feed it, this mental activity arises and passes.
Similarly, psychological issues.
This is very important because we all suffer from many things related to emotions.
For example, anxiety. If I do not feed the anxiety, the anxiety will simply arise and pass.
As we saw two weeks ago when we saw anxiety.
Things arise because there are causes and when the causes disappear, they pass.
Similarly, there is rain. There are clouds, there is rain. The clouds disappear for rain.
Now that the Buddha understood this relationship of the causes and dukkha, that is suffering,
concluded that dukkha could be eliminated if somehow we can transcend the causes.
I basically said the same thing, but in another way.
If I have a stem in my hand, if I manage to remove the stem, the pain passes and disappears.
If we manage to remove the stem from our heart, or as the Buddha says, remove the arrow,
which has hurt our hearts, then dukkha will have an end.
This teaching of the four real nobles is quite radical and exhaustive.
I consider it radical because it challenges us to the extreme.
Because it shows us that the idea of perfection is possible.
It teaches us that it is possible to completely eradicate all the irritants,
all the stem and arrows of our heart and mind.
That is, all the causes of what Buddha called dukkha.
Now, many are not convinced that it is feasible to reach this point of liberation.
Because when we are liberated from dukkha, we find liberation, what the Buddha achieved.
So many doubt. The possibility of liberation seems too arduous and remote to them.
It is very common to think that this path is only a path, to enjoy the benefits,
but liberation is not. That is too much for me. It is too big.
I confess that when I started practicing more than 12 years ago,
when I read Dharma books, I always stopped when I reached the point of discussing liberation.
Because, like me, it seemed to me like a mountain too high that I could never even dream of.
But the Buddha is undoubtedly talking about the possibility that each one of us has the capacity.
We have the capacity to walk the complete path, to purify our heart and mind.
Now, let's go back to the meaning of dukkha a little.
Dukkha understands everything that promises the complete happiness, everything.
And now I tell you how the Buddha wrote it, but how it appears in the teachings, the definition of dukkha.
The first sermon says, nacer es dukkha, envejecer es dukkha, morir es dukkha, estar con lo que es desagradable es dukkha, no poder estar con lo que es agradable es dukkha.
All the ways in which we identify or close ourselves to this physical being that implies the yo, implies dukkha.
The more we try to inflate this yo, the more we will suffer.
Now, many think that focusing on dukkha is something like being a water to parties.
We can understand why most people are going to look depressed and say, why am I going to give them time to focus on dukkha, on suffering.
I think that some of you are already seeing how the ideology in Buddhist teachings works, because the idea is that if I know deeply what hurts me, what hurts me, what makes me suffer,
then I have the possibility to transcend it, to free myself from this, instead of running. If you run for something, you spend a lot of energy and it always goes after you.
On the other hand, we turn it around, we face it and we study it.
And then there is the hope that we are going to free ourselves from this.
In other words, in order to cure a disease, the doctor has to know about the disease, right? It is the same.
Now, when we understand the suffering or dukkha, there is also the act of compassion. And that is very important. It is a tremendously important element to bring when we observe dukkha.
We always seek this balance of returning to us, but not to the point of being discouraged.
When we begin to discover that our mind is not flat, that within us there are obstacles, that there is avarice, jealousy, etc.,
we have to bring this compassion. It is said in circles of meditation that the knowledge of oneself rarely gives us good news, rarely.
Now, through meditation, we achieve very pleasant states, not always, but pleasant states of quietness, harmony.
But from the perspective of the Four Noble Truths, to achieve this stability and quietness, it is recommended to investigate dukkha.
And again, I could say that I make parties. Yes, because we finally manage to relax, let go and feel well-being, and now we continue to follow.
Do it when you can, that is, it is not about being discouraged. When one manages to feel the strength, stability, then you go further.
Then you challenge yourself to investigate this of the Four Noble Truths.
So the first directive in relation to the Four Noble Truths is to understand dukkha, to study it and get to know it deeply.
The second directive is to abandon the causes of dukkha.
It is to observe tanna or sedh, which enriches our thinking and acting. It is asked to be aware of our desires, attachments and irresistible impulses.
The cause of suffering is the sedent mind, sedent, the compulsive mind, which is attached to ideas, to people, to things.
Now, it is very necessary to practice humility when applying full attention and notice how difficult it is to deal with the compulsive mind.
If we regularly meditate and, above all, when going to retire, we realize clearly the reality of our mind.
From day to day, when we do our kyaseres, the activity of the mind seems quite innocent.
But the more we pay attention, the more we realize how the mind pulls us from one side to the other and causes us so much suffering, or dukkha.
We learn little by little that the mind does not manipulate us, that the mind does not behave like a puppet, but we, with discipline,
we are going to incline the mind towards thoughts that benefit us.
So, this compulsion or inclination of constant activity in the mind has the quality of dukkha, of dissatisfaction, of discomfort, of something that is unpleasant.
Now, the fears, desires or resistances also have their enormous power in us.
Part of our activity is to observe dukkha when we begin to discern the causes and see the causes, we begin to relax.
We can relax more and more and release more deeply.
When we release deeply, then we are able to see the end of suffering or dukkha.
Some sufferings are easy to unravel, others are very difficult, others return and return.
And it is interesting that Buddha gives us the image of a root for these sufferings.
Kido gives an example that seemed very good to me, to show how these forms of attachment can be very profound and resistant.
The example he gives is the following.
One day I get the desire that I want, that I want a Ferrari.
That is my desire.
But since I have already meditated, I observe, I realize that this will not bring me happiness.
I release, bravo.
Two days later, the desire appears again.
Now I want a Porsche.
I go back to the same.
I realize that this will not give me release.
The days pass and now I want a Maserati.
And so we go.
Then we ask ourselves, why does the desire return time after time, if I am releasing?
With the observation we realize that in reality, the desire is not so much the car.
The desire is in my self-image.
In how I want to see myself important, with a lot of dignity, that everyone admires me,
because I walk with my Maserati with all my strength.
There it is.
That is the most sticky point that we all have to deal with.
Then the desire of the car is a branch of the plant.
Loose is how to cut the branch.
The plant grows again.
So what we have to do is carve, pull the root.
And that requires time, requires patience, requires compassion and a lot of dedication.
So what are we doing here?
Through meditation we are training the mind to differentiate between the branches and the roots.
And that is all.
And that ends perfectly in time. That was the first part of the Four Real Nobles.
If you have time, I highly recommend that you read the chapter of the book of Iqueo, which is translated into Spanish.
If you don't have it, tell me, I'll give you a copy.
There is a chapter dedicated to the Four Real Nobles.
The entering class will be much more free than this class.
We will read a little, we will discuss.
It will be more like questions, answers, discussion.
And then the next week, we will continue with this format with the next part.
These are the nine, but if anyone has any questions, any comments?
Yes, with this topic.
As you mentioned, it's been a year.
Is it green?
Yes, it is green.
But I think that an important point that we should be dealing with is the concept of facing suffering, of not running from suffering.
Of course.
Because many of us have grown up with that belief of not wanting to touch it, of not wanting to feel it.
And Buddha's teachings say the opposite.
That you have to touch it to feel it and find the cause.
So I think that would be a very beneficial point for me.
Of course.
It is something that, if you realize, the trade is specialized exactly in destroying our suffering.
Whether in food, in drinks, in clothes, in anything.
Because there is violence.
There is violence.
There are many emotions that come out.
Of course.
No, it is a huge issue.
And of course that is something that we are going to see.
And the fact that you are here with that, you are telling me and you are telling yourselves.
I am capable and I am willing to look at this face to face.
Did you not see comedy on television, at home?
No.
How?
We left them recording.
I wanted to say something about what Pablo was saying.
I think that also, culturally, they teach us not to have fear or not to face suffering.
Or also to identify with suffering.
That is our identity, right? The victim or the victim.
Many martyrs, with whom we have identified.
I think that is also the other extreme.
Perfect. Great comment.
We do not want to evade it or turn ourselves into the drama of the suffering.
It is very common.
Carlos.
I think that it has to do with the cultural part.
Because I have lived here for a long time and there for a long time.
And I notice how the mentality of us Latinos is, poor me, poor me, poor me.
And all is pure suffering.
While other cultures are, do it. You can.
Do it. Do it.
Interesting.
And that is one thing.
We Latinos have a lot of beautiful things.
But at the same time, we have many things that do not allow us to move.
And that, for example, is something that helps us.
In the world, there are many things. But the most important in the world is in the internal part.
That is the one that we are going to take.
If we go somewhere, it is what we take.
One day when we are no longer here.
But I think that this type of practice or any religion or belief that makes you see yourself.
And makes you forget that self-martyrization.
That everything hurts me.
I die because I have a sheet.
It can put us in another plane.
Of overcoming as a human being.
And start to advance.
For those who believe in God.
For those who believe in Buddha.
For those who believe in whatever it is.
The idea is that they sent us to this desert world to understand and suffer.
But to climb and keep climbing.
So that at the end of our days, we can feel better and say,
Oh, I made a difference.
And I just spent 50 or 100 years without making a difference.
Very good.
Thank you very much.
The cultural issue is very interesting.
That is something that with this group, I hope that little by little we will embark on this more from our culture that we bring to this country.
Something super brief.
Basically what I understood of everything that is Duka is practically knowing our anxieties.
Because that is like the biggest monster that we carry,
which are anxieties that move us to one side and to the other.
I was thinking about an idea about, well, this is Buddhism.
But we also see in other philosophies, for example,
something very interesting that says,
know yourself,
which is practically what you just explained to us.
That sooner or later, after all that you explained to us,
is that, know yourself.
And that is something that is the Catholic religion.
So it means that although you are not on the path of Buddhism,
there are other philosophies that are also helping us advance,
advance forward.
So there we came to check,
that is true, we are going on the right path.
It is not Buddhism, it is Catholicism, it is any other philosophy.
Everyone focuses on the same.
Know yourself.
And that is the comparison I have right now.
Very good.
What is important here, especially for those who are here for the first time,
it is very important to know that we see this as a practice,
as a way of living,
as a mental discipline, as something to investigate.
This does not come into conflict at all.
If you practice Catholicism, Judaism, whatever, whatever.
Here we practice the acceptance.
