An interesting approach to practicing mindfulness is to 
do the basic practice of sitting still in meditation or 
walking back and forth in  walking meditation. You have 
a certain structure for your experience of sitting or 
walking . Notice  what’s happening to y ou without 
censoring , without any idea  of wrong or right. J ust 
notice yourself and what’s going on . Then notice  what it 
feels like in your body for this to be happening.  
 
For example,  you could be sitting and meditating , and 
you’re distracted . You think y ou’re supposed to be on 
your breath , and your mind wanders away a lot. In this 
approach to meditation , you wouldn’t see the mind 
wandering off in thought as being wrong. It’s just what’s 
happening. If you notice  what’s happening , then notice 
what it feels  like to be a person whose mind wanders off 
a lot. What does it feel like in the present moment? How 
does it feel experientially and  viscerally? Is there a lot of 
energy? Is there a lack of energy? Is there a lack of a 
sense of purpose? Is there interest in  something? Are 
there feelings and emotions going on? How would you 
describe  it if someone asked you, “How are you feeling 
when this is happening?” Then  stay present for thos e feelings and see what happens. See h ow those feelings 
unfold if you stay present . 
 
So stay in the structure of sitting and walking , and just 
simply notice what your experience is. All experiences 
are okay. As you notice your experience , go into 
yourself and see in the present moment how it 
immediately feels  having this happen. What does it feel 
like in your body? If you’re thinking about the past or the 
future , that’s  fine. What does it feel like in the presen t 
moment to be thinking abou t the past or the future?  
 
Keep coming  back to your present moment ex perience. 
Anything is  okay. Y our job is to feel it, sense it, be 
present for it , and then  notice what happens as you feel 
it. If your mind wanders away, that’s okay. When you 
notice when  you’re present again, w hat does that feel 
like? What does the  next thing feel  like? See what  it’s 
like to practice  in this way. It’s very permissive and 
allowing because there’s no idea at all that you’re doing 
it wrong. It’s just whatever your experience  is. It’s fine 
and you feel it, sense it and are present for it.  
 
If what I said doesn’t make sense , then forget it.  Thank 
you.
