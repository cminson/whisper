 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Here you go. Recording. Recording. Okay. So now a formal, formal hello and welcome. So the theme for today, we're going to continue with the theme of gratitude, which we started on Friday and it was so rich, so rich that there was a sense, I felt in the song, that oh yeah, let's continue with this. There are many, many more explorations and few of you said that. So we will explore, we'll continue with exploration of gratitude, katanyuta in Pali, those who like the Pali words, katanyuta. And in happy hour for those who've been listening for a while and coming for a while, you know that we each time we try to take a slightly different new perspective on these practices and explore as a scientist of our own mind to discover something new, something slightly different with a spirit of curiosity as an experiment. And an experiment is always successful because you learn something, you learn about what works for you, what doesn't work, et cetera. You learn something about the practice as well as this, as well as cultivation. There's always cultivation happening. So the perspective that I will take tonight with gratitude is one of simplicity of the moment. So as always, we'll start by settling the mind and heart with a few minutes of calm abiding, calming the mind. And then starting with this simplicity, the simplicity of gratitude or appreciation for this mystery called life. And the invitation, the invitation to play around with is to imagine you are a young child if you have been around young children lately or ever, especially if they're one or two years old, there is this sense of wonder, there's this sense of joy, there's this sense of everything is new, everything is amazing. There is no good, bad future past. It's just amazing. There's this sense of awe for the mystery of being alive, being here. I had the privilege to be around a year and a half old this weekend and was lovely to observe the way this little girl was eating up the world, the waves of the ocean, dipping her waves in the cold waves and just, wow, this is fun. It's cold. It's really wet. I'm shivering. And yet this is interesting. This sense of awe, wonder, awe, wonder. And with that sense of appreciation, gratitude, there is no good, there is no bad. It's just amazing in this impermanent life that is ours. Crash of lightning across this vast sky of being to show up. It's all an amazing show. And from that perspective, all our worries and fears and trepidations and insecurities and want to this, don't have that greed, hatred and delusion. It's a way to step out of ourselves into appreciation. So having set the stage, let's begin. Let's begin settling into our bodies. Landing, landing. Whether you're sitting or lying down, deciding what works best for you, for your body in this moment, whatever posture. And arriving with each in breath, each out breath, exhaling long, settled here. Once again. Feeling contact points of the feet. You're at the floor. You're sit bones on the cushion. The chair. With each out breath landing, landing into her lower body. Letting go of any tightness or holding. You're at the floor. Connecting, connecting with each breath. The lower abdomen, each breath cleansing, settling. Soothing. Just taking our time to settle and arrive. And this body, this amazing body that knows how to breathe. Fully present. Here, turning our gaze inward. Greeting ourselves. Greeting ourselves with friendliness. Each in breath. Each out breath. Long exhale. Greeting ourselves with friendliness. Greeting ourselves with friendliness. Just this breath. Just this one. Not the next one, not the previous one. Just this moment. Just this moment. Welcoming. Settling peace and quiet as much as it is available in this moment. Thank you. And if thoughts, plans, memories are arising, it's okay. No need to judge oneself. Simply acknowledging. Thank you, thought. But right now I'm giving my heart to this practice. Please come back later. Smilingly turning. To take refuge. Just the simplicity of this moment. As we till the soil and prepare. For our next practice. As each breath is breathed in. The abdomen, the lower part of your body. Noticing. Noticing sense of immediacy. The freshness. The nowness. The fleeting nowness as if your awareness is standing at a revolving door. Awareness. As going through the door past, present, staying at the revolving door. As the new experiences keep arriving. New breath arrives. Rises crests. Like a wave. Rising, falling, always. Awareness. Fresh. Standing at this revolving door. The point of view of nowness. Even if the mind can stabilize, then this viewpoint for a moment. Or if it can simply set up an easy chair and just rest here. Knowing, observing, experience as it arises and passes away. Almost feels like a miracle. This knowing, this awareness. And whatever experience is coming through, the revolving door coming and going. Whether it's the sensations of the breath, this wave-like sensation. The sensations, so many of them. Fell through the abdomen. And so, it looks like the important things are coming through. Whatever else is arising, this revolving door of experience being known in this nowness, there are sensations in the body. Quite miraculous. Whatever experience is arising. And the knowing of it. The sounds arising right here in this moment heard arising and passing. This nowness, experience arising and passing through this pinhole of knowing. How miraculous this whole show. To have a first row seat in this conscious experience, this mind, this heart, this being, the only one looking through this pinhole of experience in this nowness, having these experiences of life. In its particularities, yes we're all humans and yet, in its particularities, the way it's showing up in this moment for me. Not taking it for granted. So fascinating. This experience of being human. This miracle. This mystery. We each have a front row seat too. In this moment. Just observing with interest curiosity for it to reveal itself. With patience. With appreciation. With incorporate knowledge. But this perspective in the present moment appreciating, really waking up to this mystery passing every moment. It's all amazing. In what we usually call unpleasant, perhaps an unpleasant sensation or pain in the body or loud noise, it all becomes fascinating from this perspective. Amazing sensations. Wow. Interesting. Interesting sounds arising and passing. Sense of gratitude and appreciation. We're having this conscious experience. Knowing it's all impermanent. Going through the pinhole of experience, the revolving door, just here. Just now. Awesome. you you you you you you you you you you you you I will read a poem by E.E. Cummings Let it wash over you I thank you God for most this amazing day for the leaping greenly spirits of trees and the blue true dream of sky and for everything which is natural which is infinite which is yes I who have died am alive again today and this is the sun's birthday this is the birthday of life and of love and wings and of the gay great happening illimitably earth how should tasting, touching, hearing, seeing, breathing any lifted from the know of all nothing human merely being doubt unimaginable you now the ears of my ears awake and now the eyes of my eyes are open you you you you you you you you you you you for the last few minutes notice what is it in your experience in this nowness seeing, hearing, touching, breathing, tasting being this amazing experience of just being which the many have you have I been taking for granted what if it wasn't here this sense didn't exist and letting go letting go of any judgments however this practice period was or wasn't appreciating appreciating having shown up and even if there was awareness mindfulness connecting at this moment even for a moment giving thanks giving thanks thank you all thank you for your practice so welcome back so before I open the floor for reflections to ask you for a moment to look around your space just look around the room you're in with fresh eyes there's any new appreciation with fresh eyes really take your time maybe look at one object either the process of looking or the object itself with fresh eyes huh of appreciation of just seeing the object being seen before turning your gaze back so so we have few minutes for reflections questions comments what you discovered complaints all welcome the benefit of the Sangha what did you discover what arose for you questions are okay too and if you type them in chat if they're typed just to me I won't say your name I'll just read the reflection privately if it's typed to everyone then I'll read it all publicly can also raise your zoom hand and I'll have you on mute the question coming do you feel a somatic difference in your body between feeling meta and feeling gratitude yes I do that's a good question how about you the person who's asked this question I want to if you like to comment if you'd like to say more you're welcome to unmute yourself now and if not it's okay you can or you can also ask me to elaborate okay yeah so yeah for me there is a difference and maybe where do you feel it all right so it's interesting I've never been asked this question so let me tune in so so with gratitude what I sense is is you know it's gratitude and joy I think their nuances of joy when I practice gratitude whereas meta can have gladness but it's more turned towards others towards myself so there's friendliness but gratitude has more joy in it has more brightness in it that's the best I can describe it right now but then again don't take my word for it see what works for you and I would be curious about your your report Bill says it's hard to stay still in front of the revolving door yes that is true it is it's a practice exactly but as long as if you're able to even stay for a moment it can be so amazing to even try to stay there and be there for a little bit Nicholas says today was a lovely opportunity to sit with discomfort and unpleasant sensations in the body I love how you put that Nicholas a lovely opportunity to sit with discomfort and unpleasant sensations in the body and Nicholas you're welcome to raise your hand if you would love to hear you explore expand a little more if you would with that sitting with those sensations and this kind of so I'm going to ask Mark tell you actually I'll ask Nicholas to continue with that and then I'll go to Mark so Nicholas you're up yeah the chest was not aligned very well and so there was just a lot of tightness and sharpness and it was moving around it was I felt the push to try to meta it away it's like oh there's some aversion here oh there's some like why is it contracted it's like oh maybe meta will push it away and there was a few minutes of that and then they kind of yeah there was this nice moment of oh it's uncomfortable to be in this body right now oh like what is that like and it kind of yet it just shifted the discomfort didn't go away for the whole sit it wasn't uncomfortable sit but there was that kind of falling back into being annoyed and hoping it goes away and then coming back and recognizing that aversion is there and just kind of feeling the back and forth and yeah it was it was lovely in its own way thank you Nicholas this is fantastic and I want to highlight what you said for benefit of the Sangha because what you described was so and so beautifully you mindfully observed in your practice that there's this desire to meta it away we often do that like okay so there's aversions like okay I'm gonna meta this thing away this unpleasantness whereas when that falls away and you fell into like the revolving door this is what's showing up right now this this this unpleasant vedana feeling tone and this is what's showing up this is this and that too can feel amazing and incredible and just mysterious and it's you're smiling so I think it sounds like you got a taste of that yeah yes it's there's an ease that holds the unpleasantness it's still unpleasant but there's some sense of it's not maybe the urgency of like needing it to go away somehow there's that thirst kind of settles down it's hard to describe it's hard to describe but that's it there's the ease that holds the unpleasant it's it's the ease that holds it it's still here it's not gone away but it's held with ease that's exactly it that's an important insight remember this Nicholas thank you for sharing awesome Mary Christine please oops wait you're still muted mark Christine there so me meta is something that happens outwardly from me to the outside world where gratitude is what comes in I don't know if that makes sense of course it does absolutely yeah thank you for describing how it shows up for you that's lovely yeah thank you yeah great now there's one more example of that this is an invitation for all of you to now explore this beautiful question that came through nice yeah and I think this reflection that I think from Hugh was meant for everyone came to me it is wondrous to sit alone in my sanctuary with all of you worldwide Sangha that's beautiful thank you Hugh it's lovely so glad you're joining us and Eric last reflection before we turn to small groups I have this experience when I was sick the last time I was asking myself like what if this were to continue forever would I be okay with this is there a way I could be okay with this and I didn't know I was like I don't know it seems pretty bad I kind of had a similar experience today yeah so this has helped me understand so yeah I guess I just wasn't able to tap into like a gratitude I think this was like saying I probably found like an ease around the unpleasantness yeah yeah yeah I just wasn't able to find that yeah so you're saying there was some discomfort in the body is that correct oh yes so there was some discomfort in the body and then did the question come up that what if this continues and there wasn't ease with it there was a sense of overwhelms help me connect the dots Eric yeah I felt I couldn't find gratitude for it yeah yeah yeah yeah so and that's okay that's perfectly fine you know the insights don't always arise so so one way to work towards that the invitation is would be this would be to um pull back first into calm into spaciousness and breathe around the difficulty and see if there can be breathing around this pain this difficulty kind of breathing around it right not breathing it away and not making it all okay but just kind of like can it be here and can I breathe around it can I breathe around it can I breathe peace around it that would that could be a way to gently you know build a little yellow brick road using a different uh metaphor towards it does that make sense what I'm talking about breathing peace and space around the difficulty it does it does yeah so that would be my invitation Eric if that arises again yeah thank you for that really appreciate you bringing that up yeah so dear ones let's turn to practicing into small groups together for six seven minutes and the invitation today is we will start with 15 seconds of silent META when we go into the small rooms of three or four and then after the let's say 15 seconds of META then sharing as little or as much as you like with each other about your practice your insights and caring for yourselves caring for each other and um yeah so the rooms are open take care of yourselves take care of each other with META and here we go okay
