 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. And let all the fragments of thoughts that have been aroused in you by what we've shared today just ripple away. Like waves, little waves in the ocean. Let them ripple away and settle in to the ocean of you, of your beingness. And let go of all the tension in your face. And let go of all the tension in your shoulders and your neck. And let go of any tension in your arms and hands. Unclutching any clutching in the hands. And let go of any tension in the upper back, in the lower back. And let go of any tension in the front of the torso, around the heart. Relax the heart. Let go of any grasping, any contraction in the heart area and in the belly. Any tension in the belly. Let it go. And let go of any tension in the hips, in the thighs, in the legs, the calves, and the feet. Letting go of all tension in the entire body. And simply relax. And simply be aware. That's it. That's all. It's really so easy to be aware. It's so close. Breath by breath. Just aware. Like a radiant star. It shines like a jewel, like a star in all directions. As the Buddha was dying, his last words were, be the light. There's light everywhere. When did this light begin? It's like asking, is there a beginning to space? When does this light end? You could say death, but I mean right now. Like saying, where will space, where does space end? And is there a middle to light? It just is. We fundamentally just are fully being. We don't have to do anything to make this happen. We don't have to concentrate on something. It's our birthright, this jewel that radiates with goodness, with awareness. Maybe with some intrinsic metta. Some intrinsic goodwill is here. Some love is here. Some kindness, sweetness, tenderness is here. And just relax into our wonderful nature. That's always been with us. And thoughts come, arise, like the swells of an ocean. And then they settle back into the ocean, back into you. In a way we don't even have to let go. They liberate naturally. They liberate themselves. Look at your thoughts. And notice that urge to get entangled sometimes. That urge to stick. Maybe pick out one thought that you stick to. Is the thought sticking to you, or are you sticking to the thought? It's just a thought. But we can become lost in that thought, and we can suffer from that thought of this imaginary me. We're getting so old, it's a little exhausting. Let yourself be exhausted, and let it go. Just let it go, and feel the freedom as you unwind into being, into freedom, into maybe joy, happiness, ease. Of just simply being in this natural state of awareness. We can experience this anytime. It's our birthright. You know, giving up all contemplations now, just rest in the natural simplicity without being for or against anything that arises, just letting it be. Let whatever happens happen. Who cares? Carefree openness, like a child. Is this enough? No. No. If you notice you're getting entangled, just notice it, and it'll naturally free itself. Okay, thank you.
