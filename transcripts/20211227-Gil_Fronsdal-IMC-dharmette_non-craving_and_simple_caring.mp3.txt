The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So we have a guest on the altar for this week. It's Kwan Yin, Kan Nun, Abu
Lokiteshvara, different names. And I left it there yesterday morning for the
Sunday morning talk because I wanted to give a talk for the new year, the
coming new year. And so I gave a talk, I called it, they're calling this the year
of care. And so I talked about care and compassion. So I wanted Kwan Yin to be
there. And now she's there, left her there. And I thought of giving the same
talk, spread it out over five days these mornings. But this morning I woke up
with a different idea. It begins with a story. In the monastery, there was a
hallway and a door that went out doors into the garden. But there are all
kinds of other places that offshoots other passageways that went off from that
hallway. But when you went straight down the hallway you came to the door, big
door, big wooden door. But it was a kind of a special door, maybe a magical door.
And now the only way to visit this special garden was to go through that
door. And many of the monks and nuns, the monastics, wanted to see this garden.
They'd heard rumors about how wonderful it was and peaceful it was. And they
really wanted to see it. And some of them were depressed or angry or upset
somehow, disturbed. And they wanted to go someplace away from everyone where they
could be safe. And that's what they really wanted to do. And some just wanted
to see beauty. And some wanted to get away from the work of the monastery. And
many, many of the monastics stood in front of that door and tried to open it.
And it wouldn't open. It wouldn't open. And this door only opened under very
particular circumstance. For each, for the monastics to discover, how does it, how
to open this door? And because they really wanted to go to see this garden,
they wanted to get away from what they were doing. And how do you open this
door? And because the door didn't open, some of them ended up going down the
side hallways and into the labyrinth of the different places in the large
monastery. And some of them forgot about the door or took a long time before they
came back to that door. But every once in a while, some people would stand in
front of the door long enough that they would, and try all the different things
to open the door, that they would just stand there and not have any more
wish for the door to open, stand there without any desire. And when that
happened, then the door opens. The door only opens for people who have no
craving, no clinging, who are not caught in the grip of desire, where then the
door opens. So this little story is, you know, represents a huge possibility for
us that the door that's always standing in front of us, ready to be opened when we
meet it, meet reality without projecting and asserting our desires, our craving,
the strongest desire that Buddhism talks about is craving. And craving is a
desire which has the better of us. It directs us, it's compulsive, and we
can't put it down easily. Some desires are a dime a dozen that come easily and
easily let go of, there's no big deal. But the cravings are the ones that we can't
put down. They kind of a force within us, like I have to have this. And as long as
that force is there, there's a door that won't open, door to reality, door to our
heart, door to our minds. There's a door that won't open, then only opens when we
put down our craving and we stop desiring for a few moments at least. Now
it's a hard thing to do because desires are, some people identify with desires. I
desire, therefore I am. Desire is me. If I have a desire, it's my desire, it's part
of me, it's an important part of me, and to deny my desires to deny myself in
some way. And of course there's some truth to that. Not all desires are a
problem, but the desires of craving, the desires that are compulsive, the desires
that take the better of us. Those are the desires Buddhism is learning to,
we're learning to address. And when we identify them strongly and we follow
them and go into them and try to understand our life through them, sometimes
the metaphor for it is that of a big tangled ball of string. And it's
like more than it's a two-dimensional labyrinth or maze. It's a
three-dimensional maze, labyrinth, that you know it's very hard to find your
way out. Once you go into the world of desires and wants and not wants and
cravings and versions, then try to understand and find your way and navigate
and understand it and find the right one. And it's kind of like it can be a
labyrinth you never come out of, all these side hallways and trips you take
for a long time. And then there's the Gordian, the sword that cuts through
that Gordian knot, the big knot of the entangled desires. And it's a very
simple thing. It's to put very, very hard both to do, but maybe even harder to
appreciate the value of it. And that is to crave nothing. In a sense to be
present, in a sense within any compulsive desire whatsoever, maybe with no
desire, just here, just present. And what opens then? And what then? Would you
stand? If the door opens, would you stand there? Some people don't like to have no
desires because then they feel like then they don't do anything. But then
there's a next instruction. And in the monastery, if the door finally opens for
you, there's a rake just the other side of the door and begin raking in the
garden, cleaning it. It works to have no craving. If it doesn't work, we have no
craving if we're couch potatoes. But no craving, no compulsion, nothing, no
desire is driving us. And then take, you know, start raking, sweep the
kitchen floor. When's the last time you clean the shower? Clean the refrigerator.
Take out the trash. Go say hello to the neighbors. Call a friend. Start doing the
simple things of life. But the ones that are kind of in front of you and obvious,
but don't do nothing, have no craving and start caring for this world in the
simplest possible ways. And then that grows and develops and can become the
whole world. The danger that challenges how to engage with the raking, the
caring for the world, without then succumbing back into the world of
craving, into the world of desire. And one of the ways to do that, to avoid that,
is to meditate every day, to find a way to be present that allows you to shed,
put down the burdens of desire, the weight of craving in aversion, the force, the
contraction. In meditation to discover or get close to a way of being, where you
put down desires, put down craving, even healthy ones and good ones that are good
to pick up again after meditation. But to kind of come to a kind of place of
diminished, quiet, calm, diminished desires and have that as a reference point
then to understand what are the healthy desires to act on when we come out. If we
come out of the door, if we stand in front of the door and we have no desires, and
we just stand there, very quickly that becomes a desire. It's a natural thing.
Follow the natural pull into the garden. The rake is there, starts raking the
leaves. When I was a Zen monk, there's a very formal way of eating in the
meditation hall. And we have these three bowls that are nestled inside each other.
One is a big one, middle one, and small one. And usually the rice would go in the
big one, the soup would go in the middle one, and some salad or vegetables go in
the small one. And I thought, well, I'll just eat the most efficient way there is.
I don't have any desires for anything. I'll just eat everything from the
first bowl, then everything in the second bowl, everything in the third bowl, and
they'll be done. But I was eating in the meditation hall where we ate in
silence next to the abbot. And at some point he saw what I was doing, and he
told me, Gil, just eat naturally. And then I noticed that if I kind of stopped
my kind of drive to eat efficiently, simply because I was not supposed to have
any desires, I noticed that I would take a few bites of the rice, I'd put it down,
I would naturally pick up the soup, and perhaps I would put it down. You know, I'd
go back and forth, and kind of, you know, and it was almost as if there was no
desire, which is kind of this natural thing to do, to go through and eat from
different bowls at different times. What is your natural inclination when you have
no craving, when you have no desires? And maybe it's to clean the kitchen floor,
the refrigerator, the bathroom, or go visit a neighbor, or all kinds of things
this world calls us, calls on us to do. And so to have no desires, that'll, to be
desirousness, desirousness in a certain kind of way, craving-less in a way that
allows us to care for the world. And then do, please do, engage, or be careful, you
don't get to cut up then back in the world of craving. So that's my thoughts
for today, and thank you very much.
