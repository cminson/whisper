The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

What's on my mind today is news of the world.
And just how sensitive we are as human beings.
We're designed to connect with each other and feel what's going on around us.
I don't know if others of you have had kind of a emotional response in the day to the events in Ukraine.
But I wanted to speak a little bit about exploring the kinds of feelings that come when we're meeting the world.
Often we in meditation kind of come inward and explore, you know, let go of the thoughts and just come into what's here.
But there's also a place for us to notice that interface, what's going on in the world and how it's meeting, how it's meeting me.
We're designed to meet the world. Our senses are designed to connect us with the world.
Our mind is designed to reflect and put the pieces together to understand the world.
And so this interface and how we are in relationship to the world, it's actually it's poignant and it's beautiful and it's heartbreaking.
It's so many things. The capacity that we have to feel what's happening is actually quite beautiful.
And that's a piece I wanted to explore a little bit because earlier in the day I was kind of jumping right to,
oh, I should do meta, you know, and then at some point I felt like, no, I just need to feel what's here.
How is this heart receiving what's going on in the world right now?
And as I did that, the kind of the arc that I'll just say it very briefly and then maybe dive in a little bit and explore it,
was that as I could really just feel all of the stuff, I mean it was not terribly articulate.
There are feelings of confusion, helplessness, sadness, twinges of anxiety about what might come in the coming months,
you know, things along those lines.
But as I really just let myself feel it in the way that I described in the guided meditation, you know, no trying to figure it out,
but just really being with, landing with the whole thing of it, the whole, the wholeness, the whole way the events were impacting this being.
There was a point where it really felt like that connection, and as I described in the meditation, that connection is actually a connection of love,
a connection to how this being is in relationship to the world, that's a connection of love.
And then there was really room for the movement of the heart opening to metacompassion for the world.
But it felt like the opening to really just like landing with, what's here first was the doorway to a much more kind of what I would say for myself,
a genuine feeling of connection in metta, and not one that I was just like picking up thinking it was something I should do.
And so that really kind of land with how am I in relationship to the world.
It's not easy to feel that sometimes.
Actually, we talked about it a little bit last time, in a way, the meeting of the whole kind of broader sense of how we are.
And that's kind of what I'm pointing to here, not the individual kinds of little sensations or twinges here and there,
but just the whole like, how am I with this?
The heartbreak, the pain, the frustration, and then opening to it.
This is a human response when the heart is open, the way our heart works actually is when it's open,
when it's not defended, when it's not shut down, it feels the ripples of the world.
It feels the suffering of others, it feels the confusion, the pain.
And our heart can learn how to hold that without tightening down, without turning into hardness.
And I think that's a real gift for the world.
If more of us would be able to really feel what's happening for us as we meet suffering in the world,
in my experience, when the heart can really feel it, it is more naturally moving in the direction of compassion.
And the wish for non-harming, the wish for behaving in ways that are ethical, that are kind.
And it's not easy to open to that level of feeling.
It's not easy. We want to do something very often quickly when we touch into those kinds of experiences.
We want to do something, we want to act, we want to fix something, we want to...
It's like we can't just sit here.
And yet sometimes that giving yourself the space to really just feel into it with the heart that can then respond and resonate with compassion.
That heart, one of the beautiful things about compassion is that it does want to act in the world.
It wants to act from love and from connection and care and wishing to alleviate harm and wishing to alleviate suffering.
And sometimes, you know, from here in this place where I am, you know, I felt like, well, there's not much I can actually do physically.
But this movement of keeping the heart open and well-wishing, wishing for freedom from suffering, wishing for safety and freedom from fear for all beings,
wishing for freedom from confusion for all beings.
That is actually, it is a kind of an action that I think does have ripple effects.
It does affect the world in some way.
If only that when we're out in the world, if we hold this wish for non-harming for ourselves,
this wish for connection and care that others do feel it, others do feel it.
And sometimes for some of us, you know, there might be a movement of something actually that we could do that can come from that place of compassion.
And yet touching deeply into that, that tender place where the compassion can be felt and acted from.
It's such an important skill.
There's not so much of it in the world as a whole.
And I think equally as much as hatred is contagious, so is to that heart of kindness, that heart that acts and wishes for the well-being of others.
That too, I think, is contagious.
And so spreading that is not a small thing in this world, which is not a small thing.
Sometimes I think, you know, we think about the precept sometimes as being, you know, simple actions or something, but, you know, they're not actually so simple in some ways.
We, in our ethical conduct, aspire to not killing moving beings, not killing, not taking what's not given.
And if every human being on this planet just decided, even with respect to not killing other human beings, not taking what is not freely offered from other human beings.
If we even just went that far with those precepts, this would be a completely different world.
So honoring yourself for the engagement with those practices, they're not small.
It's not a small thing to engage with this heart that is exploring the possibility of openness to the suffering of the movement towards the wish for non-harming.
It's not a small thing.
I also felt as I was exploring this today around this big thing, you know, this big thing that's going on in our world today,
that this exploration around, how am I right now?
And just meeting whatever is happening for us, that's a good place to start no matter what's happening.
Whether we're experiencing some kind of struggle in a relationship or at a work situation,
or whether we're experiencing delight and joy over the celebration of a birth.
Really connecting to how the world affects us.
To me, it feels like when I can really connect there, it's like very naturally the heart opens outwards.
So this deep connection to how am I in this moment?
It's like it expands outward to how are you?
How are you too?
And so it really is this connection between being with ourselves, being present,
being mindful with this kind of just, how am I in this moment?
The curiosity of the human experience of it.
It connects us to ourselves but also connects us to others.
It connects us to the wisdom of things as they are, the wisdom of impermanent and unreliable experience.
And also connects us to the kind of, to me it feels like it goes through the kind of the impermanence,
the unreliability, the kind of vulnerability as a human being, to the heartbreak of how fragile we all are
to just loving everyone in that fragility.
And so there's this deep connection between what we're doing, exploring how we are,
and the movement of the heart to open to love and compassion.
These two is not separate.
The development of wisdom, understanding how our minds crave and cling to things
and how that leads to suffering.
We often talk about it in that way in the terms of wisdom, the growth of wisdom.
There's not a separation, wisdom and love really do develop together.
And it's, for me in this moment there's this kind of interesting like joy and pain all at once.
The kind of the joy of the heart that can feel and the pain of what it's feeling.
And it doesn't have to feel like a contradiction, just this is what's here.
So I'm just offering my reflections this evening and that's where they wound up.
I'm curious, how are you? What are your reflections either on how you are with experience or responding to anything I offered,
questions, comments, how to work with things.
I'd like to hear from you.
Sarah.
I just really, I love the way you framed how being able to really kind of open up and take in and allow the feeling of the heart.
It sort of naturally leads to that opening in that care. I guess I could really, I've really been feeling that a lot in my own practice lately is just how much that the way the meditation start with,
how are you like don't nothing needs to be changed like just how are you take a minute or longer.
And how and I really have been feeling how that is so something deeply relaxes and then there's capacity for being with others.
Sometimes being with ourselves even more deeply at times that capacity. Yeah, yeah.
I'm glad I'm glad that you've been noticing that.
Thank you.
Susan.
Hi, sorry, I'm back lit. So you can't really.
I really, I've very much resonated with what you said.
And, you know, feel that in my practice, what one of the gifts of it is the sense of kind of honoring what's here or honoring, you know, sometimes, sometimes my feelings which are what are very much here.
But it's, it's a different experience around honoring them versus getting kind of all tied up in them, so to speak.
And, and so today, I mean, between what was happening with what's happening in Ukraine and I have my father-in-law is very, very ill and it's looking like he's probably going to pass away.
And I, you know, I was working, but I just kept saying, you know, this is here. This is here and I can honor it.
I can honor it and it's here. And I was very much looking forward to the mindfulness practice because I could be with it.
You know, but even just having it in the background and just knowing it's here and holding that kind of gently and kindly.
That's just been a real gift.
I love the word honoring, you know, it really helps us to like honor whatever's here because it is, it's here, you know, and it's, it's like, it's asking to be seen in some way.
It may not be skillful to act on it at times, but it's asking to be seen and it deserves that kind of honoring with, with awareness, essentially.
And so much transformation can happen with that. It's, it's, it's mind-blowing to me.
It's just like, yeah, it's amazing how, how much when I really can just land with, yes, this is how it is, how things begin to change, things shift.
And, you know, I'm not doing that change. There's some other process at work that's wisdom. I think wisdom, wisdom and compassion are doing their job.
And the other pieces I can see when I'm grasping things to move away from it, like just and seeing that so much more clearly of like just the kind of desperate grasping at times of,
let me get busy with this and let me get busy with that and let me make plans. Let me reach out to this person or whatever it is.
And because it's hard, you know, I'm afraid of it too.
It's hard to be with.
It's hard to be with.
It is.
And there are times when we have to know, I mean, it's important to, to be honest with ourselves.
So honoring and honesty, I think those two words are good. And it's important to be honest with ourselves about when, like, if we, if we're trying to open to it,
and we just get caught right back in it, you know, it may be a little bit much for us in the moment.
But we might be a little overwhelmed. And so we do need to know when it's time to say, okay, I'll come back to this.
It's, you know, now it's not, it's not the time, you know, there's something, something else that, you know, and in times like that, I'll often just put my attention to something really simple,
something kind of neutral, nothing very complicated, you know, just to kind of let the mind settle down a little bit.
But I think there's a lot more capacity that we have than we give ourselves credit for.
And so I think that when we think about it as honoring, that seems to give me capacity anyway.
You know, it gives me some capacity when I think about it.
It's like, it's not that I have to figure out how to fix it or change it, but just honor it and let the, let the movement of it inform or teach or show the next, the next things to the next place, the next thing to happen.
Thank you, Susan.
Sue.
Yeah, I just wanted to say I appreciated the way you addressed the events that are, that are happening in the world and what's going on, you know, especially, you know, what happened today.
I think that's been on all of our minds. I just, I haven't, I had no idea how to, how to deal with that, how to, how to start living with it or, or bring it into my practice or, and, and I feel like you, you, you provided some, some good insight about approaches that might help.
You know, it's like this morning when I got up and I saw the news, it's like, wow, this is going to be on everybody's mind.
Yeah.
And yeah, just really felt like I,
I was just really overwhelmed with it and, and, and it didn't know where to go from there.
Yeah.
I think there were probably a lot of people in that category today.
I especially appreciated your suggestion of just being with it or just, just, just feeling it, experiencing it because there is this tendency to want to do something if no more than just read another article to figure out what's going on or whatever.
But it is so important just, just to be with it and to, and to ask ourselves what, what is going on for me right now.
Yeah.
I mean, it's one thing the Buddha said is, it is this fathom long body that I call the world.
It's like, this is where we meet the world. And so, you know, the world is kind of like being, taking shape in, in our own experience.
And so that's really, it's also not only honoring ourselves, it's honoring the world to, to be with it because the world is kind of showing up here.
It's, it's kind of, it's, it's the world resonating with this sensitive organ, this sensitive organism.
And not trying to make it into something that it's not.
Yeah.
So I think it's useful to, you know, especially when big things happen like this to take some time. I mean, I didn't have that much time today. I had other things I needed to do. And, and at some point as I was talking to a friend, a Dharma colleague, and we were talking about this and exploring how we were, you know, working with it.
And, and, and I said to her, you know, I said, I haven't had the opportunity yet today to just sit and feel it. I said, that's on my, that's what I have on my list after we finish our phone call.
I just want to see what it feels like, you know, I kind of have some ideas about what's in there, but I don't really know yet.
And so, you know, a little while later, I had that opportunity. He's like, oh, yeah, there it is. There's what's here. And it was so important. And so that's really why I wanted to share that this evening.
