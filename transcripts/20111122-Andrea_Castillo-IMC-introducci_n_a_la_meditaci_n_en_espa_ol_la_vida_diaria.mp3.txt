The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
This is the fifth class of the introductory course.
And I remind you that we have seen in the first week the breathing, the body, the emotions, the thoughts.
And now we are going to see how we apply what we have learned in our daily life.
Because there is the power of this practice.
If we only achieve a little bit of relaxation when we are meditating and the subject ends, well, it is nice.
But as I told you in the first class, it would be as logical as if I gave them a car
and they only use it as a chair and they never go anywhere.
They just get in the car and relax and rest and that's it.
But someone will say, but why are you not going anywhere?
That's exactly what happens when you use this practice only to relax.
Little by little one understands that this practice is to go to new places, not explored, fascinating,
that can be more interesting, more fascinating than going on a trip to Asia and spend wonderful days on a boat.
It is incredible what one can discover.
So being patient and what I want to talk about now is the tremendous importance of being constant.
Being constant in this practice, because what is going to help you the most is to practice,
even if it is for ten minutes, if you can't do it for a day, but regularly.
That is when we start to see changes in quality in our life and the way we perceive things.
For example, Sarah, how beautiful, she already captured this way of being one of the most enormous things in Buddhist teachings,
the impermanence, everything is impermanent in life.
So the full attention is a tremendously powerful tool and the idea is how are we going to apply it.
When we unify mind and body in the moment, in the experience of meditation
and then we take it to life, we realize that in our life the bondage love begins to grow.
It is called bondage love to distinguish it from romantic love, which is another thing.
We don't get into it now because it is already a matter of desire and attraction and it is another very complicated thing.
We think of bondage love as the love of a mother or a child.
It also grows the interest or the integrity, the constancy of the soul or the equanimity,
of not having so many ups and downs in our life.
It also grows the mental and physical strength.
We already have access to our wisdom, we become more patient, we become more flexible,
also with our opinions and with our habits,
that you are surely known to be someone who is not at all pleasant to talk about,
because if you do not agree with them, they answer you with a slap that you say,
well, we better not talk about it.
So since it is beautiful to be flexible, to say,
well, what do you think?
And to be truly open to the opinion of the other person.
So this flexibility is very beautiful.
We definitely experience greater happiness,
regardless of what is happening outside in our life.
Because if we are only going to be happy when everything goes as we want,
then obviously there will be many seasons in which we are not going to be good,
because many times we are not in control.
That is another hard thing that one has to learn,
but it helps a lot when you understand that in reality,
even if one thinks he is in control, we are not in control.
And it gives a huge relief to let go and say,
well, it's fine, I don't have to control everything.
I was still thinking that if I was worried,
I would have more possibility of something happening as I wanted.
Think about it and see if you don't do it too.
It is super common.
I remember that years ago I wanted to rent a specific house in Los Angeles.
I was very distracted, but it was a little house.
And I was convinced that if I was all tense and focused on the little house,
that I had more possibility than the lady that I was going to choose,
between 50 people, I was going to choose myself.
In reality, it is quite logical, but that we do a lot with our desires.
And the last thing is discipline.
That is another thing that we see grow.
Now the Christmas parties are coming.
How many times do you not make these new proposals in a year?
And how long?
A week.
And then I go to the gym, every day, and I go down 20 kilos.
And after two weeks, oh, I'm tired.
And they don't go back to the gym.
This discipline is tremendously important.
To be happy with our own company.
It is very sad when people look at themselves and say,
and they don't have confidence in themselves,
because they have seen time after time,
that they are not able to carry something to the end,
that somehow they go down the path.
This kind of full attention helps us a lot in a very soft way,
without reproaching us, to encourage us to be constant with ourselves,
to be disciplined, but in a loving way.
Something that we have not talked about,
which is also very, very important,
is the knowledge to distinguish.
That in this practice we are paying attention,
but it has nothing to do with selfishness or narcissism.
At least I have heard many times that people tell me,
and who are you going to help?
Sit there and look, don't get involved.
You have no idea what you are doing in meditation.
What is what we are doing in meditation?
It is not that we are sitting here,
we are inflicting our own image and making ourselves bigger than Superman,
but we are simply bringing the attention that we would give a small child,
and who is mother or father,
here you know exactly what I am talking about.
A child that you give attention to since he was a child,
grows happy, grows with security,
is well integrated,
and that child will be able, at the same time, to give a lot in life.
Now I am not saying to mime it,
nor are we going to give any whim like ourselves,
and we are putting our attention,
a wise attention,
to live a full life,
and not to give us any whim that we want.
We are going to be able to distinguish
from this option that I have,
from this option that I have,
which is what benefits me the best in the long run.
That is all.
We are leaving our wisdom that we all have inside,
flourishing.
For those who were not here,
I think that if I said it at the beginning,
we have an image here of a Buddha.
This is not like many of us are used to in a church,
it is a God.
This is simply a reminder
that we have this inner wisdom,
and that we are able to go little by little,
waking up and letting out this wisdom,
and simply a reminder.
Inside of me I have a treasure,
and I simply have to make a side of the rubble
to discover what is inside.
It is clear the difference between
narcissism, egoism,
and what we are doing in meditation.
I always ask,
in several points in this practice,
I go well,
sometimes I have to make an adjustment,
a way of knowing clearly
if they go on a good path,
is if they feel the flow of their wisdom,
and if they feel that the heart opens
a little more each time, to include everyone.
Not only to my husband,
or to my son or to my daughter,
but to all human beings.
That is what we are looking for, little by little.
And that is something that is not just like that,
but that we have to go working little by little.
To go back a little bit to this difference
of egoism,
by giving us this internal peace,
obviously we are going to be able to give it to others.
That is why it is not about anything,
nothing about something selfish.
The world needs people
who are truly capable of being present with you,
truly listening to people.
You have had the experience of being talking to someone
and you realize that they are not listening to you.
You are there talking,
and the person is looking at you,
but he is not listening to you.
The mind goes to the other side.
Obviously we feel sad when we are in a situation like this
because there is no connection.
And most of the people miss this connection,
we miss it, it is what feeds us.
So we start by giving this gift to others.
Remember,
this idea of what you need to do,
offer it to others.
There is an example that came to my mind
when I was trying to explain,
when I was trying to explain in my notes
how I started to realize,
many years ago,
when I started to meditate on the benefits
that meditation was giving me.
It is a very small and insignificant example,
but nevertheless it is something
that you start to realize
how the quality of life
is changing with this practice.
About ten years ago,
I went to visit some friends in Los Angeles
and we spent the first day,
as usual, when we were going to visit friends,
we went for a walk,
we talked a lot, we laughed a lot,
we ate together,
and then at night we said goodbye,
I went to my room,
I felt like meditating,
I was going to meditate every day,
I felt like meditating,
and something very special happened.
When I closed my eyes,
I perceived my friends more clearly
than when I was looking at them during the day.
At that moment I saw them clearly
and I deeply perceived what I appreciated and wanted.
The rest of my meditation
gave me the warmest feeling
and with that sense of affection and gratitude.
Having that clarity on the next day,
it was very natural for me to tell them
how much I appreciated them,
how much I loved them,
and it gave me a very beautiful connection
and the rest of the meditation
we spent the most joyfully.
It was simply a detail,
but it is a clarifying experience.
It is the kind of experience
that if we have it at the right time,
we can change our lives.
How many times have we not heard
a loved one who tells us
if I had known
that I was about to lose
my father or my mother
or my aunt or my cousin or a friend,
I would have loved to have said how much I loved them
and now it is too late.
People tell you this constantly.
This practice,
constantly coming back and forth,
being with you and asking you
how you are,
what is happening at this moment,
how is your body?
You find out what is happening
and then you can communicate with the others.
You are giving the gift to the others.
When you live with more people,
whether family or friends,
one of the best gifts
you can give to the others
is the clarity of how you are at the moment.
I do not know if you have had the experience
of living with someone who is unable to know
or a little bit how they are feeling.
They may be super depressed,
but they do not know
and it is only like a nightmare
in the house, tremendous,
that it is not palpable
because no one speaks,
because no one knows,
but there it is,
like the white elephant in the middle of the room.
So it is very, very beautiful
if you have the clarity
of communicating it.
For example, years ago I learned
to communicate to the people
I said I had around me
when I did not feel well,
that all of a sudden we feel disaffinated,
like a disaffinated violin.
I just learned to say,
you know what?
Right now I feel totally disaffinated.
I'm going to stay quiet
because I know that if I open my mouth
I'm going to say something not very constructive,
let's say, okay,
no problem.
There we saw the gift,
one, to be aware of what is happening to us,
two, to tell the other what is happening,
and three, the other is no longer worrying,
he was going to say,
are you already angry with me?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing,
simply the person is a little
a little bit nervous at that moment
and needs a little bit of space.
And we have to give ourselves that space
and know how to give space
to the people we live with.
Knowing how to give that space
is the difference
of living harmoniously
or like that,
fighting each other.
So,
it is not less important
to express the importance
of knowing how you are at the moment
and to communicate with others.
Before I continue,
I would be very interested in knowing
if any of you already had
some experience in your daily life
of realizing the effect of meditation.
We have already had four weeks,
five weeks,
have any of you already noticed a change?
Go ahead.
I have noticed that I am more tolerant,
that I let things happen by themselves
without worrying about
whether this is going to happen
or whether it is going to happen.
I have found more peace
just like in my family,
because before,
if they did something bad,
I was upset,
and now I have realized
that I was starting to be more tolerant.
Wonderful,
wonderful, thank you.
I think we don't take
as much time as we say.
Don't worry, anyone else?
I still don't.
Okay.
So now I want to give you
very specific ideas
of how you can remember
in your daily life
to practice full attention.
It is not a matter of having to sit
for half an hour.
Of course, that is part of
what I hope you will continue
meditating,
ideally half an hour every day.
It would be wonderful.
But what I am referring to now
is small reminders during the day.
For example,
some people put a little letter
here or there in their house
that the letter says,
attention,
for five seconds,
check how I am.
It can be a letter,
it can be
when the phone rings,
we have the habit
that if the phone rings,
I don't know why, we have to run
to answer the phone.
What do you think,
if they wait two times
when the phone rings,
they breathe deeply
when the phone rings.
Why do we have to run?
And not only does this
benefit you,
but you will be much more present
for the person who is calling you.
Another classic is when
we drive.
Take into account
when the traffic changes
and it is red,
if they are like that,
all nervous,
so
now it will change to green
and ask,
at this moment
it is not useful for them
to be anxious,
but
the semaphore invites you
to be the reminder
of full attention.
Twenty seconds
or what lasts the semaphore
is a little gift
for you.
Take about three,
four deep breaths
and see,
how am I now?
How do I feel?
And maybe you can do
a few
meta prayers,
that is,
that I am calm,
that I am in peace,
that I have well-being,
etc.
Well,
you can see that those details
are very small and,
however,
they are gathering little by little,
like the pearls of a necklace
and suddenly they already have
for a necklace,
only the thread is missing
and there you go,
a beautiful necklace.
Little by little,
it is a gift.
Something beautiful happened
at that moment, they are present.
Something that we did not
do
yet is to learn
the meditation walking.
But although we have not
learned yet, it is something that I
highly recommend you try.
If any of you
who I imagine are the majority,
manage daily
to go to work,
the station may be
one square, two squares
more removed from where they go.
Before getting off the car
they simply say
my intention is
that I will walk
with total presence
here at my work.
I will not start
to advance to think
what I am going to do at work
nor that I will forget
to give the plants in my house.
I will simply walk
with all tranquility
and give this space
of my car to work
to be calm.
Before I tell you
where I want you to apply
full attention to an activity,
I want to mention
the question of
not only
helps us a lot
to have daily meditation,
but they choose a little place
simply a corner
it does not have to be anything big,
a corner in your house where they put a chair
they say that is my place to meditate.
It helps a lot because
when you see that place
they make the connection
there is where I meditate.
Put a little detail
something
some simple object
that gives them
something of inspiration
it is not about going to buy anything
do not buy anything please
an autumn leaf
they put it there
an autumn leaf is beautiful
it reminds them
it is a special place for you
it is simply to create
a place for you
an amazing
activity to attract
full attention
is to eat
and I want to do an experiment
with you now
with the food
that is,
I bring you snacks
and what I'm going to ask you
is the following
I'm going to pass this bag
and each one takes two snacks
do not eat them
put them in your hand
and we are going to do an exercise
ok
sorry
only two
after the class
if you want more
I give you all the snacks
but for the exercise
we only need two
while passing
the snacks
there is something I want to
mention
it is extremely
important
to use
specifically in meditation
in moments
when you feel exhausted
bored
upset
discouraged
in general
in that moment
specifically is when
I recommend you
to try to sit
they will not want to be
guaranteed, I tell you right now
because when you are sitting
in a gray humor
I do not know why
I want to do what helps you less
but
simply as a child would say
just sit for five minutes
five minutes
sit
and then check
after five
maybe once you are seated
they want to stay
a little longer
after five or ten minutes
they want to change
do the experiment
I ask you
to try
at least once in your life
there is no problem
if you return
on the weekend
or whenever we see each other
you know what, it did not work
the truth is that it helped me
more to watch television
and eat five or some biscuits
ok, I accept it
try
pay attention
the next time you feel lazy
all of them
like crazy
all of them
look how the weather is
you feel like meditating
and see what happens
does it change or not
and honestly
describe
did I do better
or not
or if I had perhaps turned on the TV
and I would have eaten an ice cream
just answer that question
ok
well
everyone has steps
ok, so
let's see
this is a very simple exercise
in which we are going to observe
to have just a very small test
of
what it is
when we bring
full attention to eating
for many people
eating unfortunately
is very connected
to many traumas
many emotional issues
that my mother forced me
to eat
that
when I was little I was fat
and I got injured
because my parents wanted to put me on a diet
etc.
there are a lot of traumas for many people
not for everyone
but for many there is a lot of emotion
connected with food
that is nothing more to say
to put in the background
so let's see
I do the exercise
with you
we put the steps
we have them here in our hands
ok
look at these steps
and
in the mind you describe
as if you had to describe
someone who is blind
what color
they have
in the mind they describe
what shape
they have
if they touch
what texture they have
if we touch
what color they have
the steps
now
I'm going to ask you to close your eyes
and very slowly take
a step
and take it to the mouth
observing carefully
what happens
when they take the little step
to the mouth
for example
they noticed
how the salivary glands
immediately activate
when one is about to put food
in the mouth
for some reason the expression
when we eat
water in the mouth
now
describe in your mind
the taste of the little step
observe
what happens in the movement
when they chew
how the little step
moves from one side
of the mouth to the other
the taste
of the little step
changes from the beginning
to the end
or remains the same
more or less
now observe
when they are ready
to swallow
and when they are ready
you decide
when they take
the little step
and in silence
you observe
the experience
of the little step
imagine that we eat like this
I assure you
there would be no problems
of weight
of indigestions
if this is something
that we have
as an option
in retreat
it is a very interesting experience
to eat
because one always eats in silence
the food
in retreat
is marvellous
because the senses
are totally agudized
and if we can
remain with our senses
in this way
agudized
we will not be
totally manipulated
by our desires
because we will be
totally conscious
of what you are
you are
there is so much suffering
in the people
who are so disconnected from their experience
that they are looking for more
to achieve this
this exercise so simple
this exercise so simple
ok, someone has
a comment
if you are fine
if they are weird
if they did not connect
if there was nothing
there is no problem
sometimes one is ready for something
So...
Yes, the other day too, did you hear it?
A little closer, yes.
Also, one of the exercises that you put one of the tasks for the house was to make a food like this.
Yes.
And it was a task that was done.
It's great.
And it's the same as now, I said, wow, because I don't do this all the time, right?
And it's like that, because for me, for example, eating is something like that.
I get ready for the food and when I'm eating I'm thinking about the following.
Yes.
And...
This is the opposite.
Bravo.
I love it.
A very dear friend of mine who is from Germany did this exercise and then he told me,
you know what?
I discovered that I bought bad wines.
That's what happened to me.
You never know what you're going to discover.
Anyone else?
I focused so much on eating that I forgot the position of meditating.
Are you okay?
And for me it's very difficult to eat space, because always since I was a child it was
just to eat, because if you were going to go to school or the time of the recess to eat
it was just to eat, because if you were going to go to class and it's always been that I have to do something
more, so I have to eat fast.
So it's very difficult for me to eat space.
But now it became very curious because I really enjoyed it and I don't know, it became
something beautiful.
It's great.
There it is.
It's very simple, but I don't know why we don't do it anymore.
It's not just that we wanted to eat slowly and pay attention.
We eat much more than everything in life, everything we do.
Ana María, how was it?
Did it work for you or not much?
No, it didn't work for me.
It worked for you?
Yes, yes.
That's why I usually eat slowly.
Oh, okay.
Naturally you eat slowly.
Slowly, yes.
It's great.
Good habit.
We go with the science of the flavors of everything.
It's great.
One of the great advantages of eating slowly is that it gives time to the stomach to give
the message to the brain to say, I'm satisfied.
If we eat fast, we already know what happens to us.
We eat more than what is due and then we feel fatal.
And then we get fat too.
But well, it's good to remember.
Remember that the nice thing about this practice, Buddhists, is that it doesn't
handle the sense of guilt for nothing.
Imagine how wonderful.
For nothing, guilt is handled.
But when something catches us, we put our feet in, it's a question of, okay,
the next time, it could be better.
It's like, this opportunity caught me.
But the other one.
That's the way we work with these teachings.
Something else that I want to touch now before our long meditation is how we bring
full attention to speaking.
It's a very important and difficult topic.
Because you speak and you get the words out so quickly and so easily that when you
don't realize it, we put our feet in.
There's an interesting expression that says, it takes one year to be a good friend.
And only one prayer to destroy friendship.
I mean, you have to be tremendously attentive.
My father told me, be careful because with the words, you can hurt and hurt someone
more than with a blow.
So, the more careful we learn to do with the words, the better.
It's very nice to bring full attention to the question of speaking because the same
qualities that we need at the time of our meditation, we need them to really
listen to someone.
I mean, it's this true attention, I'm here in the present, I'm listening to you.
I really like something that says, girl, it says, in a conversation, the one who
listens is the one who is loving at the moment.
So what we want to pay a lot of attention to is, how often do we interrupt?
In a conversation, do you realize when you interrupt?
How often do we take our opinion as our most important opinion than the others?
Why do we say what we say?
With what intention are we saying what we are going to say?
How many times do we say something to raise a little bit of ego?
We need to be aware.
And when you start to be aware, you start to notice it in others.
And then it's when you have to bring a lot of bondage, to say, ok, this person has not
realized yet what is not necessary.
It's going fast and fast.
Something I want you to remember, since the time is going, in Buddhist teachings,
it is said that when one is going to say something important, we take a moment to ask ourselves,
is it true? Is it useful? Is it opportune? Is it gentle? Is it bondage?
If you can answer yes to this five, go ahead.
If you can't remember the five, at least the first three, is it true? Is it useful?
Is it opportune? Because sometimes it's not the time to say something.
Ok, so there is more, but time has not gone, and I want to leave time to have a little
talk about what is going to happen for the weekend.
We have ten minutes. You tell me, what do we do?
At least we had the first meditation and the exercise with the little steps.
Or we do a meditation, let's say, ten minutes, and we go about ten minutes more to
dialogue a little bit about how we continue, or if we continue, or we don't have the
meditation and we dialogue a little bit now and we go to the nine exact.
Option one, who prefers option one? I mean, meditate, meditate and then we
have ten more minutes left. Option two, and some none.
Ok, so we meditate for ten minutes and then we dialogue about how we are going
towards the future. So, we take our posture again, very straight,
stabilizing the body, closing our eyes when we are ready.
Let's pay attention to how the body feels at this moment.
It's different to how the body is when we start the class and meditate for the
first time. Is there a difference or not?
If there is anxiety, let's just give it a name.
Anxiety. If there is fatigue, let's say fatigue.
There is a way to balance anxiety, we are going to give it a little more balance
if we do the longest exhalation. I invite you to try.
If someone is feeling a little bit of anxiety, take a deep breath
and the exhalation, do as long as possible.
If someone is feeling especially tired, it is the inhalation that we are going to do
as long as possible. It is as if we were affining a very good musical instrument.
Now we observe our body.
See if it is possible to feel the pulse, the breath of the heart.
If there is a strong sensation in the body, let's pay attention to that part of the body.
If there is pain, let's pay attention to the area where there is pain.
Let's try to soften that area little by little.
Even if it is only around the area of pain.
We feel appreciation for ourselves, for being here, for looking for new ways to live better,
to live fully.
Let's try to remain as quiet as possible. Let's see if it is possible not to move in the following minutes.
It is interesting to notice, before we move, that there is the desire to move.
It is possible to breathe deeply.
Try it.
Softening the neck.
Checking that there is no tension in the posture of the head.
It is possible to breathe deeply.
We are aware that we have reached the end of our introductory course.
Softening the shoulders.
What texture is the silence?
Notice how everything constantly changes.
We have silence a minute or two, or a second or two, and then a sound arises and disappears.
Let's remember that all of our emotions, the most difficult, the most unpleasant,
our triumphs, our joys, everything we can bring to this practice,
we give everything the hug of acceptance.
We breathe deeply.
We slowly open our eyes when they are ready.
