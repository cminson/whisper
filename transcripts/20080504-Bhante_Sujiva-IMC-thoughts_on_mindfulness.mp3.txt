The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good morning everybody.
It's too short a time to say anything much.
So I'll say as much as I can.
And since this is the Insight Meditation Center,
I'll talk something about Insight Meditation.
Particularly on certain points that are critical to progress.
When I started coming to the West,
a number of things amazed me or surprised me.
I will not say about many things that surprised me.
One of the things was the Yogis in the West were told not to expect.
We never hear of this in Asia.
Not that we don't expect anything.
We expect many things, but we were not told not to expect.
But I suppose here people expect more.
I think expectation comes with hope.
And without hope, it's very difficult to strive for anything.
So it's not a matter of not expecting or expecting.
It's a matter of expecting it in the right way.
Not too much.
Because we strive and we don't expect for results,
I think the striving won't be very strong.
Expecting and craving for results are two different things.
So this gives me a reason to give this talk today.
Which is certain critical points for the progress of insight meditation.
Here I will use my experience as an example.
Not that I'm going to tell you all the secrets,
but I will tell you something.
Firstly, you can say like many of you who are not born Buddhists.
People look at me as an Asian monk,
and so I must be a Buddhist.
No, I wasn't.
I'm an ethnic Chinese from Southeast Asia,
and we are basically materialists.
We have a patch of Confucianism,
but really that isn't too much.
Secondly, my first language is English.
Because I lived during the early colonial days,
the British were the colonial masters of Malaysia at the time.
And so from young we were taught to learn in English.
We even taught about English history, which has nothing to do with us.
My father was a civil servant, so he spoke to us in English,
besides sometimes in Chinese.
So I came to Buddhism as a start of an accident, or blunder,
because we were all labelled as Buddhists.
Anybody who is not a Muslim, or Christian, or Hindu, are Buddhists.
At least I'm not, I'm thinkable, or never thought of.
And so when I started, I had to discover that I was supposed to be a Buddhist,
so I started learning about Buddhism.
There was more of curiosity than anything else.
Anyway, to cut the story short,
I finally ended up doing something like meditation.
I started originally with Zen.
Not the Zen that most people know of, it's more of the Chinese Chan.
And to make another story short, I also ended up as a Theravada monk.
To us, during those days, it didn't really matter which type of Buddhism you came under.
Buddhism was Buddhism to us.
Now, when I was studying the Zen under the Chinese master,
I did get results.
And that was basically what made me decide to try being a monk.
Yes?
I don't suppose you are too interested in all that small details.
Actually, it's my reason to go straight to the point.
What happened is, although I did get genuine experiences under the Chinese Zen,
when I came to Theravada Buddhism, Bipassana,
I found I took to it quite easily.
This was because of the British education.
They are also quite structured.
Then I found it was quite unstructured.
In fact, a little bit lost.
The teachers say something to you and you get very aware of some things to do with your existence.
Something like that.
When I took out the Bipassana, everything, the Theravada, was also very structured and very analytical.
And so I took it to it happily.
Now, when I started taking to it, I started to pinpoint and emphasis was on mindfulness.
I'm sure you have heard of that, Amtin Times.
So, when I heard about this mindfulness, I began to ask, what is mindfulness?
And so I started digging into whatever texts I could get in English.
Many, unfortunately, weren't very clear.
For example, the characteristics of Sati, first they talk about Sati as to remember,
which does not seem quite right to me.
Then it started, the characteristic is plunging onto the object as a plug that sinks into the water.
And I thought, this also doesn't make too much sense to me.
It sounds like concentration.
And so one after another, manifestation is coming face to face with the object.
Again, it doesn't really, it's a bell.
Anyway, I picked up whatever I can and made sense and went on from there.
This has something to do with my Chinese background.
Because a China man is basically a pragmatic person.
When you come to meditate a China man, you don't give him all the philosophical and theoretical crap.
You tell him what to do.
If he works, he'll follow you.
If he doesn't, forget it.
That was the China man in me.
So I took to it and somehow it worked somewhere.
I went on from there.
But later, after coming one big round, I discovered that actually it is a very important point.
It's a starting point.
But fortunately, in my case, I had good teachers.
When I needed the right teachers, they were there.
So the first important factor, I think, in the progress of the practice is having your basics right.
The basic techniques, the basic understanding right.
Many people have started, like I could have been me, going on the wrong track from the very start.
For example, this mindfulness is not so easy.
So I don't blame myself.
Because it is a state of mind.
And mindfulness takes different forms.
And mindfulness is an experience, not words.
How would you point to an experience with words?
It can only give you a right, rough guide.
So from the very start, I tell people what I think is this mindfulness.
And this is usually given in the beginning of a vipassana retreat.
And I tell them, the first thing, you must get your mindfulness right, which is right mindfulness.
I'm playing with words, sorry.
Which is pure presence, to be totally and completely present.
And when you're completely present, you have also right concentration.
Concentration basically is a total involvement of the mind in a certain direction.
Sometimes they use the word object for the direction.
But if you use it as a pure mental state, it's a total involvement of the consciousness at the present.
Don't think who is present.
Don't think what is present.
Just be completely present.
I think if you can get that idea right on the point, you're getting the right method.
Because all other methods and skills and techniques revolve around this.
The reason being, reality or truth is here and now.
Even when you say here and now, it's also a concept. What is here, what is now, you can ask.
You say whatever is present is here and now.
So that's basically what mindfulness is.
And according to the teachings of the Buddha, if you realize what in reality is truth, there's no ignorance.
And from that, all the other causes of suffering are not there.
And the way to perfect peace is right there.
It's as simple as that. It's too simple.
I suppose that's why the earlier commentators did not say too much because it was too simple.
You cannot be simpler.
You see, when you're totally present and totally involved, you're totally plunged in whatever there is.
And when they say the object, the object of vipassana, which is a reality.
And when you're totally completely present, you can't face to face with reality.
And that's a vipassana object. It's just a matter of being totally present.
And if you say, I must be present, that's the first step, but you must not even think of present.
The present itself is a concept of time.
After all, what is present, you tell me.
So that is the basic first idea of vipassana.
All other techniques revolve around that.
Now the second thing to remember in this basic technique is
the next thing around this total presence is the wholesomeness.
The wholesomeness of this consciousness.
That means there is no delusion, there is no craving, aversion in all the negative states.
There are these basic wholesome qualities of peace, clarity and gentleness or softness.
And one is totally present with reality, this automatic becoming.
This second level, we call it kusala, impali, wholesome, wholesome and unwholesome, yes?
It's basic quality.
Now this has an important implication because many techniques, if you just follow it literally
or mechanically, it goes into an unwholesome state of consciousness.
So this second wholesome state is an important part.
And it is this part which most teachers start with.
Because the first step is too simple, too direct.
So you have a second step.
You take one or couple of steps back.
And so what is mindfulness?
Mindfulness is clear awareness, clear, peaceful awareness of what is going on, what you are doing here and now.
So what are you doing?
And so you have the basic meditation objects, rising, falling, sitting, touching, in, out and all that.
And how to bring it there and watch it continuous.
And when you go watch, have a continuous mindfulness, you bring it closer and closer to the reality of the here and now.
Or the timeless reality to be more accurate, yes?
So I don't have time to do all the tools in detail, yes?
But generally I give you that in the sense that to get your techniques right, the principles right.
Different traditions have their approach of dealing with the matter.
Once this, often somebody will ask me, Pante, is Vipassana the only way to realisation?
I said yes. Then you are not happy.
Because they think Vipassana is just watching rising and falling.
So I qualify my statement.
I said, Vipassana means realisation.
You are asking, is the way of practising to get realisation the way to realisation?
Of course.
I mean it is not the question, but generally that is what I wanted to point out.
All the techniques which are correct should bring about realisation, right?
It doesn't matter which tradition you come from.
You can be Theravada, you can be Zen, you can be Jackson or whatever, Tibetan.
They all should come to this, because there is only one truth, one reality.
There aren't too many of them.
Either it's real or not. If it's not real, then it's not.
If it's real, it's real. Simple as that.
Then, so when I started practising,
the next thing that gave me the extra progress,
is the intensive retreats.
Well, I've heard of it.
The first time I heard of this monastery,
it became four o'clock, three o'clock,
frightening, to meditate the whole day from morning to night.
Being young and enthusiastic and idealistic, it was not an obstacle.
So I went for it. Wow, that's such a thing in Malaysia itself.
I'm going for it.
I went for it.
It isn't as difficult as you would think.
When everybody is doing it, you can do it.
Once I started, I was trying out with a few people who are more experienced,
not very experienced, maybe.
So I started a programme of two hours sitting.
One hour walking, two hours sitting, one hour walking, two hours sitting.
No problem.
Even for certain people who are quite new, it was no problem.
They sat for two hours, they sat for two hours.
A little more pain perhaps, but it was okay.
The mind could take it.
But usually, you go one hour, one hour.
Here they do 45 minutes.
But what is important is the continuity of the practice.
There are certain factors that are helpful.
In real life, you meditate and go back, and thousands of things will bother you.
Then you start again.
I would not say that there is no progress.
Usually, I notice people still progress fairly well and far.
If they are, I would call them die-harders.
Whatever happens, they'll sit.
Even they're half-sick and half-dead, they'll sit.
They're very regular.
Day by day, they sit.
After a while, you can see steady progress in the insights, development.
Other than that, I think most people need to go for retreats, intensive retreats.
Because of the continuity, firstly.
Because one of the factors which is lacking in daily life is the concentration.
The mind needs to be concentrated.
Then it's clear and open without any thinking for a while to realize what's going underneath.
Otherwise, all the thinking and the concepts, you cannot see properly.
So it has to be completely open and clear to see what is happening.
And this is often, especially for beginners, possible only during intensive retreats.
After that, then when you go back to daily life, it can still go on.
Now secondly, during intensive retreats, there is this close guidance.
Ideally, the interviews are held every day.
Many things happen to you in 24 hours.
When you sit so many hours, many things happen to you.
And often you don't get much time for interviews.
You try to give 10 minutes.
Sometimes they only get up for to give you 5 minutes.
Now 5 minutes is insufficient to say all that is happening in all those hours.
But you can summarize.
But imagine if this is happening and you don't get an interview once, only get once a week.
So how much guidance do you have?
And at the beginning, you really need some guidance.
You notice that many people think they can get everything from books.
I suppose you can get quite a speed.
But many of things are still in the oral tradition.
And especially with experiences, how do you describe your experience?
Especially an experience that you have not come across before.
It's more effective one-to-one.
When a teacher interviews you, generally he knows your state of mind and what's happening.
This is generally accepted in Asia.
But in the West sometimes, because people rely a lot on books.
It's very strange.
At one time I was in Houston and there was, in this temple, I was holding some retreats there.
And this man came to the temple and says,
I said, do you go to retreats?
He said, retreats, I don't go for retreats.
It's not necessary to go for retreats.
People go to retreats because they want to socialise.
That's what he said.
Besides, he said, you look at it, he borrowed a few thick books.
All the great masters have said what they want to say in these books.
So why do I need to go for retreats?
It's a bit arrogant, I think.
But it's not without reason.
So I think retreats are very important.
It makes a big difference.
Then there are other methods.
Tentative, which are always short.
If you stop at ten, isn't it?
Now, in the tradition I came in, and probably many of you are also allied to the Mahasi tradition.
They use the four foundations of mindfulness.
Satipatana.
And so it's called Satipatana Vipassana.
Inside meditation, based on the four foundations of mindfulness.
I think this is a very good tradition.
Very start.
Especially for beginners.
And most people are still beginners.
It starts with a very strong emphasis on the body foundation of mindfulness.
Rising, falling, sitting, touching, breath, walking.
All these are body foundations of mindfulness.
The importance of the body foundation is strong grounding.
Generally when we teach the body foundation of mindfulness,
when you naturally, sooner or later, would come into the other foundations.
Feeling, consciousness, and mental objects.
And when a person embarks on the body foundation of mindfulness,
how the mental development takes place, we know.
This is like a first test when you go to the medic,
and you go to the hospital to keep taking your blood and all those things.
The first try, we know how your mind responds.
Because from there, the seeds and fundamentals of the other foundations
are also found connected with it.
And so, you can be led to the development of the other foundations
when you have the aptitude.
But sooner or later, all the foundations have to be developed.
There are also other traditions that teach other foundations.
For example, they teach more on feelings, more on consciousness.
They are more specialist in that sense.
But I find that if a person is not really grounded in body foundations of mindfulness,
it is very difficult to progress otherwise.
Because it connects to your daily life. It connects to everything.
But once one has reached that foundation level,
then one should expand on the other foundations.
Many of the people in the tradition are watching a lot on body and feelings.
They don't go too much into consciousness.
So, when I started going into this in Malaysia,
in Malaysia, there is also an S-Conservative School.
So, when I started teaching about consciousness, they asked me,
Who taught you to teach like this?
We never learned this from our side-offs.
Things like that happened.
I said, well, the Buddhists taught it.
And this is also another very interesting field.
The body foundation is the grounding and the base.
The feelings are the foundations of what?
Emotional happiness.
Although watch feelings, the introduction is pain.
Not very nice.
But when you get more into the foundation of feelings,
you develop mastery of the feelings.
You can be happy whenever you want.
You can change, transform pain and whatever into pleasant things.
Things like that. That's the foundation of feelings.
And because of that, concentration deepens.
Life becomes very pleasant.
Because they have discovered the fountain of joy
because of the feeling foundation of life.
So, don't be turned back by pain.
It's just the beginning.
But when you go to consciousness, then you meet with a boss.
Because in Buddhism, we say that mind is the forerunner of all states.
All are mind-made and created.
So actually it is the most strategic in the terms of meditation techniques
to reach up to the foundation of consciousness.
Because everything in our practice, everything in our experience
are connected to consciousness.
So if you reach to there, then you get to the boss.
The key that connects everything.
And so you discover how this consciousness works.
Because the whole of meditation is about consciousness.
What else?
Mental development, mental cultivation.
Even the happiness and suffering are all mental, as people know it.
So I started working on this different way.
Because people don't tell too much. Books don't tell too much.
The most I got are from the suttas.
So I always go back.
It's the same thing that I read.
But every time I read this new discovery,
there's something that came along which gave me another extra lift.
This is the study of the Abhidhamma, the Buddhist metaphysics.
Fortunately for me, a meditation teacher is also an Abhidhamma scholar.
And so he taught us Abhidhamma.
For example, in one hour talk, he would just give the talk on one consciousness.
And he'd give the whole hour all on that consciousness, for example.
Because there are 89 consciousnesses, so it takes quite a while before we go through all that.
So when I started learning into the consciousness,
we know this is theoretical. Even some people say this is not a Buddhist word.
But let me say that this has been endorsed by the Sangha,
by the entire Theravada Sangha.
So it is something that is worth seriously considering.
We don't just wipe it out because it is not in the sutta,
so it's not in the later century or something like that.
And from the practice, many things can be validated.
But more important is that it gives you many clues to the deeper aspects
and finer aspects of the practice.
I'm still slowly discovering more and more things.
Because it is highly structured.
It has classified everything in the universe in little square holes.
And there's nothing left for you to put anything in.
But if you study closely, there are loop holes.
Why are these loop holes there?
Then you started discovering that there is something deeper besides what they say.
And so where is the best place to find out?
It's in your meditation.
So you look at the consciousness.
Because you study consciousness, mental states,
and you meditate, you automatically look at them.
And if you are curious, you look deeper into them.
And so it becomes a whole avenue for further discovery in vipassana.
And after that, you go into dhamma and vipassana.
Dhamma and vipassana, I would call the highest form of vipassana.
That means the essence of vipassana is in dhamma and vipassana.
As before, when I read all these things, I said,
What is dhamma and vipassana?
The common translation is mindfulness of mental objects.
Now, that is again something I didn't quite ring a bell.
Because the word dhamma has many meanings.
Then I think, when you talk of mental objects,
everything can be a mental object, fair enough.
But so what?
It seems to me more like a search for a word that suits the translation
rather than the practical application as it is meant to bring about.
Then one day I read a book.
It's a Thai book.
And he talks about the four foundations.
Then he hit a note.
He says, dhamma here means natural truth, phenomena.
It's just as I had learned in Abhidhamma.
dhamma, nij sattva, nijivo, sunyo.
Not the being, not the soul, emptiness.
And they describe it according to the four-fold analysis.
These characteristics, its function, its manifestation, and its approximate cause.
All phenomena are defined, identified in that way.
For example, your teacher, how does he know your teacher?
Because he teaches.
The function is to teach.
And people have seen you teaching.
Something like that.
So the characteristics are natural phenomena like anger, greed, mindfulness, concentration.
All these are natural phenomena, including hardness, softness, heat, and so on.
All these are natural phenomena.
And he says that that is the actual meaning of dhamma-nupasana, meditation of phenomena.
Then it rings a bell.
Because it gives you the practical aspect of it.
And when you study Abhidhamma on this phenomenon, it tells clearly about this non-self, which is a natural truth.
Many often people define, give a negative definition of non-self, anatta, no self.
Ah, it's a negative prefix.
Atta in self, so no self.
They translate that way.
It gives you what it is not.
But it doesn't tell you what it is.
So you are left with that empty space.
And something else may fall into the empty space, which may not be correct, you know?
Because usually what happens?
So I find the more correct thing is dhamma, which is natural truth, natural phenomena.
When you have no concepts, no ideas, things are there whether you like it or not.
It is there.
And so I use that as the meaning of dhamma-nupasana, which means contemplation of natural truths,
which of course include everything.
When you have this right of mindfulness in all its steps.
From the first level, which are, we call it the paramatadamas, ultimate relatives.
Again, this is so misnominal.
It shouldn't be ultimate.
It's not ultimate.
Only one of them, the one that is ultimate, the rest are not ultimate.
The rest are non-conceptual experiences, more correct phenomena.
And so as you practice on, it goes deeper into their deeper natures, which again we say
is impermanence, suffering, non-suffering, which very often is also a negative definition.
These deeper aspects are understandable because no words can describe it.
Any words that I use, I find are more instructive, rather than define definitive.
So anyway, so Abhidhamma has this important aspect of lifting up one's practice and understanding
one's practice to progress into the citta and dhamma.
Forty-five.
One more thing.
Now, after some years in Asia, I came to the rest, started teaching.
Not that I came to teach.
I came as an escape.
I fled from responsibilities.
In Asia, the movement is very strong.
When I became a monk, it just started.
My teachers started the movement there.
And by now, it's a lot of people.
So I was teaching from morning to night.
I hardly had time to go to the toilet.
And so I didn't become a monk to do all this.
I don't mind teaching and sharing what I know, but this is too much.
It defeats the life of a monk.
So I fled.
And I had some friends in Australia, but they were too near.
Because all you need is a ticket when you go there.
So I had to fly across the Himalayas.
Not many people know places in Europe.
For me, I only know one or two friends.
So I started with my small groups.
Mainly because I could meditate most of the time.
Of course, it's increasing now.
So I fled.
And of course, as a monk, teaching is part of the profession.
If you can call it a profession, can you call it a profession?
It's part of his life.
If people ask you something, what do you say?
You don't talk about television shows.
You talk about the Dharma, right?
Sometimes, once in a while, you do if people ask.
But I haven't seen television for a long time.
So I can't say much.
So now, when you come to the West, it's a different kettle of fish.
It's quite a mixed pot.
Because in Asia, I wouldn't like to use the word sectarian.
People in certain strict groups, and they go deep into the practice,
does not mean that they hate the other groups, although some do.
It does not mean that they are very involved with their form of practice.
Now, when they come to the West, there are many groups.
There are Zen groups, Tibetan groups, Tunuban.
There are Osho groups as well.
I don't know whether Osho groups are still here.
There are so many other groups.
So when you talk to a group, there are so many people.
And especially when you teach meditation.
They come from all types of people.
And I go to so many countries, which further makes it more varied.
So when you try to teach the people, you try to teach them from where they are.
Understanding their culture and so on.
And so this becomes quite interesting for me.
It's quite refreshing.
I don't have to use the old ways of dealing with the method.
And besides, people are more individualistic.
So you treat each individual with a certain specific method.
There, sometimes they are quite homogeneous.
I sit there, a whole lot of them.
One come, I'm like a factory in a factory.
Okay, after listening, something wrong with you.
Twist you a bit.
Next.
Twist a bit.
Next.
Because they are quite homogeneous and they are quite standard.
Once in a while, you are odd ball.
That livens me up.
Wow, what is this?
But here, people are quite different.
Quite different.
So this makes me feel that it is possible
because the Dharma transcends all these cultures.
Reality and truth transcends all the cultures.
All you need to do is speak in their terms and their language.
And so you find that it's able to reach to these people
and they can progress in the Vipassana, in the meditation, whatever you call it.
Now this has also a benefit for me itself.
Because you know when we used to want things for a long time,
there are a lot of dark masks and things which are put in the institution.
Which are not wrong.
It's not wrong.
It's more often more for the safety of the beginners.
But they are there for so long and you take them for granted.
And when you go further, they become actually various.
Because you take them as just word for word.
Later, with all these things coming out, my mind became more open.
And so it's able to see more of the path as it is.
Not as a path strictly outlined by any tradition.
And I find this also very important.
And this I get only when I came over to Europe.
I did a lot of meditation by myself in the Swiss mountains and things like that.
So there is this very important basic quality for improvement,
which is important from the very beginning.
A few things.
First, insatiable curiosity.
There is something that I have. I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
If this is what I'm about, I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
Secondly is, which means that you're always wanting important
because always you must be looking further.
If you see something what's more, what's more, you must keep looking up.
It's one very important.
Second, connected with this is the willingness to transcend and go beyond.
Many people are very talked up in their little secure world.
And so it's difficult for them to let go.
For example, after some time there's a further step going.
It's like going into unknown territory.
You don't know what's going to happen in your mind.
So there has to be a degree of, I call it, the faith in the beyond.
Then third is openness.
And this is difficult.
We think we are open, but actually often we are not.
There are so many things in our mind.
We are open, we are not thinking, but they are there.
The betters are there.
Let's give you an example. This is not an example actually in the meditation,
but something like that.
When I first came to Europe, now I'm resident in Europe, about over eight years ago.
Because of all these things in too much work down there,
I escaped for my first time to Europe.
And after three weeks of meditation, I said,
I don't have to go back.
Why should I go back?
I don't need to go back, so I'm not going back.
You see, sometimes the things they put into you, you have to go back,
you have your responsibilities, you have all these things.
And I don't have to go back.
I can carry on here.
So it's just the idea of the certain things that are limiting you.
And once you take them off, a whole new world opens to you.
So meditation is also the same.
There are many things that are blocking our views and we don't know it.
Take one example maybe.
When you meditate, people often have a sense of eye there.
Sometimes they don't think, when I'm meditating, no, I don't have a sense of eye.
But it's there.
Once you start recognizing this more subtle presence of a sense of eye or ego,
it blocks.
But once you recognize it, the blockage is removed.
Then you go to a completely new phase of experience.
Take just one example.
I think I will stop here, thank you.
We're short on time.
We have one question.
I have a friend in Malaysia that used to come.
He would dress with a bit strange.
He's an elderly man but he throws us up to here.
It's rather short because it's rather short.
So he wears the trousers up to here.
We call him a Malay woman.
Because a Malay woman usually wears the trousers up to here.
He always comes around.
Master, one question.
After that, it goes around a few times.
I was coming at one question.
So I asked him one question.
Yes.
I was thinking about the first three fetters and one of them is letting go of ethical practices.
Sometimes I feel like that gets in the way of one of two.
Oh, I can't do this because that's...
But then there's...
I was just thinking about when those things actually become a blockage.
Because I do feel like sometimes I'm grasping onto ethics.
I'm wondering what that process is like.
Are these really the ethical principles that I'm adhering to for wholesomeness?
Or are they institutional things?
Yes, you should question.
You should question.
Yes, yes.
Everything is questioned in Vipassana.
Even your own mindfulness and your own reality, everything is questioned.
But you also need to have some faith.
Because too much questioning gets skeptical doubts.
You must have enough faith as well to try out.
But more important, the questioning is not skeptical.
The questioning is to find out why and what.
When I first went to Burma that time, it's still very traditional.
And so the teachers generally are authoritative.
They're authoritative teachers.
So I was brought up in the militia, British education.
We are a strange freak.
Because outside we are Asians.
Only inside we question what is he doing.
You know, they bow in front of the monks.
At the back they laugh at them.
What is he doing?
But inside they go like this.
But I have enough common sense to try out longer.
So yours is not the reason why.
Yours is but a do and die.
So I didn't die but I tried.
I would live before I die.
So anyway, after studying with them for some time,
I found out they have reasons for saying certain things.
It's just that they don't feel that it's time for you to understand that yet.
So eventually I understood that.
And that's why I started writing some of my first books in Vipassana.
Because there are enough wise people, the wise type of people in Malaysia.
So that became generally the basic text we use in Malaysia for Vipassana.
Because I started saying why we do this, why we do this.
If you question the reason why and you know that it's valid, you follow it.
The only trouble is you may need somebody to tell you.
If you can't find out you may need somebody to tell you.
And sometimes you always can somebody to tell you.
Suppose there are enough people here, teachers, to tell you the basics.
Sorry I don't have time, I've got another group there.
I'll have to fly back tomorrow.
