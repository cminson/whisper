So continuing this conversation about the teaching, the Buddhist teaching on not self. 
Last week there was a question around bringing a kind of a compassion to this exploration around self because one of the main ways that we've been talking about exploring or kind of getting into understanding not self. 
And this is true in many areas of Buddhism but we understand the wholesome qualities or the beautiful qualities or we understand the way we understand something is by looking at what gets in its way and so the way we can understand the way we can to understand the teaching of not self is by getting really familiar with what we think of as self with what we with what we how we identify how we constrict there how we how we believe ourselves to be a somebody. 
So the the question came up as I was talking about it because often our senses of self not always but often our senses of self are kind of connected with areas of struggle ways that we get constricted. 
For myself one of the big areas of selfing was around self-hatred and that was a very painful identity. 
Miserableness another very painful identity but it's helpful too to also notice that there can be counterposing identities so for instance along with that self-hatred identity the identity that thought I was no good I was a failure was this kind of identity that I occasionally kind of hooked on to which was I can do this I'm maybe the best meditator in the room or you know so there was there was this kind of flip side of the identities and this this may happen it doesn't always happen but it can be interesting if there's a particular flavor of an identity you see often to check and see if there's kind of the counterpoint identity to it and you might find that one of the identities is preferable so I certainly preferred it when I felt like I was successful when I felt like I was doing well but what what I discovered in this kind of exploration of this back and forth was you know I felt like the problem was in the side of the identity around self-hatred that that was what had to go away that what I was supposed to feel all the time was to feel like I was successful like I was good at things and what I discovered was that that identity of feeling like I was good at things was a need it was a kind of an ideal that was a setup because I couldn't always feel like I was successful and so the the kind of opening to that side opening to the side of seeing oh this is the identity of feeling like I'm successful that was helpful because then I could start to see how these two played off of each other and so we start to see what I talked about in terms of the compassion piece last time question that I started with years bringing compassion to this exploration it's useful to to recognize the conditionality you know that that these identities are often conditioned always conditioned and in my case around the self-hatred part of the conditioning was the setup of feeling like I always had to be successful so then seeing this back and forth seeing this weaving back and forth helped there to be a little bit more compassion around the the side of the self-hatred so there's a lot there's a lot more to explore in that terrain of what I was just talking about exploring identities but I want to speak a little bit more about the compassion side just for a couple of minutes so we can bring some compassion somebody asked how can we bring compassion to this exploration of our identities and that was that's one piece around recognizing that these identities especially the ones that are suffering especially the identities like for me the identity of self-hatred you know I didn't decide to grow up having that identity you know I didn't choose it it was conditioned it came because of a whole host of conditions that I actually began to understand and see including conditions of my of prior generations you know that it wasn't just about me in this generation that there was a connection to prior generations it kind of a generational kind of passing down of patterns and habits seeing that was really helpful to feel like yeah it's not my fault this is happening this is just conditions unfolding and yet there is a way that we have to take responsibility for the continued unfolding of it that that's this in this moment the arising of these identities and the taking responsibility is really being curious about the identities and as we can begin to hold them with some compassion it it does become easier to to investigate them to be curious about them so that is one side of it that we can bring compassion to the the investigation itself and then also I've seen that the the investigation of our identities can open us to compassion so I want to give an example and the way that I think this happens in them in general is that as we see and understand our identities as patterns and habits and how much suffering is created out of that as we start to see that this unfolding being is following its conditioning it kind of it kind of opens the mind to seeing or recognizing that everybody is in this same boat we're all like tumbling on in these conditions and there's a poignancy to that it kind of almost breaks the heart in a way when we see that when we see the the amount of suffering that is happening as a result of these kind of constrictions that happen so an example yesterday here in the in the Bay Area I know some of you aren't in the Bay Area in California but here in the Bay Area we've been having a really big heat wave and on Sunday a line of thunderstorms came through and lightning kind of sparked hundreds and hundreds of wildfires throughout the state of California and we are now in a pretty pretty dire situation many people are having to evacuate and the smoke is pretty bad and I woke up yesterday morning of the night before I had had to close everything down because because the smoke was had gotten so bad you just have to close all the windows and there's a lot of heat so you know the heat gets trapped inside and so it's kind of miserable you know just basically pretty uncomfortable and as I went to bed it's like well maybe the wind will change in the morning and maybe it'll be okay and I woke up yesterday morning the wind hadn't changed the air quality was really bad and I had to stay closed up all day and in that morning as I was preparing breakfast I was feeling really grinchy I would say you know kind of grinchy I was annoyed with the way things were going in the kitchen and and immediately it's like okay what's going on you know what's happening and I could I immediately saw that it was connected with the conditions the the fire the smoke the heat the challenge of all of that and as I was seeing it it's it came it was immediately clear that what the mind was rebelling against was the uncontrollability of the situation that I didn't get to decide if I opened my windows and you know let let the air blow through because it you know to cool off the house I didn't get to I didn't get to do that because doing that would create conditions I have some lung issues so it create conditions where I couldn't breathe and so couldn't do that so the uncontrollability both of my body and of the of the conditions of the smoke now last time I think one of the main threads I talked about in terms of selfing was this identification around control you know that that when that that sense of we feel good when we're in control you know it's like that when when there's a sense of I can control what's happening there's a sense of I know what to do I know how to do it I can do what makes me feel good so there's that there's a kind of a feeling of okayness and that that comes when we have that control but when that's pointed out to us that it's not that it's a that it's kind of like an illusion almost of the control then then the mind gets frustrated and it's it kind of bumps up against and I was pointing out last time that that if you notice you're getting frustrated around things being out of control right there that's not self you know that's a teaching that's a pointing to the to the exploration of not self and so that was what arose in my mind yesterday morning as I was exploring it's like oh right this is not self I don't get to choose this this is just the conditions there's the external conditions of the smoke and the fire there's the internal the conditions of the body there's just all of this is conditions unfolding and there's some suffering around it the heat the the difficulty breathing it was even a little bit difficult breathing in the house because you can't keep it perfectly sealed and so that was there was suffering there but as I as I explored this you know looked at this and kind of saw the that not self nature of this just being conditions unfolding my heart kind of opened to not just my own personal conditions my own body my own like house with its you know leaky seals that let smoke in it was it wasn't just about my own conditions it's like oh there are people all over the world who have challenging conditions who can't breathe or who are in pain or and and that just took my you know it expanded the the sense of the compassion so broadly and so this is this is another pointing to what happens as we begin to do this kind of exploration as we explore our own identities our own ways that we congeal around an eye or a me or mine that exploration can open us it can break that it can break down the barriers between self and other you know it kind of it that's another piece that actually I want to point to and probably talk about more next week or the following week maybe that if there is a sense of others you know that that the sometimes we kind of us and them me and you you know if we find ourselves they and theming you know it's like we sometimes I me and mine you know we sometimes have that running around in our mind 95% of our thoughts seem to be related to I me mine and then maybe the other four and a half percent are related to they them that they them is a form of something it's it's an I it's a it's an identification of other so I sometimes call that other ring that's a phrase that some others have also used that that the this exploration around selfing also we can begin to explore when we are other ring when we are creating identities for other people that's when we're creating identities for other people when we are they and theming we are implicitly me and my me so so that's a that's a way to to to begin to also see a different form of of selfing and so this exploration around self around looking at the the sense of self exploring how selfing functions in our minds it it can open us to compassion it can break down barriers between ourselves and others essentially what I want to say here is that studying identities studying this way that we self is not selfish you know as I was thinking about talking about this tonight I was feeling I was really kind of connected to the larger suffering particularly right around me where within the space of you know a radius of about 15 miles there are multiple fires burning and people are evacuating and and I was just asking this question you how does this teaching of not-self like how does this connect to this whole thing and and it really struck me that the the compassion that can come through investigating and exploring our own identities is a way to to break down these barriers between self and others and open us to compassion exploring not-self exploring the teaching of not-self exploring our own identities in the in the process and I think I've shared several times I think in this in this series the famous Dogen quote to study the way is to study the self so that's what we're doing we're studying the self we're studying our identities and then Dogen goes on to study the self is to forget the self through studying the self the mind begins to understand that it's not a thing actually it the that what we take to be self is a process it's not something that's solid or stable and as we begin to be curious about our identities we start to see that and as we so to study the way is to study the self to study the self is to forget the self to forget the self is to be awakened by all things and so this the study of our identities is a way that we're studying the self what we're doing there is we're studying one of the deepest the found one of the most foundational delusions in our minds that leads to suffering actions that arise out of this delusion are responsible for so much suffering in the world far-reaching consequences now we may we may not every every action out of a sense of self necessarily has those far-reaching consequences but I think we can all think of certain situations or people or times where we have seen a sense of self creating far-reaching consequences so it's not a small thing to do this kind of exploration I'm saying this too because sometimes we think or we feel that the practice of looking inward of exploring what's happening here is somehow you know disconnected from the world you know that we're stepping out of the world or something to do that in some ways though what we're doing is stepping into the the world because the what we're seeing as we explore our own hearts and minds is a reflection of what's going on in others hearts and minds and that is where the compassion is born isn't seeing that similarity that we share with others well yeah that well that's I have so much more to say about studying identities maybe that will be the topic for next week we'll go into studying identities you know I talked a little bit about let's see if there's one piece I want to bring in just for today I talked a little bit about those counterpoint identities I talked about selfing and othering just a little bit here here's a here's a piece that I want to point to another way perhaps to come to the compassion piece as we're exploring our own identities often I think our senses of self are at least some of them some number of our senses of self because we all have many many self senses of self this is actually some part a part that we get to see as we start to look at our identities and a part that begins to undermine our belief that any one of them is kind of the stable solid self because we begin to see we look at this one for a little while and then it's like oh yeah that's me and then suddenly another one pops in and it's like wow that one doesn't have much to do with this one so there's there's kind of this recognition that they're just these things that we adopt these stances they're like stances we adopt and some of those stances some of those identities that we adopt have been created as strategies for taking care of ourselves you know they're the there are those those strategies that we learned when we were kids about how to navigate our families and our our you know school grounds and their you know their their their strategies that potentially have kept us safe their strategies that have navigated us through perhaps even threatening or dangerous times in our lives and and so they they they may have been you know the only way for us to survive some of those strategies and so sometimes we can bow to them and say you know thank you for getting me here and now let's take a look at whether it's still necessary so I want to leave a little bit of time at least for some comments and questions and I would like to record the comments so just to know that I will record you're welcome to type into the chat box if you'd prefer not to have your voice record it but I'm also happy to to take questions live in the chat box however however you want yeah Joe so sometimes when awareness is clear and kind of coasting in it. 
I find myself starting to struggle with the awareness because I don't have a clear identity. 
It's kind of a panic. 
And so I start struggling to form an identity which creates suffering. 
And so then I try to form an identity that doesn't try to form an identity. 
And the only thing I can really do is just kind of write it out. 
And if I write it out then awareness sees what's happening and then there's wisdom about it. 
And it just kind of all, it kind of resolves itself. 
But identity is like addictive. 
It is. 
It absolutely is. 
So one thing, you described a process that I think does happen at times that when we come to a place where there's more or where there's a less of a sense of self. 
It's unfamiliar, let's say. 
It's a little bit maybe ungrounded. 
It feels a little wobbly. 
It feels like we don't have an orientation that we're used to. 
So that's where the discomfort comes from. 
It's that unfamiliarity with the experience, the sense of like a little bit of ungroundedness. 
And so that's a place that I think, you know, and so your reaction, so you notice the, did you say anxiety? Well, it's just kind of a thrashing. 
A thrashing, okay. 
I need to get control back. 
I need to form an identity. 
So there's a feeling of uncontrollability as well then. 
Yeah. 
So I think that that's a place to just explore that. 
So you're noticing the thrashing. 
You're noticing the lack of control. 
Sometimes you can actually step more into that vulnerability. 
That's the truth. 
Sometimes a wisdom reflection in that place of like, yes, this is true. 
This is the uncontrollable is true. 
You know, it's, it's, that's the nature of a deeper kind of nature of experience. 
And so sometimes wisdom, a wisdom reflection there might help the mind to hold that, maybe hold the thrashing a little bit, the feeling of discomfort around the uncontrollability. 
So if you can, if you can kind of recognize, okay, there's uncontrollability and there's discomfort with it, you might be able to land there for a little while. 
But, but the pattern or the habit of trying to form a sense of self, like, there's got to be somewhere, there's got to be somewhere I can land, there's got to be something I can hang on to. 
Yeah, I have watched this pattern many times. 
And sometimes that's what you do, you do just get to watch it, you know, and, and, and rather than trying to stop it, because, you know, we can't stop it. 
It's, it's the habit, you know, sometimes we can, we can be aware of the whole vulnerability piece. 
And there can be a kind of a hanging in that space in the discomfort of that space, hovering there. 
And, and we can, we can maybe watch the sense of self kind of want to emerge, and not quite fully form. 
So you can, you can play with that. 
But mostly what I will encourage is just exactly what you did. 
You know, it's like, yeah, watch it unfold. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, thanks. 
And this is not an uncommon thing, you know, to happen in the course of practice. 
It's a, it's, it's like an edge of the practice when we come up to that place where we're hanging out in that place where there's not so much sense of self, it feels really disorienting. 
And it's kind of like the mind has to adjust to that, to that disorientation. 
Yeah. 
Thanks, Andrew. 
Yeah, thanks. 
Anyone else want to Jill? Yeah, Jill. 
I don't know if it's helpful, but ditto, Joe. 
I have a different set. 
Mine kind of goes into confusion. 
And then the thrashing, it's just a perfect word. 
And I'm, I'm not meaning to wallow in it, just that it's, it's kind of helpful to hear that it's, it's a part of the process. 
I have a sense that wisdom mind is in there somewhere because I have a sense that it's just where I should hang. 
Absolutely. 
And sometimes the thrashing is around trying to figure out what am I supposed to do with this? You know, so there's a little bit of thrashing around us and the practice, like the identity of the practice, I'm supposed to be able to look at this in a certain way. 
And if it can, if it can be held in the, in the sense of, oh, this is just part of the practice unfolding. 
Sometimes the mind doesn't have to thrash around it. 
It's just like, Oh yeah, you get to this place and it feels uncomfortable and you want to not have that. 
So there's the tension and tightness. 
But sometimes the thrashing is kind of more connected to trying to figure out how to be mindful of this in some way. 
And, and maybe, maybe you can just let that part go, you know, sometimes the wisdom reflection of this is just the path. 
This happens on the path that can create conditions that allow there to be a little less thrashing in that scenario. 
Yeah. 
And it's time to stop now, unfortunately. 
But I'm happy to hang out for a couple minutes.
