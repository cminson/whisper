Let's surround you.
You
Maybe there's noise inside you.
There's noise somewhere out in your environment, the road, sound of my voice.
But between the noises you're surrounded by silence.
As we settle in, just listen to that silence.
You
You
You
The noise need not interfere with the silence.
We hear sounds, inner sounds, outer sounds, but we also might have the sense of being surrounded by silence, by even sense of the silence running right through us in moments.
And so we relax everything that can be relaxed.
And we listen to silence for these first couple of minutes.
And we listen to silence for these first couple of minutes.
We listen to silence for these first couple of minutes.
And we listen to silence for these first couple of minutes.
And we listen to silence for these first couple of minutes.
We listen to silence for these first couple of minutes.
And we listen to silence for these first couple of minutes.
We listen to silence for these first couple of minutes.
We listen to silence for these first couple of minutes.
We listen to silence for these first couple of minutes.
We listen to silence for these first couple of minutes.
We listen to silence for these first couple of minutes.

Just holding the whole body in awareness.
Awareness of this whole constellation of sensation.
Sensations blooming and collapsing.
Unpleasant and unpleasant.
Intensities and subtleties.
Some places in this field feel very dense.
Other places feel more airy run through with space.
We quarrel with nothing.
We become devoted to awareness as we hold the body.
We're welcoming your body into awareness.
We're welcoming your body into awareness.

The spotlight of attention.
To the world aside for now.
We are clarifying body experience.
Meaning that in the light of this attention.
We perceive our bodies with more precision with higher resolution.
What was one solid thing becomes a jumble a constellation of movement of change.
The intention is to pay attention to change.
We develop higher definition picture of these body sensations.
So we unify, we clarify.
Then we call a truce with the imperfection of the moment.
Any given moment in every given moment.
Something could get better.
Terrorized.
By this possibility of fixing of maximizing of acquiring.
Owning.
We can fidget our way from cradle to grave trying to erase the first noble truth.
Please, please let us stop this.
Just for now let us stop this.
Let us make a truce with samsara with imperfection.
We do this at the level of the body.
Allowing all sensations to have.
There the natural course of birth and death.
To be as pleasant or unpleasant as they might be.
This is equanimity.
We unify, we clarify.
And we make our truce.
And we rest.
Thank you.

In these last couple of minutes, knowing the bell will ring soon.
Just practice protecting nothing.
Brace.
Brace against nothing.
Just let the world of sensation fully rush into awareness.
Be still.
Be still.
Be still.
Be still.
Be still.
Be still.
Be still.
Be still.
Be still.
Be still.
Be still.
Be still.
Be still.
Be still.

So stay close in today.
Just try to be nurturing something wholesome through the day.
Mindfulness in every moment, it might be that what you're doing,
non-distractedness is the practice or tranquility is the practice.
Of course, maybe it's mindfulness.
But keep that thread to the Dharma in one way or another.
So we'll keep going together.
Some folks have meetings in 10 minutes or so.
And hopefully you're feeling supported by the Sangha, supported by the Dharma,
supported by awareness.
Good enough.
Thank you.
