 Tonight's talk is for mostly to... Boy, I can't speak today... is for it to mostly be in appreciation of mindfulness of the body. Mindfulness of the body, the body's mindfulness is something which is very important for me and has been a very important gateway to my own practice, to deepening my practice. And I sit in my own practice with a tremendous amount of joy and appreciation of the sensations in my body, the feelings in my body, what goes on in my body when I open to it, when I become sensitive to it. And I find it kind of a miracle, kind of miraculous, what happens in the body as I sit, does I bring mindfulness to it. It seems that the body in some ways loves attention, loves being penetrated with mindfulness and awareness. And it loves it and responds in usually positive ways by the presence of awareness within it. And part of what we're doing in mindfulness is to overcome the kind of withdrawal of attention from the present moment, from our lived experience, so we can be more in our lived experience, experience our lived body more than just living in our thoughts and our ideas. And I just think it's kind of marvelous, you know, and I sit here, when I sat down here today, when I first sat down I was uncomfortable in my body, and I could see the tendency for me to start thinking, oh, this is going to be a lousy sitting, and maybe I should kind of get up and do some stretching, or maybe I should, you know, this is not going to, I'm going to have a bad time today, you know, whatever. It's very easy to kind of go off in thoughts about the meaning of this discomfort, about thinking about what it means and what it's going and what I need to do with it, and having kind of an objective relationship to it, as if it's an object and I'm here and I have to do something about it and react to it and be upset about it and all that. But rather than doing that, what I did, which is what I do in my practice, is I yield myself to the felt sense, the physical experience of what's going on in my body, allowing it to be there without any sense that it has to be any different, without any sense that, without kind of getting cut up in the ideas and judgments about what I have and what it means and where it's going. And then what happens is I do that, is I just feel and sense my body, be with my breath, allowing it to be whatever way it is, uncomfortable, comfortable as it is. The miraculous things is at some point it begins to shift or to change. And it's not really, it's almost like I can't watch the change or I'm kind of aware of it, but what's miraculous about it is that I'm not the doer of it. It's not like I can see actually what actually causes the change. But after a while I found myself today sitting kind of in a bubble of warmth and kind of warm, soothing kind of pressure and wonderful sensations of vibration and pulsing, kind of organic biological sense of just being alive in the flow of living sensations within me. And it was a delightful place to be, and the more I could be there in that kind of delightful flowing flow of sensations, the more satisfied and more pleasant the meditation was, though I didn't think about it. I didn't get cut up in those thoughts either. I just kind of was with it. And then at some point near the end I could feel that my thoughts began kind of getting the upper hand and I started kind of following certain thoughts. And when I noticed that what's happening, I would go back into the felt sense of the concerns. And sometimes there was no felt sense of the concern, but sometimes my thoughts had a little bit of an emotional charge to them. And I would yield myself to the felt sense, the physical felt sense of those concerns of that emotion as a way of grounding myself back in the present moment in the body itself as a way of getting out of the way, as a way of leaving it alone without getting caught by something. So I say all that, perhaps as an expression of my appreciation of how important mindfulness in the body is for me and what an avenue it is for presence. It's very easy I think to reflect about the body, to have various thoughts about it, about both kind of negative and positive thoughts about the body. But one reflection that I have thought about recently is the body that we live in, the body we experience and have and can touch and feel, is all the material of this body is completely recycled material. I think that's kind of marvelous. Way before recycling was popular. It's all this. And when I was a child, my father would, he had this kind of thing, he would teach me about how, you've probably all heard this, that there's so many molecules in a single glass of water. That the chances are pretty good that the glass of water that Julius Caesar drunk, that there's at least one or two molecules of his glass in the glass of water you're going to drink today. Because all these molecules used to disperse and there's so many billions of molecules I guess in a glass of water that somehow it circulates in probably at least a few. And it gets more interesting. Probably some of the carbon molecules that went into creating Cleopatra's skin is down in your skin. Because of the way that it cycles and recycling of nutrients. And it's marvelous I think to reflect on how this body that we have is this creative, is a result of the creative and energetic coming together. Creative energies of this planet, of this earth, the earth, the land and the sea and the water and sky and all this stuff comes together. And through this kind of amazingly creative process, it gets recycled or cycled or created into this body that we have. And it's kind of miraculous. And the more medicine and more science learns about the body, the more it seems to be miraculous, the more it seems the incredible amount of sophisticated balancing and monitoring the body does for itself. And that's completely outside of our choice and outside of our knowing. We think we're in control. And 99.999999% that's going right in their life is completely outside of our control and our doing, at the least. So it's easy to reflect I think about the body, what a marvelous instrument, marvelous piece it is. But mindfulness practice is more than just reflection. It's not reflecting nice thoughts. Though it can often be useful to reflect, reflecting can often change our perspective in often radical ways. And to realize that, for example, to realize, to reflect and to realize that there's much more, who we are is infinitely more than what our preoccupation is, what our identification is. And to realize that, you know, what am I then? If I'm not my preoccupation or my identification or what I've said I am all my life. You know, we're so much more. And to realize that, even to get hints of that, and then to kind of either relax into that realization or be in awe of that realization can shift the person's perspective quite dramatically. So reflection can be important. But mindfulness practice is not reflection. It's not thinking about things, not thinking about the body or about our life or about anything at all. Mindfulness practice itself is, rather than being reflective, it's actually more, I think, more receptive. It's a receptive practice where we receive to us, within us, to awareness the experience of being alive and all the aspects of being alive. And the beauty of mindfulness is that none of our life is considered to be outside of what we can become aware of, what's the domain of attention, of bringing attention. There's nothing which we cannot become aware of in our experience. However, our physicality, our physical experience, our physical senses is given some priority, usually, in mindfulness practice. Of the whole, you know, mandala, various kinds of experiences we can be mindful of, there's an emphasis in mindfulness practice to yield ourselves, to turn ourselves over to our felt sense in our body. And in Asia, it's usually said, maybe a little bit more, less maybe poetically, more matter-of-factly. But it's recognized that the tradition of mindfulness that we come out of focuses, centers itself on mindfulness of the body, on sensations in the body. It's centered and includes everything else that goes on, but bringing ourselves into the felt sense in the body of what's going on is one of the central things we do in this practice. And it's very, one of the reasons to do it is it really is a powerful way of overcoming the strong tendency we have to objectify our life, to objectify our experiences about life, to live in our thoughts, thinking about things, thinking about the meaning of things, thinking about, we want that thing, or I don't want that thing, or this body, you know, my face, objectifying our life. Objectifying my face and saying, well, I need to kind of, you know, even Bob Dole now has objectified his face. I think that he had this surgery, plastic surgery of his face to kind of get out the sags, getting ready for the next presidential campaign, I guess. I think that's very important. But in order to do that, that's having an objectified relationship with your face. And it's not that it's bad to do that, but it's about, you're doing something about the face. And this is kind of often, I think, the way the doctors relate to our bodies. A doctor sees you, and the doctor, some doctors will see you kind of mechanically. Your mechanical being, and this is wrong, and he or she is going to go in there and fix it and take care of it. And it's completely as an object, a physical object there, which is very different to live inside your body and experience it in a sense subjectively. And it's a whole different game, a whole different context, a whole different nexus of phenomena that comes together when we allow ourselves to experience it. And we can experience the body subjectively. If you treat it objectively, the tendency is to kind of want to manipulate it. To treat it subjectively is to allow the inner understanding of the forces, the emotions, the tendencies, the intentions to clarify themselves so we can kind of maybe change things from the inside. For example, you see a lot of people, especially on retreats, where if you sit for a long time, the body starts becoming kind of tight and uncomfortable. And you see people kind of beginning to go like this, you know, as if this is going to make a big difference, you know, kind of stretching and doing it. It's a good thing to stretch, generally. But when you do this in meditation practice, you objectify your discomfort, your tension. You're treating it as an object that you can somehow manipulate and change, kind of from the outside in a sense. What we do in mindfulness practice is we don't do that, but rather we yield ourselves to the felt sense of that tension. And we experience the tension from the inside, because only that will get to the root cause of that tension, to the holding, to the fear, to the resistance that's caused it. But if we go out and get a really good massage, we might feel really good. But the massage is not going to get into the inner subjective experiences, the causes for why we're tension-tense in the first place. So to treat the body as an object, as an external thing, misses out a tremendous amount of information about what's actually going on that sometimes is important to pay attention to. So I suspect that a lot of the suffering we experience in our life arises out of our objectification of things, treating things as object. In a sense, one of the heresies of Buddhism is considering things to be objects. Things are out there, in a sense, they're true objects, and you're here as a subject receiving or relating to that object. Of course, it's true in some sense, but it's not the complete picture of what an experience is. Today, I don't know if some of you saw it, but there was the biggest rainbow I've ever seen in my life. You see it over Palo Alto? It was not only the biggest arc, I don't know how long, but a big piece of Palo Alto. All you have to do is look up, and you would have seen it too. In Mountain View, too. But it was huge, it was really round. It was really wide, the arc itself. I don't know, it was the biggest thing I've ever seen in terms of a rainbow. I think part of what a rainbow is is our subjective experience. It has to do with the felt way in which our eyes respond to light and see what's going on there, see the diffraction of what's going on. If we're not looking for that rainbow as if it exists out there as a true object, you're going to spend a long time looking for the pot, the golden pot at the end of the rainbow. We all know how foolish that is. But a lot of our experiences, everything that we experience out there, all the things that we experience that belong to the world out there, are experienced through our sense-tours, through the contact of the world with our eyes and ears and nose and tongue and the body and skin. And so in a sense, and it wasn't a pun to use the word sense, but I mean I wasn't thinking, it was thoughtless. But in a sense, the world of our experience is actually very, it happens within this bubble of sensations. And then built on this bubble of sensations, we build meaning, we build associations, we build contexts that explains it to us, which is often fine. We need to do that to some degree in order to kind of get around. But what happens to human beings is we build on those objective relationships and we objectify more and more and more about what the world out there is about. So one of the things that mindfulness students pay a lot of attention to is the five hindrances. And the five hindrances are usually ways in which we get preoccupied with objects out there so that we lose our attention in the present moment of what's really going on. So the first hindrance, for example, is desire, getting lost in desire. So we all know, you know, desire usually has an object, something we want. And it can be very tight, the world can be very narrow if we're very, if we're focused on getting that desire fulfilled. And sometimes, you know, the world is not so accommodating to our desire. And so, you know, it's not so easy to get it. So we can actually be very, very focused and, you know, in kind of manipulating the world or preoccupied about or fantasizing about it. And in a sense, when we get lost in desire, our world gets smaller and smaller. We're dealing with objects out there. And what's often interesting then is to turn back into the felt sense of that experience. What's the felt sense of the desire? So rather than doing away with it or rejecting the desire as being bad, but rather than kind of, you know, pursuing the object, the thing that we've objectified, what we do in mindfulness practice is we turn ourselves back into the felt sense of that experience, of that feeling having a desire. And often, if I do that, immediately I feel a little bit more space in the experience. When I'm kind of focused on the object, I kind of feel narrow in my mind, in my body, kind of contracted slightly. And if I turn back and open up to the felt experience, how it is for me to be full of desire, it's like there's a little bit more space around it. And it feels as if I'm not so controlled by the desire or the desire is not running me so much. I'm not a slave to it or whatever. So there's a little bit more space with that desire then. And then what gets interesting is once I kind of start feeling the felt sense of the desire, sometimes that felt sense opens up to a deeper cause of that felt sense. I mean, how many of us have been filled for desire for something? And really the motivating force was our loneliness, for example. It could be many things, but for example, we feel lonely. And we want to fill our loneliness with something. And so there's a desire for food, there's a desire for entertainment, there's a desire for friendship, for contact with other people, in a way that's kind of objectifying and reaching out, looking outside of ourselves for something which is a solution. What we do in mindfulness meditation is we turn back into the felt sense of that loneliness. That way the loneliness isn't kind of in control, isn't kind of driving us in a certain direction, but rather some kind of space around the loneliness that we can just feel it honestly and kind of sense what it's like. So the second hindrance is hate or ill will, usually, aversion. How many of us have been, someone said something to us that was painful, hurt, might be true or might not be true, kind of maybe was offensive. And then we've attacked the other person as a response. We've treated the other person as an object to somehow alleviate our discomfort. Though I didn't do that, you did it, or whatever. We often find blame in other people for our own discomfort, things that are uncomfortable. And what we do in mindfulness is we stop objectifying when there's aversion or hate or ill will. We don't reject it, we don't exactly stop the hate, but we stop objectifying, we stop looking outside at the object and preoccupied about who it is and what it is and what has to happen to it and all that. We turn ourselves back into the felt sense of that experience. What is that experience like in the body? And you can feel often the contraction, the tightness, the warmth, the heat, the fire that can be there with ill will, the resistance or fear. And to feel it directly as a felt sense. And again, you feel a little more space than around it. It's easier to be with it when you feel the felt sense. And the beauty about the felt sense of the experience is it allows and respects the experience. You're not rejecting it or pushing it away. But the felt sense of the experience is not an objectification. The felt sense is not about something else. It's not about what I think about her or him or that particular thing. It's much more closer, it's deeper, and it's much more in the feeling level, the emotional level of what's really going on. So in mindfulness practice we're constantly coming back to the felt sense of the experience. And you can almost use that as a mantra. You notice what's going on in the present moment. And you say, okay, this is what's going on. What is the felt sense of that experience? What does it feel like to have that kind of experience in my body? If it's thoughts and they're very compelling, often there's an emotional, energetic felt sense connected to those thoughts. If it's desire or hate or restlessness or anxiety or sleepiness or thoughts about doubt, there's often a felt sense to that experience. And what is that like? So we turn ourselves back into the felt experience, feeling the tightness, the contraction, the looseness, the openness, the pressure, the tingling. Allowing it to be there, but being careful not to objectify that experience also. Being careful not to say, oh, I'm contracted. This contraction is bad, and what do I have to do to get rid of it? And maybe if I kind of just bring my mind, my attention carefully and kind of laser like and focus on it, it'll dissolve it. You know, we have some object, we have some idea about it. What we're trying to do in mindfulness is not to live a life that's about anything. How about that, for a definition? Often our life is a life of aboutness. We're thinking about things and about what will make things better, about what we think about things, about what happened yesterday, about what's going to happen tomorrow. As opposed to living in the felt sense, living in the living experience of being alive right now. What comes out of us, what's being expressed, what's being felt in our lived body. Because we're only alive in the moment. And to be alive is a marvelous thing. And to feel our lived experience coming through our body, I think is one of the delightful things to experience as a human being. The aliveness and fullness of it all. And it's wonderful to feel the flow and the change and the joy of mindfulness is very peculiar. And the joy of mindfulness is kind of different than happiness, which happiness might be kind of fragile. You know, happiness comes and goes or whatever. But the so-called joy of mindfulness practice is the joy of being willing to be open, be willing to experience, be willing to feel without blocking, without resisting, without prejudice or bias, whatever it is our felt experience is. That's a kind of joy, even when it's uncomfortable. When I sat down here this evening and felt this discomfort in my shoulder and my head and tightness, it wasn't comfortable. There was no doubt that it was uncomfortable. I started to talk myself into saying it was really comfortable and nice. It was definitely uncomfortable. But my willingness to be present for it had a kind of joy to it. But I had to kind of drop into the felt sense because to be open to the experience you have to be there for the felt sense of the experience. Today, up where I lived, it rained really hard at some point. It started raining hard. And my thoughts at first were, oh my God, the rain and electricity is going to go out again, it goes out every winter. And maybe I have to leave early because I want to be sure to get down here and there might be a tree might have fallen down or I'll drive slowly, might be an accident. Oh, what is rain? It's just a headache. I left this stuff outside. I treated the rain as an object out there and I was thinking living in it. And it's important to take care of that part of your life. But I was kind of getting lost in those kinds of thoughts. When I noticed that, I dropped back and said, what is the felt experience that I'm having now, right now? What's the felt experience of experiencing the rain? And experiencing the rain as a felt experience is very different about thinking about what it means. And when I turned myself over, yielded myself to the felt experience of the rain and had a kind of delightful, even nurturing quality to it. It felt kind of soothing. It kind of felt like, you know, somehow, maybe this is silly kind of description, but kind of like I'd wrap myself up in this warm wall blanket. And I felt kind of cozy. I wasn't wrapped in a blanket, but somehow the sensation of the rain falling on the roof and the coolness in the house and the moisture was actually quite delightful to feel if I turned myself over to the felt experience. So becoming interested in this difference between objectifying our experience and experiencing this felt sense is a very useful one for helping us to rest more in the present moment in our experience. One of the ways in which we objectify our experience is by treating it subjectively. This is happening to me. It's my pain. It's my joy. It's me. You know, it's happening to me. This is what it means to me. There's a beautiful thing about mindfulness is mindfulness neither operates on the objective or the subjective realms. There's this kind of amazing space that's kind of neither. And maybe the easiest way to talk about it is just saying it's the felt sense of experience. No self, no object, no other. It's just a felt sense of experience. Have you ever been together with someone and there was no self and no other and just a felt sense of these two people being there together? It's a marvelous thing. First time it happened to me, I was out in a, I guess I was about 20 and I was out in a field of huge, I had just been tilled and I was kind of working on this farm. And this fellow worker came over to work with me or talk to me and we sat out there in the middle of this field and there was this vast sky. If you've ever been to Tennessee, it was in Tennessee and these rolling hills of Tennessee and what kind of trees they have like these, the city of trees in Tennessee. I don't know, these beautiful trees on the edge of the field and he came over and for some reason I thought of just letting go of myself when he arrived. So I just let go of myself, whatever that meant, I didn't know what it meant, I was going to let go of myself and be here with this person. And the sense of him and me being separate disappeared, the sense of the field and me being different. It was just this experience and it was just a tremendous intimacy and presence that kind of reminded me or told me there was a whole different way of experiencing the world. Then if I was only experiencing it as objects, oh him and I have to talk to him about this and I have to be worried about how he sees me and how I present myself and what he really wants from me and how I'm going to protect myself and all the kind of concerns that are about the relationship. If those drop away, what are we left with? And the felt sense of the experience is neither subjective or objective. So to learn to rest in that. So I thought in the spirit of kind of this talk, of reading this chapter from Rachel Naomi Reeman's book, Kitchen Table Wisdom, I haven't read the whole book. I just read it occasionally before I give a Dharma talk. I think it's a great book. I just kind of open it and read a couple of chapters. I think even if Dharma talks, eventually read the whole book. And this chapter is called Eating the Cookie. Another of my patients, a successful businessman, tells me that before his cancer, he would become depressed unless things went a certain way. Happiness was having the cookie. If you had the cookie, things were good. If you didn't have the cookie, life wasn't worth a damn. Unfortunately, the cookie kept changing. Some of the time it was money, sometimes power, sometimes sex. And other times it was a new car, the biggest contract, the most prestigious address. A year and a half after his diagnosis of prostate cancer, he sits shaking his head ruefully. It's like I stopped learning how to live after I was a kid. When I give my son a cookie, he is happy. If I take the cookie away or it breaks, he is unhappy. But he is two and a half and I am 43. It's taken me this long to understand that the cookie will never make me happy for long. The minute you have the cookie, it starts to crumble. Or you start to worry about it crumbling or about someone trying to take it away from you. You know, you have to give up a lot of things to take care of the cookie, to keep it from crumbling and to be sure that no one takes it away from you. You may not even get a chance to eat it because you are so busy just trying not to lose it. Having the cookie is not what life is about. My patient laughs and says cancer has changed him. For the first time he is happy. No matter if his business is doing well or not, no matter if he wins or he loses at golf. Two years ago, the guy continues, two years ago, cancer asked me, okay, what is important? What is really important? Well, life is important. Life. Life any way you can have it. Life with a cookie, life without the cookie. Happiness does not have anything to do with a cookie. It has to do with being alive. Before, who made the time? He pauses thoughtfully. Damn, I guess life is the cookie. So to stop objectifying our life and instead turn ourselves over to our lived life, maybe another way of saying our felt experience is to say our lived life. What is the lived experience of the present moment? To be lost in the objective world, to be lost in it. We need it, but to be lost in it is to be lost in a kind of virtual reality. And virtual realities are not very much fun. So, what is your felt experience? Or your thoughts? Or your concerns? Or your questions? I think it caught the first two or five hindrances. The five hindrances are desire, ill will, restlessness, lethargy, and doubt. And one of the ways to understand them is when we're lost in objects. And that's a clue that whenever we notice we're lost in the hindrances, that we should come back from the objectified world back into our felt experience. Question? What's the difference between doubt and the hindrance? Doubt is the hindrance and doubt in the way that Stephen Beschler writes about it, the face to doubt. I haven't read his book, so I can't say. What does face to doubt mean? To me? Perhaps it's the willingness to stay open. Not to settle in anything, now I have the answer. So what's the difference between that and when it becomes a hindrance? You're worried. You're worried. Yeah. The face to doubt doesn't worry about anything. Faith to doubt. It's the title of a book by Stephen Beschler. Having the faith to doubt. There is, in certain traditions, especially Zen tradition in Buddhism, emphasis on the importance of doubt. But it's not anxious or nervous or self-preoccupating kind of doubt. It's more this willingness not to settle any place as being the answer. And you're constantly holding this kind of doubt in front of yourself. And actually, in some schools of Zen, one of the primary spiritual practices they have is to maintain that kind of doubt all the time. It's kind of like, not this, not this, not this. But you stay open. What is it? What is it? What is it? It's kind of like what we do when we talk about investigation. What is this? Always staying open. Never settling for the answer. Yes? Does that mean accepting uncertainty instead of doubt as opposed to doubting or is it still doubt? Well, if you can't accept uncertainty, you're not going to make much progress spiritually. Right. Yes. It sounds like it's different but it's accepting uncertainty as opposed to doubt. And doubt is more like a fear. Yeah, maybe. I think it's fair to say. Yes? One of the five hindrances too. I mean, one of the hindrings. Awareness. Actually, the Pali word is nivarana, which means to cover. And they cover our ability to be present, cover up our ability to be aware. So it means, another word for hindrance is preoccupations. It's the five preoccupations of the mind. We're kind of lost in these preoccupations. We're lost in, you know, some fantasy of desire or lost in some ideas of hate, you know, in scheming and planning or whatever. So we tend to get so preoccupied in these forces and we get preoccupied with it, that's when they become hindrances or covers. They're not hindrances in and of themselves. Desire or ill will is not hindrance in and of itself. It's when we get lost in them. What we're trying to do in mindfulness is not to get rid of anything, but rather to strengthen our mindfulness so that we're not lost in those worlds. We can see it for what it is. Yes? Sometimes when the thought process of something is very strong, and I'm obviously caught up in hindrance along the way, what I do is, you know, I almost kind of just sort of let go and abandon it and just say, okay, come on back to the breath. Because I don't know how else to deal with it. And in a sense, just letting it go is the most skillful way, isn't it? It's one skillful way. I don't know if it's the most. I think it all depends on that particular context. So what would be another way, say, to deal with it's skill? Just keep staying with it? Stay with it without getting involved in it. Just allow it to be there. You don't have to let go of something in order to become free. You just have to stop participating in it, stop getting caught up in it. Sometimes it's a little bit of a spiritual trap for people to think they have to let go of something to become free of it. You're always turning away from things then. And all we need to do is kind of be, the mind forms become stronger than the preoccupation with it. You see it clearly for what it is. Yes? Isn't that kind of a sense of letting go? Sure. Sure. There's a difference in my mind between, again, I think it's useful to think about the objectification. Because there's two ways of talking about letting go, I think. One is as if you're letting go of a thing. And the other is you're letting go of your holding. And I think it's more useful to think about letting go of the holding rather than letting go of the thing. And if you're always focusing on the thing, the practice might get kind of problematic. So, for example, if we get angry, to let go of the anger is not to get rid of the anger, but to let go of the way in which we're holding on to it. To release the grip in the hand or in the mind or whatever, the heart. That's a sense that I have about letting go of the holding. Why isn't fear considered a separate hindrance? I know you can always say, well, you're pure of blues and something, pure of foster security, you're pure of, you know, finding a way to put fear in one of the categories, but it seems to be something that also has a lack of its own. Yeah, I don't have a good answer to that. I mean, the usual answer is kind of what you implied, is that fear is usually subsumed under one of the other categories. It's usually considered to belong to the category of ill will. It's kind of an aversion or pushing away is what they say. It could also be, fear is sometimes a complex animal. It can be made up of a number of different hindrances. It can be restlessness, there can be doubt, and there can be aversion, a number of different things kind of operating together. So I don't know. The five hindrances were described in the early Buddhist tradition as being the five powerful forces that prevent a person from having their concentration enter into a place where you're easily resting on the thing you're focusing on. So if you're focusing on the breath, there's many things, you know, we can do all kinds of things which keep us from being present, right? We're all experts at that. But as we start getting more and more present, it's these five things which are kind of the last barrier before we become, you know, one-pointedly concentrated. And perhaps in coming up with this list, fear drops much earlier. And that's why it's not included in this list because you have to already be fairly settled in order to... That's my guess, but just a guess. I don't know why the Buddha dreamt this up. Maybe he got it wrong. It certainly seems that fear lays at the root of a tremendous amount of our life. And the Buddha said that ignorance seemed to lay at the root. But when you look around at people, sometimes you wonder, you know, if it isn't fear that lays at the root. Maybe there's two sides of the same coin. I don't know. Yes? When you first started talking about contrasting, treating something as an object, instead of feeling the experience of it, the item was showing tension and moving around, you know, to relieve that tension. But there's times when that's the right thing to do to prevent purple tunnel. What's the mood of being around? What would be the experience of just you being with this kind of further intervention of past? What kind of guidelines would it be to know when I should deal with the object and when I should just feel the experience? It's simplistic or to brush you off in any kind of way, but my common answer to that kind of question is common sense. My first practice is not to substitute to common sense. And if we're paying attention, I think we can differentiate situations of when it's appropriate to kind of do something and fix something. And when our attempts to fix something actually contributes to the problem. You could be doing both. Sorry? You could be doing both. In what sense? You could be doing the felt sense. You could do both. Yeah, you could do both. In many senses of the word, you can do both in the sense that you can... And it's very useful to allow yourself to feel how the felt sense and really be there with experience for a while to get to know it so well that you really know how to take care of it and how to act. Because a lot of people act too quickly. And some people don't act at all. That's problematic. And some people don't know the situation well enough. So it doesn't wait long enough to really find out what's going on. The other day... I don't know if this is a silly example, but the other day I was running. And one of my knees started hurting at the beginning of the run. And my thoughts were, oh my God, my knees, my career depends on them. And it would have been easy for me to kind of get lost and my concerns would have stopped the run. And it just hurt for a couple of minutes here. Let's keep running for a little bit longer and really feel it and sense what's going on and give it a chance. And then I ran for another few minutes and it stopped and it went away, whatever happened to be the little thing. So to immediately fix things, sometimes we miss a certain kind of crucial information or understanding of things. So to hang out, in both senses, you can hang out and get to know it really well so we know how best to take care of it is very useful. So you can do both. It's important to do things. And besides answering common sense, I can't give you a rule. Yes? You'll be a good teacher, even if you have to sit and try. I tried that a few weeks, a month ago. We had this Sati Center class. I was a student in it. I was sitting there, you know. And you know, maybe self-conscious. You know, I think you're fully telling it right. Oh, probably not. There's only people on the Sati Center board that yeah, all the people who do hear Monday night, look at you, felt the sorrow of relief and we felt okay that we could do it over again. Great. Thank you. One of these days, I'll sit and share too. So, that's probably enough for today. Thank you.
