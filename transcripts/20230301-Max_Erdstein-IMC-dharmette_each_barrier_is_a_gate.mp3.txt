 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. When I was involved with meditation practice, Dharma practice at the San Francisco Zen Center, there was one resident who was in his, when I knew him, I guess he was in from his mid-80s to mid-90s, Lou Hartman, some of you might know him, knew him, remember him. He was the husband of Blanche Hartman, who was the abbess of the Zen Center for a number of years. And I think Lou was older than Blanche, so, and they both lived quite a long time, and into his late 90s. But I remember that Lou used to ride the buses around San Francisco and ride like the line all the way to the end of the line, and then come back. And he didn't kind of go off for the afternoon, he was very independent, and very steady presence in the temple, and always there in the morning, and always, he had a kind of few things that he did. And I remember asking, why do you ride the buses around San Francisco? And he looked at me and said, I'm working on my problems. It was a kind of unexpected answer, but such a great answer, you know. He was working on his, you know, thinking about his problems, and you know, and sometimes I think that when we're meditating, I mean, it happens when we're not meditating, well, we go on these, we go down these holes, we go down these mental, we take these mental buses to various destinations unknown, and you know, we're working on our problems. It's one of the ways we do it. But I think there's something about practice that is, addressing our difficulties is a very important part of practice. Whatever we think our problems are, whatever we think our difficulties are. In Zen, this is called the barrier, you know, that we all have some barrier, that we, that's, we're working on, we're working with, we're sitting with, we're chewing on, we're ruminating on, whether it's real, whether it's imagined. I think it's very human to have problems, have difficulties, and kind of be working on them. So maybe we could say in this teaching that I shared earlier in the morning, happiness is what's right now, happiness is what's happening right now, minus our expectations. You know, maybe we could say the barrier is our expectations, that's the difficulty, that's the barrier. And so we come to practice because we have difficulties, and then the sort of strange thing is practice doesn't say, okay, we're going to take away your difficulties right now. What practice says is, I'm going to give you some new difficulties. You know, so you thought you had the difficulty of all of the expectations and all the things I want or the stresses in my life, but now I come here and I have some new difficulty. I have to find out how do I sit still and not move and not get up and go check my phone and go to my car and go get a cup of coffee. How do I just stay here? And how do I stay present in this ordinary moment that's not particularly special, not particularly interesting? So practice gives us these difficulties. It gives us difficulties that we need to somehow figure out. I remember one of my teachers, Mel Weitzman, used to say, in practice, you can't stay and you can't go. It's impossible. You know, it's impossible. And, but somehow when we're faced with something that's impossible, when we're faced with a barrier, an immovable barrier, we, it stimulates something in us. It brings something out of us that we didn't know we had, that wouldn't have been elicited if we hadn't put ourselves in this position. So we, whether it's we come here and we sit with each other, whether we're doing our practice at home, we're giving ourselves some challenge. And the trust is that even though it's impossible, we find out how to do it. I think someone once asked Suzuki Roshi, who is the founding Japanese Zen master, founded San Francisco Zen Center, and said to him, if practice is impossible, how can we do it? How do we do it? And the student said that Suzuki Roshi just looked at him and said, you do it every day. You know, every day we come up against difficulties. Every day we meet what's challenging. And if we're lucky, it sort of brings forth some, another level of awareness, another level of consciousness. And so I think about that. You know, it's easy to, I think it's very human and very understandable to want to avoid what's difficult. And I think a lot of our life and probably a lot of our economy is rooted in, you know, the path of least resistance and avoiding what's difficult and putting, distracting ourselves. So maybe we can say that meditation practice is kind of a practice of non-avoidance. We're coming here in this somewhat constructed artificial container to be with and meet whatever is present, whatever is alive in this body, whatever needs care and attention, whatever is alive in this heart, in this mind. And to just meet it and be with it, I think it's a powerful thing and it's a profound thing. And it goes against, I think, our instinct, which is to often to not deal with things, to avoid them, to distract ourselves. Because there's a payoff to that, you know. So we should expect and understand that when we sit down and when we walk and when we're willing to be just in this ordinary moment, some difficulty will arise, some impatience, some unpleasantness, some discomfort. And so how do we relate to that? Is that a mistake? Is that a problem? Is that a sign that we're not doing it right? No. I think it's actually the opposite of that, that when difficulty arises, when this barrier, when we come up to this barrier, it's like, yes, okay, this is my practice. This is what I'm here to be with in this morning, in this sitting. And it's not that we figure it out cognitively. It's that we just sit with it and we breathe with it. And we notice all of the ways that this difficulty is influencing us and coloring our experience. And we sit with it and we accept it the way it is. But something in that acceptance, in that being with, maybe the barrier is transformed, or we're transformed. And so, in Zen, there's this collection of stories, collections of koans, which is called, sometimes it's called the gateless gate, or the gateless barrier, or the no barrier barrier. And what I think it's pointing to is that every barrier is also a gate. It's like every barrier, every obstacle, every difficulty is an opportunity to practice. It's a Dharma gate. So it's the gateless gate. Or maybe we can say everything is a gate. When we see it that way, everything is a Dharma gate. We imagine there's some special gate, there's some special doorway. If you're a meditator and you're into meditation, maybe it's the jhanas, or maybe the gate is working with some particular wonderful teacher or master, or going to some special retreat, or special talk, or it's like, that's the gate, that's where we enter. But actually, it's like each moment is our gate when we see it that way. And so then, we can be grateful for our difficulties and the barriers that we're inevitably going to come up against. Because those are the places we enter, the practice. The barrier is the place where we meet ourselves. I was thinking about the barriers that we can come up against with other people in relationships. And it's kind of inevitable that if we're in relationship for a long enough time, there's going to be some conflict, there's going to be some difficulty. In my family, it's like every 20 minutes with the kids. What's going on now? I remember when I was going through some relationship difficulty many years ago, and was talking to a teacher, a Dharma teacher about it. He said something that I've always remembered. He said, with this conflict, with a deep conflict in a relationship, there's only three things that can happen. Either the relationship ends, and that's how the conflict ends, because the relationship ends, or the conflict sort of gets ignored, and the relationship kind of stagnates. Or the third thing was that the conflict is an opportunity for the relationship to go deeper. And it sort of reconstitutes itself. In working through that conflict, the relationship reconstitutes itself on a deeper level. And I really love that. It made so much sense to me. It doesn't happen all the time. But what if a conflict with another person, a difficulty with another person, is an opportunity to get closer to that person? And in the kind of honesty and vulnerability that it takes to talk about a disagreement or a difficulty, we get closer, we feel closer, there's a new level of understanding and relationship. So, you know, the other thing I was just reading about was, there was a story in, I don't remember which newspaper, but it was something I was reading online about a mother who was talking about the journey that her family was on as her young teenage daughter of 13 or 14 was being treated for very serious cancer. And anyway, I felt very emotional reading about this. And one of the points that the writer was making was that because we've had to face this huge difficulty, you know, in all these different levels, what my daughters had to face, what our families had to face in going through all this together, we know how to face what's difficult and what's challenging, and we don't shy away from it. And one of the examples that she gave was that she took her daughter to see a film that was about the Me Too movement. And I can't remember exactly what the film was called, but I think it's a well-known film. And it kind of dealt with some of these issues of what young women face in certain industries and sexual harassment very explicitly. And when the mother said that to another mother, oh, you know, my daughter and I went to see this film, the other mother was like, is that an appropriate film? Or, you know, is that, you know, it was kind of a little bit like, oh, I don't know if I want to show that to my kids right now. And this writer, you know, she understood that, and then she realized that having gone through these tremendous challenges in a different area of life, she doesn't feel like she needs to protect her daughter anymore from some of the truths of life. And, you know, we have this instinct to protect, especially to protect our children, which I think is good at certain developmental stage. And this goes right back to the story of the Buddha. His parents, you know, as the story goes, the Buddha was a prince who was, now we would say, what, it was, you know, his parents were not only helicopter parents, they were snowplow parents. They were just, you know, they didn't want pushing away every obstacle, right? Didn't want the young prince to see any kind of disease or sickness, to see poverty, to see death, you know. So we want to protect our children and smooth out the barriers, right? But that doesn't really work, you know. At a certain time, life gives us difficulties that we haven't asked for, necessarily, like this family with the daughter who had this illness. But I think that it's like, developmentally, children start to perceive more and more, and as they become independent, you know, more and more independent selves. And, you know, my kids have just said to me, Papa, you're so overprotective. You know, I'm like, don't watch that, or I'm not showing them certain things, or they want to see, they want to know, they're curious, they, you know, don't keep something from me. And so at a certain point, just like a parent has to perceive that shift in their children, and no, oh, this isn't it, I can't smooth out every obstacle. The kids have to face, have to meet that obstacle and find out for themselves how to deal with that, how to deal with that conflict with their friends, how to deal with that, you know, maybe it's a teacher who's difficult, or assignment that's difficult, or, you know, something. You know, in the same way, I don't think we're trying to get to some place in our practice where there's never any more obstacles, or barriers, or difficulties. But rather, we're developing little by little the confidence that we can meet what life gives us. And we can meet it, we may not like it, we may not like this difficulty, but we have the resources, we have the tools to practice with it, to breathe with it, to acknowledge what's difficult, to take care of ourselves, to meet what's difficult with kindness, with care, with compassion. And then maybe, maybe there's a way, and maybe I'll just stop here, maybe there's a way that not only is practice sort of widening our, our container, that we can hold more and more and contain more and more. But there's also, it's strengthening us, this kind of resilience. So, you know, I love that image of, I don't know if it's true medically, but they say like, if you break a bone, then when it heals, in that place, it's actually stronger, it's reinforced in a certain way, all those cells and the new, new matrix of, of bone that's built there makes it stronger. Or in the, I think it's in Japan, they have this practice of filling the cracks in, you know, like a vase or like a bowl, a ceramic bowl, something that gets damaged, they fill it with gold, you know, and then so if you with this kind of gold material. So if you see a bowl or something, it's the places where it's been damaged, the places where it's gone through difficulty, are sparkling, are beautiful, because they're, they're, they're gold, that's our gold. So, hopefully we can, we can see whatever difficulties that we're dealing with, that we're practicing with, these are our treasure. This is our goal. This is our place to enter the Dharma, to enter our life, to meet, to meet ourselves in a new way. Thank you very much.
