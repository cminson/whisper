Good morning, all of you. 
Today, I would like to talk about meeting our thoughts with mindfulness. 
Actually, I had difficulty to find out what I can talk about with this group, actually. 
You had such wonderful teachers. 
So what am I going to talk with having heard about? Really, actually, this is probably the first time when I'm trying to think about what to talk about. 
That I came up with something this morning, actually. 
Yes, somebody asked me, what are you going to talk about? I said, I don't know. 
So this morning, I thought to talk about thoughts because I found out in my practice, time and again, as soon as I wake up, there I am with thoughts. 
You know, maybe you can talk about anger. 
I was talking about this topic at the East Bay Meditation Center. 
You can talk about pain. 
But usually, we don't wake up with anger or pain. 
The first thing I realized in my experience, as soon as I wake up, thoughts are there. 
Planning. 
Because I have one year and a half schedule of teaching around the world, Australia, England, Mexico from here. 
I'm going to Spirit Rock, then after that, Mexico, then Uganda, then this. 
So I think, actually, I don't know whether you think a lot, but I tend to plan where I'm going. 
So then I say, let me talk about thinking. 
Maybe you are also saying the same, but maybe not. 
So if you are planning to think, or if you are already a compulsive thinker, so I think this talk is for you, it's going to be short, right? Now, thoughts. 
In the United States, I think people like to get good food for the body, isn't it? They are very careful, actually, this country, and also Europe, actually, they are very particular about what they eat in this country. 
Vegetarian and vegetarian, and Naderi, and vegan, and all these. 
In Uganda, it's amazing, you know. 
I haven't seen someone who's vegan. 
I don't know. 
But it's amazing. 
I think here we are very selective of what we eat, and then that's good for our body. 
We take care of the body. 
I found out that there's also another dimension to this about the thoughts. 
Are we really selective with the thoughts, or we just think randomly? I don't know about you, sometimes I find myself thinking randomly, not selecting what I want to think. 
Yet thoughts is the food for the mind. 
While the physical food you eat provides nutrition for the body, so thoughts provides nutrition for the mind. 
And it was very clear for me when I was teaching a prison, I think a couple of days ago. 
Three days ago, I was asked to teach in a prison in Salono. 
Yes, Salono. 
S-O-L-A-N-O, I don't know whether it's Spanish or. 
. 
. 
Yes, I was teaching there in a prison. 
And I was so touched, actually, by the intimate there. 
He said that he's Jewish, and he didn't know about meditation at all. 
And he came to the prison, and he found somebody, and this person gave him mattress, clothes. 
Other inmates were not giving him anything. 
I said, what's amazing? This guy was giving me all these things. 
In other words, he had the thoughts of generosity, which is part of the right thought. 
And what happened, they separated for a while. 
And then after 20 years, this guy learned about Buddhist meditation, he went to Zen center. 
And then they came back, reunited after 20 years, both of them were meditators. 
It's amazing, this guy really was so much attracted to the generosity, and he got to know that he was practicing Buddhism. 
Both of them, I met them, it was amazing. 
Now, another thing, this man, during another session, one person told me that meditation has helped him so much. 
But he said, it's not only me, but also when we go out on a courtyard, when we're eating, it affects also other people, other inmates who are non-Buddhists who don't meditate. 
So he really said that, actually, it's helping even the whole prison, because once they meditate, they go with a different vibe. 
And for me, that wasn't new, but it was great to see the prisoners talking about it, because the movie I saw before became a monk, what the blip, quantum physics, yes, they brought 100 meditators to Washington DC, and the crime rate reduced from 50% to 25%. 
And it was this Zen monk who was chanting, and then water changed the atomic structure. 
So I said, wow, that's how powerful the thoughts are. 
And in fact, the Buddha said, what do you think is what you are? So all that motivated me to talk about thoughts. 
So now, thoughts, as we know probably already from your teaching you've had before, they arise from the six senses. 
Whenever you see something, a visible object, there's what we call eye consciousness, for instance. 
Then there is contact, there's designated contact, and then impingement contact. 
That's one of them, if the mind is the one which is involved, then it's a different contact. 
But anyway, there's contact, and after that there's feelings and perception in the thoughts, and then if you're not mindful now, we go into some area which is very strange, it's called pappancha. 
Have you had this term, pappancha? Yes, yes, it's called, people say adding on. 
My teacher Bante Gunaratana said, it's delaying enlightenment, you delay enlightenment. 
It makes sense actually, because you know when you're really wondering here and there, you don't even think about thoughts of the most and all that, you're just lost in your dream. 
In other words, a mental movie. 
Then pappancha, and then you start getting lost. 
Actually, thoughts, they start pricking you. 
You really suffer because of your thoughts, and because you're not mindful of them. 
And I don't know if you're familiar with this, but we can see for a life in their life, where are we most of the time? Are we lost in the past and the future? Actually, there's no problem with thinking, knowing the thought process, there's no problem. 
The problem is getting caught up in thoughts. 
Yes, so you are really lost. 
It's kind of a chaos. 
It's like when you're driving, and then there's no traffic jam, there's no problem. 
You just keep on cruising. 
You can put on a cruise button. 
But the problem, if you are really in a parking lot, you are pretty much in a parking lot when you have traffic jam. 
So your cars are really stuck basically in the traffic jam. 
That's the problem. 
So I think when I reflect in my life, I see a lot of traffic jam when I'm thinking. 
A lot of traffic jam, you know? Motion, commercial, and then you cannot even go as you like, you know? So now, the good thing, the Buddha gave some methods that I can remind you. 
I know you have done this already. 
In Vittaka Santana Sutta, in Maj Manika, how to deal with destructive thoughts. 
But before I go there, I'd like to tell you something that there's a book by Sonya. 
I think it's a professor from UC Berkeley. 
The book is called The How of Happiness. 
Have you read this book? Yes, yes. 
It's a great book actually. 
Even recently I was teaching at Stanford. 
I saw it. 
He said that he made the scientific research for the first time actually to find out why people are unhappy. 
And guess what? The reason why we are unhappy is not because we don't have money. 
It's not because we don't have friends and lovely ones and all that. 
It's overthinking. 
Overthinking. 
Lumination every time. 
I'd like you to reflect that. 
I know you have studied many sutras and all this. 
You are practiced. 
But the reality check is really every day. 
Check where you are. 
From time to time, you really want to find out a template. 
Where are your thoughts connected to greed or generosity? Are your thoughts connected to anger or loving kindness or compassion? Are your thoughts connected to confusion and delusion or clarity or understanding and wisdom? Or are your thoughts connected to fear or are connected to courage and confidence? So if you have that template, from time to time even you can work with it. 
So any thought comes, you pull out your template. 
Now you know where you are. 
Now, in fact, people do many retreats. 
And I tell them there's a retreat you can really do in their life until you go for another retreat. 
But in their life, you can really actually work with that template. 
So if you find out to yourself that your thoughts are now connected with loving kindness, compassion, generosity, wisdom and understanding and courage and confidence. 
Then you are on a retreat. 
To that extent, you are on a retreat. 
Moment to moment retreat until you wait to go for a weekend or 10 days retreat or even one month or three months. 
You can go for those former retreats, but for me, living in their life, I see as a time to practice. 
Not to wait and postpone, oh, I cannot meditate, I'm very busy, I have a job, I can meditate. 
I wait until I go for the retreat. 
For me, I wasn't born as a monk in case it's not obvious. 
I struggled a lot with my practice actually, a lot of struggle. 
Until I went to some teacher and then told me that this has to be in their life. 
You have to do it from moment to moment and we can do it. 
As you have heard from your teachers that meditation is not brain surgery. 
Actually, mindfulness is not brain surgery. 
What is very difficult is to remember to be mindful. 
If you actually get a lot of things to remind you, maybe a steering wheel, you put their mindfulness and say, dead keeps duke away on a steering wheel. 
I think that would be very helpful. 
I was living at Bhavana Society and people are forgetting these cell phones. 
On a steering wheel, they put their right at the steering wheel. 
Don't go with that cell phone. 
That changed a lot. 
If you do that and you put everywhere signs of mindfulness, keeping in check with your thoughts and speech and actions, I think that would be great. 
As Andrea talked about, I also teach at Mississippi. 
I taught this moment to moment or minute meditation through a judge who is a thousand Baptist. 
Another one was a prime minister. 
I was about to get ordained. 
The prime minister, the one who was about to ordain, said, I like meditation. 
Many things Buddhists say are very similar to what I am studying in Christianity, but I love Jesus. 
But I will apply something. 
The judge said, you know how to order the Buddha statue. 
Because he thought he was going to apply this in her court sessions. 
For me, it was very powerful to get that feedback. 
I said, you know, just meditate a minute. 
Just every time, check where you are. 
Are you on the other side of the coin or on the other side? You know, you can't do that, actually. 
You can't do it. 
Now, this is what I also got in the prison. 
It was a Muslim at the end of my session. 
They came to my meditation. 
One Muslim there came at the end and said, Oh, you know what you talk makes sense to me, brother? So how can I meditate? I said, OK, this is how to do it. 
He said, I can do like this? I said, yes. 
So even the Muslim image is going to take up this practice. 
It will be very interesting next year when I go there to see whether it's really meditating because I've taught a Muslim to meditate when I bring this practice in their daily life. 
Because everybody think. 
Everybody speak and act. 
So I start from the thoughts because everybody thinks. 
So probably most people think that meditation is to empty your mind and there's no thinking anymore. 
So in other words, people think that you just, in fact, that's their goal. 
You just meditate and all of a sudden, kaput, no more thoughts. 
In other words, you become a vegetable. 
Very peaceful like that. 
Well, most of the icons of meditation actually seems the so. 
They look like that. 
Somebody in Himalaya like this. 
As if they have no thoughts. 
You know, we have all these role models of meditation. 
They look as if they have no thoughts. 
But you don't know what's going on. 
Even when you are meditating here as a group, you see wonderful yogis like these. 
You think, hey, maybe they don't have thoughts. 
Maybe I'm the one who's going through all these thoughts. 
But you have no clue. 
So I mean, long story short is actually pay attention to your thoughts. 
Pay attention to your thoughts. 
Okay. 
If you are the person who's overthinking, here is some practice. 
So first thing, make thoughts your object of meditation. 
So like thought arises, you become your thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking. 
Not thinking. 
Thinking, thinking. 
No, no. 
It has to be a soft meant or not. 
Like 98% your direct experience and maybe 2% as a tool to stay connected, to stay on a track that actually you are mindful of the thoughts. 
Thinking, thinking, thinking. 
And then try to see the emotional background. 
That's step number two. 
See the emotional background. 
What's going on as you're thinking? Maybe there's some kind of fear. 
Maybe there's aversion. 
Maybe some anger. 
Maybe some attachment. 
So then you can now start noting. 
Mentally noting, there's aversion. 
Maybe fear or then attachment to your thoughts and all these things. 
So that's the next step. 
So now on the third step, you want also to actually to have a proper attitude so that you are not actually noting thoughts to go our way because that's most of the time people what they do because they are tormented by their thoughts. 
So whenever they actually become mindful of their thoughts, there is that inclination, that leaning forward. 
If I make maybe three mental notes, they'll be kaput. 
I'll be very peaceful. 
So then what happened as they are mindful of thoughts, actually they are keeping their thoughts there. 
They kind of have an overlay over the note. 
That okay, there's a magic button. 
As soon as I note maybe 10 times, they'll be gone. 
So then they stay actually caught up in their thoughts. 
So then there's other kind of thoughts. 
That's in general because people like to think just about anything under the sun. 
But if you are the person who is thinking like that, that might help. 
But are there other thoughts that are called judgmental thoughts? Is that familiar to you? Yes, comparing. 
I think that's most of the time what we're doing. 
Yeah, this is bad, this is good, bad drivers, good drivers, good yogi, bad yogi. 
I mean, that's ongoing on. 
But I found out a kind of mantra that is very helpful for that kind of mindset because also I used to do this kind of thing. 
Yes, so I have a little bit of a mantra that helps me a lot. 
I say, every time there's a judging moment, I just say, mind your business or mind my business. 
Mind your business? Don't actually get into other people's business and also mind my business. 
I try to mind my business. 
If it's working, just stay with working. 
I'm not caring what other people are doing, but we have to be also very careful because also as I say, meditation over Buddhism is not like passive. 
It's very also active. 
You want to be judicious. 
So there's no problem actually being judicious. 
That means you are not biased. 
Judgmental mind is biased of greed, hatred, delusion, and fear. 
But when you are judicious, that means you are designing, you are making informative decisions and comments about something. 
So you're not just all keep quiet. 
I shouldn't make judgment. 
No, no, you can substitute a judgment of mind by a judicious mind whereby actually you are really talking what's going on, what's true, without bias. 
Now, another thing is the teaching on karma, the love karma, is that if you see somebody doing something, so finally it's their karma. 
They're going to get the effect, so you shouldn't get bothered about people. 
Then if you know that you have your own karma and it's their own karma, you can reflect along those lines. 
I know that you know this teaching already, I'm not going to tell you all this, what it entails. 
I don't know whether you believe in the love karma, but I think it's very helpful because what people are doing, they're the ones who are going to get the results, not us. 
But you have to be very careful when you're driving. 
If somebody is really a bad driver, don't say, oh, it's the love karma, and then you stay on the road. 
It's not good, not very wise. 
So yes, you have to be judicious and then, of course, go away from bad drivers and then be a cautious driver. 
Now, I have also to leave time for question and answer session, but let us go through the sutta real quick. 
I know you know the discourse. 
There's not enough time. 
Okay, Vittacca Santana Sutta, the Buddha talked about five ways of actually dealing with destructive thoughts. 
Now, I call this kind of sutta a very, very powerful discourse if you have problems with thinking, especially lost thoughts, every time you are lost in blind alleys of thoughts. 
The Buddha even said that if you can apply this and practice according to Vittacca Santana Sutta, you become a master of your thoughts. 
How about waking up one day and you're a master of your thoughts? You just think whatever you want to think, isn't it? Like you, you go to Walmart and you just buy what you want to buy. 
It would be great, actually. 
The first technique is called replacement, substituting your thoughts. 
So if you are thinking about anger, you substitute it with thoughts of loving kindness. 
If you are thinking about all the time confusion, then you substitute it with thoughts of wisdom and understanding, right? Thoughts of wisdom. 
If it's always thinking about fear and fear about being a fear, then you substitute it with thoughts of confidence and courage. 
I was one time giving a talk at Cambridge. 
I think someone on the internet, I landed on the definition of fear, not according to Buddhism, but it was an acronym. 
Fear is false evidence appearing real. 
For me, I was great because I can see one time I went to Thailand to meditate in a cemetery because I wanted to see the ghosts. 
I'm a monk. 
I say, okay, you know, in Africa, they tell me about ghosts and every time I ask somebody whether they have seen a ghost, they say, oh, no, I've never seen it, but somebody told me about it. 
So I always want to go to the source. 
I had never found somebody who had firsthand experience of seeing a ghost. 
Now, I think five years ago, I went to Thailand on the United Nations conference. 
Then I went to Ubon. 
It's called Wat Pananacha. 
And then I said, I'd like to see a ghost. 
Then the monk said, come along with me. 
It took me to a cemetery where they don't bury people or cremate. 
They just put them just on a few feet in the ground. 
So I was there at around 10 pm  And I'm telling you, I imagined a lot of tigers. 
I wanted to see ghosts, but it's amazing how my imagination went to tigers and lions. 
After reading this book of Ajahn Mahabua, it's called Mahabua. 
Those monks would meditate and tigers come and say, I thought they are going to come, actually. 
So fear is false evidence appearing real. 
And there are many thoughts around that. 
I don't know about you, fear. 
Is it something that is familiar to you? All right, so that's the first technique. 
And then the second one is called reflection. 
You reflect whenever you have thoughts, you start reflecting. 
You know, these thoughts are dangerous. 
Whenever I think, actually, thoughts undermine your health. 
Yes, in fact, this Dalai Lama, in fact, said that anger, let's say if you have thoughts of anger, he said that the thoughts of anger is one letter, which is D, short of danger. 
You know, you put D before anger, you get danger. 
So whenever you are actually thinking and the thoughts are raging of aversion or anger, you know that you are in danger zone, danger zone, try to go back and then see how things go and get out of that zone. 
Reflection also means, of course, it should be from your experience, actually, the way you reflect. 
Also, they defile your mind. 
They defile your mind. 
Every time you think about thoughts of aversion, you become uptight, the mind gets defiled. 
That means next time that thought arises, it will be stronger. 
Then also, they degrade. 
Like thoughts of anger, they degrade you. 
Nobody wants to be somebody who is angry all the time, actually. 
That's what we call degradation. 
You lose your status. 
People who love you, they stop loving you, in other words. 
Not so much unless you are stuck with them, but I'm telling you, if they are a little bit of a far, your friends, they try to keep a distance. 
They maybe come on a reunion only. 
They don't frequent you, in other words. 
Then the second technique is called redirection. 
You redirect your mind. 
Whenever thought of anger arises or desire, you come back to breath. 
You come back to a safe refuge. 
That's the body. 
You take a few deep breaths. 
Then you redirect your mind. 
In the Sutta, they say ignoring, but I don't want to use the word ignoring. 
Ignoring means that you don't care. 
But for me, I know that if I redirect my mind, then I'm doing something awesome. 
I'm putting my mind somewhere else. 
The fourth technique is called retracing. 
I'm using my own words, but the same meaning in the Sutta. 
In other words, while your reflection was forward-looking, retracing is actually going backwards. 
Why am I the one who's always angry and all people have a good time? Then you start to really find out the springboards. 
Springboards. 
More is the personal thing about fear, where this fear comes from. 
Fear comes from a version. 
Where does a version come from? It comes from craving. 
Anger is always a frustrated desire. 
Whenever you have a lot of anger, then you know there's some kind of desire which is frustrated. 
So you go backwards. 
Why am I the person who's actually trying to push away things? Then it's because of ignorance. 
I'm trying to ignore things. 
So you go backwards a little bit. 
Then you actually, you really found out that the thoughts actually are losing grip. 
They lose their grip. 
Then lastly is called resolution. 
You make a resolve. 
Thoughts become your master. 
They shouldn't keep on leading you around like this. 
So my friends, I wish I had more time. 
I hope you have five techniques under your belt. 
Try to be a selective thinker. 
Thank you very much. 
Let us sit for a moment or two. 
Then you have a Q and A. 
Take a deep, slow breath. 
Letting go of the past and the future. 
Relax. 
. 
. 
. 
Having seen that all beings, like oneself, have a desire for happiness, one methodically develops loving kindness for all beings. 
Thank you very much for your attention and I offer this for your refriction. 
Thank you. 
So time for questions. 
Five minutes. 
Thank you for these enlightening words. 
I didn't realize I apply some of what you said without having known that to try to escape from a difficult thought. 
I was wondering about the thoughts that don't arise from the mind, but that may sometimes come from pain or the body itself. 
And something relatable is like a heart palpitation or a stabbing pain in the stomach. 
How to control that burst of a thought that is more physiological and that triggers this wave in the mind. 
Can these techniques be used in such an instantaneous wave of a moment? Right. 
Actually, you asked a very good question. 
But I would like to talk about your wild control. 
If you want to be a control freak when thought arises, you will be in a lose-lose situation. 
If you were wondering how do you control the thoughts, I would substitute how do you work skillfully with thoughts. 
That's another thing about controlling. 
Because we are so much used to control what we don't like. 
So if we can actually put that way, that's very helpful. 
Actually, thank you very much for asking this thing. 
I had already planned to talk about that. 
Yes, it was part of my plan, but we know there was not time. 
I had to make you do stunning meditation. 
And then I lost time there and there. 
Well, actually, that's part of my talk. 
I was going to tell you about when you practice mindfulness and be aware of the emotional background. 
I was going to go into the area, like sometimes as thought arises, they trigger certain emotion when you have pain and then the emotion arises. 
And then when the emotion arises, then you start thinking. 
And then thinking about thinking, then you get caught up. 
So these techniques also work. 
And I started with the first technique, which is mindfulness, of the thought themselves. 
In other words, whenever there is a thought, the first thing you have to do is to make it the object of your meditation. 
It doesn't matter where to come from, who is the parent of that thought, the ascensor of the thought. 
If you feel it's a thought, mindfulness is the key. 
The rest of the techniques I've given you when it's repetitive. 
In other words, you are getting into compulsive, obsessive thinking. 
That's why the Buddha says how to overcome destructive thoughts. 
Every time it's the same thoughts, the same thought, day in, day out, day in and out, and you actually become a prey of your thoughts. 
So they need to apply those techniques. 
In that's actually order. 
The Buddha says if this fails, go to this. 
So given five techniques, you have to apply in that order. 
If this fails, go to this one. 
This fails, like that kind of thing. 
But the first technique I gave you is about mindfulness. 
Mindfulness, it works where it's triggered by the emotion, whether it's pain or whatever. 
It doesn't matter. 
That's the way. 
Because then you will understand your thoughts. 
And you will see them arising and passing away. 
And you become wiser as you're watching your thoughts. 
And you start enjoying your movie, mental movie. 
And then you have insight meditation. 
Because you have to go there also, not just become aware of thoughts. 
You have to be aware, are they rising? Are they passing away? Are they staying the same? How do they affect my body? Because when you think, sometimes you feel tightness and all that, that's part of the investigation. 
My friend, I wish I had more time. 
I would give you over ten techniques how to do this. 
But in a short time, that's what I can offer. 
And a good thing I can bank on the excellent teachers you have here. 
That's why I kept on talking. 
Then you can ask them, they will answer. 
Better than me maybe. 
You have one there, I think there's also one one I've never seen. 
It's called GIL. 
Where's GIL? It's in Europe. 
It was in Europe. 
I didn't give a big session for Q&A because I know if you ask them, they will answer probably the same way. 
But maybe they won't talk the same way because I have a different experience. 
Having said in Africa for over 20 years, Asia 10 years. 
So I had more experience here and there, and I would give examples teaching in the prison and all that. 
That's what I wanted to kind of jazz up the talk basically. 
But for answering questions, they all answered no problems. 
So I'm sorry I didn't give you more time for. 
. 
. 
Okay, one little question and please give me time. 
Okay, I've seen even one yogi here. 
I've never seen you at the Rock. 
You who's looking backwards. 
You, have you seen me at the Rock? And also you, I've seen you at the Rock. 
You. 
Yes, yes. 
Because I've spent two years without seeing you, but I was seeing whether you're sisters or wife or somebody. 
Oh, great. 
That's fine. 
Okay. 
That's the question. 
Could you talk about your own personal experience of applying retracing? Sorry? Could you talk about your own personal, your own experience with applying retracing? Just because it seems like retracing can be quite complicated. 
Like you gave a lot of routes, and maybe you've read about them in the sutras. 
But it's not always apparent to a practitioner what the root of something is and then to trace back to the mental movie, which has been conditioned, and it can be sort of like going down a rabbit hole, like from your own experience. 
So can you talk about how you've effectively applied retracing in your own practice? Yes, yes. 
Actually, as the Buddha said, he's teaching like this theory, practice, and realization. 
So of course I've read, that's why it's very important to read. 
You apply actually both the theory and the practice. 
It's like writing a book. 
You have to do like this, like this, like this. 
The theory and the practice. 
So these things are offered to you, you must, you have at least a theory about it so that you know what we call the psychological underpinnings behind these emotions. 
I've done in Burma, Bidama, which is Buddhist psychology. 
Yes, it's very important to have something like that, right? But there's no problem, even if you haven't read all that kind of thing. 
In my experience, really, okay. 
As a young boy, I used to walk and then I hit my toe on a stone. 
I always look backwards, what hit me? Right, instead of walking, but I've seen people walking actually, and they leave the stumbling block there. 
And then when they come, they knock on the same thing, right? So for me, errors whenever I knock my toe, even I have it here, it doesn't have a nail, I was fed up of knocking my toe without knowing what hit me. 
Every time I knock my toe, I always look back, what knocked me, and remove it. 
So now in my experience, when I found out fear, right? Fear. 
Come to body, feel it. 
And then I say, why am I fearing? Why do I have that intense fear? It's because I'm attached to my body, right? I'm attached to this life. 
But then I say, oh, life is impermanent. 
Even when I hold on tenacious, let my life, at one day I will lose it. 
Then I find, oh, it is because I'm so much attached to my life, I don't want to let go. 
Then once I do that, I'm telling you, it's amazing. 
The freedom. 
Yes, you can do it without having that prior knowledge. 
If you have prior knowledge, that's very good. 
And then when I was in Thailand meditating in the cemetery, in the cemetery, and then these lines were coming and all this kind of thing. 
And then I felt some kind of fear that, okay, this line is going to eat me because the thing was not closed and branches were breaking and all these things. 
Then the thing I say, oh, you know, I'm a monk. 
I've done all good things. 
I haven't done bad things. 
At least as a monk, I haven't done bad things. 
And then I say, I have a den, my mother, she's a nun. 
Even if I die, she'll be there like holding the fort, you know, and keeping on the lineage, and I have some people who have become Buddhist and meditating. 
Then I go back and I say, why actually am I actually, why is this fear arising? Maybe actually I'm not connected with my different sensation. 
Then I start finding out different things in the body, the tightness and all that, and I try to release that. 
Yes, you know the good thing about emotions is that with the body, it has kind of a biofeedback. 
If you cannot, you don't have all that theoretical background, go to the body. 
It will tell you whether you're angry or you're fear. 
And also the mind will tell you to start racing and you start feeling tap tight and all those things. 
Yes, so don't go so much and start creating more thoughts. 
When you are retracing, don't get lost in the thoughts. 
I've told you, go at least maybe to find out the springboard behind. 
Once you find the immediate springboard, then actually you are going to break through. 
Because now you are so much attached to fear, oh, am I going to die? But once you go backwards and see the show behind, it actually will melt, like a film, and it's there and then all people are crying and all that. 
But you go to the project and find out there's nothing going on actually. 
You say, what's the relief? People actually laugh and cry and say, why? They're lost basically. 
But when you sidestep that and you're not just one step backwards, you may not go back as I've gone because of my theoretical background. 
Just go and step behind. 
You tell me. 
That's enough. 
Yes. 
Okay, thank you very much for your question. 
I enjoyed your presence here, and thank you very much for inviting me, the management of IMC, and we keep in touch. 
Thank you very much. 
May you enjoy your thoughts. 
And think selectively.
