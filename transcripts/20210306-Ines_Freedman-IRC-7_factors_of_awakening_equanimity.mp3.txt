So, today I'll talk about the seventh factor of awakening, equanimity. 
You know, they call it the crowning jewel, though to me it feels like they're all the crowning jewels. 
So, I'd like to begin with a teaching that the Buddha gave his son, Rahula. 
He said, Rahula, develop meditation that is like the earth. 
For then, agreeable and disagreeable, sensory impressions will not take charge of your mind. 
Just as when people throw what is clean and unclean on the earth, feces, urine, saliva, pus or blood, the earth is not horrified, not humiliated or disgusted by it. 
In the same way, agreeable and disagreeable, sensory impressions will not take charge of your mind when you develop meditation like the earth. 
Equanimity points to a balanced mind and evenness of mind, a mind that stays open regardless of circumstances. 
It's a rich, warm, satisfying state of mind. 
It's not just neutral, but it's a really wholesome state. 
It's a connection with ourselves. 
It doesn't resist the unpleasant and doesn't cling to the pleasant. 
It has nothing to defend. 
And it comes naturally any time the hindrances are suspended. 
Some years back, I read a book that really inspired me. 
It's a biography of the nun, Tenzin Palmo, called Cave in the Snow. 
Some of you, I'm sure have read it. 
She's a contemporary Tibetan nun originally from England. 
She spent 12 years living in a cave high up in the Himalayas. 
The cave was six by 10 feet and she spent three years of it in full retreat. 
She never laid down. 
She slept sitting in meditation in a wooden meditation box for three hours each night. 
Her last years were in complete isolation. 
It was way up in the Himalayas we'd get like 30 below at times. 
But that's not what really inspired me. 
She grew some of her own food but she depended on the villagers to bring her enough food for each winter because the roads were often closed for six months or more. 
And every year, a villager would show up with her food in a cart and they'd show up in a timely manner. 
But one year, he didn't come. 
And the roads were closed with the weather and she wasn't sure she'd survive the winter. 
She did have some turnips left and I guess she must have grown those. 
And she barely survived but she just kept practicing. 
And what really impressed me though is that she never complained to the villagers about not getting group delivery. 
She never bothered to find out why. 
The next year, the delivery came as expected. 
That's, that was an inspiring level of equanimity for me. 
So developing equanimity affects every aspect of our lives and relationships and it's an essential part of developing the mind. 
It's the state of staying balanced in the face of what we call the eight worldly winds or the eight vicissitudes. 
They're called the worldly winds because they easily toss us around. 
And they're all very familiar to all of us. 
Pleasure and pain, gain and loss, praise and blame, and fame and disrepute. 
Most of us want the four pleasant ones and then want the other four. 
And despite that life continuously shows us otherwise, we tend to believe if we just do everything right, if we're smart enough and try hard enough, we'll just get the four we like. 
And daily life is placed out in just countless of ways. 
For instance, pleasure and pain are at the center of our addictions. 
The little reward of pleasure the brain gives us when we check mail or crave something to eat that may not be so good for us. 
And we're all familiar with physical pain, gain and loss, getting what we want and being deprived of what we want. 
We get lots of that. 
And praise and blame, it can be over big things or over little things, it can be deserved or not. 
If boss might say one day you did a great job and then you feel great and then another time criticizing you and you feel bad. 
In the Dharmapada that Buddha noticed, they find fault in one sitting silently. 
They find fault in one speaking much. 
No one in the world is not found at fault. 
No person can be found who has been, is or will be only criticized or only praised. 
And the last one, Feynman's Disrepute, these are the words of the Buddha. 
And the last one, Feynman's Disrepute, these are the, they're Olympic athletes that see themselves as failures if they get the bronze. 
So these are, we definitely get incredibly tossed around by these worldly winds. 
When I first learned about the worldly winds, I only thought of them in relation to my daily life. 
But as I start paying attention on retreat, I realized they easily, easily show up on retreat. 
I'm sure many of you have been easily tossed around by pleasure and pain at some point on retreat. 
My body feels good, I'm happy. 
And another time I back hurts, my knee hurts, I can't practice. 
Pretty familiar territory for some of us, or maybe in practice, you've experienced being tossed around by gain and loss. 
My concentration was so good, it was just so good. 
And then later I was completely distracted, would I do wrong? And sometimes we're tossed around by praising blame ourselves, congratulating ourselves on being such a good yogi. 
I kept the schedule really well, I showed up to everything. 
And I was mindful all day long. 
And then another time, berating ourselves for not trying hard enough. 
You know, unfaithful in this repute, I'll share a little story that happened to me. 
I was on a long residential retreat. 
I was a couple of weeks deep into the retreat. 
I had shaved my head at the beginning of the retreat. 
I really wanted to let go, I wanted to renounce. 
And I was moving slowly, mindfully, standing in line for food. 
And I always wore shawl in those days. 
And as I reached for this completely full serving picture of a delicious, oily, creamy dressing that I loved, my shawl caught and the entire picture full of slimy mess fell on the wooden floor. 
And it was really loud. 
And I froze, you know, all 100 eyes were on me. 
For a moment, you know, I just had this flush of embarrassment coursed through me. 
Everyone was looking at me. 
Everyone was seeing how unmindful I was. 
My mind went from shame to noticing how much I cared what people thought of me and how painful that was. 
It was so important to me. 
But in the spaciousness of meeting that, meeting that with equanimity, it's something in me really relaxed. 
And I was just, and all of a sudden, just this very sweet laughter arose in me. 
And I laughed at myself a lot of warm affection. 
So fame and disrepute. 
There, in Pali, there are two different words that are translated as equanimity, which points to two different aspects of it. 
And to me kind of points to ways of practicing with it also. 
Upeka, which is what many of us have heard, means to look over or have an overview. 
It's like being able to observe an experience without being caught by it. 
We see the whole picture, we understand it. 
So it's kind of the overview. 
I have a good friend that would always be late to everything. 
We got in the habit of telling him that everything was earlier than it actually was, like an hour earlier. 
So we figured that would get him there on time. 
And one day he was over the house and a few of us were going for a hike. 
And lo and behold, he was ready to go on time. 
You know, so everyone else went to the car as he and I went to put on our shoes. 
But just as we're walking out the door, a poetry book I had on the shelf caught his eye. 
And he picked it up and just delightedly started reading it oblivious to his waiting friends. 
This is how our minds tend to work. 
We can easily pick up whatever comes away regardless whether it's helpful or not. 
But if we have a big picture, we keep in mind our friends are waiting in the car. 
What distracts us in meditation, right? A thought coming by. 
And we pick it up just like that book, just like that book, forgetting why we're meditating, forgetting that freedom is waiting for us in the car. 
The other word for equanimity, which I likely mispronounce, but just know that I do so with that most equanimity. 
And that's Tatra Machata. 
It means to stand in the middle of all this. 
And I love that definition. 
It's just really standing in the middle of our lives. 
It's being centered in the middle of our experience. 
Being in balance. 
And that kind of leads you to see how concentration, which Gilles talked about yesterday, how that leads to equanimity. 
Because when their mind is unified and samadhi, the hindrances aren't there. 
It will not pull them pushed by them. 
So we're in the center. 
And that being the center naturally leads the mind to be able to abide in that balance, that equanimity, or ride in the middle of all of it. 
As we gradually develop these seven factors of awakening, and we live in our lives, a balanced life of blamelessness and inter-tegrity, or inner strength and stability, that grows in us and what we have is unshakable balance. 
We're like a tree with deep roots that's not easily blown about by the strong winds. 
Ride in the middle of all this. 
Every wholesome state we experience has equanimity in it. 
Equanimity allows us to investigate a hindrance without rejecting it. 
Something I think I've mentioned more than once, just how we approach a hindrance needs to be wholesome. 
And that's the equanimity that's, you know, we're balanced and yes, I can see this. 
It helps us accept all the difficult parts of ourselves that are challenging to meet. 
Another way that we develop equanimity, some of us are familiar with practicing with the Brahma Viharas. 
They're known as the Four Unmeasurable, or Four Divine Abodes. 
Loving kindness, compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity is the fourth one. 
But I like the way Gil referred to them once, the four faces of love. 
I think that's really sweet. 
It's a wonderful way to think of these. 
Equanimity is another aspect of this unrestricted love towards all beings. 
As we develop it, it allows the heart to live with an unconditional love. 
It helps us develop a deep acceptance of full range of humanity, including all the beings that are really, have been challenging to love and develops a heart that's like the sun that shines on everyone. 
And that's a freedom of the heart. 
A heart that doesn't say, no, I have to stop shining for a little bit. 
That person isn't deserving. 
It's a heart that just shines for everyone. 
Equanimity supports all of the factors of awakening. 
As they become strong, we develop deeper and deeper insight. 
This is the deeper work of meditation. 
We begin to understand the truths of change, not only conceptually, not just idea of change, but in the very direct experience of things rising, passing away. 
We experience in our bones the truth that everything is just dissolving right in front of us. 
We experience the truth of dukkha, that all phenomena are unsatisfactory and everything arises and dissolves. 
And there's no place for the self to take a stand. 
Nothing lasts long enough to be called a self because that too dissolves. 
Whatever has the nature to rise passes away. 
What would it be like if we really let this in? That's everything in our experience. 
If our understanding were complete, we wouldn't hold on to anything. 
In the Anapanasati Sutra, the Buddha said, one abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. 
When we consider equanimity as balance and centeredness, it makes it immediately accessible at any time, on or off the cushion, because at any moment we can just be centered. 
It just takes one moment to take a breath and to connect with our body. 
The body at the center, this is an embodied practice. 
Maybe we connect with the breath or a soft belly, connecting with our body in any posture or any situation we're in. 
You can naturally find our center and that connection is the thread of our inner strength. 
The strength to become like a tree with deep roots that's not easily blown about by strong winds. 
I'll tell you one more little story. 
My husband and I set a three-month retreat at IMS a couple of decades ago. 
This was in the olden days of residential retreats. 
On the last day of retreat, to facilitate the ending of the retreat, the managers decided to change the lunch schedule. 
Normally, there was just one group eating at noon. 
They decided there'd be two groups and they'd split them by the alphabet. 
They posted the day schedule. 
It said 12 noon was 8 o'clock. 
1 pm  was M through Z. 
They accidentally left out H through L. 
My husband, with all the wisdom of a yogi after a three-month retreat, took a pen and added H through L equanimity practice. 
As Gilbert reminded us this morning, in many ways the practice is simple. 
Be here, pay attention, and let go. 
Let go of clinging. 
In a way, the rest of the teachings, as beautiful as they are, are different ways of pointing to that. 
So I'd like to end with a poem by Kozan Ichigyo, a 14th century seasoned monk. 
Empty-handed, I entered the world. 
Barefoot, I leave it. 
My coming, my going. 
Two simple happenings that got entangled. 
I read it again. 
Empty-handed, I entered the world. 
Barefoot, I leave it. 
My coming, my going. 
Two simple happenings that got entangled. 
So let's share a couple of minutes of silence. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you.
