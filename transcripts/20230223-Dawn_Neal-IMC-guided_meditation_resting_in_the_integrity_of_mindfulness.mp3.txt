 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So... Great. Wonderful. So the invitation is to... Notice how it feels to be hopeful, giving feedback with the sound. And notice how it feels to be in connection, in connection with this far-flung virtual Sangha that this community has built over these past years. And then, drinking that in, gathering it up. And when you're ready, bringing it into your heart and softening your eyes, perhaps closing them. Doing whatever works for you to settle in, settle into meditation. Perhaps one or two slightly longer, slower breaths. Allowing your belly to relax. Really allowing the exhale to release. Let go. Any excess tension. Anything extra it took to get here. Maybe like me, you had to play with the technology to get it to work right. Just relaxing, noticing, noticing your surroundings. Perhaps distant sounds outside your window. Or the soft hum within your home or room. Noticing the immersion. The immersion of your body, your heart, your mind in the moment. Contact of your feet against whatever they're resting on. Grounding. If you're sitting the contact of your hip points and buttocks in the chair or cushion. The contact of your skin. On cloth, air. Perhaps your hands or some other part of you is touching. Noticing how that feels on the outside of your skin. And then noticing how it feels to be present inside. All of the ways we know we're alive. Sweeping the attention through the inside of your body. Perhaps noticing the integrity of your skin. And the strength of your spine and your bones. Stay hold this body upright. Knowing your muscles to relax around the bones. Knowing your belly and your chest to soften. Life's breath. To move unimpeded. As we settle in, noticing too quality of the inner posture, the mind, the heart. Setting the intention of kind, generous awareness. To be kind, generous, discerning with whatever arises. Even if your thoughts are a bit of an echo chamber this morning. Okay, it's okay. You can step back and rest. Rest in present moment experience of breathing, body or sound. And resting in the present moment flow of awareness. Thank you. You notice your mind has wandered. Seeing how kindly and generously can greet the reemergence of awareness, the integrity of mindfulness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you for the Brahm over scratched Hair Jesuits Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mindfulness, concentration, kindness, generosity, any other, gather it up. And soak in it. Be nourished by it. Appreciating this practice we've done together. And then cast in your internal gaze, gaze of your heart outwards in your life, wherever you are, whoever you encounter. And if it feels right, generating the aspiration that they too may benefit from the fruits of your practice. May others in our lives be happy, safe, peaceful, and free. And may our practice, our actions, in some small way help support that. Thank you for the sincerity of your practice.
