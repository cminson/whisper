So continuing this reflection on becoming a refuge, you know, this similarly or
this analogy of the path, of keeping the path clear, a path in the woods, a path
in the forest, keeping a path clear. Others have been traveling this path,
keeping the path clear, and that is a kind of, we take refuge in them as we
walk the path because they have kept it clear for us. So kind of consciously
reflecting on that, others have kept this path clear for us, is a way of taking
refuge in the song. But we become a refuge as we walk the path, as I as I
just mentioned, that that we are also keeping the path clear by walking the
path. And so we we can't not be a refuge for others. We become a refuge for
ourselves by walking this path, and we become a refuge for others. So this is
a piece, the piece that I'd really like to to explore today is what it means to
become a refuge.
The Buddha in a couple of places in the suttas talked about becoming a refuge.
And and you know, the the language is to become a refuge for ourselves.
And to Ananda, the Buddha says, each of you should remain with yourself as an
island, yourself as a refuge, without anything else as a refuge. Remain with
the dhamma as an island, the dhamma as your refuge, without anything else as a
refuge. And how does one remain with oneself as an island, with the dhamma as
an island, with oneself as a refuge, with the dhamma as a refuge? There is a case
where one remains focused on the body in and of itself. The body is a body, ardent,
alert, mindful, putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world. One
remains attending to contemplating feelings, mind, mental qualities, ardent,
alert, and mindful. This is how one remains with oneself as an island, with
the dhamma as an island, with oneself as a refuge, with the dhamma as a refuge. For
those who now or after I am gone, remain with their self as an island, their
self as a refuge, with the dhamma as an island, with the dhamma as a refuge. They
become the highest of those who desire training. So this is pointing to the act
of practice. That is, as the highest refuge, the act of practice, doing the
practice, is actively taking refuge and creating refuge. To me, that's
beautiful. It's a beautiful inspiration. And you know, Gil has often said, you
can't just practice for yourselves. It's not possible, actually, to just practice
for yourself. But there are times where it feels like the focus, you
know, that we are exploring our own experience. So the four foundations of
mindfulness are the refuge, taking refuge and creating refuge. We understand
our experience. We open to our experience. And that, there's so many things. I
mean, the freedom from our own, you know, the practice of the four
foundations of mindfulness begins to point us to the freedom from our own
greed, aversion, and delusion, our own reactivity. We attend to, we turn to, we
open to our reactive states of mind. And we see that there's a difference
between being caught by those reactive states, engage with them, kind of
stuck in them, and being aware that they're happening. Or even being aware
that we're caught by them. That there's a freedom that happens there, a feeling
of loosening, of not being so kind of tied into the tangle of that, of that
reactive state. And that freedom is a kind of a pointer to that refuge. That
we see the awareness of experience creates a whole different perspective on
experience and allows us a place of ease and peace that is a kind of a taste, a
little taste of that refuge. And so that is making ourselves a refuge.
You know, we, we, that the Buddha says in other places, he says that we, we can't
rely on others. You know, we have to, we do, we do take refuge in others in terms
of, in the Sangha, we take refuge in terms of receiving the teachings and we
need that. But we can't just sit and listen. We have to engage. A famous, a
famous quote from the Dhammapada. I'll read this whole thing because it's
beautiful section. Just this is the path. There is no other to purify vision.
Follow it. And that will be Mara's bewilderment. Mara is the embodiment of
delusion, the embodiment of the one who tangles us into our knots. Just this is
the path. And I love that language. Tanasaro Bhikkhu wrote this translation.
Just this is the path. To me, that points right directly into the present moment.
Just this, this moment, this experience, just this, the four foundations of
mindfulness right here, right now in this moment. Just this is the path. Following
this path, you put an end to suffering and stress. I have taught you this path
having known for your knowing the extraction of arrows, the extraction of
suffering. It is for you to engage. It is for you to engage ardently. The Buddhas
simply point the way. Those who practice will be freed. So again pointing to this
need for personal engagement. We can't, we have to engage for ourselves. And this
to me comes back to make yourself an island, make yourself a refuge. And it
actually uses in this, in the suttas, in the Pali, it uses the term atta for
self, which is, you know, this is one of the few places in the suttas where this
word atta is used in a positive way. Normally atta is used in the way of
being caught, of being identified. But in this case, I think, and Bhikkhu Bodhi
says, you know, the obvious thing that he's pointing to here is that you have
to rely on yourself for freedom. Nobody else is going to give it to you. That the,
the action, the agency of engaging comes from within. It is for us to strive, for
us to engage ardently, to free the mind. No one else can do it. The tattƒÅgata is
the Buddha simply point the way. That's, that's the, that's like, you know, saying
the Buddha, the Buddha sitting there pointing saying, here's a path in the
woods. Yes, there it is. And we have to get on that path. We have to take the
steps. We have to walk the path. And so this frees ourselves, you know, the, the,
the practice of walking that path of, of exploring our experience. We get little
taste of that refuge, little taste of that possibility for having ease within the
craziness of reality. Not dependent on what's happening. A letting go of wanting
things to be other than they are, and yet that not meaning that we don't act or
engage. And, and this very act of freeing our own minds of these habits and
tendencies. You know, part of the way this, this clears the path for others or
supports others, part of the way we become a refuge doing this is, is not
only that we keep the teachings alive by walking the path, we keep the path open.
But we become different, we become more, more of a, of a, of a, I don't know what
the right word is. We become a person who is no longer caught even, even for just
moments that we have some capacity to not simply react out of our habitual
tendencies, where we see a kind of a reaction arising and we hold our tongue
and we don't lash out at somebody, or we offer a smile to somebody rather than
kind of just being absorbed in our own world and we connect, we connect through
kindness and care with others, others in the world. And so this is a way to the
qualities that we cultivate in our mind as the mind begins to let go of greed
aversion and delusion. Those qualities are felt by others. And so we become a
refuge in that we become a place where people don't have to be quite so
afraid in our presence. We engage ethically that we're engaged with
ethical conduct, engaged with non-harming as a, as a key component to our path.
This supports everyone, not even people, not only people who want to walk the path
behind us, but, but everyone. And it does create a kind of a contagion of beauty
because meta and compassion are, they tend to create the conditions for more meta
and compassion, not only in our own hearts and minds, but in others. And we, we
know this. When somebody comes with us, to us with a smile and openness and
connection, it tends to open our own hearts too. So this is another way that we
become a refuge. In one, in one reading, I was reading a little bit about the
refuges in the last days this morning and reading something by Niana Ponica. And
he pointed out that taking refuge in the Sangha was taking them as a model for
emulation, taking those who have engaged or are engaged in the path, taking them
as role models. And so as we take others as role models, we become role models
ourselves. This notion of
being a model or, or modeling the teachings is expressed in one particular
teaching that is one of my favorites. It's in the Sutta Nipata. It's called the
Ataka Vaga, the chapter of the eights. And you know, the whole, the entirety of
this teaching, it's a set of 16 poems and it kind of has three aspects to it.
Through the poems had three flavors, one of three flavors or sometimes multiple,
but there's three basic flavors. One is a description of somebody who is caught.
The description of our, our human condition, basically. So that's one, one
kind of poem. What happens to us is we stay mired in our habitual
tendencies. And then another set of poems is a description of how we, how, or what
it's like to be free from that condition. Kind of the inspiring description of what
it's like to have freedom from that. And then the third set of poems is how do we
get from one to the other? What's the training? What's the path? What's the
path of practice? So I'll read just a little bit about the, some of the verses
describing somebody who is free. I won't read, read all of them because I want to
save some, some time for discussion. So I'll just read a few selected verses.
So somebody comes to the Buddha and asks the Buddha, having what vision, being of
what character is one peaceful? Tell me about the Supreme Person. The Buddha
responds. A person, a person who is not angered, not frightened, not boastful, not
fretful, who gives wise advice, who is calm, restrained in speech, who is a sage.
A person who is not attached to the future, who does not sorrow over the past,
who finds solitude amidst sense contacts, and is not guided by fixed views. A
person who is retiring, not deceitful, not covetous, not greedy, not impudent, not
arousing, condemned, who does not engage in malicious speech. A person who does not
relish pleasure, who is not arrogant, who is mild and of ready wit, who is not
credulous, who by nothing is repelled. A person who is even tempered, ever
attentive, who does not suppose that in the world there are equal, superior, or
inferior, who is free of conceit. This is someone I call peaceful, free, the sage,
free of greed and selfishness. The sage regards nothing in the world as one's
own, and does not grieve because of what does not exist. So I think it's, this
description is largely, there's a couple of pieces about this description of
someone who is freed. It's described in terms of things largely that they
don't do. You know, they're not angry, they are not covetous, not greedy, not
arousing contempt. They don't engage in malicious speech. So there's some of it
that's what they don't do. Some of it is kind of qualities of their
mind, mild and of ready wit, even tempered. But those are the fewer, you know,
fewer descriptions. So a couple pieces about this, it's, again, it's about what
is, what is, what is let go of, is where the refuge is, is where freedom lies, is
what's let go of. I forgot the other piece. Maybe it'll come back to me. So the, the
description of someone who is on the path of practice, I'll just read this and
then I'll reflect again. So the questioner this time asks, speak about the
path of practice. The Buddha responds, a person should not have covetous eyes,
should close one's ears to ordinary chatter, should not be greedy for
flavors, should not cherish anything in the world, should be meditative, not
footloose, should desist from worry, should not be indol, indolent, should not
fear blame, nor be conceited with praise, one should not be a boister nor speak
seeming, scheming words, one should not be drawn into telling a lie, nor be
deliberately treacherous, one should not despise others for their way of life or
wisdom or precepts or practices. If ordinary people or ascetics irritate one
with their talkativeness, one should not respond harshly for the peaceful do not
retaliate. Knowing the Buddha's teaching, an ever-attentive person who
investigates it should train in it. Knowing the cooling of desire as peace,
one should not be negligent in applying the teachings. With regards to the
teaching, one who is diligent should constantly venerate it by following his
example. And so consciously here pointing to, and to me this is, this
description is, in some ways it's like you could take the description of a
liberated person and put should engage or in front of every, in front of every
sentence. That's essentially in some ways what this, this, the path is. This should
not be angered, should not be frightful, should not be boastful, should not be
frightful. It's like the, the, the path of practice in this case is a description
of an emulation of what it means to be free. And the, and this is what the, the
last phrase I read was. One should be diligent by following his example, by
emulating, by emulating those who are free. We become free. Now this is, there's an
important piece to this emulation and that is mindfulness, because it is not
simply by externally emulating, but it is by emulating and noticing the rub. Not
being, not being, not just putting on something and saying I'm going to emulate
this. It's like putting on a mask or putting on a costume. But the, the practice
of the emulation brings things up in our hearts and minds. It brings up
resistance. It brings up fear. It brings up confusion. And that exploration is where
the freedom begins to actually happen. And so the four foundations of mindfulness
get embedded into this practice of emulation. We do our best to emulate
and notice where it feels hard. And then we don't repress that, but we acknowledge
it. We open to it. And so we can become a refuge by modeling the teachings of the
Buddha, by engaging in this sentence, the sentence for, I love this sentence from
the first. If, well, if people irritate one with their talkativeness, one should
not respond harshly for the peaceful do not retaliate. To cultivate peace, act
peacefully. The path and the goal are not separate. We walk the path. It's like the
path, the path reflects the goal in some ways, that we engage in the path through
modeling the path. If you want to be peaceful, act peacefully. If you want to
be kind, act with kindness. If you want to be compassionate, act with compassion.
And notice the rub, because there will be a rub. Notice where it's, there's a
struggle there.
