 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So just letting yourself find a posture that feels relaxed and comfortable. And that supports a natural sense of wakefulness and alertness. Financial asking I'm taking a couple of just slower breaths and if you'd like on the exhalation just inviting a softening of any extra tension or holding in the body. If you'd like just doing a few slower out breaths releasing any extra tension. If you'd like to do a few more out breaths releasing any extra tension or holding in the body. And particularly in this the space of the face and head. Having a softening around the eyes. Having the mouth and jaw be relaxed. And neck be relaxed down into the arms and hands. Into the upper back and chest. Just being very easy with any tension any discomfort there might be there. Just giving it a wide and gentle room and space to soften on its own just to be exactly as it is. And down into the area of the solar plexus and belly and lower back. Just inviting a softening and just feeling any sensations that are present. Feeling down into the pelvic area and buttocks. Having the weightedness of your body on the chair or cushion. And just allowing the attention to flow down into the legs, the upper legs and knees. Down into the lower legs, into the ankles, into the feet and toes. And just being with the experience of the whole body sitting. Being but not demanding relaxation, settling. Maybe we can even enjoy just being here even when there's some discomfort or jangly energy. Maybe we can meet that with just an inward smile, allowing it to be just as it is. Giving it a wide paddock to settle in its own time. And inviting the space of the mind to simply be known just as it is. The mind is constantly churning out subtle thoughts, ideas, perceptions, liking, not liking, imagining commentary about present, past or future. Even just the mental image or mental sense of where you are, what you're doing. Just including all of the space, the activity of the mind. We can know the mind as just another sense door. Just as body sensations are arising and being known. Just as sounds are coming and going. So too the various forms of mental activity are just constantly arising and passing. Just being known. This is the nature of the mind. No need to do anything with it. Just knowing. Just recognizing. Saita Utejnaya often encourages us to reflect that our experience is just nature. The activity and patterns of our minds. Just lawful, just natural. Something to fix or struggle with. Can we take the stance of a naturalist just observing nature, the nature of this body and mind? Can we take the stance of a naturalist just observing nature? So much of whether we're at peace, whether we're feeling free and at ease or caught and struggle and contraction has to do with the mind's relationship to what's happening in our experience. And this again is not something to force or struggle with or try to get right. But something to get to know. What's the relationship to what's happening right now? Is there resistance? Anything to change what's happening? Is there a sense of wanting to make something happen? Kind of grasping onto something pleasant that is already happening maybe? Where's the mind? Kind of checked out. Kind of a sleep to experience. Or perhaps the mind is just simple and okay with what's happening. No problem. We're encouraged to include noticing any of these relationships in our meditation practice as something to be aware of, to be interested in. This is where the learning, the learning about cause and effect and what mind states give rise to the well-being, happiness, which mind states give rise to stress. But it's good news to be seeing even an unwholesome mind state of greed or aversion. Because in the seeing of it, we're sowing the seeds of understanding and of its untangling, becoming disentangled from the patterns which we're clearly seeing. So there's no right or wrong experience. We just want to see if we can recognize what's happening however it is. Seeing the mind struggling with awareness, with some sense of letting it be just as it is, is a wholesome moment. It naturally starts to weaken those patterns when we meet them with mindfulness. And on the other hand, when we are present with wholesome states of equanimity, of kindness, of a simple non-reactivity, just that very mindfulness of that state strengthens it, makes it more likely for that to continue and arise in the future. Just recognizing how is it now? Seeing in the simplicity of just recognizing just how it is right now. Thank you.
