The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
How's that? Better?
Well, it's really nice to be here.
It feels a little different sitting up here.
There is a quality of mind that brings us to this practice,
and it keeps us going on this path.
In Japanese, the term is do-shin.
It usually gets translated as way-seeking mind.
This is the mind or the heart that seeks the way,
seeks the truth, is looking for the truth.
And I think it's what brings all of us here,
because Insight Meditation, Pipassana, is one way to find out what's true,
one way to see the truth, to see the Dharma.
So way-seeking mind is kind of like the spirit of our practice.
And there is a tradition of sharing your way-seeking mind with others.
You're kind of sharing a little bit about your practice
and what you've learned on the path.
So if that's okay, that's what I would like to do tonight.
I was born in Brooklyn, New York.
Anyone from Brooklyn?
Okay.
There was something special about you.
Greens.
The oldest of three siblings.
My father died when I was 13 years old.
My mother is still very much alive.
She's a teacher and educator, small children, for many years.
And I think both my father and my mother were very nurturing people.
So I feel very lucky, the kind of wonderful role models of unconditional love.
When I was in high school, which was about 20 years ago,
there was a television program on PBS.
Maybe some of you remember that.
I watched a lot of TV on PBS called Healing in the Mind.
It was a Bill Moyers, a wonderful journalist.
And the program explored the connection between the mind and the body.
So it profiled people, pioneers who were researching in this field.
In one of the segments profiled someone named John Kabat-Zinn.
You may have heard of who is the founder of the mindfulness-based stress reduction clinic in Massachusetts.
And I don't know why.
I just really liked that program and I even bought the book.
It was a book, the transcripts of the interviews.
And it just kind of filed it away.
I moved here to California for college at Stanford.
And in my second year, when I was 18 years old, I became quite ill.
It was a kind of unusual allergic reaction to the medicine I was taking.
And it left me very weak.
I could hardly walk.
And I was recovering quite slowly.
And in addition to the physical problems, I had a lot of stress, a lot of worry.
You know, just still living in a dorm with all these other, you know, 18-year-olds.
And I was kind of like an old man, you know, slowly moving.
And I went to the Stanford bookstore and I found a book by John Kabat-Zinn.
This guy is seen on TV.
And it was his first book, which is, I think, called Living the Full Catastrophe Living.
And I really liked that book.
I really appreciated it.
I read it cover to cover.
And I sent away, at that time it was just cassettes.
So I kind of clipped it back.
And I sent away and I got the cassettes.
Because he was leading these guided meditations.
There was a guided body scan and a sitting meditation.
I never did the sitting meditation because that was a little boring.
The guided body meditation, body scan, and then the yoga.
There was 45 minutes of yoga each side.
And every day I would play the tape in my room.
And I would do, you know, about two hours of this kind of mindfulness, slow yoga.
They do body scan.
And I just thought it was really great.
It made such a big difference for me in how I experienced my body.
Something about learning this skill.
This really basic skill to be mindfully present for my experience.
So I think that was kind of a turning point for me.
And something about being sick had given me a jolt.
And I've heard that over and over again.
I feel that there's something like when you're forced to practice,
and something, you know, something disrupts that, you know,
the story of how you think your life should be.
You can really practice and you can really go very deeply, I think.
So looking back now, I feel grateful for that illness when I was 18 years old.
And so I think about it as a kind of a condition that aroused my way-seeking mind.
And I think one of the things that I discovered and noticed through doing all that mindfulness,
that kind of very basic mindfulness practice was a kind of intimacy
that I had never experienced before with my body.
I just, I remember feeling so close, so connected to my body.
I kind of slowly walk to class.
I mean, now when you go on retreat, you walk slowly, right?
But that was because I couldn't walk any faster.
It was like very slowly.
But I just felt, you know, I feel really alive.
There was something so connected, so in tune.
So that kind of made an imprint on me, it made an impression.
At that time, it was also, I had a lot of stress and I had a hard time falling asleep.
I couldn't get in bed and there would be this cycle, this loop of thinking.
And through doing this practice, something shifted.
So it was like, I was so used to paying attention to the sensations of my body
that when I would get in bed, the mind would just naturally feel.
It would feel the pillow, feel the weight of the blanket.
And I thought, wow, I mean, am I enlightened?
It wasn't.
But it just, it was such a, it was like always being freed from the tyranny of thinking.
You know, because the sensations of just normal sensations of feeling the pillow on my cheek
were much more compelling than any thoughts that I could generate.
It was very interesting to me.
And then, you know, as it happens, my health improved, eventually fully recovered.
And I felt less compelled to do this very intensive practice.
And that, you know, in that way of being, you just kind of, it just faded.
I remembered it, and I felt it kind of slipping away.
And, you know, but I always remembered it.
A few years later, maybe three or four years later, I had graduated from college.
And this was in the late 90s, and it was in the middle of the tech boom in this area.
Some of you, I'm sure, lived through it, still living through it.
And I followed some friends into a small startup, a small startup at the time,
which had a funny name, and it was called Google.
And that's a whole other story.
But I was working there for a few months, and a woman who was a colleague of mine,
I didn't really know her well, I wasn't friends with her, she said to me,
she said, hey Max, I'm going to this meditation group on Monday nights,
and I really think you would like it.
And I really think you would like the teacher, and the teacher is this really interesting guy,
and I think you should come.
And he said, okay, and, you know, and that group was this very group.
This was the IMC.
It was at that time, the group was meeting in Palo Alto in the Quaker Friends Meeting House.
I think recognize some faces from there.
And it was just on the other side of 101 from my office, so it was really, really convenient.
And I remember going in the first time, and the room was set up,
where there were chairs on two sides, and they were facing each other,
and there were Christians in the middle, and the teacher sat in the front.
And everyone was just kind of sitting quietly, you know, and I walked in,
sat down in the chair, and I just waited, you know, just waiting, waiting to start.
It took me a while, I'm a little slow, and it took me a while to realize, you know, this was it.
Okay, I can do this, just sit there.
And also I remember after the talk, walking out of the building,
and walking through the parking lot, into the street, into my car,
and it just, everything seemed so beautiful, so exquisitely calm.
It was a quiet, calm night.
And I thought, you know, what changed, you know, what was, what had happened there?
And something about, and I really appreciated Gill,
Gill Fransdahl was the teacher that night, and what I liked about Gill
was that I felt that he wasn't trying to, he wasn't trying to sell anything.
He wasn't trying to convince me of something.
You know, I was working in sales, and so, you know, it's a kind of different way of being.
And I just felt that this was a person who had a lot of,
seemed to have a lot of integrity, something about him.
And the message I got, you know, from the teachings, or from the first couple of talks,
was also really powerful for me.
It was kind of like, finally, somebody is telling the truth, you know, about how things are.
And I can't remember what he said that night,
but the basic feeling that I got, or the basic message that I received,
was that fundamentally, life is never going to be what we want it to be.
And I was like, exactly, you know, that's right.
You know, why isn't anybody else saying this?
You know, we deeply, excuse me, we deeply want safety.
We deeply want permanence.
We want security.
We want to get what we want and get away from what we don't want.
I mean, it's just such a deep conditioning.
And this kind of clinging creates suffering for us.
And I just felt like Gil was talking about that so directly,
and it just made so much sense, and I never could have articulated that to myself.
But hearing him say that, I thought, yes, that brings true to me.
You know, demanding that life, demanding that other people conform to our expectations,
is painful.
It's a tremendous burden to carry.
So just hearing Gil say something like, life isn't ever going to work out like that.
It was very powerful for me.
And in a way, you know, if that was the bad news, there was good news too.
It wasn't just like, you know, that's the bad news.
Good night, everybody.
And what I felt, I was hearing, is a good news was that we could choose life as it is.
You know, we could choose to kind of enter into our life as it actually is,
as opposed to all of our ideas about it.
And then this meditation practice was offered as a safe place to do that.
And I just thought, this is really, really great.
There's something very unique about this message.
And I feel like one of the things that Gil talked about a lot at that time was the ideal versus the actual.
You know, these two poles, like the ideal and the actual.
And this is such a basic division or split, you know, way we divide our experience.
How my life is versus how I want it to be.
How I am versus how I think I should be.
You know, how we divide our experience.
And the usual way of thinking about this is like the way my life actually is a problem.
You know, there's some problem and then there's some solution, some ideal solution.
And I think that's a usual, at least that's my usual way of thinking of things.
And then Gil said, whenever we have a choice between the ideal and the actual, we choose the actual.
And I thought, well, the ideal is better.
And the reason we choose the actual is because, you know, of course, because the ideal doesn't exist.
The actual is what exists.
And something about getting out of my head and getting into the actual experience of my life just made complete sense to me.
And I just thought, this is really, this is so fundamental.
It's like the heart of the matter.
And of course, the meditation was, I found it very difficult.
I had no discipline to sit on my own.
So coming to the group or coming to different groups was so helpful to me.
And a lot of times it was just a victory to stay in the room, you know, to stay in my seat.
I remember a few times when I came to the group and I saw that the teacher wasn't Gil.
And I thought, can I leave?
And I just kept coming back.
And I think something about this way-seeking mind could grow.
And I just, it just became something that was a big part of my life, you know, at work, kind of an intensive job.
And then after work was I would come here a couple of times a week and other groups you can kind of go to.
And it was really great for me.
So sometimes during Gil's talks, he would reference something called Zen, Zen.
He would talk about his time as a Zen monk or different Zen teachers like Suzuki Roshi.
And so I began to, you know, I ordered some books about Zen and began to read.
And you know, this is pretty good too.
And I began going to Dharma talks at Zen centers.
At the time I was living in Mountain View, and I didn't know it, but the house that I was living in was owned by a Zen center.
It was like Kanando Zen Center, which some of you may have gone to.
This was, this was when they had a little house that was, you know, closer to El Camino in Mountain View.
And I was living in these really old house that they eventually tore down and they built a new Zendo there.
It had no heating. Anyway, that's another story.
And, but I would in the morning, I would drive over about five in the morning to sit Zazen, Zen meditation at this Zendo.
And I would sit every morning with them.
In the evenings I would sit Vipassana, to Vipassana.
And sometimes I would meet with Gil and we would take a walk, we would talk about practice.
And I remember one time telling Gil that I have, I have a two prong strategy for happiness.
Kind of like a parallel strategy.
Okay, you know, and the first, the first strategy is to, you know, to make so much money.
So we have so much resources that I could satisfy every desire that I could have.
And they'll be happy.
And then the second prong, the second strategy was to have few desires.
So I don't remember what he said, but it was something like, let me know how that works out for you.
And so I kind of had these parallel tracks and sort of unbelievably to me,
both of those were kind of blossoming at the same time.
I was working at this company at Google, which was just overflowing, was just growing so fast, is getting so popular, so profitable.
And then at the same time, I was really getting drawn into Dharma practice.
And kind of my, my head was overflowing with so many books and talks and, you know, retreats, short retreats.
And after a while, I felt maybe around 2004, 2003, 2004, I felt about Google, I've got to get out of here, you know.
It's too comfortable. It's too nice.
It's kind of like, if I don't do it now, you know.
And so I've been practicing for about three or four years. I was 26 years old.
And I quit my job and I moved to Tasahara, which is this, some of you may know it, it's a Zen monastery in Carmel Valley, near Big Sur.
And I went on a three month retreat and ended up doing six months of retreat that year.
So that was another big turning point for me.
And a big practice question for me at that time, something that was really, really compelling to me, was, um,
what is the difference between Zen and Vipassana?
That was, I don't know why, that was such a big issue for me.
And, you know, they're kind of sibling practices.
And now I would say that I feel at their deepest level, there is a difference.
But they do have different approaches.
And so one of the ways I came to understand it for myself was that Vipassana was something active.
It was like, you know, there's something to do. You can follow your breath.
You can open to sounds. You can open to sensations in the body.
And in a way it's a kind of doing. And then as the practice unfolds, you know, that doing undoes itself.
And then, at least the way I was practicing it, sort of took the other side.
Very receptive, very accepting, kind of, it was like a non-doing.
One quote that comes to mind from Suzuki Rashi was something like,
reality is like a bed that is so soft and so deep, it can accept everything exactly as it is.
You know, that kind of feeling to it.
And I really like that. Something about that really spoke to me.
I feel that in a way, Vipassana for me, it was almost all too easy to turn it into a project.
You know, like everything else in my life, you know, kind of, that I could evaluate myself on.
You know, you can either do it well or you not do it so well.
How many breaths can you stay with, kind of thing.
And Zen just totally destroys that. It's like, it pulls the rug out from under you.
Very early on, I asked a Zen teacher named Mel Weitzman at Tasahara.
I went up to him and I said, what do you do when you sit Zazen?
And he said, you know, I kind of expect him to say, well, I follow my breath, you know.
And he said, I express who I really am.
So over and over, I would kind of ask, you know, what are you doing here?
And he would say, we're not going to tell you how to do this.
And so at Tasahara, instead of meditation instruction, what is offered is something called the practice of just sitting.
And my understanding of that, or the way I kind of could relate to it, was just sitting, was like just experiencing your life
as it is, as it actually is, without trying to change it, without trying to tinker.
Someone says, and it flows from the insight that the point of practice is to be yourself.
And so it's, you know, in a way, it's like, how could you do it right and how could you do it wrong?
How could someone else tell you how to be you?
It doesn't make sense.
So something about that was very helpful to me.
It was like just showing up to this moment, however the moment presents itself.
And for me, this turned meditation into a refuge in a way I could finally stop evaluating myself.
And, you know, and just sit, just, you know, without any sense of, you know, there's a right way to do this.
Along with this, another big learning for me there was this idea of no gain.
You may come across this in Zen books.
But it was particularly important to this kind of practice.
And the idea was just to do something for the sake of doing it.
That the payoff for an activity is in the activity itself.
And that was like, you know what?
I just think it goes against the grain so much of, at least my conditioning, you know, we do things to get results.
And it's the same way with practice.
It's like, you know, we so deeply need to feel that we're going to get something out of all this practice that we do or don't do.
And, you know, so this idea of no gain.
And in a way, I think we need a fantasy to bring us to practice.
You know, what this practice is going to do for me.
How this is going to change me in some way.
You know, and it's like the fantasy is like the ideal.
And then the practice of mindfulness is the practice of the actual.
You know, so we bring all our fantasies, it's fine.
And we just come in and we just practice with them.
So just sitting, no gain.
And then the third thing that I think I kind of got from Tasahara was physical pain.
In Zen, the instruction, the request is to sit still.
You know, don't move when you meditate.
And when you don't move for a long time, there's going to be some physical pain.
And the idea, as best as I can tell, you know, I'm not a Zen teacher.
But I think the idea is that learning to stay with physical pain,
learning to not run away from it and to kind of stay with it, develops a capacity.
It develops a kind of container.
And the idea is hopefully that will generalize into the other kinds of pain in our life,
you know, emotional pain or other things.
So something about that.
Non-avoidance, I think it is non-avoidance.
You just face it directly and build that container to hold it.
I think it does work to some extent, at least for me.
So those three things, it's like just sitting, no gain, non-avoidance.
Kind of a reconditioning.
And I just thought it was a really beautiful practice there.
Just enter the moment, just be what is.
And I think if there's one thing that I took away from that experience was
learning, you know, when I meditate and hopefully in other parts of my life,
learning how to leave myself alone.
You know, it's like, it's fine.
It's okay.
Something about that.
And so for me, that's very close to something like unconditional love.
And I think that can be a very helpful foundation for vipassana practice.
So those three month retreats were in 2005.
One of them was led by Mel Weitzman and the other was led by Paul Haller.
Both wonderful teachers.
I became very close to them.
Another teacher who was very helpful to me in Zen is a man named Barry Majed
who teaches in New York City.
And he's in the Djoko Beck School.
Also a wonderful person.
So I came back from Tasahara and I felt very motivated to sit more intensively.
But I was looking for a way to kind of combine intensive meditation
with living in the world, you know, living a householder life.
And I was fortunate to have at the time and the money and the health
to be able to start doing some longer vipassana retreats.
You know, a month, two months, three months.
And when I started doing long vipassana retreats,
I made a somewhat startling discovery for myself, which was that
I didn't really know how to meditate.
In all those years of Zen practice, which were so helpful for me and so powerful,
I feel that there are a little bit more about cultivating a global attitude to life, to practice.
But it's not exactly meditation in the way we think about meditation here.
And Zen teachers are very quick to say, Zazen is not meditation.
Zazen is not meditation. It's like, okay, but what is meditation?
That's what I wanted to know.
And I think sometimes in practice there can be a time when you are just very ready,
very almost ripe to get specific instructions about how to practice,
how to work with the body, how to work with the breath.
And coming out of these six months of retreat, I was ready to take in the vipassana instructions
in a way that I just wasn't ready when I first started sitting here.
And so on, those long retreats, I learned a lot about how to observe.
You know, how to observe very, very carefully.
You know, it's one thing to just, you know, it's like I'm present.
Thursday night, we're in California, America, the universe, you know, I'm present.
And another thing to be present for the very beginning of a thought, you know,
to be present for the tiniest microscopic sensation that makes up the rising and falling.
So something about that, learning how to observe very carefully, how to concentrate,
how to develop deeper concentration, the difference between concentration and mindfulness,
learning about insight.
Those were so helpful for me.
I felt like that was something that I could access on a longer retreat, a longer vipassana retreat.
So, you know, so in a way for me, it was like sitting the longer retreats, there's a movement,
there's a progression towards something that's more and more subtle.
You know, just kind of peeling back the onion in a way, refining something more and more.
You know, so that was just my experience that the on vipassana retreats was able to access a depth of meditation
that I hadn't accessed before.
And I felt very lucky to work with some wonderful teachers, spirit rock, IMS, people like Guy Armstrong,
Carol Wilson, Joseph Goldstein, Jack Cornfield, of course Gil, retreats with Gil.
A few Asian teachers like Paok Sayadaw and Sayadaw Upandita.
So, I think a long silent retreat for me, I feel, is a very special opportunity.
Because you go into another world, it's like this world that you go into is totally designed to support you in meditating
and to support you in going deep, as deep as possible.
So you just go deeper and deeper and deeper and touch something that's real, touch something that's true,
and then come back, come back from retreat, come back into the world, and find it everywhere.
So something about that, this beautiful rhythm.
And just discovering the tremendous power of mindfulness, of the mind.
You can say mindfulness, mindfulness, mindfulness.
And there's something, I mean, it's a powerful quality of mind, it's like magic in a way.
And it can grow, and it can be strengthened.
So, anyway, that's been kind of my path.
Something about cultivating these two sides of practice, accepting what is, and then making effort.
And making effort in a particular way, a real careful effort.
So balancing those two sides has been very meaningful to me.
And I guess the only other thing I wanted to say is just that I think you will encounter many techniques for how to meditate.
There's so many ways to meditate, and there's so many teachings, and there's so many teachers.
And it's kind of like skillful means, and it's all good.
But I think the inspiration to practice, the inspiration to practice, and the perseverance to keep at it,
that's something that's very special.
You can learn skills you can learn, you can learn concentration, you can learn all these things.
But the way seeking mind is something that's very precious and it's very rare.
I mean, just think of how unusual it is to be doing this practice, to find this practice, especially in this culture.
So I heard a great teacher once say, the best technique is your own sincerity.
And I really like that.
I think that's really true.
Something about that, it's like, if you keep looking for the truth, it will find you.
And we never have to fear the truth.
And that fearlessness or that trust or something, it can be a beautiful gift to give to other people.
Thank you very much.
I think we have ten minutes for questions or comments, complaints.
Hi, I was wondering if you can tell why, not why, not why.
Is that made you choose the most vipassana over Zen?
What is the part that was missing?
Is it just the meditation part or other things in it?
I don't think I chose. I mean, I guess what I would say is my goal is to practice vipassana with a Zen mind, something like that.
Or it's like, I remember one time saying to Gil, something like, I feel like, in a way, vipassana has verified my Zen practice, what I learned in Zen.
So I think of, so that's at the deepest level, I think of vipassana as an expression of Zen.
And then I do think there's something that, I like the idea of vipassana of, there are skillful means.
There is a map of practice.
There is a way of, I don't know, of teaching that and of learning that.
And for me, I just feel so grateful to Gil and to all of my teachers.
But on retreats, the vipassana teachers who gave me instructions, that was just totally changed my life.
And I may have figured it out on my own, I may have taken another hundred lifetimes or something.
So it's like, those teachings and the people who offer those teachings, basically out of compassion, they don't have to do that.
You know, Gil doesn't have to come here every week, so I, something like that.
So I asked Gil once why he gave up Zen, and he said, I haven't given up Zen.
I think for me, Gil was, you know, was my first model.
And in a way, you know, he would talk so much about his Zen experience.
I just felt that, yeah, there's really no differences, like, to kind of go between the two.
And then also, in a way, especially for someone who's younger, who's in their 20s, it's like,
the Zen model is easy to access because you can go, you don't need any money, you don't need any skills,
you can just go and they'll teach you the practice and give you room and board and you just work there.
And that's, you know, a beautiful model.
So there's something ironic about, or seems to me that there is about Zen, Vipassana,
and what you're saying regarding the practice and no practice.
I've only sat Zen a few times. I don't know it well, but I've always been struck by, there's so much ritual.
And I've heard Gil hint at it a few times, but I've never heard anybody so clearly say it that you don't do anything in that ritual.
So what's the ritual about? Well, the irony of this.
Only a Brooklyn person would, the ritual is an elaborate ruse, kind of a Kabuki show, and it can take many years to realize that it's empty.
And I'm only partly kidding. I mean, this is my understanding, but I feel like the ritual is kind of an opportunity to be mindful.
And to actually accomplish the ritual, you have to be pretty mindful, be present, very aware of your body.
In Zen, when you walk into the meditation hall, you have to do it with a certain foot.
I don't remember if it's the left or the right, maybe it's the right foot.
But you have to be, and if you do something incorrectly, someone will say, kind of point it out to you.
And so I think there's something about mindfulness there, maybe that's one of the functions of it.
But it's often in a Zen meditation hall, it's set up like a mandala.
So it's a very beautiful way of the monks moving around and expressing emptiness or expressing that, but in this very particular form.
Steve.
I first practiced at the Rinzai Soto School down at the Zen Center of Los Angeles and actually studied with Joko Beck.
But a lot of, I remember Zen practice is expressing appreciation.
What you do when you enter the Zendo, I mean the bowing is, and by the way this has always been a pet peeve, so I will now get it on the Internet.
But those of you who bow to your pillow that comes from Zen and you're not bowing to your pillow, you're actually bowing to the person on the right and left to you to express appreciation for them practicing.
That's how you show respect.
So when you go to your seat, there's no one at your seat obviously, but there's someone you're right and left and you bow or you bow to the people in the Zendo to express your appreciation for them practicing.
Yeah, I remember a Suzuki Roshi quote, something like, if there's no bowing, there can be no Buddhism or something like, you know, bowing was so intimately connected to understanding the practice of expressing appreciation.
So I sat at the LA Zen Center one time, and at that time, I don't know what they knew now, but people were getting hit with a stick.
And I didn't know what I was supposed to be doing, and I thought, do they just, how do they decide who to hit with the stick, you know?
I know, I figured that out later on.
So I'm thinking about, later on, you know, what is the difference between Zen and Vipassana?
I thought, hmm, Zen is stick, Vipassana is non-stick.
The non-stick pen.
So in Western Zen, in American Zen, at least all my experiences, you have to ask for the stick, you request it, but in Japan, they come to you.
And there's a guy who creeps around slowly, tiptoe.
And then if you're slouching, or if you're sleeping, God forbid, they don't give you a few.
I have a question. How do you accept life the way it is, like you said?
But at the same time, sometimes you feel that you need to make change, like your case you said, that you feel you need to get out of the job.
So how do you reconcile that on one hand, accepting?
I mean, that's what it is. On the other hand, sometimes you feel that you shouldn't accept it, you need to make a choice.
Yeah, no, it's a great question.
One thing that I would say is that accepting things as they are includes accepting that you may need to make a change.
I think that's where we each have to use our wisdom.
I think that the element of acceptance in that is being in touch with what you're feeling, in touch with what you're thinking.
So it's not just like, this is the way it is, it will always be this way.
But it's like, it may be like, this is the way it is, and it doesn't feel okay when something is off.
And it's like, okay, to accept that, and to accept that.
So I think the part of acceptance is the part of to really be honest with this is the way it is, as opposed to the way I wish it would be.
And then out of that honesty, I think there's a wisdom that it's like, okay, what is the appropriate response?
Is it to get up and leave, or is it to say something, or is it to...
My mother was just telling me, we should probably end after this.
My mother was telling me she was just in New York, and she was walking on the street.
And there was a mother who was screaming at her three-year-old in a way that she felt uncomfortable.
And knowing my mom, I knew she was going to say something.
And she said, you know, I just kind of turned, or my mom would...
But what she did was she just said, your daughter is so beautiful, or something.
She just kind of totally changed the energy, and she could have said, how dare you talk to her like that?
So there's many different ways to respond, and I don't think there's a formula, basically.
But I don't think accepting things as they are should be confused with being passive.
It's totally different.
Okay, so thank you very much. Thank you.
