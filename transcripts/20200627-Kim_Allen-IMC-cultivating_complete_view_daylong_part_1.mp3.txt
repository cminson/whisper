The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So welcome to today's day long.
I'm calling it Cultivating Complete View, five key supports.
I think one of the earlier versions said Right View, and that's part of what we'll talk about in the initial
teachings. But the sense is that how we see the world
has such an important impact on not only our own well-being, of course,
but how we're seeing the world benefits, how we go out and act or relate with other people,
and then that will impact them also. So it's important.
If we're meditators, we understand that we sometimes have to change how we see the world.
That's a lot of what meditation is about, is seeing the way that we're interacting or relating
experience, and then finding ways to do that that don't bring about suffering.
So this makes it a practice.
Just as an overview of the day, we'll be doing some sitting together, obviously,
as well as I'll be offering some teachings. We have some periods of walking.
There will be one and probably two opportunities to go into small groups for a short period of time.
So I'm hoping that this, as well as some chances for large group interaction.
So my hope is that by having these different mixtures, those who are looking for a fairly silent day long,
you'll have an opportunity for that. We'll have quite a bit of sitting.
But those of you who are also or in addition looking for some connection with the others here,
I definitely want to provide that. I heard the call from several of you that it's really community is so important at this time.
So we can take advantage of the Zoom platform that makes it quite easy for us to do that.
So, and in fact, part of the teachings today are how important it is that we each other.
It's not really only about reading or hearing from a teacher.
We learned so much from our discussions and conversations and interactions with other people, all of us walking the path together.
We'll have a period for lunch that is intended to be spacious, so you're not kind of rushing to get through that.
It will be part of the practice to be able to have a chance to do your lunch and maybe have some little time afterwards.
So I think it'll be at least an hour, maybe 75 minutes for lunch in the middle.
Also, I noticed that the different publications around this sometimes said it ended at 3.30 and sometimes said it ended at 4.
And so I was a little surprised by that. So I guess to sort of accommodate everyone's plans for the day,
I will aim to finish us by 3.30 in case there were those who were counting on that.
But I'm kind of going to see how the day unfolds, see how we're feeling in the afternoon.
Just out of curiosity, though, how many people could stay until four if that were possibility?
Okay, I see some hands. Okay. Okay. Very good.
All right. So to start us off then on the topic, many of you may be familiar with these teachings on the Eightfold Path,
which is a series of areas of practice that the Buddha offered to us where if we work on those kind of deliberately and consciously,
we will find ways to harmonize them and get them into alignment and they really cover much of our life.
And the very first of these is our view or our understanding.
And it's important that in Buddhism, this is not understood to be a doctrine or something that you would believe in,
sort of tenets that you have to take on.
Rather, view is just one of these many facets of our experience that we look at carefully,
and therefore it is actually a practice and our view is going to change as we go along the path.
Our view being how we see things, how we orient, how we meet experience.
And the word on the Eightfold Path that goes in front of each of the Eight Path factors is usually, we would hear it as
right view or wise view, and then the other's intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration.
But this word in Pali is Sama, and Sama has a variety of meanings.
It doesn't have just one English translation that's the exact word.
And interestingly, the word itself comes from a root that means together or drawing together.
And so it's a reasonable translation to call it complete, complete view, Sama, Diti.
So what would this mean to have a complete view of a situation or a complete view of our experience?
I think it points away actually from having just one rigid idea about how things are or one way that we see things,
and instead points toward something a little more comprehensive than that.
And the teaching that will be kind of framed around today, or at least the structure, this subheading I add of five key supports,
is a teaching from the Angutra Nikaya that says that there are five dimensions through which we can cultivate this practice of wise view.
And I will put them up on the screen briefly.
I promise this is not like a PowerPoint presentation kind of day, but I do have a few slides just where it's,
why not we have the online platform so it's easy for me to be able to show you these things.
So this is A&525 is the teaching for those who want to look it up.
And these are the five factors that assist development of complete view, virtuous behavior, learning, discussion, calm, and insight.
This is not a common teaching. You may not have heard this one before.
But it's interesting to me, and the teaching doesn't consist of much more than that.
It's the sutta. I mean, it's just a list.
But you can notice things about this.
For example, they include certain actions.
Virtuous behavior is an action, something that we do in the world.
Discussion is also an action.
Learning might be reading or going to a Dharma talk.
They encompass mundane thought, learning and discussion.
Reading books, listening to Dharma talks, talking with other people.
So often we're told in spiritual practice that thinking is bad and anything from your rational mind or anything that uses your intellect is not spiritual and is not liberating and is so forth.
I would say that the Buddha did not teach that.
It then goes on, though, the other factors of calm and insight. These are samadhi and vipassana practice.
And so these also encompass meditation.
So it does say that action and thought alone are kind of everyday sorts of things are not quite enough.
We need to meditate also.
So we'll then go into those components also.
And they include things that are individual, such as meditation practice and some kinds of learning, as well as things that are relational.
For sure, our virtues, behaviors, relational and discussion means we're talking with other people.
So there's a lot of different dimensions.
If we want to cultivate this complete view, this way of seeing things that is liberating, it includes a lot of different dimensions.
And my hope is that through the course of today, we'll see different aspects of all five.
We're going to use all five of these and maybe broaden out our understanding of this important first path factor of wise view or complete view.
So as a little preview of the structure, I'm going to give three different teachings on that we're in the suit as it says what wise view is.
It's not always described as the same thing.
So I'm going to give three different views of view, if you will, and through these five dimensions of virtue, learning, discussion, calm and insight,
and we'll examine those through meditation and through a couple of chances to talk with each other.
So it might be interesting throughout today to sort of think from time to time which of these five key supports seem to be active.
You know, like for instance, right now, we're kind of doing learning that dimension, but you may also be doing some calm if you're sitting quietly.
Like you're meditating a little bit while I'm talking.
And in some ways where we've already taken on the virtuous behavior of dedicating ourselves to doing a day of practice.
So we can already be benefiting from the wholesomeness of that, which is a very important support for cultivating the path.
You might also consider, just as we're starting out, which of these five seems familiar or comfortable or something that you say right away, yep, that's part of my practice.
And which one or more feels a little unfamiliar, like, oh, I don't know if I do that one or I don't know that I see how that one really fits into the cultivation of wise view.
That might be interesting to reflect on.
And then another thing that I'd like to suggest is as part of our kind of introductory stance is consider if you have a question in your mind today about coming to this day long.
What was interesting to you, what question when you think of complete view or supporting it or cultivating view as a practice view as a practice.
What does that mean? If there's some question for you about this, this path factor that was relevant to the topic of this day long, and you might even want to write it down.
If you have such a question, almost everybody has a question somewhere coming to something like this.
And the reason I'm suggesting this is that, first of all, it's part of this process of learning and discussion. And that would also include sort of internal reflection and contemplation.
These help us really hone our understanding.
And also, there's the reminder that in the course of a day or any kind of teaching, you are responsible for finding the answers to your questions. And so, if you know what they are, that's a good start.
And then you can practice with that throughout the day, or if it seems like it's not being touched on, you can ask a question. There will be chances to ask questions. Make sure that you're finding from this what is most meaningful and is calling you to come to this.
I really wanted to be a meaningful and growthful experience for you.
So with that, I will then ask right now if there are any questions before we get started with our first sitting.
And I can't see all of you. There's Sheila. Okay. Does meditation help with the wise view or a complete view of what life is about?
It does help with that because life is rushing by so fast. We don't get a chance really to get a very complete view. And we need times where we stop and we sit down and we open to what's really here.
I think if we don't do that, it's very hard to get a complete view, no matter how much we read or talk.
Okay. Also then, okay, actually, before we sit, then I want to introduce the first teaching because it's relevant for our sitting. So, you know, what is the first view that will take a view.
And in this case, I want it's very simple. I have it stated again on a slide so that it's easy for all of us to read together.
There are two conditions. So this is a very short teaching. This is actually pretty much the whole teaching. It says there are two conditions for the arising of complete view, which to the voice of another and wise attention.
There are two conditions for the arising of complete view, the voice of another and wise attention. Those of you who aren't muted, if you could use mute, we're getting a little bit of background.
This word, wise attention, translates the Pali word yoniso manasikara, and you don't need to know that. It was written on that slide, but you don't need to know the Pali.
But I would point out that this word manasikara literally means manas is mind and kara is like a roti to do.
So it literally means done well in the mind. Done well in the mind. So there's something about what's called wise attention as a way in which we were bringing ourselves to experience in a way that is helpful to us.
We all know that we've had times when we were paying attention well enough, we were going through, we knew what we were doing, but it wasn't in the most helpful way.
Like maybe we were paying attention in a way that was kind of oppositional or a way that we had a little agenda of wanting to get something or manipulate somebody or judge somebody.
So we were there, we were paying attention, but it was not quite conducive to seeing the complete situation, shall we say, something like that.
So these two factors, the voice of another and wise view, part of our reflection is going to be why these two were singled out as so important.
But this wise, this wise attention, sorry, I said wise view earlier, but the voice of another and wise attention is that we're paying attention in a way that whatever is wholesome in the mind is growing and whatever is unwholesome is falling away.
There's another teaching that actually says, when a practitioner attends appropriately or attends wisely, skillful states that have not arisen will come into being, and skillful states that are already present will be strengthened,
and converse, unskillful states that have not been, that are not present will not arise, they will be prevented, and unskillful states that are already present will fall away, will be abandoned.
So doing well in the mind has to do with connecting better with the wholesome and abandoning the unwholesome.
I would say also that appropriate attention or wise attention includes some ability to remember teachings and apply them in the moment, so there's some connection also to the teachings.
Okay, so with that, I thought we would start with a guided meditation.
So please take a posture that is upright and also relaxed.
Settling into your seat, you may, you can just stay sitting where you are, or if you want it, you can move over to your meditation spot as long as you can still hear,
just allow yourself to settle in, maybe taking a couple of long, slow, deep breaths.
Again on the exhale, allowing any surface level attention that's ready to let go, just to soften.
First of all, doing so you can close your eyes.
Perhaps feeling the contact points, so your seat against the chair or the cushion or the bench, your legs or your feet against the floor.
Feeling the stability support for your body from where you're sitting.
That can maybe allow us to relax a bit, let go into the support.
We may get a sense that with the grounding into the support, there's a way that the body raises itself up from that.
It releases upward.
You may almost imagine a small thread at the top of the head lifting the body slightly through that erect spine.
And then softening around that straightness, so softening in the face or head around the eyes, the jaw, just softening the expression on the face.
Softening the eyes and the eye sockets.
Moving down into the shoulder area, softening the shoulder joints.
As the shoulders drop, maybe imagining the shoulder blades sliding down the back.
The shoulders aren't really rounding forward, but just lowering down away from the ears.
Releasing through the arms and the hands.
Moving down into the chest torso area.
Letting the heart and lung area be soft, feeling the ribcage, front, back, sides.
Moving down into the belly, allowing that to be soft around.
And all the way down into the legs, releasing any racing.
All the way down into the ankles and the feet.
Just returning attention to the sense of the whole body sitting.
We may begin to connect them with the sensations of breathing.
Just allowing the very natural process of breathing, simple sensations.
And in the mind, consciously bringing to mind a sense of the goodness of choosing to do some practice today.
It's a really good intention and that comes from the wise view that practices good.
It's helpful certainly for you and even more for others around you and for the world.
It's actually good to know that, to find, to sit and think, yes, this is good.
Just in a simple way, feeling the virtue or the ethical approach of meditation.
And then returning to the sensations of the breath in the body, letting there be a sense of ease and calm to whatever degree that's available.
Even if the mind is busy or has a bunch of other emotions, these are all fine.
We can just hold those in the overall sense of the ease, the goodness of practice.
All welcome along with the breath.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And when the mind naturally gets caught up in its own thoughts or distracted in some way, it's fine.
As soon as we've noticed that, we just allow the body and the breath to re-arise in awareness.
We could even remember our good intention to be sitting and practicing today and there's no need for it to be any particular way or to achieve anything.
Just being here and doing it is great, is enough.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're not aiming for perfection or an ideal but just a direction, a direction of attention where it moves more toward the wholesome.
Sometimes it includes kind of smiling at our experience.
This body, this mind, this is how it is now with a little smile.
Just staying with the calmness of the breath and the overall awareness of what else is in the mind.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In the last five minutes or so of the meditation, you may wish to scan through the body again.
Notice if there are any places of tension that have crept in in the head or the shoulders, belly or the legs.
And just once again, invite some softening.
It's natural that things shift while we sit.
It's different now than it was at the beginning.
And so we just respond to that.
Part of keeping a complete view is now and then checking out the whole situation and realigning with how things are now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Two factors for the arising of complete view are wise attention and the voice of another.
Let me reflect. Why are both of these factors necessary? What experience do you have with each?
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm going to have a chance to talk with others briefly, but I'm aware that we've been sitting for a little while.
So if you want to take a moment to stretch or if you need a bio break, my clock says 10.28.
And I'm going to start again and introduce you to the small groups at about 10.31 or 2 on my clock.
So please make sure you're back by then or you can just keep meditating if you want.
Okay, so it's good to see you. Several of you, it's like most people are back.
So since the first teaching was on wise attention and the voice of another, this is our chance to have those two present perhaps in these breakout groups.
What I'm hoping is that I know we've just been sitting and so you're fairly, you might be thinking, oh, now I don't want to talk.
But my hope is that that meditative stance that your mind may be in a bit more now, you can bring into this discussion.
You know, this doesn't mean that we're just going to throw all that out and talk and talk and talk.
But instead it can be kind of a deliberate mindful engagement with the other folks in the group.
And when I'm hoping that you'll talk about here's the question is considering these five key supports, which I'll name again in a moment.
How can they really be brought into a lay life? You know, we're all lay people.
How are each of these five going to contribute to wise view in the lives of regular folks like us who are busy and have relationships and maybe maybe jobs or community engagement.
How are they relevant? And you can also in the context of that talk about the ones that you really feel connected to.
I asked at the beginning which ones kind of struck you as yeah, those those make sense.
And also maybe share which ones you feel a little bit less connected to so that if somebody else in the group has some ideas about that,
you might have some wise attention and consider what they say about how they might be important.
So let me again go over these five so that we all know what they are.
I could put them back up on the screen briefly.
But I'll also name them. The great thing about this is that people who have different kinds of learning styles can all benefit right from the zoom.
So here it is for the visual learners. It's up on the screen.
But I will also say these five factors are virtuous behavior or ethical conduct, learning, discussion, calm and insight.
These five are supposed to assist us in having a complete view as the first step of the eightfold path.
Okay, so please hang on for a moment while I organize you into groups.
You'll have let's see it's about 1034 or five.
Why don't you talk amongst yourselves for 10 minutes and just be sure that everyone in the group contributes to the degree that they want to.
And then we'll come back together and I will ask, I won't call on all of you individually or anything,
but I will ask that a number of the groups share their ideas about how these five are relevant in a lay life.
And also I'm curious a little bit which ones seem to be the most important or the least connected for you just so I have a sense of where that is.
Okay, let me do this.
Okay.
So it'll be about 10 minutes and I'll, I can communicate with you with little texts during the session and then we'll all come back.
Okay.
See many folks are coming back.
All right, good. So how was that?
Is it, I see some smiles. Okay, good.
So I'm, I am very curious to hear a little bit about what you came up with and.
Yeah, and any thoughts about these five.
Did someone have their hand up there, Lydia. Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So what a wonderful, wonderful group discussion.
There's three of us.
We're all from different location, Raj from Wisconsin, then Marie from UK.
But it's so interesting when we look at this five factors.
And we all, we agree that the first one is really a fundamental, the ethics, you know, this building on the foundation.
But I noticed that to me, I pair the two and three together because the, for my learning to be most effective.
And it's a sangha discussion.
I need my Calianta Caliana that it makes the learning so rich because when I learning by myself or in a Dharma talk environment, it's a, it's just kind of one dimension.
And if I have the discussion together with a learning, it's bringing so much rich point all the different facet.
Then the next two, the last two, I pair them together also just because I don't get too many insight.
But whenever I got them, usually it's a very calm, serene time that the insight popping out.
And the last thing is I try to connect with, you know, during the meditation and you introduce to the wise attention and the voice of others and trying to connect that to this five factors.
I haven't reached the answer yet.
Okay, I think another part of complete view is that it always feels a little bit incomplete.
If it ever actually feels complete, I think we would be worried about that.
So that was great. Thank you, Lydia.
Other comments.
Yeah, Jerry.
I keep a very short eye. A little bit more time in those breakout groups.
Oh, was it not quite enough time?
You know, since the virus, I've been doing a lot of zooming.
But even today, even just now, I felt like another two or three minutes we could have.
So we broke the ice. Everybody had something important to say. I thought it was important.
But then we didn't have time to do much back and forth really.
Okay.
That's just my viewpoint.
Right. I saw a couple of knots when you said that.
And so I appreciate the feedback.
Let me tell you that it's very hard to judge when I can't feel the energy of the room,
which is how I usually would do it.
So we do our best. We do our best. Thank you.
Other comments. Jean.
Well, as you know, I came in late.
And so this voice of another, I'm curious about it.
Does it mean to listen?
A voice of another, or does it indicate to go to teachers or wise people and listen to them?
Yeah, I think it's a bit of a discovery for us what, you know, what this voice of another means.
But I think for me, there's something very sweet about it in that it sort of implies that the Dharma is a person to person
transmission and that we, first of all, we don't do it completely by ourselves.
So there's some indication of interconnection.
We may at a more subtle level invite some consideration of which voices do I want to listen to?
Because all day we hear the voice of another, don't we?
Other people in our household or, you know, the internet is sending us voices, things that we read or listen to.
And so we might be invited to ask, well, where's, we could take the broad view and say there's Dharma in everything,
you know, what's the Dharma in this voice that I'm listening to?
Or we might be a little bit selective and say, you know, knowing that wise intention means that I know the wholesome things are growing
and the unwholesome things are declining.
Maybe if I listen to something that doesn't do that to me, that's not a voice that's part of the Dharma voice that I want to listen to.
We can also have that kind of discernment.
It seems very interesting that it's put in there with wise attention to mean this is right view.
So it's very important, obviously.
Yeah, it is important.
Somehow the prompt comes from outside of us in some way.
But on the other hand, we have to be listening for it.
So there's, I think there's maybe two different responsibilities there.
Yeah, interesting, very interesting.
One more comment from Jerry.
Also, I can't quite see everyone.
So anyway, go ahead, Jerry and then Nancy.
Lately, I'm into seeing my delusions and they're sort of funny.
So when I meditated, I thought it was inner voice and wise attention.
But then when you talked about wise attention, I laughed that it's actually the voice of another.
But I'm a little embarrassed to say this, but I don't know the voice of another doesn't totally.
Maybe I'm not the good best listener, but I don't think it doesn't really exist without some sort of the perimeter of my voice.
In other words, it is interact.
It is, it is relational listening to another voice.
Yeah, I just can't.
I mean, it's filter or taken in with my voice.
Right.
But with my own point of view, actually.
So it's interactive in that way.
And so I found that it's very interesting, very relevant to me, actually.
As a, to be a good student is to pay wise attention, not only to the voice, but to the inner voice interacting or discounting or getting agitated with.
So I found that that it was extremely interactional that those, those two.
Yeah, you're pointing to something quite profound actually is that, you know, our own conditioning and habits of mind really filter what we can actually hear.
And it's very humbling when we first see that it's like, wait a minute, this is, we're very participatory in what we hear.
Let's say that way.
So yeah, I see you nodding.
Yeah.
It's interesting.
That's why this is a practice.
That's why even view is a, is an ongoing practice.
Okay.
Nancy.
Yeah.
Did you have something?
Yeah.
I wanted to thank you for having number one this course because I'd finished the eight full path a couple of weeks ago, I guess it was.
And the most difficult part for me was the right view.
It's taken me this whole last year really to try and figure out what it is.
And sometimes I'm still not sure what it means.
And so I'm, I'm loving all of this.
The part that I connected with so far was the learning aspect.
And when we talked about the voice of another and wise attention.
I immediately came to mind of the teacher and a student that you're listening to the voice of another.
But that can also be meaningless unless you're giving it wise attention in that you're internalizing what you're hearing and somehow building a
relationship to what's being heard.
So that was my feedback.
Nicely said, there's an image while you were speaking.
I remembered an image from the teachings that is that there's a difference between if there's soup and a spoon in the soup.
It doesn't have much interaction with the soup.
It's different than if there's a tongue in the soup.
That has to do with our connection to what we're hearing is, are we just like the spoon, you know, kind of just touching into it like that,
or is it more like we put the soup on our tongue interacting with it that way.
Thank you, Nancy.
Other comments? Anything else?
Susan.
It seems like it's interesting this voices of another and wise attention because, you know, we start out and all we have is our own view.
And this is a very interesting thing to say because it's a clue that maybe there are other views.
And so wisely listening to others and paying attention to how others use, how we interact with others.
I think that's why almost more than just a teacher.
I mean, of course, there is the teacher, but I think it's just pointing to looking at how we interact with all others.
And I think that's a big part of developing a wise view is that you have to look at all aspects of view, period.
Yeah.
Yeah, it really points away from settling on to just one view.
Okay, great. I'm Kumi.
Thank you.
Thank you, Kim.
So complete view, I thought about what Gil said, this too, including this outcome.
So this too, and just come always.
Oh, this too.
And to be wise enough to include everything.
Yeah, thank you.
Yeah, so very inclusive. Okay.
Great.
So let's, let's go on then to consider another dimension of wise view.
I said there would be three today. So I wanted to introduce the second one.
And for the visual learners, I will also put it on the screen.
So the view, the idea that wise view has to do with knowing about what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, or we can say skillful and unskillful.
Those are equivalent translations of the word, which is, which is again a word that has doesn't have just one English translation.
So I put a couple quotes here that relate to this.
There is complete view that is mundane.
There is fruit and result of wholesome and unwholesome actions.
So this statement just says that you would believe that there's, there are effects, and that if you do something wholesome or if you do something unwholesome, there will be some results of that.
So believing in cause and effect.
And we have the second one here, when a noble disciple, that's all of us, when a meditator understands the unwholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome, one has complete view or wise view.
So two different angles on the same idea that somehow wise view, this first step of the path has to do with discerning.
That's another word that people use in relation to wisdom, discerning what is wholesome and unwholesome or what is skillful and unskillful.
And sometimes people then worry a little bit, oh, there's a, there's a judgment here of some kind.
I don't think we can walk the path unless we have some kind of discernment about what works and what doesn't work.
And many of us know from our lives, however many decades we've lived, that we have at some points in our lives pursued things that really just didn't work and in some ways.
And so, and we're slowly honing in maybe on a wise way, a skillful way or a complete way to be with our lives that is skillful, is wholesome, and that leads more toward more freedom, more peace, more ease.
So this, this sense of view as a discernment of that is found throughout the teachings.
And so this is related in a way to karma or karma, the effect of our actions.
When we do things in a certain way, it might lead toward happiness, peace, connection, wisdom, compassion.
And if we do things in another way, it might lead toward disconnection or not peace or things that are not helpful in our lives.
And so starting to see that, and this is now really gives us the sense that view is a practice because it takes a while to kind of discern that through, through our actions.
Now we can understand this in an intellectual way.
And I think it's good that part of the learning is that we can read about, you know, what are the skillful intentions, what are the unskillful ones, what is, you know, what are these teachings talking about.
And in addition, we'll also start to learn experientially through doing the practice.
Remember the Eightfold Path includes things like speech action and livelihood are our ways of being in the world.
And by doing those, you know, just in living the living a human life, we learn about what works and what doesn't work.
And there are, so these experiential learning methods are very interesting.
I have a couple of sutas about that there is, you may have even heard of these, there's one that the Buddha gave to his son, Rahula, and it's a teaching about reflecting on our actions.
So he first of all says that any action that you want to do is going to include body and speech and mind.
So we would think about our physical actions in the world as well as our speech and even our thoughts, the way we were thinking about things.
And so he says, Rahula, when you wish to do an action with the body.
So when you're thinking about doing something, you should reflect upon it.
Thus, would this action that I wish to do lead to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both?
Is it an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences with painful results?
And so if you reflect that way and you realize that that will do that, then you don't do it.
You have a chance not to do it.
Similarly, of course, if it seems like in advance it's going to be something skillful and helpful and lead to good results, then you should go ahead and do it.
And it doesn't really stop there though.
He actually then goes on to say, while you're doing the action, you can have the same reflection.
Does it seem to be working in this moment?
You know, I thought it would be a good idea to start to broach this topic of conversation with my partner.
But as I start to say it, their face is clouding over and I'm thinking, oh, maybe this isn't so good.
So then you have a chance to redirect.
If you're mindful about that, you have a chance to redirect and think about changing the way you're saying it or something.
Or if it seems to be going well, like the person looks interested, okay, then you can continue.
And then the same with afterwards.
Maybe you've gotten through the whole encounter, but then you reflect back and you think, well, I wasn't so truthful in the way I said that.
Or if you realize there's been some harm or it wasn't quite an authentic thing to say or do or even think, then there are ways that you would maybe try to correct that.
Or it says in the sutra, actually, it says that you would go and talk with a wise person about it.
But as laypeople, we can also choose to go and talk with the person themselves.
So it's very, you know, whenever I hear this teaching, I think, well, that's so basic and obvious.
And yet it's so good to keep remembering it.
It's like, oh, that's right. This is a good way to do it.
Now I understand that you can't reflect before, during and after every single act of body, speech, and mind that would be impossible.
So it's not meant as something quite so fine grained as that, but it's a guidance, you know, it's a way of considering how to do our actions in the world.
And as we start to do that and actually pay attention in that way, we're developing a more wise view and a more complete view of how human interaction and behavior work in ourselves and in our relation to others.
And then there's another sutra, not to just throw a lot of sutras at you, but I think it's also quite wise.
This is a teaching that the Buddha gave to a group called the Kalamas, which were some people who they actually weren't Buddhist.
They were just residents of a town that a lot of spiritual teachers came through and the Buddha was one such teacher who came through.
And they were kind of skeptical by the time he got there, because every teacher who came through would say, here's the right way.
And what I'm telling you is true and what all those other people say is not true. And then the next person would come and say the same thing.
And then they were confused. And so they said to the Buddha, well, now you're here. How do we know who to believe?
All these people come through and people say, this is good. That's good.
And the Buddha realized that he was going to have to give them something very practical. And so he said, well, first he said, yeah, it makes sense that you would be confused.
You hear all these different things people telling you and we may feel the same way living in our Internet culture.
We can get anything. We can tune into all kinds of stuff coming in all these voices of another, right?
And they all say, this is the right way. This is the thing to do. Here's my suggestion. Here's my technique.
And how do we know?
So he says, well, again, he gives sort of a reflection and he says to the column, as you can reflect to yourself.
If you know for yourself, these things are unwholesome. These things are blame worthy. These things are censured by the wise.
These things, if accepted and undertaken would lead to harm and suffering, then you should abandon them.
So he says, think about whether or not the results of this are going to be good, including whether or not wise people say they're a good idea.
So there's the voice of another coming in, right, even in his list of things.
Then you think you just don't do those things. And interestingly, it includes the phrase at the end, if accepted and undertaken would lead to harm and suffering.
And it might be that to know that for sure, you might have to actually try something out, undertake something, see if it works.
And I think there's something very forgiving that approach toward ethics in this sense is that he says you should actually, you might actually have to try things.
The same with Rahula, you know, you think in advance, is this going to work? And you think, yeah, I think it is. And then you try it.
But maybe it doesn't work while you're doing it. And so then you correct. So it's not ever a sense of here's the here's the 10 things, the 10 commandments that you need to do or not do.
That's it. It's a very experiential. There's always an encouragement that we would try it out. See in the moment, is this working or not working?
And that's part of this discernment, this development of you.
And then of course, for the column was the converse is also true, you know, when you notice that something is wholesome is blameless is praised by the wise, if accepted and undertaken would lead to welfare and happiness, then you will do that.
So there's, you know, there's a very practical side. And this is about our also about our cultivation of wise view.
So experiential learning. So I think the second step of learning, it does go with the discussion in some sense.
I think that was partly how it was intended, but maybe it includes experiential learning to something where we would actually feel in ourselves whether or not something is working in the moment.
So are there any questions on that. Before we do another sitting together.
This is our second understanding of wise view.
Wholesome one wholesome action and result karma.
Okay.
Oh wait Sheila.
What if there's someone who doesn't have like full control of his life or her life.
And, you know, they're under someone else's control.
And they're, I mean, maybe they're unable or they're able or not able to follow, you know, unwholesome, I mean, wholesome behaviors or behavior actions.
So I was wondering if there is an answer to that.
You mean like if you need to interact with such a person.
No, it means like say if I were working for say someone who was a bully.
Okay, yeah.
Or say someone is married to a bully.
Okay, yeah.
So, you know, the person who is being controlled.
How can that person, you know, undertake wholesome behaviors, maybe he or she is being stopped.
Right, I see what you're saying.
Yeah, I was just wondering if.
Yeah, I don't think these teachings are meant to be super easy for us.
But they do remember that they've at the top level encompass body, speech and mind.
And so if we find ourselves in a situation like this where it's a certain situation like that, we can at least begin in the mind with a sense of compassion for ourselves.
You know, wow, this is a hard situation that I'm in.
It may be a stretch at that point to have compassion for the other.
I'm not saying that's needed.
But, you know, when we start to have just that modicum of compassion and respect and love for ourselves, we may find a way through that to be able to take an action that puts us in a more wholesome situation.
I'm not suggesting anything dramatic or obvious, but immediate, but I would start internally, which is always our private territory.
And then from there, finding ways to improve our situation because out of love for ourselves, we want to get ourselves into a more wholesome situation.
And there are cases where the outside conditions have just come, which we're not in complete control of. We are not in total control of our situation.
And that was even more true probably in the Buddhist time.
So these are teachings that are meant to be gentle also, not in the sense of you are good or bad, but that we can take wholesome or unwholesome action even if we're in an oppressed situation.
At least mentally we can do that.
So we start there. It's like a little kernel, and maybe it will grow in some way.
But yeah, we are not always, we are not able to completely shape our lives the way we want to.
That's part of what we have to learn along the path.
It's a very tricky balance of we have some degree of control and awareness, but not total.
If we're total, we'd all just get the manual and know how to do it.
It's more nuanced than that, isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
At least we have a place to start with the internal thoughts.
Yes.
Thank you for that question.
Thank you.
Okay, so let's do another sitting then.
So please find a posture that's again upright and also relaxed.
Coming back into your own internal sense, had a little bit of time talking with others and also looking at a screen,
which is a particular conditioning on the system.
It's just how it is to look at a screen is that our eyes maybe get a little strained.
So deliberately softening the eyes,
maybe taking a couple of long, slow, deep breaths,
settling in again to that internal space.
Maybe some energy in the system because talking bring up some energy and just looking on that as some dust has been swirled up or the water's gotten a little muddy.
And if we just just let it sit still, some things will slowly settle out.
And just looking at ease with whatever energies there are in the mind and body right now.
Softening through the body.
Relaxing the shoulders.
Let them drop away from the ears.
Softening down through the belly.
Letting go of any breathing in the legs.
And tuning into the sensations of breathing.
Having a sense of ease or softness in the body so that the breath is just natural.
It might be long, it might be short, it might be deep, it might be shallow.
It's all fine, we can just notice how it is now.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
As we continue to sit with our breathing and also a general awareness of what's in the body and mind.
Again, tune into how we're being aware.
Is there a sense of wholesomeness in the way that we're aware?
So those would be a sense of gentleness or ease, acceptance, compassion.
We don't need all of these, but just a stance that is encouraging of what is good in us.
If there's some part that's not on board with that that's feeling critical or judgmental or if our mind is going to thoughts of sadness or depression or anger today,
then that is what we can hold with that sense of ease and inclusion.
It's kind of a simple awareness that honors the complete experience we're having now.
And it often helps to have some anchor to the present moment, such as the breath, breathing with and through whatever is there.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.

Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
Relaxing the body.
So these teachings on skillful and unskillful
or wholesome and unwholesome go very deep.
And they point even toward truths that are beyond just what a certain culture has decided
or beyond conventional ways that we've structured things among humans.
I'm reminded of this verse from the Dhammapada which says,
Hatred never ends through hatred, through non-hate alone does it end.
This is an ancient truth.
We may have heard that before, but sometimes I'm struck by that last line.
This is an ancient truth.
It doesn't say, you know, this is true because we've decided it or because it's a good idea.
It just kind of points toward, this is just how the universe works.
And part of wise view, eventually complete view is starting to understand just how things function.
I find it enormously encouraging that somehow there's some skillful direction
almost built into how the universe works that we can tune into.
We have access as humans to knowing, some kind of knowing of what is skillful and unskillful
for ourselves, something that we can feel for ourselves.
And so I invite, we're going to do a period of walking meditation now.
And I invite reflection on kind of what the Buddha was pointing the columnist toward.
What is it that you know that you don't have to have the voice of another for, right?
Here's a contrast.
What do you know internally so well about what's skillful, non-skillful, wholesome, non-wholesome.
You just know that's how it is.
His teachings start to point toward that.
So for the walking meditation, it's a little, just a little after 11.30 now.
Why don't we, it'll be relatively brief because I want to do one more segment together before we break for lunch.
Why don't we come back at about 11.47, 15 minutes from now and we'll aim to all be sitting down and starting before 11.50.
So enjoy your walking, find a nice space in your house or outside and maybe reflect on wholesome and non-wholesome.
See you soon.
Okay, so I hope that the chance to walk was a chance a little bit to integrate some of the teachings.
It's often done in Asia where the monks are learning the texts or maybe they're learning Pali or something they're studying.
So they're doing one of these components of the five factors for right view or complete view is that they walk back and forth while doing this.
And it's, I've certainly found for myself that the walking meditation has a way of integrating things that I've been taking in.
And also, you know, this sense of the wholesome wholesome and unwholesome, I think relates back to that teaching on what is wise attention in that first teaching about wise attention and the voice of another.
If we have a sense that our mind is attending in a way where the wholesome factors are supported or increasing and young wholesome factors are at least not growing and possibly are diminishing.
That connects in right that quality of wise attention is itself the discernment of moving toward the wholesome and away from the unwholesome.
So we have a connection between these two dimensions of wise understanding with complete view.
I'm going to keep using all kinds of different vocabulary for this that we've had so far.
And we'll have yet a yet a third one in the afternoon.
So I first wanted to offer a chance for you to ask any questions or make any comments about this teaching on unwholesome wholesome and karma as part of wise understanding.
Yeah, does anyone have any questions or comments about that?
Jean and then Nancy. This is a quick question.
I found when I was walking and starting to reflect that I was thinking about concentrating on the steps.
And so I just decided to concentrate on walking.
So the question about reflection as reflection is reflection about devoting oneself to thinking about a certain thing or does it come up out of the practice itself and not necessarily thinking mind.
Yeah, that's an interesting question.
The function of mind that does thinking or reflection or contemplation can come from a lot of different places.
So we were familiar probably with discursive thinking, which is what when we sit down and meditate and the mind is going.
And we know from experience that that's, I don't know if it's, you know, strongly unwholesome, but it's at least not helping anything.
It's just feeding one itself. And we can reflect on teachings in that way.
Also, we can kind of just think and think and think about things that we've heard in the.
However, it's also possible to start to use it.
So then then people sometimes get the idea, well, I need to just turn off my thinking mind because it's obviously not helpful for anything.
And so there's sort of a suppression or moving away from that.
And that's, I won't say that's totally wrong if you have a mind that concentrates. Well, I'm taking your answer a little bit more general, by the way, Jean, because you've touched into something really important.
So it is fine to actually just kind of let the thinking settle out and go into the concentration if that's easy for the mind.
But I think especially the teaching that we're looking at today where we have these five different factors and two of them are related to thinking, you know,
learning and discussion, we might want to start thinking about are there skillful ways that we can include our thinking mind and our analytical mind that separates things out.
And so I didn't have a chance to teach this earlier, but you've given me an opportunity to say a couple of things about that.
One is that it is possible to bring in that kind of mind and coordinate it with the body, like while you're walking, you know, step by step, like what I just said, that's great for memorizing things.
So you can line up your thinking with your body movements.
And that can actually help to integrate teachings into the mind body system pretty well.
A very mundane example of this not related to the Dharma is that I used to work in a lab and I had to learn how to use a whole bunch of different pieces of equipment all around this lab because I was trying to get one particular thing done.
I had to go use the oven here and then the mixer there and then the, you know, the depositor here and whatever.
So it was enough things where it was a little bit hard to remember all of them, but once somebody had showed me how to use each machine to do the thing that I needed to do, I would find that I could go there and just kind of reach toward the machine.
And I would remember, all right, first I have to set this and then I have to press this button.
And it was sort of in my body memory.
I think people are familiar with this also.
So there's a way in which we can do Dharma reflection as body memory and it really is really good.
It really actually supports our practice to do that.
So that's thinking, but it's connected to the, to the body and that's all quite mundane.
And then in addition, there's a way in which after we've done some amount of meditation practice and actually gotten the mind calm and maybe stopped all that discursive thought at least temporarily and gotten settled.
It is possible for the mind of wisdom that emerges at that time to go back and do thought from a place of wisdom.
But thinking is not automatically done from a place of busyness or unwholesomeness or wanting or not wanting, which is usually where surface level thinking comes from.
But wisdom can think too.
Compassion can think.
Love can think.
So these other qualities of mind when we're really strongly in touch with them can generate rational linear thought as well as as anything else.
And so we need to learn to recognize, you know, when our thinking is coming from different places.
But I don't want to make thinking out to automatically be bad because, you know, some of the great spiritual leaders of the world, you know, have written wonderful things.
Well, that's linear thought and put into words.
So I've made it much bigger than your question.
But it was a beautiful question because it gives us a way to relate to thinking and reflection as part of the path and as even an emergence from wisdom.
Thank you.
Was that adequate?
Did I then actually miss your question or?
No, you didn't miss it.
I think I'm actually more with it because to understand it more and there's more for me to deal with this.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
And then Nancy, did you have something?
I thought I saw your hand and I saw I see Casey's hand also.
Casey, because I've gone before and you partially answered my question.
Okay, we'll see. Let's have Casey and then if there's, if you still have a question, we can get to you later too, Nancy.
Hi, Kim.
Thank you.
That was a great answer.
Yeah.
Good to see you too.
So when I was doing walking meditation, it was the first time that the suggestion of like, you know, wholesome and unwholesome thoughts for me, which was very helpful.
But it was also the first time I was dealing with some very stronger versions where I live. There's construction on all sides, like six days a week, you know, eight plus hours a day.
So I was, it was interesting for me to kind of work with that because, you know, wholesome unwholesome.
So I was wondering if you had any, any tips because my inclination is to kind of want to find the quietest place I can find.
Yeah.
Yeah. So that's so interesting, right? Because our, our, our wanting of the wholesome means that we're seeking, you know, we're seeking certain things.
And, but if the situation isn't producing that, then we might have some aversion to it.
I guess the first thing I'll say is to, to be careful not to be too averse to your version because that just adds one more thing.
It's like, oh no, now I'm complaining, but I'm supposed to be a spiritual person and complaining is bad and, you know, that kind of thing.
So I think it's possible to recognize that within that, yes, there's a version.
And so, okay, maybe that's not the most skillful approach, but it's coming from a place of care about your practice.
And you know from experience that being in a quiet place is supportive.
You know, if we could all be sitting in IMC right now, that would be great.
Of course, sometimes there's construction outside of IMC. I've been there during that.
So maybe often what, what happens in the mind that's, you know, in the regular world is there's a mix of stuff.
You know, there's the, there's some things that are wholesome and some things that are unwholesome.
And, you know, it's true that sitting there and being irritated about something you can't control like the sound of the construction.
That's harming you at that moment. It's not doing anything with the construction workers. They're just doing their thing.
And yet you can also kind of what I do when my mind has a sort of a mixture of things is I just try to favor the ones that I know are skillful or wholesome, you know,
and so that more of my thoughts and actions are coming from that side.
And okay, maybe there's still some aversion, but okay, I'll then apply some acceptance to that or something.
And not worry too much that absolutely everything in the mind is completely pure and wholesome, but more that I can hold all of it in awareness.
And then that awareness is itself wholesome. And if it's aware of something that's a little bit unskillful going on, that's okay, because it's, I'm seeing it.
Does that make sense?
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And that's, that's super helpful.
Yeah. Yeah, this goes back to the one we had earlier about, you know, what about if you can't control the world? It's like, yeah, we can't control the world. That's right.
So we have to have other strategies for that. Yeah.
Thank you.
And then Megan, I saw your hand.
I was curious about wholesome and unwholesome actions.
But I guess what I'm trying to say is I like I quit drinking 10 years ago.
And what I found out from going to AA is they would only address the quitting drinking issue rather than what drove me to want to drink in the first place.
Those underlying feelings, those urges and desires and that feeling of emptiness or loneliness.
Which is how I came to Buddhism is because they address those issues.
And I guess my question is that even though I might not engage in that unwholesome activity, there still lies inside of me those cravings and desires and that void that I'm trying to compensate with something.
It still comes up and I'm more aware of it now.
I don't feed it with food as much as I used to.
So I think becoming more and more aware of it is helpful.
But I was just wondering if you have any advice on how to address it because it's kind of been with me for so long.
Sometimes it's hard for me to even be aware that it's taking over.
This is a wonderful question because it's so you're so aware of your own mental tendencies.
Not everyone knows that they have more root tendencies underneath toward things like loneliness or other such things that are driving behaviors that look like they might be unrelated to that in some way.
So if you remember from the teaching that the second teaching said, when a person understands the unwholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome, then one has wise view.
You've named that you've seen that there's not just good enough to look at the unwholesome, you have to look at the root of it also. That's what that teaching is saying is that we have to keep looking a little bit farther down to maybe we spend a lot of time pruning the leaves.
We never get down to the roots.
So the teachings that we're doing here and through Buddhism are meant to eventually get to that more root level. And that's usually if we want to get all the way really to the root, it does require the fourth and fifth factors on that list, the calm and the insight.
It's that we can change behavior on the regular everyday level all we want, but if that root is still there, it will find other ways to come up through.
We can start to get more skillful approaches to it like, you know, meditation is coming to maybe addressing loneliness through going to a meditation community.
That is really skillful, actually, compared to addressing loneliness through drinking or through other less wholesome ways. So we're getting there.
And then these, yeah, we do really need to go a little farther down into mind, which is what we'll talk about more in the afternoon.
It was like, how can we get to the, what is the root of the unwholesome? What does that mean? It's just a word. No, actually, there are specific teachings on that.
And then there are practices that help us get closer to that, which mostly relate to the meditation and to seeing in ways that will really penetrate and cut out those roots eventually.
But it's a long process, so it's patience is helpful. But you are on the way. I mean, not drinking for 10 years is already a good start and knowing that there are deeper roots that you're working on.
That's it. That's a form of wise view right there.
Okay.
Susan, and then we'll make that one the last one before we go for lunch. Yeah.
Oh, you're still muted. You must have hit it twice. Yeah, there you go.
Okay. This is just a comment on your instruction.
I thought it was interesting because, you know, the walking meditation and the contemplation of these, the wholesome and unwholesome, just by combining the two, it immediately brings your attention to noticing the body.
And so, I mean, it's just an interesting trick way to get us to pay attention to what's going on within. I think it's interesting.
So I just wanted to comment that just the combination. Okay. I'm glad that worked for you, but I wasn't playing any tricks.
No, no, no. Just the movement itself, you know, you're moving and so you're paying attention to the body and what's wholesome, what's unwholesome as you're going along.
And it's just a reminder. Yeah.
Be more mindful of what goes on in the body.
We have so much information available through the body and we may or may not take advantage of it, but it's, yeah, for me, at least I can feel tension in the body when I'm, you know, thinking or speaking in an unwholesome way.
There's some effect in the body and I, for me, it's just been invaluable to tune into that.
So it is a very important channel if it works for people. I'm glad that you saw that.
So directly, thanks for the comment.
Okay, so we're, we're moving into our lunch break and let's see, it's 1206. Why don't we, for spaciousness, why don't we come back at 115 and it'll be an opportunity during this time.
Some of you may be interacting with other people in your household.
At least we'll probably be going and getting things out of the fridge or somehow taking care of that.
So it's an opportunity also to use this first step of the ethical conduct, you know, are we going to the fridge with a sense of greed and I'm going to get the best that I can.
And if I eat this thing and my partner won't get it for later, you know, I don't know, whatever, but, or, you know, other issues of irritation that may come up or something.
So we have a chance to kind of incline our mind toward a wholesome state, which, as I noted in one of the responses, can include encompassing unwholesome states with awareness.
You know, if the mind has decided to be irritated about this, we don't need to say, Hey, you shouldn't do that.
That's getting more irritated. So holding that in awareness and just so I hope that the lunch will be a chance for some daily life practice of of these five.
And then when we come back in the afternoon, we'll have the third aspect of complete view and some more sitting and also a chance for some more small group interaction and some walking.
So all this, everything from this morning repeated again. Hope to see you again on 15. Have a wonderful lunch.
And if you will nourish the body.
You
You
