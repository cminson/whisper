I'll kick us off. 
Just a really warm welcome to everybody. 
It's just what a delight to join together and study the dharma, practice together, explore it together, and not so much that we have all the answers and that we're going to provide all the answers, but just engage with the teachings together in a way and to explore them. 
It's a beautiful thing. 
It's really touching for me. 
And maybe I'll say just a few words about this class, just a few words, and then I'll pass it on to my co-teachers here. 
For those of you who don't know me, I'm Diana Clark and again a warm welcome. 
And this class is, we're doing this kind of format where it's Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, all in one week. 
We're just going to get into the groove of equanimity for this week as a beautiful way to kind of cap off 2020. 
And then just a note that the class on Saturday is a little bit longer than the class on Tuesday and Thursday. 
And then maybe I'll turn it over to my co-teachers so they can introduce themselves and throw their voices in the room. 
Yeah, maybe I'll go next. 
So my name is Ying, Ying Chen. 
I'm just so happy and delighted to see you all. 
Yeah, so a super study and practice has been just a real nourishing source of my practice. 
And I'm just so happy to share this with you all and with my co-teachers. 
So, welcome. 
Go ahead, David. 
Yeah, I'll add my welcome to Diana's and Ying's welcome and just say something to just kind of re-strike the study and practice note. 
We, of each of us in our ways, found it very rich to bring some of the engagement with the textual tradition that underlies the teachings in our scene, bring them into our practice and really make them a living part of our practice. 
And so it's a great pleasure to think that there are other kindred spirits out there and just want to add that to my welcome. 
Welcome to this kind of study and practice mode or aspect of enriching practice and we really look forward to doing this exploration with you. 
I will note, Diana, when you said we wouldn't be answering all the questions about 10 people left, but maybe others will come back. 
Okay, so I would also like to put my voice in. 
I'm Kim Allen and it's really nice to see so much interest in this topic and also it's a joy to be able to teach with Diana and Ying and David. 
We've done a number of these together and we're, maybe I'll share that one of our little jokes is that we're always happy when we find that we have more students than teachers. 
As soon as they get that many signups and I think we've done quite well this time. 
So yes, this echoing the comments about study and practice, it strikes me as so ironic and somehow interesting that here we are in this totally modern online format, studying these teachings from, you know, thousands of years ago. 
And yet when we engage with them, they touch in the heart at really what is special just about being human, something that crosses space and time. 
I'm always struck by that when I engage with these texts and I hope you will be also. 
So then with that, maybe I'll give us something of an overview of the material that we're thinking about for this and it sort of inspired us for this class is that we looked at this term equanimity is sort of a not exactly an everyday word that we use or maybe we have some kind of an impression of what it is. 
That's just from regular usage, but it is used quite frequently in the Buddhist teachings, often in a number of different lists in different ways. 
And we started realizing, well, is this term exactly the same thing every time it's talked about. 
And we thought, well, maybe not or maybe it's one thing that has a lot of different facets to it different dimensions to it. 
And as it's engaged within different practices, it might have a different flavor. 
It's kind of the word that we settled on is that equanimity will have a different flavor. 
For example, if it's engaged with as an insight practice and ends up being part of the factors of awakening. 
That might be a little bit different flavor that if it's engaged with as a Brahma Vihara is one of the heart practices. 
So it shows up kind of in different ways under different conditions. 
And so we thought to explore some of that in this class and in particular, the awakening factor will be explored today. 
This is kind of a deep steadiness or non entanglement, or even letting go in the mind. 
Equanimity has that flavor when it's used as a factor of awakening in those practices. 
And then Thursday will look more at the Brahma Vihara at the heart practice, in which case, equanimity could be said to be a form of love. 
They all in our tradition, we understand the Brahma Vihara is to all arise out of Metta, the first one loving kindness. 
And so then you get to equanimity at the end and people say, Well, why is that even related to these other sort of more warm feeling ones, but it's a kind of love, it's the love of the truth. 
And so we will explore what that means and how it comes out of the other and relates to the other heart qualities that we're maybe more familiar with. 
And then equanimity is also a very important part of Samadhi or maybe concentration or, you know, we'll use a number of different words for that. 
But it emerges as a sort of a deep simplification of the mind as we engage with Samadhi or gathering of the mind type practices, and that will be our focus on Saturday. 
We have a little bit more time to do some longer meditations. 
So I hope that in the course of this exploration of different facets or flavors of equanimity, you'll come to see how there might be some different qualities to them, and also how they're developed and cultivated. 
And we'll go through in each case some practices that I helped to connect with the kind of equanimity that's talked about in that practice. 
And we'll see that in most cases equanimity comes out sort of at the end. 
It's so the word we came up with and when discussing this is that it's kind of a capstone to a number of practices, you know, you do other things and then somehow arrive at equanimity. 
It's also called in a technical term in the teachings, it's called a resultant. 
It's something that comes about when other conditions are in place, or when obstructing conditions have been removed that can be there. 
So we'll see how that comes about in a from a variety of different angles as we explore it. 
And then I'd be remiss not to say that there are enormous benefits to equanimity into this cultivation. 
A steady mind is a gift to the world, if not, and of course to ourselves, but you know, we'll see the wonderful beauty of the equanimous mind, not at all cold or indifferent or uninterested, but really quite engaged, but in an unattached way. 
So, I hope that was enough of an advertisement, perhaps to have some sense of what we're going to get into in the next three sessions. 
So then let's, maybe I'll just pause and ask if there are any kind of overall questions or questions about the format or the recording or anything about the sort of logistics of the course. 
And I can't see all your hands so you could use the little blue hand if you know how to do that on the participants tab, or just unmute yourself. 
I'm not expecting any questions necessarily I just wanted to not go forward before everyone was comfortable with all that. 
Okay. 
Very good. 
So, today's focus then is equanimity, kind of in the, in the neighborhood, let's say, of being a factor of awakening. 
You know, because maybe we don't get to the factors up to the last factor of awakening immediately but there's a lot of qualities that we develop that are in this neighborhood so it's maybe, maybe this is the most familiar form of equanimity that you might think about what you've learned or practiced already. 
So it's equanimity as steadiness and steadfastness in the face of our changing experience. 
So the ability not to react, not to get caught up, not to get drawn in, but instead to just be with experience, if you will, that's kind of the most broad idea. 
So, I said a moment ago that equanimity has different flavors in different practices. 
So we're going to start to kind of hone in on what we mean here. 
The monastic teacher, Analyo, venerable Analyo, he calls, he finds it useful actually to distinguish different terms for these different flavors. 
So he calls the factor of awakening equapoise and the Brahma Vihara equanimity, because in his mind, they're different enough. 
And I wanted to name that at the beginning. 
I think we'll just say equanimity throughout this course, but the word equapoise, at least to me, has a sense of, it brings in explicitly the idea of standing in a steady and balanced way. 
So equapoise, equapoise, equapoise as a sense of being there in a balanced way. 
So I think that maybe captures the flavor quite nicely. 
The most common polyword for equanimity is upeka. 
That's U-P-E-K-K-H-A, upeka. 
And it literally means the word roots mean looking on. 
So the implication is that one has kind of a big picture of you or you could imagine, maybe you could imagine sort of standing up on a hill, but it doesn't have to be like in a remote way. 
Oh, thank you for writing that in the chat, David. 
So it doesn't have to be in sort of a remote detached way, but it's a sense that we're with something, but we also are aware of the bigger picture that it's happening in. 
And so we're not as likely to get sucked into the details of it caught up in the excitement of it or some such. 
So we're not getting pushed around by it. 
That's actually another meaning of upeka is that it has a neutral feeling tone to it. 
It's related to feeling tone. 
So there's also an implication that we're not getting pushed around by things that are pleasant and unpleasant, which is something that we'll look at also when we get to the dharma teaching, the sutra quote. 
So this is how it's used in the factor of awakening. 
The mind is stable in the face of changing experience, which is actually what allows it to see clearly enough. 
You know, among all this change, the mind can see clearly enough in the end to finding an alternative to change. 
So let's look then at a sutra where the Buddha talks about cultivating a mind with this kind of steadiness or steadfastness. 
And that I think was sent to you by email, but I'm going to read the key section. 
So that'll be fine. 
So in this, in this sutra, which is from Manjimuni Kaya 62, he is talking to his son, Rahula, and he's encouraging Rahula to learn to sit calmly in the face of strong feelings or strong feeling tone. 
And so this is the passage that's quoted probably the most often you may have heard this from other places. 
So Rahula, develop meditation that is like the earth. 
For when you develop meditation that is like the earth, arisen, agreeable and disagreeable contacts will not invade your mind and remain. 
Just as people throw clean things and dirty things, excrement, urine, spittle, pus and blood on the earth, and the earth is not repelled, humiliated and disgusted because of that. 
So too, Rahula, develop meditation that is like the earth. 
For when you develop meditation that is like the earth, arisen, agreeable and disagreeable contacts will not invade your mind and remain. 
So it's quite powerful language. 
So we can maybe notice first that the earth is just such a, it starts with a very visceral image. 
There's gonna be other images later, but the earth is strong, steadfast. 
It's also vast, you know, there's a sense of vastness that brings in this idea of the big view. 
So we would make our mind like this. 
What would it be to have a mind like that? And then there's this lovely phrase, agreeable and disagreeable contacts will not invade your mind and remain. 
So we're learning to tolerate, we understand that we need to tolerate things that are unpleasant. 
That's often what people are arriving with first in practice is some dukkha or suffering and needing to find a balance with it. 
But the implication here is that we also need to learn to be balanced with very pleasant sensation, things that we can get drawn into or excited by or caught up in. 
So either way, the earth can handle those kinds of things. 
Of course there's, so that's that sort of neutrality that was mentioned. 
So even with things that we might find disgusting, you know, so it labels, it includes these bodily fluids, again, as a very visceral sort of thing, but we can imagine what would it be like to have a mind that's not disgusted by these things. 
At this point, I maybe I'll put a little aside and also, which is that this is kind of the sutta study angle of this, is that we might be tempted to bring in modern ideas in hearing about the earth and having dirty things thrown on it and the earth doesn't mind. 
And we're in an environmental crisis right now. 
And in some ways, the earth is telling us that it does mind that various things are being done to it. 
And so I don't think, I think there's a, but you can understand that this came out of a very different culture and a very different time where those ideas were not common parlance in people's understanding. 
So we can just note in our mind, okay, I have this response that actually I don't think the earth likes all those things that we're throwing on it. 
But for the purpose of sutta study, we can say, okay, this is an analogy for the mind. 
And maybe our first exercise in equanimity is allowing those feelings about how we may feel about environmental situation, not to color our understanding of what the Buddha is pointing towards in terms of mental development. 
So that's, yeah, just a little aside. 
So then the sutta goes on to talk about other elements. 
It's not really only about the earth, it's about a teaching on making our mind to resemble some of these physical elements. 
It has a broader context in the sutta. 
But so it goes on to, I won't read the entire passage for the other elements, but just highlight the key part. 
So he says, Rahula, develop meditation that is like water. 
Or when you develop meditation that is like water, arisen agreeable and disagreeable contacts will not invade your mind and remain. 
Just as people wash, clean things and dirty things, excrement, urine, spittle, pus, and blood in water, and the water is not humiliated, et cetera. 
So we have a sense then of there's a different verb, people are washing things. 
And then for fire, it says just as fire burns, clean things and dirty things. 
And it's not upset about what it's burning. 
And for air, just as air blows upon or blows over, clean things and dirty things. 
Again, there's a sense of not the air doesn't mind if it's blowing over the excrement or if it's blowing over beautiful flowers, it's the same to the air. 
But these other ones, so the water and the fire and the air, at least for me, they point to kind of a different kind of strength. 
These are more fluid. 
They're not sort of solid like the earth, which also has a sense of strength. 
These are, we can start to imagine that the mind isn't rigid in these cases. 
It doesn't have to be rigid or overpower or be stronger than these things that it's encountering, but instead, it can just be strong, instead fast in a sort of a flowing way. 
So that can also be an inspirational image, sometimes in meditation. 
Sometimes we have this sort of sense of solidity and strength like that. 
And sometimes we have more sense of flow or of being able to move around or even through things. 
And that's the way that we're not caught up in them. 
So I think we're encouraged to notice that the mind has different flavors like this also. 
And then it gets to the, there's a fifth element mentioned here, which is space. 
Sometimes the teachings include space along with the four material elements. 
Later ones even include consciousness as a six element, but that's not in the sutta. 
So in the fifth element, the language changes a little bit. 
He says, rahula, develop meditation that is like space. 
And then he says, just this space is not established anywhere. 
So too, develop meditation that's like space. 
So it doesn't actually have the references to the clean and the dirty things anymore. 
And just says that space is not established. 
And so we have here yet another kind of strength, strength through emptiness. 
Maybe the greatest stability is not to stand on anything, not to stand on anything at all. 
Just kind of goes against our intuition. 
That's maybe being pointed to a little story is that I once asked a teacher somewhat jokingly, the classic Western philosophical question, which is what happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object? So this is something that Western philosophers pondered for a long time, and there are answers to this. 
So I asked this Buddhist teacher that. 
And without missing a beat, he said, nothing, an immovable object offers no resistance. 
So that's a different approach, right? We would normally think, oh, right, to be immovable, you have to have infinite mass. 
But actually, if you have zero mass, you're also immovable. 
So I thought it was a good answer. 
And then these meditations are actually quite practical. 
I mean, these are things that we're doing on the cushion to cultivate the mind and a sort of a feeling in the mind about how it can be with changing and pleasant and unpleasant experience. 
But there's a story of the same monk, Analyo, I mentioned earlier, who he had been doing a lot of this kind of meditation, and he had just been doing the space meditation and cultivating the mind of space and was sitting with that. 
And he finished his meditation. 
And at that time, he was doing some very controversial work on the suttas. 
He was doing some analysis that not everybody agreed with. 
And another monk came in who was angry about the kind of work that he was doing and the conclusions he was coming to. 
He didn't agree with how he was interpreting the suttas. 
And so this monk actually came and began shouting at Analyo and having very energetic objections to his work. 
And he said that his mind just started focusing on the space in between them and around them. 
And it was kind of just including all of that in the big picture, right? This is starting to sound like the equanimity. 
And he found that he didn't need to react at all. 
And he just sat and listened. 
And he was fully present. 
He didn't associate, but he also didn't get angry back. 
And eventually, the monk kind of blew out his energy and departed. 
So had a very practical impact right then. 
So we can see then that the cultivation of this stability on the cushion can lead to greater stability off the cushion also. 
So there's sort of a direct application. 
So you might want to try, I don't know, try one of these elements out when you feel some need in your daily life to be stable. 
If something's going on in your household or something that you read or something starts to feel a little upsetting or destabilizing, maybe try one of these, try water or air or earth space and see if that changes your interaction with the situation. 
So this flavor of equanimity has to do with the steadiness in the face of what meditation or life is throwing at us. 
And sometimes, just to throw in one more term that you'll sometimes hear in relation to equanimity, particularly this flavor of it, is that often all the things that would throw us off in life are summarized into what are called the eight worldly wins, which is a simple list of things we're all familiar with. 
Pleasure and pain, gain and loss, praise and blame, fame and disrepute. 
We've all experienced all eight of those. 
And the teachings say you don't ever end. 
We try very hard to get four of them and not have the other four. 
But the teachings are very clear that this is just part of human life, is that we have all of these. 
So equanimity is a way of handling all of these changing qualities of life. 
So you can see that there's a sense here. 
Just the last point I'll make is of not picking up. 
So things that might tempt us to react or get involved, we just don't pick them up. 
Joseph Goldstein says, don't bite. 
Don't bite. 
Stuff comes into your mind. 
And it looks like a hook, but don't bite it. 
It's not a good idea. 
And so I would say then that this not picking up, which is emphasized here, the complement of that, maybe just the other side of the hand, would be letting go. 
Anything that has been picked up, we can let it go. 
Things that are potentially in the way, we let them go. 
And this will be something that Ying is going to talk about later today, this aspect of letting go, which is also part of this insight or factor of awakening quality of equanimity. 
Yeah. 
So that's maybe a good overview of this initial part that we're probably familiar with. 
And so now we'll go on and do some breakout groups. 
Great. 
Thank you, Kim. 
Yeah, so this idea of making the mind like earth, water, fire, air, or space is a thing which we use our imagination, rather than just mindfulness. 
Or maybe it's not imagination. 
Maybe it's tuning in to what we're experiencing at that moment. 
But we'd like to put you into some breakout groups where you can talk about this amongst yourselves, these ideas. 
That is like, how does using such an image, or maybe it's an experience for you, support the steadiness or letting go, that equanimity is about this. 
It's telling me my internet connection is unstable. 
Can you hear me? Yes, thumbs up. 
OK, thank you. 
Yeah, these pesky internets. 
So in the group, we'll put you into groups of four or three. 
And it can be really helpful just to say one sentence, one idea, and then have it go to the next person. 
And they say one sentence, one idea. 
And they go to the next person. 
And then if there's a fourth person, it goes to that person. 
And then it comes back around. 
And now the first person, having heard what others have said, maybe has a new idea or can reach a little bit further because maybe the obvious things were said in the first round. 
So in this way, as together, as a team in some way, you can explore this question of, how does using such an image, or maybe it's an experience of the elements, earth, water, fire, air, and space, which is included in the sutra, how does it support the steadiness? How does it provide some stability? How can we incorporate this in our practice if you have? Or if you haven't, how might you imagine that it could support a practice? And for this day long, this breakout group, we trust we're not going to keep you here all day, for this breakout group, we can go into alphabetical order by screen name. 
So a person whose name is closest to A goes first. 
And closest to Z goes last, with apologies to people who have their name closest to A and closest to Z. 
And I think that's it. 
So I have fun and have exploring this idea. 
How does using such an image of earth, water, fire, air, space support practice have fun? Enjoy. 
We'll see you back here in 15. 
I'm going to admit one person more. 
I think we're all back. 
And we have just a few minutes. 
We'd love to just get a sense very briefly from just a few people of how that was, anything of interest that came up that would be useful to share. 
And just feel free. 
We're not a small group, but we're not a huge group. 
Feel free to just unmute if you'd like, raise a physical hand, or use the blue hand. 
But again, maybe just a couple comments from people about what that was like and whether anything of interest came up for you. 
Randy, unmute yourself. 
Thanks. 
Thanks. 
First of all, I want to thank you for such a scholarly approach to this topic. 
It's very wonderful to me. 
And I just wanted to express that those breakout groups are very powerful and bring to me, to my awareness, things that I would never have associated with the topic. 
And so it's very thought-provoking and helpful and expansive to awareness of the subject. 
Because we got into the contemplation of impermanence and courage and humility and middle way that just this spark of equanimity brought out. 
Nice. 
Beautiful. 
Thank you. 
Thank you, Randy. 
And Jerry, maybe one more comment. 
I try to share with the group. 
I don't know how coherently. 
I'll try a second time. 
Is I appreciate quickly going to the fact that some of the metaphor seems outdated because of our modern times. 
So I was disturbed by that. 
But within a day, I found a way to save the meaning of the metaphor by updating it to the fact that our minds, our mind and hearts can only take so much defilement, so many toxins in the modern era, so much stimulation. 
And so there is a point of which maybe part of equanimity is limiting the insults that we take on. 
Otherwise, we will get out of balance like they are and get polluted. 
Yeah, interesting. 
Nicely put. 
Thanks for that. 
And I think that provides a nice pivot point for us to do a little meditation practice with these ideas. 
And it's an interesting thing. 
We noticed that the four of us, as we discussed it, Diana has now left to do teaching in probably another Zoom room. 
Shall we join us, of course, Thursday and Saturday? But the four of us talk about how in reading those passages, when these unclean bodily fluids or bodily fluids that can be unclean are mentioned, we can even now, at this distant remove of 2,500 years, feel some of the effect that can have in the mind, and we can recognize that the mind isn't entirely like the earth, like water, like air, like space. 
And so there's an opportunity, even in interacting with what happens when we hear the text read or read it, there's an opportunity to just sort of watch how much equanimity does rise to meet that moment. 
So let's do a little meditation practice. 
When we have said study in practice, we, in a way, we want to include this heart of our practice that is the meditation. 
And I propose to sort of lead us in a guided meditation that in this very brief set of 15 minutes will make reference to the seven factors of awakening and to equanimity as sort of the capstone factor, but without naming them, without numbering them, without maybe treating them in precisely the order that they're presented in the text. 
But really to just sort of give an example of how equanimity as a factor of awakening can arise in the meditation practice if we sort of get out of the way and make room for it. 
So here's an invitation to sit with us, sit together for 15 minutes. 
We can bring the eyes down, let the eyes fall as we enter the meditation space and recognize that as we do so, we're performing a rebalancing. 
As visual creatures, the visual realm is very stimulating. 
And when we bring the eyes down as we begin meditation, we bring our attention to our inner world, inner experience. 
Maybe we begin our meditation by checking in with the posture and recognizing it so in this case that perform a subtle rebalancing. 
If we're sitting, walking, or standing, we balance the upper body over the torso, over the lower body. 
And we seek in the meditation to establish a place of balance between active present engagement with our experience and sort of a relaxed, easeful attitude toward what emerges in our meditation experience. 
Maybe we take a few deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth. 
And here, too, we balance that sort of energetic addition that that additional oxygen, when it hits the blood, provides nothing magic going on with these deep breaths. 
If we breathe out fully through an out breath, there's a physical relaxation and letting go that happen. 
And here, too, we're balancing that cultivation of energetic presence with our experience and the easeful letting go that can happen. 
Then the breath frequently settles into its regular meditation rhythm. 
And we connect with it in the body. 
We notice where it is in the body, perhaps in the abdomen, the chest and shoulders, the nostrils. 
And as we connect with it, we perform, again, a rebalancing. 
This world of the breath in the center of our attention, the center of our world, literally in the core of our being, is a place of natural balance, natural rest. 
And in contrast to the world of thought, with its quick pace, with its complexity, with the way it can unbalance us, settling in with the breath, bringing the breath to the center of our attention, is a way we rebalance. 
We connect with this breath that is simple, uncomplicated, slow. 
And in its nature balance, it's true physically and it's true intellectually, too. 
The breath requires nothing, demands nothing. 
We don't have to fret about how we breathed 10 minutes ago, 10 years ago. 
We don't have to plan the next breath or figure out how we're going to become expert master breathers. 
When we settle in with the breath, we rebalance. 
Maybe we let go of some of those strivings, but maybe we just set them aside for a moment and we bring into balance another capacity of mind to enjoy the restful, easy, simple, uncomplicated presence that we can find with the breath. 
As we breathe, as we sort of maintain the breathing in sort of the center of our attention, of course, we notice that the mind will get snagged, get caught up, return to thought patterns that we left when we began an hour or so ago. 
We'll find maybe the mind feels contracted or tight, that it feels burdened, heavy. 
And we can, as we reconnect with the breath in the body, as we open back up to the breath, sort of as the center of our experience, we rebalance. 
The mind does its things. 
We rely on the mind to do these things. 
In the meditation, we don't push anything that's happening in the mind away as unfortunate or unbad. 
And we just reconnect with a part of our experience that allows us to attune ourselves, attune our attention to other things that are available in our experience. 
We do this fundamental act of showing up for our experience, this essential expression of self-care, just to notice what's it really like here right now. 
Things happen. 
Maybe physical sensations happen in the body. 
Maybe there's discomfort. 
Maybe there's uncomfortable movements in the emotional currents that we become aware of as we sit. 
And in this meditation, we maintain an attitude of neither being strongly for or against what comes up. 
We notice agreeable and disagreeable contacts when they arise. 
And we sort of adopt an attitude of not letting them remain or endure in our experience for long. 
Instead, continually returning and rebalancing by connecting with the breath in the center. 
From time to time, we notice the minds perhaps become a little more caught up in some quicker activity, thought processes more complex and maybe less balanced, no problem. 
We just tug attention back to the breath or we open back up to the breath and let it become the center of our attention, the center of our world right now. 
Just noticing what it's like right now, connecting with the breath in the body, connecting with that constant rebalancing that the breath performs, just enough oxygen in, just enough waste, gases out, connecting with this essential part of our experience and of our spiritual knowing in which we don't have to be for or against. 
The mind does what the mind does. 
Maybe it gets a little bit caught or sped up. 
And we do this rebalancing. 
We reconnect with the momentum of the breath with its simplicity. 
We enjoy its balance and we use it to rebalance, reminding ourselves that in this space there's no need to be for what's happening or against what comes up, no reason to be opposed to the mind's movements. 
We just keep doing this rebalancing, reconnecting, maybe reminding ourselves that here in this still collected space, there's nothing to prove, nothing to resist. 
With the first bow signaling returning from the meditation, you may notice that a deeper breath frequently just happens. 
There's a rebalancing happening there as we prepare to come back into a different sort of energetic presence. 
The second bow might notice some attention to the posture, to the shrugging the shoulders, stretching the feet, moving the neck. 
And the third breath, feel free to bring your eyes back up. 
Thank you. 
And let me just say this about that practice. 
Sometimes equanimity or equipoise can seem like a high bar and yet we can connect with it just by thinking about the verb rebalancing. 
Rebalance or balance is a literal translation of equipoise, equal weight. 
And it's a verb which is always a good place to settle into our practice. 
And this can be a helpful way to take it in from the meditation practice into daily life to just reflect that this isn't a practice so much or only about getting to a place of equanimity. 
It's a practice about constantly re-establishing balance, rebalancing. 
The means in the end are one and the same. 
We get there by doing it, we get there by practicing it. 
Ying. 
How lovely. 
Thank you so much for my lovely co-teachers who kind of teed me up for those portions of Dharma teaching. 
And I just say that for those who wanted to read the sutra excerpts that we are going to share today, we shared one piece already and I did putting a Google Doc link in the chat box and those who don't have it. 
I will use this for this part of the teaching as well. 
So at this point, you have heard a couple of different flavors of the word opeca, equanimity. 
This is a sense of a balance that David talked about and then Kim talked about. 
And a big view, a kind of overview of the situation, a vastness of this quality. 
So I will share yet another flavor that's often associated with the word opeca and that is letting go. 
In fact, the prominent Chinese translation of this term opeca is this Chinese character which I'll type in the chat box as well for those who read the Chinese. 
I apologize, I don't have another language translation here, but for those who do read the Chinese and found out for looking at what this term character is and can take a look at it in the chat box. 
And this character itself, the literal meaning of it is to let go, to abandon and to discard. 
So it's interesting to kind of feel the effect of those different words, opecois, equanimity, and letting go on us meditatively and felt sense way. 
So for me, I started Buddhism through Chinese Buddhism and I read Chinese text and Chinese akamas and for a long time my default way of associating with opeca is that of letting go. 
I didn't think there were other ways of relating to this term, but later on when I was exposed to English translations and I realized, wow, this other ways of translating this term had brought up all this, you know, kind of very different feel to it. 
So equanimity become kind of an opening. 
And so I think we all shared a little perspective about this because this is going to be part of a sutra study process. 
It's a word of like opeca, many other poly terms may have this multifaceted spectrum of meaning, depending on the context that they're used, even in the texts that we share, sutras that we shared for today, opeca are used in different ways and they don't always mean the same thing. 
And so it's part of our practice to learn to open ourselves up to this different facets as we read them and watch out how we can easily lock ourselves down by the fixed idea of what those terms might mean. 
So watch out for that and learn to open ourselves up and explore this. 
Some of this exploration might feel challenging, but that's part of the game as well. 
So letting go. 
And the Tai Forest Master Ajahn Chah said, if you let go a little, you'll have a little happiness. 
If you let go a lot, you'll have a lot of happiness. 
If you let go completely, you will have complete happiness. 
As many of you probably have heard of this quote before. 
So many of you probably have heard a lot of letting go talks as well. 
So for today, I'd like to link this sense of letting go back to the notion of a capstone. 
So how can letting go be thought of the capstone of the Dharma practice and the awakening factor, the Brahma, the Haras, and the Samadhi practices that we'll be sharing. 
And so I want to share maybe two perspectives on this. 
The first way that we can think of equanimity and the flavor of a letting go to be the capstone of our practice in that it is a necessary condition in our practice. 
You may have heard of this seeing, saying, things break down without a capstone. 
So without some degrees of letting go equanimity, our whole system of a Dharma practice will collapse and kind of fall flat to the ground. 
We cannot practice mindfulness without some hint of equanimity, some hint of letting go, letting go of the constant hooks by whatever might come into our senses. 
If you are aware and you probably noticed this already, there's already some sense of detachment, some letting go of the hook, and to maybe some small degree and maybe to a large degree that is happening. 
And as the capacity of letting go mature and grows, it can become very potent. 
And so the sense of being hooked, being pushed and pulled and can weaken. 
And I always noticed that, for example, and nowadays when my son rubbed his hand on the dinner table on his socks, I just laugh. 
I used to get angry about this, because, you know, can you eat and still wipe your dirty hands on your socks? No, it's just laughing. 
So there can be different ways we began to relate to the things that may be used to annoy us in small ways and big ways. 
And so that's when equanimity began to shape up our practice. 
And so this way of being the capstone of our practice, and it keeps our practice up and hold our Dharma life. 
So our life doesn't collapse back to this forces of unconscious habit again and again and again. 
We are all very familiar with this kind of unconscious habits that's in us. 
The second way that I would relate to this notion of a capstone is that equanimity functions as the capstone in the sense of a platform or a launch point for further deepening of insight and wisdom, which leads to an unfolding of an awakening process. 
And so this is what Cam and David have hinted and talked about in terms of equanimity being an awakening factor. 
And so this factor is a list of the seven, the last one in the list of seven as well. 
And the unfolding of this path with a strong sense of equanimity, in particular with the sense of a letting go, will lead to a complete letting go, which in the tradition sometimes equal to for awakening. 
So we'll look at the sutra excerpt a little bit today. 
And this is a sutra number Majmanikaya 140. 
Both of the senses of a capstone being a necessary condition of our practice, as well as being an awakening factor, a launch point for an awakening process are presented in this particular sutra. 
But the first aspect of being a condition is maybe can be thought of as hinted, maybe not quite explicit, explicit. 
But the second aspect of being awakening factor for the awakening process to unfold is more explicit. 
We won't have time to discuss the whole sutra. 
So we'll look at some bits and pieces related to the second aspect of being a capstone. 
And so in the Google doc, and this is the, you have to scroll down to later part, I'll read some of the pieces here today. 
This is based on Bikko Bodhi's translation in paragraph number 20, starts with the first line. 
Then there remains only equanimity, purified and bright, malleable, willy and radiant. 
I'm going to skip the simile here, and then jump to paragraph 21. 
The practitioner understands this. 
If I were to direct this equanimity so purified and bright to the base of infinite space, and then also the three other different formless samadhi states, and that are the base of infinite consciousness, and to the base of nothingness, to the base of neither perception nor non-perception. 
And to develop on my mind accordingly, then this equanimity of mind supported by that base clinging to it would remain for a long time. 
And so a few things that's very interesting here to point out. 
The first thing is, you can see I love the beautiful words that are describing this state of equanimity to start out with in the first line. 
As Kim was saying, this equanimity is not cold, it just kind of rocks solid on moving. 
But rather it's a very alive, awake, and responsive state of being. 
It's a ripen, it's very flexible. 
And with this kind of equality in this form of equanimity, it can respond to wisdom and insight that unfolds from it. 
So it's very clearly knowing that this formless state of concentrated state of a being in the classic teachings, and these are very refined state of a being that are deeply sublime and peaceful already. 
And each of them have very little sense of grasping and holding. 
And for some people, being in this state might even feel like, you know, this is it. 
But there's a wisdom here that sees and knows. 
There's this subtle clinging to it. 
It's through this clinging that this state of being remains and can remain for quite some time, for a long time. 
And so the wisdom unfolds even further in the next paragraph. 
The practitioner understands thus, if I were to direct this equanimity so purified and bright to the base of infinite space and the dot, dot, dot, the other three formless attainments, and to develop my mind accordingly, this would be conditioned. 
He or she does not form any condition or generate any volition tending towards either being or non-being, since he or she does not form any condition or generate any volition towards tending towards either being or non-being. 
He does not cling to anything in this world. 
When he or she does not cling, he or she is not agitated. 
When he or she is not agitated, the practitioner personally attains Ivana. 
And the person understands thus, birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being. 
Now sometimes reading those kind of very technical passages, it can feel like a reading, I don't know, a doctor's notes. 
Lots of terms that are, you know, maybe not very accessible to us. 
So, you know, sometimes this is the art of reading sutra as well. 
Maybe we'll run into a lot of these terms that looks confusing and we'll say, you know, what the heck is this thing, being and non-being and volition. 
So sometimes we just hold this in our mind, in our being, in our learning for some time and continue to study and allow this understanding to kind of emerge over time in us. 
But I do want to say a few words about this next section of the sutra, maybe in the summary form. 
That is, the sutra describes a specific sequence of unfolding, a specific form of letting go process that's moving through the four formless absorption states. 
And maybe in some ways you can think of each of this as even lesser degrees of grasping and holding. 
But even with this refined states of being, it's still impermanent and the text says conditioned, it's constructed and will be destroyed, will and fade away. 
And so with that understanding, one comes to a point that no longer links to this way or that way, this thing or that thing, this state of being or that state of being. 
And so what Kim was pointing at, there's a profound sense of letting go and one can be equanimous without having to lend itself on anything at all. 
So the text says, not claiming to anything in this world, maybe a kind of form of equanimity that lands in emptiness, not on anything at all. 
And so it's a gradual unfolding and that's one thing to say. 
And the other thing is, this is only one form of unfolding. 
One specific sequence that the Buddha taught to this particular individual who was sitting with him all night long and not knowing it was Buddha who he claimed to be his teacher had showed up. 
But the unfolding doesn't have to be in this specific sequence. 
And so as we read more sutras in this kind of awakening process may happen in different ways. 
In our own practice, it may unfold in different ways. 
But in general, there is a deepening of letting go in our practice. 
And so I want to just point that out as a caveat. 
And so allow our process of our practice to unfold in our own ways, but to notice how this process happens and so that we can learn from it and grow accordingly. 
So I'm going to end now. 
So thank you all. 
And then we'll switch to then open up to some Q&A for today's teaching at this point. 
And you can ask questions or share comments about the whole warnings of the teaching in the last hour, almost hour and a half. 
And so feel free to use your hand. 
We only have a few minutes left in this class. 
Oh, I see Nancy's hand up there, Yang. 
Oh, yes. 
Go ahead. 
Please. 
I just wanted to thank you for the particular sutra with the visualization of the elements. 
I think that, you know, just practically in daily practice, when I find myself becoming irritated or somehow not at ease, that just having those visualizations are very helpful. 
We talked about this in our small breakout group, but it's a lovely, they're lovely images to have. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Yang, please. 
And okay, good. 
Yeah, I see. 
There's also David's hand, so. 
Go ahead, Yang. 
Thank you. 
I wanted to elaborate more on the elements because I started, you know, my kids watch that avatar. 
Do you know that ship? It's a great cartoon thing. 
It's air benders, earth benders, fire benders. 
So we can work with these elements. 
I start thinking about how to skillful ways. 
What is it I'm encountering in the external world? How is it affecting me? And what element would be useful to meet that? And so I've been thinking about, yeah, with air would be some air blowing stuff on every single part. 
You can escape air. 
It's everywhere. 
It's diffusive, right? So something like matter would be like air. 
And I was thinking about like fire or something that burns away and think about unwholesome thoughts like, oh, well, things that really need to be burned away, like right away, really harsh and powerful and violent, like that was thinking about it. 
And earth is a very nourishing absorbing, you know, that relates really. 
And water was something more about cooling anger and things like that. 
And space is definitely around emptiness and so thoughts and selfing. 
And so I thought, yeah, anyway, just a further elaboration of those elements, really lovely. 
And how it relates also to the Satipatana, the first foundation and everything flows and changes. 
And thank you so much. 
Really lovely. 
Nice, nice. 
And I'd say the second sutta we shared, we didn't read the first part. 
The first part is about elements as well. 
And so letting go of the grasping of identifying oneself based on elements, you know, we think of this body as me, right? And this earth and air we breathe in, it's me. 
So there's this gradual transition of letting go into the deeper kind of more refined state of letting go. 
But the early part is the letting go of maybe more every day that we kind of a feel and sense kind of identity or solidity form of the being is to be let go as well as part of the process. 
Yeah, the sutta that Ying Kuo is called the exposition of the elements, MN 140, if you want to read the whole thing, the first part is about those physical ones. 
Yeah, I just want to address the understanding part. 
Because the way I understand the suttas, you know, if I recall them correctly, they both talk about not me, myself or mine. 
They talk about not, you know, relying so much on cognizing, you know, we can take these suttas as a formula that we apply. 
And then that itself can be clinging. 
Because I believe aren't there other suttas that say that one abides in the base of nothingness. 
One does not have to form an intention, I mean, a will. 
The one does not have to will to move to the base of, you know, infinite consciousness or whatever the order is, it happens naturally, it arises naturally, and so on through the whole process. 
So I think we can get that we can interpret mindfulness to be this tight control that gets in the way of the progression of the path. 
And I'm offering that as a question, you can knock it down or affirm it or say something in between, however you think is appropriate. 
Now please don't worry about hurting my feelings. 
You know, I have a first thought about that which is, you know, that's several things. 
You know, I don't think there are templates here, but more an invitation. 
And it's interesting the seven factors, for example, that mindfulness is the first of the second factors. 
It's just a doorway, or that at least if we read it as being a series that culminates in the cultivation or the opening up of equanimity, you know, it is exactly as you kind of lay out David, something that shouldn't limit us, you know, and when and if it does, if that's part of what, you know, is possible in it. 
Yeah, we're sort of, you know, curtailing the capacity to sort of open to those broader things. 
So anyway, those are the thoughts that come to me. 
I do think these texts are so rich and so deep that I don't find in them so much inconsistencies as much as Kim said in her early talk, just, you know, lots of different flavors, lots of different ways in, and not all of them appropriate to each of us. 
There's a way for everybody in here, you know, and there's a way in which we each of us make the path our own, which is to be, is not about just any old path will do or making up any old path is valid, but making it our own, really, really living it, and bringing the study into our practice as we, as we attempt to do in these series. 
Kim or Yang, any other thoughts on that? I think we're right at the end of the hour. 
Yeah. 
So I feel maybe with a little bit of equanimity, all kind of maybe fired you up. 
There's so much more to say. 
Fired ourselves up with the curiosity of the suttas and what is being said. 
And, you know, I just invite you to make it a part of your homework and practice and, and the learning as I invite you to go back and reread this each time, maybe something different would come up. 
And if you're, you're curious, we didn't get the chance to talk about the context of this different text that we extract from. 
And it's, it has a huge impact on how we then relate to the little text that we, we shared. 
So please, you know, feel free to reread MN 62 and MN 140. 
I did a send that to, we sent that out in the email as well. 
And investigate the experience with elements. 
I think many of you shared the connection with that. 
And how is it and making the meditation be like the earth, fire, water, air, space? And so how do we, how does it support the cultivation of letting go? And so may this practice benefit all of us, may it benefit all beings. 
So till next time. 
Thank you. 
Thursday. 
See you Thursday. 
Okay. 
Take care, everyone. 
If you want, you can unmute and say goodbye. 
Thank you so much. 
Hi, Kim. 
Thank you. 
Thank you very much. 
Thank you all teachers. 
Thank you, everybody. 
Bye bye. 
Bye. 
Take care.
