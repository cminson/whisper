 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. The recording didn't start when I asked it to, so I just started again. So I was always saying, Andrea, she spoke a little bit about the paramese, this list of beautiful, beautiful qualities that we developed through practice and that are a great support to our hearts and minds in their journey towards freedom. And she suggested we can reflect on their presence or their absence in us, you know, during our meditation as a reflective practice. So I just, as I said, I really love this list of the paramese, and I think any of us, I know I would, would be really happy to be acquainted with someone who expressed all of these qualities wherever they showed up in my life. The qualities, they aren't exclusive to Buddhism, you know, they're the kinds of things that human beings have, in every culture, I think, have admired and aspired to for thousands of years. The list begins with generosity and it ends with equanimity. And the order in the way it's presented in the text is generosity first, then sila, ethical conduct, renunciation or letting go, wisdom, energy, patience, truthfulness, determination, love, ameta, and equanimity. So it's a lovely list and it can be thought of, and it can be thought of and approached as a progression, you know, from beginning to end. And there are descriptions of how the full development of one of the paramese is a conditioning factor for the arising of the next one. So that when there's fully developed generosity, that naturally gives rise to ethical conduct. And then that when it's fully developed leads naturally to the development of renunciation and so on through the list. But it's also possible to look at any one of them individually, whichever feels the most kind of useful to cultivate at any particular time and to investigate it, to reflect upon it, see how helpful it is in giving rise to the others, you know, how is it a conditioning factor for the others and how would it help in your own development of wisdom and compassion. So I think each one of them can be seen as a support to all the others. It's kind of they work in concert and it kind of reminds me of, it's like a web with many intersecting threads or like a Venn diagram, you know, where all the intersecting circles where they meet and each one of these qualities intersects with all the others, you know, they're all interrelated. So this morning, the one that I want to talk about is resolve or determination, which is the eighth of the ten, if you're going into progression. And the poly word for this quality is aditana, aditana. And my sense is, at least for me, that it needs to be present in order to cultivate generosity, ethical conduct, renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience, all the others. It needs to be this quality. You know, we often talk in this tradition, we often talk about working the edge of our practice, by which we usually mean, you know, that place where we kind of run into our strongest challenges, where we might not feel quite ready to go. And the edge of our practice, it's often it's kind of the juiciest place to practice, but it's also a place where we might tend to hold back, where we fall into habitual ways of dealing with life, because it seems kind of challenging to meet the edge. But each time we do meet and are willing to work with some unskillful habit or some, you know, habit of mind, that is or attitude of mind, we're moving in the direction of becoming free, becoming free of greed, hatred and delusion. And as we practice, I think as we mature in practice, we encounter a lot of places in ourselves where change will be beneficial, maybe where we've kind of cast our eyes in a different direction, sort of ignored, avoided looking. And those areas can be the edges of our practice, places we haven't really looked. And our practice can be reflective in that way. We can notice the areas where we could be more skillful. We can reflect on what would be most useful to bring into that area in order to bring about change, most conducive to developing qualities that lead more in the direction of freedom and away from the direction of creating dukkha for ourselves, letting go of the habits that get us stuck. And, you know, there are so many different areas of life where we might get stuck. You know, for some of us, it might be related to worldly gain or success. You know, we might know intellectually that having the best things or the best job or the most perfect partner, that none of those things really lead to reliable happiness. But still something in us moves us in that direction. We still keep moving in that way. And for some, maybe it's a tendency, kind of a mental habitual tendency to become angry or impatient. And again, maybe we recognize, oh, this isn't helpful, this isn't useful. But we haven't investigated, you know, what gives rise to those reactive attitudes or consciously cultivated antidotes like meta or patience, some of the other paramees. Sometimes it's working with self centeredness, you know, trying to move beyond that tendency to put our self concern at the kind of center of our priorities for what's important to do in life. And for some of us, there are things like addictions, you know, to addictions to substances, addictions to electronic devices, to distracting activities like Netflix shows or, or chunky books. Maybe something related to formal sitting practice, you know, knowing that it would be beneficial to be able to sit longer, or to not move immediately when there's a least bit of discomfort to maintain continuity of awareness continuity of mindfulness. And we recognize it would be useful to focus more on mindfulness than on just becoming calm and happy at ease to develop more concentration perhaps so there are so many different ways that that we might feel where we have an edge that we haven't tried to meet. A lot of tendencies or attitudes that become apparent to us as we as we become more mindful. And everybody is different, of course. You might ask yourself, you know, where's the edge in my practice, what quality of mind or heart. Would it take in me to meet that edge. What do I need in order to meet that edge. And sometimes I'm someplace I'm ignoring where, what would be beneficial to actually do some work. And the response to, to seeing our edge to coming up close to it is to back away from it and to work with what's easier to what's less challenging. In order to kind of push it away a little bit further. And what we need in that case is this quality of adhicana, of resolve, we need gumption as an American word I don't know if it's used in other areas of where English speakers are gumption it's not some specifically Buddhist quality it's something I think probably many of us were encouraged to develop by our parents or, or teachers when we were young, you know, something we needed to get through that tough math class and algebra class or to, to start a healthier diet or to begin, you know, an exercise regime, all the things that take a little bit of extra effort, we need that quality of determination of resolve, any challenge requires determination in order to meet in order to begin, begin to work with. And sometimes what we need to work with the edge maybe of our practice is not so easy to identify. There can be a kind of a sense of resignation sometimes in practice. Oh, this is as good as it's going to get for me, you know, I'm just not really cut off to be cut out to be free. Or sometimes when practice and life is going, you know, well, going nicely according to plan. Sometimes a sense of complacency can arise and in us, and we just sort of skate along every day, you know, feeling the same way having a nice sit, getting quiet and calm going about our business. Sometimes that can happen for years. And it's I think it's really useful and it takes some odd it on a little bit of determination to pay attention and recognize when contentment which is a, you know, really nice quality to have beneficial quality morphs into the sense of complacency. I think there's a kind of laziness inherent in complacency which you can tune into you can feel that and when that's present. Oh, it's probably not so healthy it's not contentment here it's complacency and maybe I need to do something else maybe I need to work a little harder. Aditana that quality of resolve or determination it's pretty much the opposite of laziness I think. So it's clear that this quality is something that we're, we're already familiar with in in daily life. And probably, we probably agree that it's useful in that context. But, you know, in the context of our spiritual path as a paramy of perfection. And we can look at determination in terms of the ways that cultivating and developing it moves us in the direction of freedom, rather than, you know how it helps us achieve our kind of worldly goals, become a better person, better athlete better partner. It's what helps us to stick with what's difficult, because our intention is for liberation. It's sometimes spoken of as the bridge between intention and action. I think that's a useful way of looking at it as a bridge between intention and action. And that's a strong aspiration for something in our life you know to give up a bad habit perhaps or maybe to awaken fully. That's a possible aspiration, which I encourage you know all of us resolve this really necessary in order to achieve it. And conversely, when we have a strong aspiration that it supports the development of determination so we need determination behind our aspiration and when we have a strong aspiration, it kind of gives rise to determination as well. It makes us want to really go for it, you know, to have this quality of gumption as I called it before. Determination, resolve, perseverance is another translation that we use for this word Aditana. Strong aspiration really fuels it gives gives it energy. And when it's fully developed. It has a, it has a kind of a quality of confidence that comes with it, you know, a kind of stability of heart, a confidence that becomes more effortless because our intention is so strong. You could, I think you could say that intention is a sort of a proximate cause for the arising of determination. It is that bridge between intention and action. And it's strong development at least to a kind of a moral strength goes along with that sense of confidence a sense of purpose, the confidence to then act, you know, services that bridge gives a kind of oomph to our actions. Dedication, commitment, persistence, perseverance. Those are all different ways of translating this word, whichever one kind of you know fits a particular situation or what you know resonates with with your own heart more is one to use I know some people don't like the idea of determination. I don't know why, well maybe I'll talk about that a little bit you know there is a sometimes we say, practice like your hair's on fire, you know, there's some urgency definite urgency to practice because it's important. It's important. And the intention behind that advice you know is to increase our dedication to effort but for some that can lead to a level of effort that's not so skillful you know that feels stressful. That feels tight to a sense of straining, pushing, pulling too hard like a dog that's just yanking you along on its lead when you're going for a walk. So that's another area where it's it's useful to use your discrimination to to develop discernment about the difference between resolve determination and straining striving in in this Western culture you know I think it's it's really useful to be on the lookout for, for how that can happen how when we have determination it can move into a sense of kind of this, a sense of urgency, which is, is associated with straining I think that that has the quality you know it is, it is Dukka, it has that constricting constraining feeling. There's a strong sense of me, I think that appears an identification with the effort that we're making that's constricted and tight. Whenever there's a me, you know, whenever there's a lot of selfing at the center of our effort. There is a sense of constriction I think wholesome perseverance wholesome determination doesn't have that tight quality has energy it has effort, but it's not constrained. It's not constricted. And this unwholesome striving I think there's, you know, there's maybe more emphasis on the outcome of the effort, then there is on just keeping going you know just just keeping going just walking the path, doing what's needed in the moment. And I think in meditation practice that can show up sometimes as a, you know, kind of an intensity I think I, you know, maybe this is unfair but I kind of associate this with young people especially young men, really going for it in such a way that there's a sense focus on the breath or other object in, you know, in meditation and the pasta meditation, trying hard to stay mindful just like, Oh, I'm really going to be mindful, or to get concentrated, and what can end up happening is that you get a headache actually with that kind of practice. In life maybe there's an example of the way you know some people drive like people who are just really, really want to get ahead of everybody else and they're zooming in and out of, of traffic you know moving from one lane to another and passing, passing and always trying to get in front of the person, and ahead of them. And sometimes when I'm aware of that happening around me I'll be driving along just trying to do my best to stay out of trouble and get where I'm going. And what happens often is that the next time there's a stoplight I'll see that person is just beside me or behind me didn't really didn't really achieve anything by all the straining and stress. Sometimes the person might be stopped by the side of the road by a police car. I think the fable of the hair and the tortoise it's kind of speaks to the difference between wholesome determination and unskillful straining, it's kind of a model of that. I used to do a lot of backpacking. When I was younger, lots of backpacking in the Sierra Nevada mountains here in California. If I just kept looking up at that ridge you know a couple miles away and thinking how I needed to get there I needed to get there I'd start to feel stressed and really definitely a lot more tired than if I just took it one step at a time, step by step, just staying right where I was, but moving along. And the way of thinking about this quality of Aditana that I really resonate with really strongly is, excuse me, in terms of vows. Vows. I know that word sometimes it doesn't work for people, but it really it really resonates with me a couple of weeks ago. I gave a talk. I think it was one of the Sunday morning talks where he talked about vows and about how usually when we begin with, with mindfulness practice. When we first get involved in mindfulness practice it's because we're interested, you know, we're interested, and then at some point as we discover what the practice can do how you know how it affects our minds and hearts and we make a conscious decision to make it part of our life, you know, and for some of us we put it right at the center of our lives. And so that interest, it strengthens into this quality of resolve resolve becomes a kind of natural outcome of having really strong interest and seeing the effects of the practice on our lives. And for some of us, this takes the form then of formal vows. And he's in this talk he spoke about his own decision to dedicate his life to the end of suffering for all beings, you know, and expression of the bodhisattva vows from the Mahayana tradition. I share that determination. Every time I sit for formal practice I make a silent vow. I say from now until full awakening, I take refuge in the Buddha in the Dharma in the Sangha. May my generosity and other virtues in my practice, may my entire life lead to full awakening for the benefit of all beings. Every time and it gives me that gumption, it gives me that oomph that's needed to keep walking the path. There's something about a vow that can inspire dedication, it can inspire this persistence, I think, in practice. It's a kind of a verbal way of aligning intention with our deepest aspiration. And for me, it creates a kind of a sense of accountability as well. I'm actually saying these words. I'm saying them in a way that I'm going to pay attention to them in the future. Ajahn Tinnisserou, Tinnisserou Biku, Ajahn Jeff, as we call him, an American monk who has a little monastery in an avocado orchard in San Diego County here in California. He speaks of this word of vow in terms of more kind of narrowly focused vows, which can also be, I think, useful in practice. He thinks of speaking of the word adhitana as vows in a more narrow way. He talks about vow sittings, you know, like maybe vowing to meditate for a particular amount of time. That's a stretch for you that's longer than you normally sit or to not move during a sit. Or vows about refraining from certain behaviors, you know, maybe eating animal foods or gossiping or using alcohol or drugs. A vow can give power to our intention. It's like a promise. And I think it implies a deep connection, a heart connection to the intention that we're vowing to keep. It's, it's again, it becomes that bridge between intention and action. In the Majjhament Nikaya, and number 140, there's a it's a lovely suta where the Buddha spends the night in a pottery shed and gives instruction to a traveling monk who happens to be there and the Buddha kind of disguises himself. So he's, he's not really known and the other monk is is hoping to meet the Buddha. That's why he's traveling. He doesn't recognize him. And the Buddha, he gives instruction all night long to this, this other monk. And after he's expanded the Dharma all night, the monk does recognize, oh, this must be the Buddha himself and he goes for refuge at that time. But during, during the night part of the text, the Buddha speaks of four resolves that are part of the path to awakening, and he calls them adhitana. To resolve upon wisdom. The wisdom of knowing impermanence, dukkha, not self. To know them really clearly. To resolve upon truth, speaking truthfully about wisdom. To resolve upon generosity, relinquishment, which naturally comes apart about as a part of wisdom once we know, you know that holding on to things is not the path to happiness then this relinquishment, man becomes a becomes natural, what we resolve upon it. The fourth resolve is to resolve upon peace. And peace is the result of the others, seen as the result of the others in this, in this suta. When there is wisdom and truth and relinquishment in full, fully developed, then there's peace. And to develop this fullness, this quality of determination, perseverance, commitment, adhitana, it's necessary. So those are some beautiful, onward leading qualities that that we can resolve or vow to develop, or to perfect, to make paramees, because they are all paramees. So I really I encourage you to, to create vows for yourself, or resolves if vow is a, you know, it was a word you don't really resonate with that, you know, that can really can serve as that bridge between intention and action. And that's what I have for this morning and I know I welcome any kind of comments or questions or any vows you might have that you'd like to share with the rest of us. You can, I just invite you to unmute yourself if you'd like and raise your hand if you want you don't have to raise your zoom hand you there. We're a small enough group that I can see everyone. Any comment you have. I have to ask you a question that you don't have to answer verbally but how about the idea of, of making, making a vow. What, what would you, what would be useful in the way of a resolve in your practice in your life right now, what would, what would serve you best serve your, your movement towards freedom towards awakening best. Right now, this time in your life. I think it's something worth thinking about. You sure. Here's a translation of the, of the bodhisattva vows that comes from San Francisco Zen centers the way they translate the vows there. Beings are numberless, I vow to freedom. Delusions are inexhaustible, I vow to end them. Dharma gates are boundless. I vow to enter them. The Buddha's way is unsurpassable. I vow to become it. So those are, those are vows that no one could ever accomplish. And that's I think that for me, when I read those there, that's part of their power, actually it's like, okay, I know this I can never do this, but it, it makes that bridge between intention and action, kind of have a lot more strength, you know, to, to commit oneself to something that's that's really out of range for the human experience. Yeah, Diane. You're muted. I'm laid up with a really twisted ankle so I'll keep myself off the screen. Can you hear me now. Yes, I can. There was a time when I was taking a class on the paramees. And for whatever reason I just became so enamored with the word paramees I imagine them as 10 cute little things jumping around like back then. I don't know what I don't know where that came from. So, it, it became a bit overwhelming in the study so I decided to adopt one like I was adopting this cute little thing and practicing with it so I adopted generosity, and just stayed with that, and that has stayed with me in the sense of the awareness of it, and seeing it and seeking to see it in myself and others. And when the instances are there. So this. So, listening to you. I started I loved what you're talking about. We all have some sort of perseverance sometimes I think I have none, but that's not true. I remember in school, taking one class over and over because I do geometry or something I couldn't get it, I finally got it. And so that I could. I needed that grade, or those kinds of things I've taught my, I've learned all kinds of new things I learned and study the Dharma, I mean, just this putting myself down. And so, it is true I have determination, and I'm thinking, I'm going to adopt it another pair of me and that will be that I will. And I will, I think I can resolve I love your bow. But there's something I can resolve to, and that what I want to do on in my practice is to do more sitting on my own. I love to listen to people and and listen to you and the others and so forth. But to sit more on my own. I've never had that discipline. And it's, I call it discipline. I've always gone to groups I'm really appreciate. Appreciating groups more and more the song and learning more but I don't do enough on my own which I can easily do. And I know it's a different experience. So that's something that I can, I can have a vow for. And I can adopt that determine adopted determination on that so. Yeah, that is a great determination for sure. Thank you. Thank you and also it. I think if you look at your, you know your, your practice with generosity and you're, you know, having kind of adopted that as your personal me, I think you might see how it has affected the others as well you know you might just look and see if it's had an effect on their physical conduct and their ability to let go of the rest of attention. Okay, thank you. Thanks. Anybody else. I'm going to start. The question I'd like to raise is the difference between a vow and an aspiration. And I find it quite easy to develop an aspiration to be generous or to be kind, or in my case especially to be patient. But a vow seems just a little bit more difficult than an aspiration. Yeah, I think, you know what I said about the edge of our practice is I think there is a sense in which that and moving from an aspiration to about is kind of meeting an edge there. In a way, it's like, it is, it's a little bit more, it's more of a promise, you know, so there's just a little bit more accountability associated with it then an aspiration can just sort of feel good you know I do this but then if we actually have to do it then there's some, we have a responsibility there and that that can feel a little bit more challenging. So, yeah, I think it is a little more challenging for sure. Thank you. I think it's worth doing. I'll give it a try. Thanks, start. Anybody else. If you're not. I invite you to unmute yourselves and just say hi, and bye to everybody else in the, in the group this morning. It was a pleasure to be with you and I hope you have a life that has lots of determination and all the other parmes as well, you know, starting with general setting with equanimity.
