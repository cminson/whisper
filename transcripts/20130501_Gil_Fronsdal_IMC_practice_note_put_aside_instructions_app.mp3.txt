Instructions

If you have had any meditation instruction 
before, i t is interesting to consider that whatever 
instruction you ’ve had can get  in the way. 
Sometimes , it is nice to put aside your ideas of 
what is supposed to happen in meditation, or 
what you are trying to make happen , or what 
you are supposed to do when you meditate  – so 
that you can better notice what is happening in 
the present  moment , in the simplest, most 
ordinary way possible. And then do it again. And 
again.  
 
This is what is happening now in my body . This 
is what is happening in my ears, my thoughts, 
my mind, my heart. Keep it really simple , so that 
there is no judgment or commentary. It is a 
simple recognition that this is what is happening.  
 
If you can recognize what is happening in this 
simple way, then a second step is to feel it more fully. Let the felt sense of the physical 
experience of whatever you’re experiencing 
register more fully. If you are having a lot of 
thoughts, then what is the felt sense  of your 
mind, body, and head with  the energy of 
thinking? If you have a lot of emotions, how is 
that felt? If you are preoccupied with what is 
happening in the room, such as sounds, what is 
the felt sense, the energy connected to your 
body? What does it feel like? 
 
Cultivate  a simple ackn owledgement of what is 
happening , and then let it register more fully. 
And t hen, in its own time  – no hurry  – see if you 
can soften or relax around what you’ve been 
experiencing and feeling .  
 
Recognize  what's happening;  feel it more fully ; 
then soften or relax. These three steps might be 
helpful once you have forgotten about your 
meditation instructions.  
 
I hope you enjoy your morning. Thank you.
