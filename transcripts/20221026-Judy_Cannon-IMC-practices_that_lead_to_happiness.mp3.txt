 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Good morning. A few notes regarding our practice. I'd like to read an excerpt from a talk by Tanisiro Biku, otherwise known as Tanjef. Tanjef has come here quite often at IMC. He and Gil are friends. He's abbot of a monastery near San Diego. This particular talk has the title, Wisdom for Dummies. Remember that series of books. Quote, You use the Buddhist teachings as tools to help you realize that if there's something you want to do, but you know it's going to cause harm, you need some help in learning how to talk yourself out of it. As for good things that are difficult, as when it's difficult to be generous, difficult to be virtuous, or difficult to meditate, you need ways of helping yourself get over the hump. Tools, strategies, ways of thinking that make it easier so that you can let go of the unskillful things that you like and arrive at true happiness. The Buddha simply taught basic principles for people who want to wise up. The first principle is to realize that your actions are important, that they make a difference, that they come from your ideas and intentions, and that they can be changed for the better. Second, focus on what really is your responsibility and let go of things that are not. Third, train your mind to develop better and better answers to the question that focuses on what you're really responsible for, what you can do that will lead to your long-term welfare and happiness. Then, take advantage of the tools the Buddha offers so that it's easier to give up the things that you like doing that are harmful and to get yourself to do the things that are difficult but will lead to the long-term happiness you want. A few comments on today's schedule. We'll continue our practice.
