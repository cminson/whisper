The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
It's often helpful at the beginning of a
period of meditation to allow the body to relax.
And you might do this by starting out taking a couple of longer breaths, deeper breaths.
And noticing how the body, particularly the muscles around the rib cage stretch
and expand on the in-breath.
How the stomach pushes forward.
And then noticing too how the body
relaxes and releases on the out-breath.
And then letting the breathing return to normal.
You can also be helpful to see if there can be some conscious relaxation
of the muscles of the body.
So seeing if you can allow there to be a relaxation of the muscles of your face
and head.
Of your jaw.
Your neck and shoulders.
Your arms.
And your hands.
Even possibly inside your shoulder socket.
All the tendons and ligaments inside the shoulder socket and along the collar bone
and shoulder blades.
Relaxing.
Softening the muscles around the rib cage.
Allowing a softening if possible in the stomach and abdomen.
Letting the belly hang forward a little bit.
Relaxing the middle and lower back.
The hips.
The pelvis.
And perhaps too inside the hip socket.
Relaxing, softening the muscles of the legs.
Including knees, ankles.
Feet.
And having consciously relaxed the outer part of the body.
Sometimes there can also be a possibility of softening some of the tension that's held inside the body.
You might see if it's possible to relax inside the throat.
Relax the heart.
And the lungs.
Relax the stomach.
The intestines.
All of the organs.
And to whatever extent is possible for you right now, seeing if there can also be a relaxation of any mental tension.
Relaxing the thinking mind.
Sometimes you can find your way to this.
Thinking about or sensing into perhaps the image of the brain being a muscle.
See if you can relax your brain.
And taking in now how you are.
How is the body.
How is this experience having consciously relaxed.
Just noticing what's obvious for you.
No need to look.
Just whatever seems obvious.
There might be some body sensations that are obvious.
Or heat or pulsing tingling vibration.
Pulling or tightness. Pressure. Lightness or hardness. Softness.
There might be obvious sound.
No needing to go and looking for anything.
Just whatever is obvious in this moment.
Settling back and witnessing what's happening.
Moods or emotions may be floating around.
There might be boredom or sleepiness.
Restlessness.
Calm.
Confusion. Irritation.
Whatever is there. Again a witnessing of it.
Confusion is happening. Irritation is happening. Whatever it is.
Witnessing it.
With the stance of allowing.
Rather than controlling or fixing or changing.
From this container of whatever relaxation you can access in this moment.
This witnessing of experience.
Allowing the attention to open to.
To attune to to receive the experience of breathing.
However, wherever the experience of breathing is most clear to you, most obvious to you.
That might be in your nostrils or throat.
It might be the expansion and release of your chest.
Or the rising and falling of your abdomen.
And attuning to the experience of breath.
It can be quite simple.
Again, not trying to dig or to find anything.
It's not obvious.
Just how is the breath impacting, landing, being experienced.
The body is breathing.
And can you notice how that breathing is experienced.
Breathing in, know that you're breathing in.
Breathing out, know that you're breathing out.
The way that we attend to the breathing is more important than that we attend to the breathing.
If there can be a sense of gently connecting with the experience of breathing.
Maybe if the breath were a delicate creature.
Sometimes delicate creatures will slip away if they know they're being watched.
Having the stance of quietness in the receiving the experience of breathing.
So a very light touch of connecting.
The amount of effort to make.
Just enough to be with an in breath.
Be with one in breath.
And then at the end of the out in breath.
Just enough effort to be with one out breath.
Over and over again.
Connecting to a half a breath.
Being with that for just those few seconds.
And then connecting with another half a breath.
The mind will wander off of course.
This is completely normal.
There's no need to judge yourself or be hard on yourself for the fact that the mind does this.
It's actually a pointer to just how little control we actually have over our own minds.
And so in the moment of remembering, in the moment of recognizing that.
You've returned from the mind wandering.
In that moment you are mindful again.
Noticing what you have become aware of in that moment of remembering.
Perhaps thinking or planning remembering.
Judging or fantasizing.
Maybe there's been any tension that's crept in to your mind and body.
It can be really helpful to reconnect with that process of relaxation.
No need to quickly turn back to the experience of breathing.
The relaxed, receptive container of meditation is how the practice of attending to the breathing can most naturally unfold.
And when you feel like the body and mind are relaxed and alert.
Reconnecting with one half breath at a time.
