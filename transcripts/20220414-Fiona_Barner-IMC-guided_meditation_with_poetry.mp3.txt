So I brought two poems today and I'm going to read them and just let silence sort of hold the words. This was mentioned by sharing the word impermanence which is very much in this practice of looking and seeing. This is a poem called Otherwise by Jane Kenyon. I got out of bed on two strong legs. It might have been otherwise. I ate cereal, sweet milk, ripe, flawless peach. It might have been otherwise. I took the dog uphill to the birchwood. All morning I did the work I love. At noon I lay down with my mate. It might have been otherwise. We ate dinner together at a table with silver candlesticks. It might have been otherwise. I slept in a bed in a room with paintings on the walls and planned another day just like this day. But one day I know it will be otherwise. How can we love what's here and just let it be? No holding. Just loving what's here. I slept in a bed in a room with paintings on the walls and planned another day just like this. But one day I know it will be otherwise. The second poem is a portion of a poem that I shared with the senior sangha. It's Mary Oliver. It's a poem she wrote in response to a health crisis diagnosis. But this part of the poem is not about that. This part, the poem is the fourth sign of the zodiac. This is section three. I know you never intended to be in this world, but you're in it all the same. So why not get started immediately? I mean belonging to it. There is so much to admire, to weep over, and to write music or poems about. Bless the feet that take you to and fro. Bless the eyes and the listening ears. Bless the tongue, the marvel of taste. Bless touching. You could live a hundred years. It's happened or not. I am speaking from the fortunate platform of many years, none of which I think I ever wasted. Do you need a prod? Do you need a little darkness to get you going? Let me be urgent as a knife then and remind you of Keats. So single of purpose and thinking for a while, he had a lifetime. So really looking at this beautiful, beautiful life, David's meditation on this body, a miracle of what works or is still working. People mentioned the beautiful trees blooming out there, just amazing beauty that's available. If our eyes turn in that direction and can see. Just to love this and also release and just let it go. There's an inscription on a headstone in a cemetery nearby. Someone very, very dear to me was something he wrote over and over again. It's on his headstone now. The nature of being is awareness. Simply be still, be as you are. That is all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank your presence and your care about your own hearts, your own minds, to nurture, develop a path in this life that sustains ourselves and sustains those we meet, those we love, those we care about and those we do not know. Maybe be strengthened by this community together, by the sincerity of our practice, and by the cultivation of these beautiful, beautiful qualities that can arise and flower in this life. Thank you.
