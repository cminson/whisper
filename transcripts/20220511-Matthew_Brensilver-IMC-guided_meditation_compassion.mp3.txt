 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome, welcome folks. So nice to see all the names. Chat line here. So welcome. You know the drill here. Let's sit together. Thank you. Let there be space in your heart for all the joys and sorrows being human. Thank you. When the heart begins to give permission, something drops in the body, something settles down. No one has a perfect shiny mind or a perfect shiny life. Some loose ends in every human life. We develop the confidence that we can take our seat amidst it all. Thank you. Thank you. We control our experience. The necessity of love becomes more and more apparent. Breathe and relax into the condition of your life this moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're not responsible for solving the predicament of the human condition. You're simply being asked to bless the intensity of the human condition, the intensity of a moment of an urge or a feeling to bless this with wisdom and love. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Every moment is practiceable in one way or another. They include PE Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you in the wake of letting go there is something like a quiet love that remains you you you you you turning now more explicitly to compassion just bringing into your heart mind someone you care about who is suffering when we first fill out the landscape of their pain actually take that into our heart to consider their inner life the life of their body and develop a kind of vivid sense of their suffering this is only one part of our practice but this is the first part and to understand their pain of course we naturally draw on our own pain from memory or from life right now we make vivid the suffering of this person we love we care about you And so in compassion, one dimension is a willingness to......grieve. But we do not stay here. Grief is not the last word. As the vision of their pain is dramatized, made clearer and clearer, our heart makes another move. And we pour all of our love into them. And if we are to be in the mind and body, our care, our wishes, that their suffering be alleviated, then they be at peace. Amen. Amen. And of course there are traces of the grief, but it's mostly displaced by the warmth, love, of compassion, a kind of compassion that doesn't fatigue our own heart, which feels good to dwell in. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And we are not insisting that someone stop suffering where offering our love and our blessings, that it might be so. And just rest our mind abiding in that care, warmth. Amen. Amen. And maybe in these last few minutes we let go, orienting to one person, of orienting self and other. And we practice just dwelling in the openness of compassion, distinctionless compassion. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
