Dharmette: The Three Steps of 
Mindfulness (Part Two)

In the practice of  mindfulness , there are three 
useful steps. The first is to include a substantial 
amount of acknowledgement of what ’s 
happening. Then it’s useful to add into 
mindfulness practice a substantial amount of 
time to feel what ’s happening. And then it ’s 
helpful to spend some time softening with what ’s 
happening. These three aspects of mindfulness 
are to acknowledge, to feel, and to soften.  
 
Mindfulness has a lot to do with acknowledging 
what is happening. For some people it goes 
beyond acknowledging to being very honest 
about what is happening – this is what I’m 
feeling ; this is what I’m  thinking ; this is what’s 
going on for me . For me, the word 
‘acknowledgement ’ carries with it a certain  
respect. No matter what you are acknowledging,  
you are doing so with respect, e ven if what you 
are acknowledging is not good news about yourself.  There is something very mature , 
respectful , and non-conflictive about the 
acknowledgement of : “This is how it is  – this is 
what ’s happening now .”  
 
For some people it is really radical to no longer 
be in conflict mode, desire mode , fix-it mode , or 
running away m ode about what is happening. To 
actually stop , make space , and just simply 
acknowledge can dramatically ch ange the 
ecology of the mind. Ease can come just by 
respectfully focusing  on and acknowledging 
what is there . No matter what we are 
experiencing, it w arrants our attention. It 
deserves to be seen , acknowledged and 
recognized . It is very easy for people to be at 
war with different parts of themselves. 
Sometimes the split between the good side and 
the bad side can be quite dramatic  when the two 
sides are at war . The practice of mindfulness is 
meant to heal the inner conflicts that we carr y 
with us. A big part of this happens  by just 
acknowledging what is there : acknowledg ing the 
war and the different sides . The 
acknowledgement is th at it’s ok. We are not in 
conflict with what is, not trying to fix or judge 
what is, but seeing it for what it is, and seeing it clearly. So acknowledgement is an important 
part of practice.  
 
The second part is the feeling. Once you’ve 
acknowledged someth ing, i n a sense you  want 
to get closer to it, and allow it to move through 
you, and to show itself in a fuller or deeper way. 
The acknowledgement is cognitive in that the 
mind is recognizing what is happening. This can 
be helpful in creating a certain sepa ration from 
the experience so that you’re not lost or caught 
up in it. But feeling it brings you back into it and 
ensures that in observing it, you’re not aloof 
from it. You’re not resisting it, or staying up in 
your head , but y ou are also including the 
physical  and the emotional body. How do you 
feel? How is the body experiencing the 
moment?  
 
We think of feeling as being emotional , but it 
doesn’t have to be emotional. When I was 
meditating in Burma during the monsoon 
season, it might not b e raining  one moment  but 
then suddenly there would be this  loud, dramatic  
downpouring  of rain . I could not believe how 
much rain could come out of the sky. The roofs 
were tin so suddenly there would be this 
crashing. One practice I had was that as soon as it started raining, I would tune into my body 
and see how it was experiencing the weather 
shifts in humidity or atmospheric pressure. I 
knew it was raining  and that I was dry , but what 
did it feel like to be in that rain?  What shifted 
inside me? It wasn’t an emotional feeling but 
rather  sensations.  
 
So, what  are the sensations? What are the 
feelings in your body, in your mind, in your heart  
in response to whatever it is you’re 
acknowledging ? Take time to get to know that 
so that it’s not just cognitive  – not just thinking, 
judging or making stories about it. It’s part of this 
respectful making  space for the experience , and 
time for the experience to be fully there. Do not 
be in a hurry. I think being in a hurry interferes 
with mindfulness almost more than a nything 
else. Take your time to really get to know it : 
“What is this? ” 
 
The same is true  with the breath. When you’re 
with your breathing, you f eel your breathing. Are 
you really present for the feeling of what 
breathing is like in your body? What is the 
impact? What resonates? How is the body 
impacted by the experience of breathing? Come 
back into the body. The body is not a story. The body is a way of helping us be in the present 
moment. It is always in the present moment. So 
acknowledge what is there ; take time 
acknowledging it . Be honest and respectful of 
what is there. Try to simplify how you are and  
just acknowledge without being reactive. An d 
then – when you’re ready – feel it more fully. 
Make space to feel it. One thing about feeling in 
this respectful , open -handed  way is that all 
experiences, feelings , and emotions in the body 
are not things but processes. As we feel more 
fully, the process es can then unfold as they 
need to unfold. If we don’t fully feel, or are not 
present for it, then it is too easy to interrupt what 
needs to unfold. So to feel is to allow something 
to unfold.  
 
The third part is softening. It can also mean 
letting go. Onc e you have acknowledged and 
fully felt something, then it makes sense to let go 
of it. B ut because there is an emphasis in 
Buddhism on letting go, some people let go too 
early, too quickly. You don’t want to be in a hurry 
to let go. It isn’t healthy to let  go so quickly that 
you haven’t really seen , understood,  or felt what 
you are letting go of. You want to give yourself 
time. Even if you can let go of something, make 
sure that , for a while,  you’ve really been with it, seen it, and understood it. Sometimes it’s letting 
go.  
 
But sometimes softening just means softening. 
Softening may mean  that the tension or the 
holding can be relaxed  just a little bit. 
Sometimes the thing that can be softened is not 
what we are acknowle dging , but rather our 
relationship to it. We might be riding it very 
close, or pulling back from it, or afraid of it. 
Perhaps how we hold it in awareness can be 
softened. Some people like the expression to 
make “breathing room” for their experience. 
Make r oom. Softening can mean mak ing room. 
Open up around it. It’s also very respectful to 
make room for something. For example, I am 
angry , and how upset I am is pretty ugly in my 
mind. So I’ll acknowledge that  I’m angry  and it 
doesn’t look good. And I can  feel it – how hot 
and tense it is in there  – and then I see if I can 
make space for the anger, make it ok to be 
angry , or make lots of room for my anger. Or 
maybe I can soften the tension  around the 
anger.  
 
These three steps can be used in a sys tematic 
way – as a way of giving the mind something to 
do to help it get settle d. Sometimes the mind needs to rally around something so that it is not 
so scattered  and jumping around  so much . So 
acknowledge what’s happening right now, and 
don’t settle for a simple acknowledgement. 
Spend more time with it. What’s the feeling of 
what needs to be acknowledged?  Respectful 
acknowledgement means listening to it. And 
then take the time to feel it. Sp end time really 
getting to know it, not being in a hurry. And then 
when the time is right, is there some way of 
softening , softening the mind around it, or how 
you pay attention to it ? Softening how you are 
with it. Softening the thing  itself, and s ettling  in. 
And then once you’ve gone through that 
process, start over. Do it again.  
 
This three -step process  is one of the ways of not  
allow ing the wandering, reactive, and busy mind 
to have the upper hand. Let the practice get the 
upper hand so that the wander ing, busy mind is 
not always be fed and fueled, and can begin to 
settle down . You can use intention to change 
your inner ecology by intending to something  
with your attention : intend to acknowledge ; 
intend to feel ; intend to soften. Really relax in a 
soft way.  
 This morning someone told me a wonderful 
thing  about another meditation teacher . 
Whenever they  gave instructions for meditation 
practice, the y would always say, “Do it the best 
you can.” I love that. I think we should always 
end that way. So if this instruction today makes 
sense, do it  the best you can.
