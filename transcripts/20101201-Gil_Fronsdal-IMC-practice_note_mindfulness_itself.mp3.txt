Practice Note: Mindfulness Itself

It’s one thing to be mindful of things; it’s another thing to 
appreciate mindfulness itself. We have  a tendency to 
focus on the things we’re interested in or the things 
we’re aversive to – the things of the world . So you could 
be mindful of other people ; you could be mindful of 
events ; you could be mindful of your thoughts ; you 
could be mindful of your feelings, your emotions, the 
sensations in your body. There are a lot of things you 
can be mindful of , and  it’s very helpful to be mindful of 
these things . You can learn a lot about yourself . You 
can learn how to be more relaxed about things . But 
there’s also mindfulness itself, awareness itself  – the 
awareness that is used by mindfulness  – as qualities 
that are quite interesting.  
 
There  are two dimensions of mindfulness: what you pay 
attention to, and the attention itself . And occasionally in 
life, the attention itself stands out . It can become  
highlight ed as something very precious and valuable. 
Sometimes it’s what gives our life depth . The things we 
can pay attention to are interesting enough . But there’s 
a poignancy to being really aware that you ’re attentive: 
to know that you know .   
To be aware of the awareness that knows things lends 
itself to a more timeless dimension. W hen w e’re 
focus ing on things  – what  we want and don’t want and 
what’s happening  – we belong to the world of time. 
There’s an interesting difference between the world of 
time and a world that is  timeless . Time seems to stop in 
a certain way . It doesn’t stop, of course, bu t it’s as if 
there’s no time. Some people have that experience 
when something dramatic happens . For example,  you 
have  a near -accident in the car, and afterwards, 
everything seems very deep, or rich, and time seems to 
stop. The future doesn’t seem to matter  anymore . 
You’re so much here , and aware that you’re breathing 
and aware.  
 
Or a stunningly beautiful situation in nature can not only 
take your breath away in terms of the beauty of the 
place, but the awareness that knows this seems to fill 
the space . The awareness that is aware of that 
becomes more poignant, more alive . It lends itself to a 
sense of being alive , and here , and very full, in a 
dynamic way.  
 
For some people, meeting death – maybe their own 
death – makes awareness stand out and become 
highlig hted. It’s so amazing that you could be conscious 
and aware . Often , time seems to disappear for people 
who are dying , when they are  dying slowly and without too much fear.  
 
There is t his quality of mindfulness – the attention itself, 
the awareness itself,  which is used to be mindful . You 
have to use your mindfulness, but you can also notice 
the quality of mindfulness itself . There’s a way in which 
that can add depth , fullness , and poignancy to your life: 
here and now.   
 
As you practice today – walking  and sitting – you might 
see if there’s some way that you can tap into something 
poignant about just the mindfulness itself, the 
awareness itself , as much as paying attention to the 
particular objects: your breath, your feet, or the sounds 
that are happening. There’s something about the 
timeless, spacious expansiveness or depth of 
awareness  that can take it all in and hold it all.  
 
And, of course, if none of this makes any sense to you, 
then you can just forget it [laughs] and continue as you 
were.
