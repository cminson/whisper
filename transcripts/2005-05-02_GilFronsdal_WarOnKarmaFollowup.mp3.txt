 Good evening. How many of you were here last week? So a good number. And I thought that after last week's talk by Tanisravikkhu, by the monk, he talked about karma. It might be useful to have some follow-up discussion about that topic. And I was encouraged to do that. And we could have open discussion about what he said. But I thought it might be more useful for me, especially since some of you weren't here, to try to summarize just a little bit what he said and what was controversial about it. And then I could offer you some of my views. I was encouraged by several people to do that. I don't know how wise that is, but it might be interesting. And before I start, I was asked and I would like to mention Douglas Woods. He's an Australian who was kidnapped in Iraq, I think yesterday, in the news today. And he's a good friend of Stephanie and Steve Briskam, who are very good, very long-time members of our community here. And in fact, he's the godfather of their son. And Stephanie transcribes the talks that I give here sometimes. And I think that's what she meant, but she said that she's been sending... This guy Douglas Woods, both his wife and his daughter, are Buddhist practitioners. And Stephanie's been sending talks from IMC to them. And they asked if IMC would keep Douglas Woods in mind these days. And so, if those of you who do meta practice or other ways, you might want to keep him in your thoughts and in your good wishes and wish him well. And I'm struck in saying this, the degrees of separation is a term. How close everybody is in this world. And it's not so far away from two, three people away from some of the big things happening in the world. And often in communities like this, meditation centers, it's often a place that people come who are trying to deal with some of their... Some huge degree of suffering, trauma, difficulties. And in a sense, perhaps the people who come, maybe here today, I don't know about today, but the people who come to meditation center don't exactly represent the cross section of society. But probably in some ways they do, but in some ways you tend to get a greater degree of suffering in a place like this, in people's lives, in people's backgrounds. And because it's people who somehow are trying to deal with suffering, sometimes the kind of great suffering, who find these kinds of teachings and practices most helpful for them, most useful for them, and have the most motivation to really try to come to terms with what they're struggling with. And I'm not so much surprised anymore, because I see it so often, but people come and talk to me on meditation retreats or here. It often seems like world events are not so far away. You can read about them in paper far away, and they're not so far away. And it has happened recently, but in the early 90s when I started teaching, then it seemed like there was a lot of people coming on retreat, a lot, but it would happen often enough that there were people who were still living with the legacy of World War II, people who were children at that time, for example, or in other situations. And 50 years, 60 years after World War II, there are still people for whom it's a huge deal, and they're still relating to it, and has it impacted their life ever since? Or it's their children who still feel the impact. One of the last retreats I sat, there was a person whose father was caught after the Rodney King riots. So that was something that was in LA and different places in the country, and I read about it and was concerned about it and had various feelings about it. But then on retreat, there came a person whose father was caught in the Rodney King riots, and he was severely injured and beat up and had a coma and is now alive with severe brain damage. And then suddenly that comes to close by. There was someone who came this last year to retreat, who was a 9-11 survivor and was trying to deal with that. And everything comes to retreats here. So today, what came our way was Douglas Wood, not so far away from our situation right here. And I imagine that the war in Iraq, whether you think it should be happening or not happening, either way, there will be people who will be influenced for the next 60 years, if not 100 years, in the way that people were influenced by World War II. And it will have a major impact and major degree of trauma and suffering for people from many, many generations. And I say that, I partly want to say that because of the topic I want to talk about today, and talking about Tanisiribeku's discussion on karma, is that people come to Buddhist practice, some people come because the stakes are pretty high. It's very meaningful. And the potential of practice is quite powerful, it's quite deep in helping people get to the very roots of human suffering. And the corollary of that, of course, is the possibility of peace and happiness, the possibility of liberation. And so it certainly, anyway, so that was kind of a little bit of a background to kind of set maybe a little bit of context of talking about karma. So we don't talk about it too philosophically, too abstractly, as if it's some kind of philosophical topic that's, we can just move ideas around, and it just seems very interesting and whatever. So what Tanisiribeku said last week, the main trust of his talk, and was the title of his talk, was the war on karma. And he had this idea, he's noticed, that a number of Western Buddhist writers and teachers, Buddhist teachers, have a critical view about what he understands the Buddhist view of karma is. And he went through some of the different arguments, some of the different critiques that people have had about the teachings of karma. And I don't remember all of them here, but he actually gave me notes exactly what he said so I'd know what to say today. Since he gave the talk last week, he's been staying with me. So we've had lots of discussions about this topic and kind of debating it back and forth and not exactly seeing eye to eye. It's been very fascinating to have the discussion with him. And what made me nice to have discussions could have happened publicly, he would have seen some interesting things. At least maybe I would have had some allies. And so he's a friend of mine and so it was a very interesting way of having conversations. So I don't remember all of it, so I didn't bring those notes, the cheap notes he gave me for this talk. But for example, one critique of the Buddhist idea of karma is that it just comes from some kind of quaint or particular worldview or teachings from ancient India that somehow the Buddha picked up or the Buddhist picked it up after the Buddha. It's not really essential to Buddhism, it's something that belongs to India and we could easily leave it behind, take out the essence of Buddhism. Some of the critique I think was that it's not logical, it doesn't make sense. For example, with the teaching of not-self, some people say, well, it doesn't make any sense. If there's no self, then what is it that gets reborn is one of the questions someone asked. And so it doesn't make sense, so the whole thing doesn't make any sense. And what are some of the other arguments? Anybody remember who was there last week? Some of the critiques of karma that he critiqued? Yes? Yes, there's no real empirical evidence for it, for some people. Anybody else remember any others? I had the fatalistic excuse for maintaining the status quo. Right, fatalistic excuse for maintaining the status quo. That part of the idea, you see it's very clearly sometimes in the caste system in India where people are born into a certain caste, and they're stuck in that caste and there can't be any social mobility. And part of the rationale for that is that, oh, it's their karma, they were born there and they have to play out their karma. So it's my karma to be the landlord and your karma to be the surfer of my plantation. And that's just the way the universe was built, and you just have to deal with your karma and in another lifetime you'll do better. Yes, please? I think he also said that from his point of view, actions were real, and that some people felt that actions were not real. So there's critique of action. That action is real in terms of this real consequence. It sets up momentum in life. That what you do now has results. And some people in ancient India, I don't think it was said here, but in ancient India, believe that action has no results. There's no karmic results. If you do something now, certainly if I knock over the glass, the rug will get sore. The rug will get wet. But there's no karmic results. If I knock it over in anger, then it isn't that anger will come back in terms of some kind of fruit in the future, in terms of some kind of retribution, karmic retribution. So he critiqued various teachers, people in the West, about the teachings of karma. He didn't bring it up. I don't think he brought it up. In the Room was a tricycle interview from maybe 10 years ago or something, some good years ago. It was a Buddhist magazine called Tricycle. There was a debate between Stephen Batchelor and Robert Thurman. And Stephen Batchelor's that point presented himself as an agnostic around the teachings of rebirth. And Robert Thurman insisted that you cannot be a Buddhist without believing in rebirth. The unfortunate thing was that, at least for the people who believe in the traditional idea of rebirth, the unfortunate thing about that article was that Bob Thurman did a really bad job presenting his point of view. So it wasn't really a good debate in that sense. Probably he could have done a better job. But there was an ambiguity or confusion in the talk that Jeff gave last week, in my mind, as I listened to it. And the confusion had to do with two sides or two aspects, or two different aspects of the teachings on karma. The first aspect was that which makes a lot of sense. And I think most people, very few people would disagree with this part of teaching of karma. And that has to do, that karma has to do with the idea that your actions, especially your intentional actions that you perform, are consequential. That what you do sets certain things in motion that has results. So for example, he likes to give something like learning a craft or learning a musical instrument. If you want to learn a musical instrument, you have to believe that your effort is going to make a difference, that your actions make a difference. If you had no faith or confidence that practicing the scales over and over again was going to make a difference in learning to play the musical instrument, then you wouldn't do it. But you have some faith that you keep practicing practicing, that that has results into the future. And any skill that you want to develop, inherent in wanting to develop that skill, it needs to be some confidence that practicing the skill, cultivating and taking the action, will bear fruit as you develop that skill and strengthen it. And in some situations, our confidence is an invisible thing. We just feel we have enough confidence, we just do it. And in some things that we do, confidence is a big deal. We don't have enough confidence, I can't really do that. And then we do something. I had to write something recently for a friend. It was going to be a foreword for a little book. And I thought, I don't have to write a foreword to a book. And I have nothing to say. And I don't have to go back over my memory of this person and what he wrote and read it and have to make some sense out of it. And I can't do that, it's too hard. And I had no confidence. In a sense. And those kinds of thoughts were going through my mind. And so then I sat down and started writing. I just write and write. And the first sentence was silly and I moved it to the bottom of the page and started writing something else. And pretty soon, I just kept writing and writing and writing. Pretty soon, this piece was written and did come out of me. And so the confidence was not there. And if I'd listened, my lack of confidence, I was lack of confidence initially, partly. And if I'd listened to it too strongly, I wouldn't even have sat down. And by sitting down and just practicing and doing, something was born. So this plays itself out with doing Buddhist practice. Buddhist practice traditionally is a practice of cultivation, both cultivation and letting go. You're developing skills of developing the mind, developing a variety of things, including developing the meditative mind, the mind that can be concentrated, the mind that can be mindful, the mind that can have insight. And you're also learning skills in letting go, learning to recognize what is useful to let go of. And a lot of, for example, meditation practice involves letting go of things which get in the way of concentration and mindfulness. And people can develop skills with that. Some of those skills come from familiarity. You understand the world of the mind. You get really familiar with your mind and you understand how it works. You understand the tricks of it. You understand the nature of it. You understand the value of letting the mind engage in certain things, not other things. You understand that, you know, if I start sitting here in meditation and start planning the great American pizza cookbook. I mean, maybe America needs a pizza cookbook, but it's probably not of great value while you're sitting at meditate. And so you see that, you know, you've written Mexican cookbooks and Chinese cookbooks and, you know, in your mind, and you realize after a while, you know, this is really a waste of time. And so I'll let go of that. Next time I sit down, I think I'm not going to do a cookbook. Now, some people, it takes, you know, a few years of, you know, meditation to realize that certain kind of train of thought is not useful. Let's stop that. Some people are much quicker on the uptake. And they learn, okay, I can let go of this. I don't have to think about that. And, and there's more important things to do in meditation than, you know, follow the train of the preoccupations of my mind. So, so the skills and learning to let go of probably probably comes from familiarity, partly it comes from working, doing the practice and getting some confidence. So this makes a difference and really seeing the results. Oh, really, if I do this, then something happens, my mind gets stronger. There's beneficial results. Sometimes you see it immediately. And sometimes you see it down the line, maybe, you know, in a year or 10 years, or maybe in a crisis. Perhaps you didn't realize that in doing practice here, doing meditation practice, you were cultivating seeds of patience. Every time there was an itch that arose, or something more dramatic, and you didn't react on it, you're developing a capacity to be non reactive, being patient in situation of enduring it. And you come to some huge crisis in your life. And you have the ability to kind of step back and watch that and not react. And you see, wow, I really planted some good seeds. And those seeds now are really sprouting for me in this crisis. So it said that it's very important to have confidence for Buddhist practitioners, it's very important to have confidence that their actions make a difference. And that in having that confidence, then becoming wise and choosing what actions you we undertake, that if you go out and lie and steal, that that has, you know, those actions have consequence. And they produce very different results than if you practice generosity or practice being honest. And so there has to do so. So the more confidence we can have their actions make a difference, the more we're careful with our actions. And this is a fundamental Buddhist kind of teaching. It's one of puts a tremendous emphasis on personal responsibility for our spiritual development, our spiritual well being. And no one else is going to do the practice for us, just as just as no one else is going to pee for us. So no one else is going to learn to meditate for us, right? Same kind of thing. So that part of what I characterize well enough that part of this talk. Okay, so that part of it includes not so controversial, you can't you can't have it's possible to have spiritual critique of that kind of teaching also. Some some teachers of non dual traditions, Advaita Vedanta, for example, and some teachings of Zen, sometimes we'll have some problems with even that kind of teaching on action. But it's pretty straightforward. And Tanjith said that that kind of learning to differentiate your actions between what is helpful and not helpful, skillful and not skillful, which is so essential to the Buddhist tradition, is really very fundamental in human mind how it works. And he said, what would you rather have a surgeon who sees no dualities, or surgeon is going to operate on your brain, or a surgeon who can differentiate between what is helpful and not helpful, and not a dualistic surgeon or non dualistic surgeon. So he said, I'm not sure, you know, it's kind of makes for a good point. But there's probably more to it than he admits. Now that more con so that's all seems very clear. Now, I was listening to him last week, at some point, without it didn't seem to me like it was a clear transition, say, Okay, there's this, and then there's this, but it's like, kind of it kind of morphed into kind of like, and this rebirth. That you have some of you had that experience? Where did that come from? Suddenly, it always made sense. And then now suddenly, he's talking about rebirth, and as if it's logical, logic kind of naturally follows from what he was talking about first. So, so I think there's two different things he's talking about, or it can be kept to things that can be differentiated. One is a very simple, straightforward, almost empirical idea of action and its results. And the other is the teaching of rebirth. Often in Buddhism, those are not separate clearly and cleanly. And so maybe it's not essential or necessary or important, or maybe you shouldn't separate them. But in my mind, I separated them listening to him. And that was useful because when he started mentioning some of the criticisms of karma, what it sounded like to me was he was that the people who are criticizing karma were criticizing the first part of karma, the part about action having results. And I think he was confusing us or confusing himself. And most of the people I've heard who somehow or other have some critique or some problem with the Buddhist idea of maybe karma, is it's not with the theory of action, but rather it's with the idea of rebirth. And it's the idea of rebirth that people will say, oh, that is that is, you know, then he went through some of those arguments. And some people say, well, that's just an ancient Indian idea. And, you know, that somehow was part of the Buddhist environment at the time and the Buddha adopted it. And, you know, why wouldn't he just be part of his culture, so that his cultural context, you know, you kind of take on the beliefs of your time and place, or as many other kind of critiques of it. And that's what I thought some of you started having some hesitation in going along with what he was saying. And then the questions answer period, he that came up very clearly about the rebirth thing. And he did a really poor job answering those questions. And which he acknowledged privately afterwards. And so that kind of added to the difficulty for us, you know, because he was really tired, and it was hard for him. But one of the questions was, oh, he offered a kind of a kind of a version of Pascal's wager, I thought. And that Pascal's wager is, if there is a god, and you act as if there's a god, it's for your benefit. If there is no god, and you act as if there's a god, you're playing it safe. In case there is one. Right? Someone once said, something like, you know, God would never forgive someone for playing the odds. So that's more or less Pascal's wager. Some of you know it, right? So the Buddhist one, Buddha gives kind of a similar one in the suttas, where Buddha says, if there is rebirth, and you live accordingly, living a good life, a life of practice, that's for your benefit in future lives. If there is no rebirth, but you live as if there is, that's also for your benefit in this life. And so you don't really go wrong. So you might as well so Tanjath interprets that, I think, Tanisraviku, as you might as well adopt the idea of rebirth, even if you don't believe it, adopt it as a working hypothesis, because it's for your benefit. And someone asked like, how is it for my benefit? How do I do that? And that's where he gave the worst answer of all at the evening, just like it didn't make any sense. That's my sense, what he said. And I tried to ask him during the week about that. And the best that I could get from him was that, and he's hard to try to say here also some of this, is that if a person's on their deathbed, what is going to keep them practicing as diligently as they can to the last minute, the last moment, rather than taking morphine and kind of numbing out and avoiding a pain and kind of dying an unconscious life, unconscious death. And in his point of view, it's the teaching of rebirth, which gives the idea of rebirth, that you're going to come back, which would be sufficient motivation for a person to hang in there and practice as long as possible in order to potentially, possibly attain nirvana or go as far and practice as you can. And if you don't believe in rebirth, there's not the sufficient motivation in times of that kind of difficulty or that kind of pain to practice all the way. That's the best argument that I heard from him. I mean, his best attempt to try to argue why it's important to believe it, to act as if it's true, even if you don't believe it. But then, if you don't believe it in rebirth, if you don't think it's true, why adopt that one? There's a lot of different teachings of rebirth. I told him, you know, the Christian idea makes just as much sense as the Buddhist one. No, no, it doesn't make any sense, because this idea of eternal damnation doesn't make any sense. You don't get a second chance. That doesn't make any sense. And it turned out in the conversation that he has some idea that the universe needs to make sense. And his way of making sense, partly, is there has to be some kind of system of justice. And so the Christian idea has no real justice, because there's no possibility of retribution or rehabilitation or something. That's the kind of nice idea. It's always good to have rehabilitation. Now, Tanisirabhikkhu, when he's offering all this, is offering it for him in a very traditional Theravadan worldview. He spent 30 years ago he was ordained in Thailand. He was been in Thailand since he was quite a young man. And I think he's really, I don't know how to say, entered into, or either that, or he already had a worldview, and it happened to be a Theravadan worldview, really fit his. And so there's a whole worldview that he fits into. And so in the background of what he was presenting to you last week was a big, very large worldview, which is very different from the worldview here in the West. And as you begin asking questions or pursuing what he's saying, the worldview begins to become larger and larger. There are more and more aspects to it. And in a sense, there's more and more things, and you're starting to be asked to believe in kind of unfaith. If you really want to enter that worldview, if someone's presenting themselves, this is important, this is important, then pretty soon there's a huge worldview that's kind of behind that. And so what do we do? People in the West who didn't grow up in that worldview, perhaps, how do they then relate to these kinds of traditional Buddhist teachings? And how do we negotiate that? It's a real challenge. And how do we do it in a way where we stay true to ourselves or have some sense of integrity in what we do, so that when we adopt a belief, we do it because we really believe in some deep way that makes sense, as opposed to just out of faith to our teachers or to tradition or something else. So one of my views around all this topic is that the teaching on action, theory of action, I think is very important. And I think that it's a very, I think it can be prevented somewhat in a simple way, like I did, but there's a lot behind it and it's quite a sophisticated teachings of the Buddha. It's very deep and it's very profound that he organized his spiritual teaching around a theory of action. And I thought Tanisha Bhikkhu last week did a brilliant job presenting that side of the Buddha's teachings. So that I think is great, that part. Then the part about rebirth, I actually don't care. I don't care whether someone believes in it so much. I mean, I do in the sense that I want to support people and understand where they're coming from and I want to respect people and all that and work with their understanding and their beliefs. But it doesn't have to be that important for me, whether someone believes in rebirth or not. And it's not so important for me. It is important for me if I feel that their belief in rebirth is getting in the way of their liberation, their freedom. Tanisha Bhikkhu felt that he was quite confident in his worldview that the idea of rebirth is bad news. The idea of rebirth is bad news in the sense that you've been reborn as part of the worldview as it gets bigger. You've been reborn not just 10,000 times, not 10 million times, the amount of times you've been reborn is astronomical in the Buddhist worldview, the traditional one. And the kind of poetic way it said in Suttas is, the amount of tears you have shed in all your lifetimes is greater than all the water in all the oceans. It's pretty big. You've been crying a long time. And maybe if you step back and think of ancient India where the medicine was very different than it is today and people often died in childbirth and there's a tremendous amount of suffering. The idea of getting reborn, the chance of when you get born is to become into a world with a lot of suffering. And they, oh I've got to do this 10 million, you know, 100 million times more? Please, I don't want to kind of go through these struggles and difficulty again and again. So people have a tremendous struggle. It's often happened in religious teaching. It's been pointed out by philosophers of religion or scholars of religion that people who see no hope in this life will often create a religion where the hope exists in the future life. And I don't know if that's a fair characterization of some of the teachings of Buddhism, but you certainly see that the tremendous stealing of this being reborn human life time after time is, you know, there's some pleasure in it and some happiness in it, but ultimately it's just a drag. And Tanisir Bhikkhu also believes not only a drag for us, but it's also a drag on the world around us because he used the word for consumers, where all of us are consumers. And we're all kind of eating each other basically. And the best thing to do for the environment, for the life in the world is not to come back and consume more, you know, kind of leave people alone, don't cause more damage than we do. So the day of rebirth then for him is very motivating. And for him it's motivating because of that one, he's really motivated to get off the wheel of rebirth. And because of that, he really wants to practice as strongly and deeply as he can to attain full liberation. That's really what he's at, so he can step off the wheel. And that's a very beautiful, you know, very profound teaching of traditional Buddhism, Theravadan Buddhism. And I certainly have a lot of respect for anybody who wants to hold that view. It's not a view that I want to disparage in any kind of way. So Tanjith thinks it's very important to believe in rebirth because that's going to give us a sufficient motivation to do the hard work of getting liberated. Because it's one thing to get a little bit liberated, but to really go all out. You know, he's a monk after all, right? To go all out and devote your whole life to it takes a tremendous motivation. And you need some kind of vision or some kind of something to really get the spark going. And for him the idea of getting off the wheel is that spark. So, you know, then you really practice really hard because you don't want to come back. However, what he didn't say, maybe because he hasn't seen it, hasn't recognized it, but for some people the idea of rebirth is a consolation. It's actually, oh, I get to try again. Or it's not so bad, you know. And actually, oh, I don't have to practice so hard yet here. I'll just do enough so I can get reborn in a better circumstance next lifetime. And I'll practice then. Then I'll get around to it. So what was it? Was it Augustine who said, you know, give me chastity, but not now? So, you know, give me chastity, give me celibacy, but next lifetime. So the teaching rebirth can also be seen as a way of putting off practice for some people. And perhaps if people felt this is the only life they have, then in some ways if this is the only chance you have, maybe I now I should really go for it and really go as far as I can. So, you know, what actually is motivating for different people, different things motivate different people. And he was kind of assuming that, you know, this is what his idea is, this is what really motivates people the most. So to back up a little bit, so my view that I mostly want to share with you is that it's not important for me, one way or the other. If people would like to believe it or they believe in it, some people feel like they know it. Some people say that they've had past life experiences or memories. And so they feel like or they've had some kind of situation experience in life where, you know, something that really seems like powerful evidence. This is really the truth. This is really the way it is. And I remember once listening to an audio tape of a Sri Lankan man. He was quite young when the tape was made. When he started talking, he was three or four or five years old, he apparently was able to chant these traditional Pali chants, supposedly without ever being introduced to them. And when scholars of Pali listened to him, they said the accent or the dialect in which he chanted was one from a thousand years ago or more. And the way he spoke it then. And so this was supposed to be, you know, the fact that he even knew these things was so phenomenal. And then the fact that he had this accent, you know, or dialect, but that was also quite phenomenal. And so that kind of those kinds of examples are supposed to be stories, you know, of, and there's people that have assembled kind of books of, you know, evidence of rebirth. So some people feel the evidence is there. And some people feel that the evidence doesn't stand. People looked into it. And that's all a matter of discussion argument. I don't know if anybody's kind of come to a final conclusion. They're still arguing about evolution. So it'll take a while. But for me, the way I was introduced to Buddhist practice, all my teachers I practice with, I practice with a lot of teachers, American teachers, Western teachers, and Asian teachers in Japan, in Thailand, in Burma, and in Nepal. And none of them ever asked me whether I believed in rebirth or not. And none of them ever implied that I needed to. They just were so happy. They just offered the practices and encouraged us to practice the best we could. Really sometimes really kind of tremendous encouragement to practice deeply and strongly. And I was never asked to do that part of Buddhism. And in the famous Stephen Batchelor Robert Thurman debate, Bob Thurman also says as a view that unless you believe in rebirth, you're not going to have the sufficient motivation to practice. Now is that the case? Maybe it's true. Maybe, maybe it's true. But I've known plenty of people for whom the idea of rebirth is not the motivating force for doing a practice. And those people have been phenomenally dedicated, you know, kind of made it their life work in a sense to do practice and really go as deep and as far in the path of liberation as they can. So I've never felt a need, one way or the other, to address people on this topic. I don't feel, you know, it's not an important one for me, whether people believe it or not. I don't feel as a teacher that I need to present that as something you have to believe in. It's a very central part of classic Buddhism, a traditional or mainstream Buddhism, whatever, Buddhist teachings. And I want to be very respectful of those teachings. And I'm in phenomenal awe of the Buddha. The more I practice and the more my own practice is developed, the more I'm just in awe of this man 2500 years ago and what he was able to discover and systemize and work out. And sometimes I think, you know, he was he able to the things that I've been able to see that, you know, are true of what he's taught, it's so phenomenal. He could figure this out that I kind of feel, well, maybe just given the benefit of the doubt for the rest, you know, someone who has this level of ability and capacity and, and sometimes I have that feeling. And, and sometimes I don't. And there we are. There we are. So, so I left you for four minutes for you. So I was mostly wanting to have a discussion today about all this. It's a maybe it was wise not to leave any time. But what do you think? What would you like to say? How do you how would you like to follow up a website or anything else that out of last week that you'd like to bring up? Yes, please. So, so one thing he did say was, he didn't want to talk about what it was, it was reborn, which I found a kind of interesting part of his discussion. Yeah, I started to remember that part of the conversation afterwards. And, and I probably, I think maybe I heard wrong, I remember it quite wrong. But I think the way he heard the question was more like who gets reborn? If the person had asked him was the person who asked that question here? And, and, and so I think he heard more like who gets reborn? And that's not an interesting who is not an interesting question. But if you asked him what is reborn, then you get some little more interesting question answers. The that rascal of teacher, Chogyam Trungpa, he said, what gets reborn is your bad habits. And there's some some kind of there's a background for him saying that. And that is that the momentum, what gives momentum to rebirth is the habits of the mind to cling and to hold on. And you can even hold on to skillful things, useful thing, wholesome things, good things. But as long as you're clinging and momentum to cling, then that momentum is what carries something into the next life. What that exactly is, is, you know, I have a PhD in Buddhism, I tried to look into this. And the best you know, I, you know, and I don't say I understand this too well, you know, I can speak for Buddhism, but I've never had a satisfactory answer about what is it that gets reborn? The best answer that I have so far is that it's kind of like the waves in the ocean. If you if you have, you know, if there's a big wave that comes from Japan to California, you say, well, there's there's the wave, and you can kind of track the wave as it goes across. But actually, no water is moving across the ocean. It's more like the water particles go up and down, and they strike the water particle next to it, it goes up and down. And so it's like the wave in an amphitheater, you know, people's hands go like this, and there's no hands that, you know, are moving around the amphitheater, but it looks like movement, right? So there's certain kind of momentum or spin that in our lives, and that spin of the spin of clinging or the spin of our actions of behavior in the past, whatever we've done, influences that spin. And that spin, in a sense, strikes the next consciousness. Is it consciousness which travels? Is that what it is from one moment to the next? Or is it that consciousness is often described as what is it that gets transferred? But is it is it conscious is not a thing, it's more like a wave. So you know, it's so it's like this consciousness strikes the next. And so I'm sure that people are going to try to do a better explanation or no, I think they have a better explanation. But, but the rather than thinking of a what, it's more like there's a process. And what is it that the substrate that carries that process, that's really difficult for Buddhists to point to. But, but there's just this momentum, this process that continues. And once you let go of clinging thoroughly enough, there's no more momentum to create the next spin. And that's something you can see here in your own life, right? The certain activities of the mind are self-perpetuating. And sometimes you it's it's it drops, it stops, and doesn't continue. And, and, you know, so that sometimes it can be quite liberating to have it finally stop. So that's adequate. Yes. The concept of rebirth being a motivating factor for you to advance your practice sounds to me a lot like aversion, that you're being averse to being reborn. And that's, you know, that aversion is what's driving you to do your practice, which seems like a problem in itself. Yes, there might be aversion in it. But the practice is self-purifying. If there is aversion, sooner or later as you practice that, that aversion has to be settled out or purified. And then, and then, then the question then is, can there still be that motivation after you've been purified of your aversion? And, and I don't know, I don't have any evidence that but I think there can be. I think that if I think, I think that if a person's suffering, a person can have the motivation to relieve that suffering without there being aversion to that suffering. And to be motivated to relieve that, to relieve that suffering can be quite a healthy and natural or innate movement of the heart or the mind. I have a view that the drive towards liberation or freedom is inherent within us or in us. And that if a person is sensitive enough to what this shy, quiet voice is inside, that you'll feel that there's this momentum or this drive or this desire, this wish or this calling for liberation for freedom. And I have a very, maybe reductionalistic explanation for this, which I've given here sometimes. And that is, if you've done this before, you don't have to participate, but you could support the other people who haven't by doing participating in this. And that is make a really hard fist. And not so much you have to go to the hospital afterwards, but make it really hard. Okay, really, really hard. And you're doing it hard and hard enough? Really? So you can't go wide, right? Hold it. Okay, keep taking it hard. Keep it this way until I tell you not to. Okay. So in India, if you want to capture a monkey, you take a coconut and you make a slit in it, and you tie the coconut to a tree, and you put a candy inside the coconut. The coconut is tied to a tree. And the monkey comes along and the monkey puts its hand into the slit when it grabs the candy, right? Are you holding just as tight as you were before? Really? And then because it's greedy, it can't get its hand down anymore because it's a slit, right? Like this. And so because it's greedy, it doesn't want to let go of its candy. The hunter comes along, just picks up the monkey. Okay, you can let go now. And now, in order to keep your fist that tight, did you have to kind of reassert yourself periodically? Wasn't there kind of like a natural movement to kind of let go and release? Clinging takes effort and work. And innate in the clinging of the fist is that clinging wants to be released. And so any kind of clinging within us wants to be liberated, wants to be released because it's painful and suffering. That's the momentum that it wants to go. So it's my view that's inherent in all of us, this movement of liberation. And if a person is sensitive enough, they realize this to their own best interest. Really, it's a motivation that's there for all of us. That sensitivity, mindfulness, sensitivity, compassion, and all that, that can come from this life here, can provide a tremendous impetus and power for practice, independent of any believing or not believing in rebirth. And so that's my, that's a view that I have. It's a view which I think some of the traditional teachers like Bob Thurman, for example, doesn't share because he feels you need something extra, something more to get you motivated. And that's something more is the belief in rebirth. So I hope this has been useful. It's, you know, I kind of wish we didn't have to talk about it. But given that it was brought up this way last week, I thought, and now what Tanisir Bhikkhu is very interested in having done is having had talk last week transcribed. And I thought that'd be interesting for me because if it was transcribed, then I can actually track the arguments of his much better. And that would help me in my next conversations with him. But he wants, I think he wants to turn it into an article, in which case, I would probably help him because, you know, he has to kind of contend with, you know, with me. So if anybody would be interested in transcribing last week's talk, that would be very nice, I think, and both of us would appreciate it. So, and those of you who are brand new here and never came here before, and don't even know what Buddhism is, Harley's checking it out, you know, just maybe even forget you were here tonight and and try it again next week.
