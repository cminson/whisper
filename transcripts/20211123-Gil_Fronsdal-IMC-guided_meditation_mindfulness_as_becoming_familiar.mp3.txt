 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So warm greetings. And one of the important aspects of a regular meditation practice is developing more and more familiarity with your own body. More and more familiarity with your own mind and how the mind and body work together. How they connect and meet. And to take the same meditation posture, more or less same but maybe everyday, we develop a heightened sensitivity to the subtle distinctions, differences from one day to the next, the way the body is held, the tension, the patterns of breathing, where the breath is maybe a little bit held and where it's easy. And so, and same thing with the mind. We begin developing heightened sensitivity to the differences in how the mind is day to day, even minute to minute. What it's, how much energy is in it, how tired it is, how distractible it is, how centered it is, all kinds of things. And this is not incidental to have this heightened sensitivity. It's actually very important and the more we become sensitive to the subtleties of the body and the mind, the more interesting meditation becomes and more we have an ability to kind of begin seeing more deeply and offering more presence to our experience and ability to relax more deeply. So to just keep becoming familiar. So taking a alert, relaxed posture and gently closing your eyes. And before you start meditating, to familiarize yourself with your body, how is it now? What parts of your body are tense, tight? What parts seem settled and relaxed? Part of the subtle familiarity with the body is familiarity with the minute differences in posture. The alignment of the spine. The placement of the hands. And half an inch difference of where the hands are can make a difference in relaxation of the arm and even the shoulders. And the position of the head on the neck. So try tipping your head down a teeny bit. And bring the head back slightly. And then gently, ever so gently as if you're familiarizing yourself with what happens as you do so, take a few long, slow, deep breaths. Deep enough that you feel the fullness but not so deep that you feel winded. Long relaxation as you exhale. Letting your breathing return to normal. And gently, familiarize yourself with the experience of breathing. Noticing the activity level of the mind. Familiarizing yourself with the activity level of the mind. Noticing any way in which the mind might be contracted or tense or agitated or dull. And like your body might relax if you sit down in a nice, easy, soft chair. See if you can have the same movement of your mind as the mind settles down into the body, into the breathing. The mind settled on the body breathing. Steadying the mind, the awareness on the experience of breathing. And as the mind is steadied on breathing as you exhale, let the thinking mind become quieter and stiller. Thinking slows. And as the mind gets a little quieter, stiller. Let there be a heightened sense, a higher sensitivity to the experience of the body breathing. With awareness centered on breathing. And as the mind gets a little quieter, stiller. And as the mind gets a little quieter, stiller. And as the mind gets a little quieter, stiller. And as the mind gets a little quieter, stiller. And as the mind gets a little quieter, stiller. And as the mind gets a little quieter, stiller. And as the mind gets a little quieter, stiller. And as the mind gets a little quieter, stiller.

And as we come to the end of the sitting, to turn your attention inside out, in the sense of turning now your gaze of your attention on the world, people you'll encounter today, tomorrow, and to familiarize yourself with your attitudes and feelings towards others, how is it for you, the people in your life? And without pushing away any way that you feel, to continue to turn this inside out of the heart. So the softness, the peacefulness of the heart of your inner life is the place from which you gaze on the world of others, with a well-wishing heart, a heart that has good will towards others. Wish them well. May others be happy. May others be safe. May others be peaceful. May others be free. In ways, in whatever ways that are easy for you today, perhaps you can contribute to that possibility. May we live for the happiness and welfare of ourselves and others. May all beings be happy. Thank you.
