Dharmette: Notice What is Absent

The teachings of min dfulness are often given 
with the emphasis on being p resent for what is 
happening, to notic e what is happening. Giving 
instructions that way  tends to overemphasize 
what is happening , as opposed to what is not 
happening. Sometimes in practice it is useful to 
notice what is not happening as well as what is 
happening. If you look at the instructions  the 
Buddha gave for mindfu lness practice, it 
included  noticing  both what is present and what 
is absent. There is learning and value in noting 
the absence of some things .  
 
We can be focused a lot on our concerns. The 
mind can focus on one concern and  then when 
that’s finished , it moves on to the next concern. 
Then s ometimes , by noticing that something is 
no longer present, we can notice what we are 
like when it ’s no longer there. We can notice 
what  has shifted and not shifted. This is 
particularly tru e, not so much with the outer world , as with our inner world. We have certain 
ways of being – certain emotions  and 
tendencies. Mindfulness practitioners might 
spend a lot of time paying close attention to their 
emotions, understanding what it is like to  be 
present for the emotion. But then when it is 
gone,  they just go  on to the next thing. But there 
is information to gain from noticing when 
something is no longer there.  
 
In the mindfulness teachings the Buddha gave, 
he said to notice the five hindrances , and notice 
when they are not present. So not ice when there 
is strong desire;  and when it has gone away, 
take some time to recognize what it is like to 
have that absence. If there is strong aversion,  
anger or  ill will, certainly notice what that is like  – 
but then notice how you are  when it has passed . 
And do  the same for the other hindrances: sloth 
and torpor, restlessness and regret, and doubt.  
 
When you notice that something  not there, a  
number of things happen then. You can explore 
in your mind and bo dy what is now absent and 
what is present , now that the hindrance is gone . 
If you are consumed with anger – and if anger  is 
a common phenomenon in your life – it might go 
away by accident one day , and then you can spend some time getting to know what that 
absence is like. You might feel that you are not 
so contracted, that your thoughts are not 
spinning so much. You recognize what is 
different when you’re angry as opposed to when 
you’re not angry . There’s learning there. Then 
the next time you ’re angry, you  have some point 
of comparison  – not to judge yourself by , but as 
a highlight. Now you see the contraction , which 
before you could not see because of being so 
caught up in the anger. But now that you  can 
see what it’s like  not to be contracted, you can 
see the contraction.  
 
To take time to recognize, acknowledge and 
appreciate what it is like when we are not 
troubled  by something anymore is a valuable 
part of the practice. Because things pass away 
with time, s ooner or later, you’re n ot going to be 
troubled by something  anymore . Even if you get 
distracted, it has passed temporarily. So you can 
notice: “What’s this like now?”  
 
The more you can become aware of this 
difference, the more you’ll see the benefits as 
well. One benefit is that n the absen ce of a 
troubling state  – if that feels pleasant or 
enjoyable in some way  – then recognizing what that’s like can make it  more appealing to let go 
of things you are troubled by or attached to. If 
you have some place to go  that feels nice, then 
letting go is not letting go into nothing. It’s letting 
go into s omething that feels nice, and this  helps 
you to be not so contracted. Rather, you can let 
go into that nice feeling of being uncontracted. 
There’s something attractive there. The mind will 
tend to go where it is more interest ed and where 
it feels nice.  
 
Another benefit is that the more we become 
sensitive  to seeing the contr ast between states 
of suffering and states free of suffering , and the 
more we are attuned to seeing that difference  
between the two , then  we might see we have a 
choice  when  we’re holding or attached  to our 
concerns . This is harder to see if we are just los t 
in our suffering. But by seeing that there is a 
difference, then sometimes we can see how we 
are contributing to what we’re holding onto – and 
so it’s easier to  let go.  
 
Also, seeing a  greater contrast leads some 
people to find it less interesting to suffer. Some 
get really interested in the ir suffering and 
become fascinated by it. There are a few  people  
who find it very strategic to suffer. It is their way of controlling the world. I have met people who 
are clearly trying to take contro l of other people 
by being really good at their suffering  – being 
victims of their suffering so the world has to 
accommodate them and organize around them 
because everything is so hard for them. So the 
contrast is useful.  
 
Another helpful thing in noticin g the absence of 
things is  noticing positive states as well. Or on 
the other hand, y ou might be suffering or feeling 
kind of neutral , and you can ask yourself what 
happened to the good feeling you had earlier. 
That well -being you had is no longer here now.  
That’s interesting. Or in the absence of that, 
what’s happening now that that suffering is no 
longer there?   
 
For example, I was confident this morning , and 
now the confidence is gone. Let me take a 
moment to look back and reflect on this. What 
happened  there ? Reflect , rather than just not 
notic ing and be ing upset. Instead, “Now I will be 
present  for what is. I’ll be present  for 
‘upset ness .’” That is valuable. It might also be 
valuable t o notice the shift  in the course of the 
morning . I was confident in the morning, and 
now I’m not. What is that about? What does it feel like not to be confident ? What is going on 
for me that the confidence is no longer there? To 
explore it , get to know it  – that might be 
valuable .  
 
The idea of the absence of something being an 
important area of  mindfulness is not equal in 
time with what is here, with what you’re  present 
for. But it can be useful to take some time to 
notice what is absent. Sometimes by noti cing 
when something is absent, it might highlight 
something that you’re overlook ing. For example, 
maybe you are caught up in doing your tasks, 
and the confidence you felt in the morning is no 
longer here. You could just focus on feeling what 
it’s like to b e caught up in your tasks , or you 
might notice the absence of confidence and 
consider , “What is going on  here that I don’t feel 
so confident?”  Then you might notice that you 
are feeling discouraged because there are so 
many daily life tasks you always have  to do. So 
then you notice the discouragement in a way 
you hadn’t before. Maybe it was a mild, small 
thing that then became significant.  
 
So, from time to time, especially if something 
has been going on for a while  – a recurrent 
theme or some strong state, emotion, or way of being – once it’s gone, don’t just rush off to the 
next thing. Instead, give yourself a little time to 
recognize the a bsence of that state, whether it’s 
a pleasant or unpleasant state . Once it’s gone, 
take some  time to recognize what it’s like that 
it’s no longer there, see what you can learn from 
the contrast, from the absence , and what else 
might be useful to pay attent ion to in the present 
moment now that – whatever that might be – is 
no longer there.
