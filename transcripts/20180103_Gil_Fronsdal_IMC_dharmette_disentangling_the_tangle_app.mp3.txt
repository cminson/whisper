Dharmette : Disentangling  the Tangle

The Buddha gave an interesting analogy. He was 
talking about two oxen tied to each other with a rope. 
He asked  someone, “I s one ox being hinde red or 
fettered by the other ox?”  The answer to the question is , 
“No.” The two ox en are being fettered or hindered by 
the rope between them. For some people,  the tendency 
is to answer the question , “Yes.”  They think that if  
they’re tied together , then one ox is hindering the other 
ox. But , the oxen are hindered separately, and the 
hindrance  comes from the rope that holds them 
together.  
 
The Buddha then takes this teaching analogy and 
applies it to our lives. He  says that there is the object of 
what we see; there are the eyes ; and there are the 
attachments, fetters , or ties that can connect those two. 
For example, if  I’m attached to this wonderful bell , I see 
the bell. The attachment does not live in the bell. The 
attachment does not live  in the eye. But according to  the 
language of the ancient tradition, the attachment is in 
the relationship between the two , which is  not the bell, 
not the eye, but the ‘knot,’ which is the word used in the 
text. Those  two get entangled . So, is it the bell’s fault when I’m being limited by my attachment to the bell? If 
it’s the bell’s fault , then I can  just get rid of this bell. We 
can’t have a Buddhist teacher attached to anything. So , 
if I’m attached to this bell , then I can put it in the 
garbage , and live happily ever after . If only  it were  that 
easy ! 
 
But we don’t want to blame the bell. Now you  could 
blame the teacher. Let’s just dump the teacher as if the 
person or their eyes is the problem . Rather , it’s the 
attachment . So, Buddhist practice focuses on untying 
the ties or disentangling the tangle, which is a famous 
little Buddhist sloga n.  
 
The Buddha went on with hearing. There’s sound ; there 
are the ears ; and then there can be a tie, attachment or 
knot between those two.  There’s smell , the nose, and 
there can  be what ties the two together. There’s taste, 
the tongue , and there’s what ties , hinders , or entangles 
the two together. There  are sensations, and the body, 
and the tie between them. It’s the same thing with the 
mind. There are emotions and feelings, and the inner 
eye that sees , perceive s or know s that we’re having 
emotions and feelin gs. There is also the relationship 
between them , which can be one of being entangled.  
 
Central to this Buddhist  practice is to not reject anything 
in the worl d, or anything within us. That is not to reject 
ourselves as the subject or the experiencer , but rather to investigate the relationship between the world and 
ourselves , or between ourselves as the observer  or 
experiencer and what we are experiencing.  
 
It’s so easy to blame the other ox. It’s so easy to blame 
the bell , or the thing th at we’re in relati onship with and 
struggling with . Or we blame  ourselves , the person 
having the experience or knowing it. But, it’s wonderfu l 
that there is a middle ground  where we don’t have to 
take responsibility or the blame , or feel bad about 
ourselves . It’s not what is out in the world that we have 
to rej ect. And  there’s something magical about 
discovering  some freedom in the relationship between 
those two.  
 
When we’re not free, Buddhism calls that an 
entanglemen t, fetter , or tie. Somehow we’re tied to 
things. So, can we di scover the nature of those ties? 
Can we discover the natu re of what that relationship is?  
Do we have a relationship of want ing more? Do we 
have a relationship of want ing less, or wanting to  push 
away? Are we tangle d up with our experience because 
we’re seeing it through the lens of me, myself and 
mine?  Or is it that whatever  is happening here says that  
I’m a good person or a bad person , as opposed to just 
letting it be a simple experience ? 
 
We have emotions. There’s  a powerful way to give 
freedom to our emotions when we don’t tie ourselves to them. We don’t reject the emoti ons. We don’t try to 
repress th e emotions , but we’re not tied to them. We’re 
not entangled with them. We know them,  and the 
knowing is free of wha t we know.  
 
We also don’t have to be enta ngled with our thoughts. 
Human beings can have  all kinds of amazing ly creative 
thoughts. I imagine that some of you are very creative 
(to say it in a polite way) in the kind of thoughts you can 
have. It’s not a problem having those thoughts. But, it’s  
a problem of how we relate to the thoughts  – how we 
hold on, fight them, reject them, judge t hem, or how we 
judge ourselves  because of them. There’s a thought ; 
there’s a knowing of the thought ; and between the two , 
there doesn’t have to be anything that ties  or tangles  
them up. Inst ead, there can be vast emptiness and  
space. There can be a wonderf ul, glorious gap in which 
there is a sense of  clarity, openness , or luminosity.  
 
This morning I talked  about  the idea that is there is  a 
place of stillness, quiet , or peacefulness , which is not 
requiring anything in the world to change , except  how 
we look. We look in a quiet way. We look in a peaceful 
way at whatever  is difficult, easy , or wonderful. We hear 
in a quiet way . We taste, smell , and touch with stillness, 
peac efulness , and clarity. And with the mind , we know 
what’s going on internall y. 
 One of the ways that the Buddhist tradition talks about 
the whole purpose of Buddhist practice  is to untie or 
disentangle the tangles . One of the greatest 
disent angles is to disentan gle yourself  from your 
tangles. S o, if from time to time , you find that you’re 
entangled, attached , or caught up , then don’t add 
another knot. There’s just the tangle, the knowing of the 
tangle , and between the two , there can be peace. There 
can be stillness. There can be space  and glorious  
emptiness.  
 
This teaching points to the importance of  dropping in, 
settling down, and showing up for our experience at the 
level of how it’s immediately experienced. It points to 
the immediacy of seeing what you can see  now, of 
hearing what you can hear now, of tasting, smelling, 
touching or tactilely feeling , and the immediacy o f what 
you can know in the mind or  the inner life right now.  
 
So, if you’re thinking about the past, you see that it’s 
clearly happening in the present , and it’s known in the 
present.  Thinking about the future  is a present moment 
experience. To somehow be able to settle back into this , 
we can then start discovering the rope that ties the ox. 
Perhaps  if the ox becomes free , that’s nice because 
oxen  are strong. Maybe all of us can b e oxe n, or 
something like that.  
 I hope that , as we start this new year , your practice 
unties you from all the things that limit you, so that you 
can be strong , and walk through thi s world with your full 
strength, capacity , and confidence – like a might y ox.
