The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Hello and good morning, good day, and to say a few introductory words for the
meditation. There's a fascinating use of attention awareness in meditation
especially. And I say meditation by the time when we can kind of give ourselves
over to the exercise, the experiment, the discovery process of what we can, what
happens when we're really aware. And that is to be aware of some psychological
thing within, thinking, some emotion, and hold it gently, carefully, fully in the
gaze of awareness. And if you do that, what you're doing is, if it's really
only aware of it, what we're doing in that, in being aware of it, where in
itself awareness does not interfere, or doesn't judge, or doesn't react to what
we're aware of. And so if we're fully invested in caught up in something, being
aware is a process of beginning to step away from it, to know it, to see it,
without being caught in it, without fueling it, without adding to it,
participating in it. But just knowing it. As we know it more and more that way, we
start seeing, eventually, we might see how we're participating, how we're
fueling it, how we're repeating the same thought pattern, ideas, desires, in order
to keep certain things going. And so we keep kind of opening or developing that
awareness to non-reactive, non-judgmental, just to see it, we see what we
contribute, and or we stop feeding it, we stop, you know, this kind of renewing it
all the time. And then we see it begin to fade, maybe fade and fade away, it
becomes less intense, it weakens more often than not. It's hard to see sometimes
if they, our participation in it, our reactivity to it, is subconscious, is
deeply embodied, and habit made, or something. So we have to be careful with
making too many conclusions around this. But this idea of just gazing upon
something, long enough to watch it begin to fade, to weaken, this is a
fascinating process. And a lot of things will fade quicker than we realize,
surprisingly fast. There's some studies about how quickly an emotion will last
by itself, and it's, you know, in a minute or 90 seconds or something. That's how
long emotions last, unless there's something in our psychophysical system
that's renewing it, feeding it, building it up. So to be with a breathing also, the
breathing, if the breathing is a neutral place where we're not controlling,
reacting to, this is another way in which we are shifting the direction of our
mental fuel, mental renewal process, so that we're renewing and fueling attention
to breathing, not to our thinking, not to our reactivity, not to certain emotions,
reactive emotions. So taking a meditation posture, assuming a posture,
entering into a posture, and slowing down, slowing down and maybe twisting and
swaying your body in a slow way to kind of begin the process of mindfulness of
the body. Aware from the body's point of view, how we can find a balanced, aligned
posture, maybe twisting a little bit from side to side, the upper torso around the
shoulders. It's a way of maybe helping the shoulders kind of come alive and maybe
settle a little bit, lowering the gaze, gently closing your eyes, taking a moment
to simply know how you are in the most obvious way, know it in the most non
reactive way that you know how. Just know how you are in some simple, general way,
where what's important is not what you, not how you are, but the way you know it.
And then on the exhale, relaxing your body, a kind of relaxation is not forced or
expecting much, almost allowing the body space and room to release itself.
The shoulders, the belly,
and then connecting more fully to your breathing, taking three breaths, just
three breaths, three breath journey of settling in, being here just with your
breathing three times. And then once you've done three breaths, ordinary
simple breaths that you attend to carefully, you're very quite aware of the
count, the breath, the really connected, then do it again. And again, give yourself
over to three breaths at a time, a relatively small goal to stay present
for three breaths, and then to renew that practice.
Remembering to do the three breaths, just fully present for three breaths.
The inhales, the exhales, the transition between inhaling, exhaling, exhaling, inhaling.
Coming back to doing three full breaths, remembering to stay with three breaths
again and again.
You're able to stay with the repetition of three breaths at a time. Great. And if
you can't, what is it that's pulling you away? Not the content of your thoughts,
but is it thinking? Is it feeling? Emotions? Recognize clearly what it is
that grabs your attention so you forget to be with your breathing.
And now, let go of breathing, focusing on breathing, and bring your
attention to the process of thinking, or to some emotion that is difficult, or
to engage upon it carefully, non-reactively. Just watch and see. Step back, let it be
what it is, but live in the knowing of it, not in it. You might even use the note
thinking, feeling.
Allow whatever is there to be there, but don't participate in it. Just step back
and gaze upon it non-reactively.
And if there is desires, or a
version wanting, or not wanting, gaze upon that with non-reactive awareness,
recognizing it as wanting, not wanting, and see what happens under that gaze.

In a very normal morning, when you are feeling the same and you really have this feeling of
being with the constant mind, your body is fully engaged in other feelings.
And then as we come to the end of this sitting,
there is a way to gaze upon the world non-reactively,
that is at the same time kindly, kindness, friendliness.
Love is not necessarily a reactive way of being,
but rather is the closer to just flows from the open heart.
And to gaze upon the world with kind eyes,
without wanting anything or not wanting just kind eyes,
kind of kindness that carries with it the wish and the delight
and the appreciation of others, wishing them well.
May from these eyes of mine, may their flow well-wishing,
wishing for the welfare and happiness of others.
May flowing from me, may there come the wishes
carried in these words.
May others be happy.
May others be safe.
May others be peaceful.
May others be free.
And may we contribute to that possibility.
Thank you.
