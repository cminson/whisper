So, find myself happy to be here with you this morning and for this third talk on the qualities of the Dharma. 
And today, you know, so I have the simplest way, they're kind of very, kind of simplistic, maybe a way of understanding these five qualities is that they are, it's about here, Dharma is here, the Dharma is now. 
The Dharma is looking. 
The Dharma is flowing along and the Dharma is to be experienced. 
So, today the topic, you know, in a simplistic way is the Dharma is looking. 
The literal Pali word, as I said last week, is a very common, ordinary expression that suggests this kind of simplicity that I'm talking about a simplistic way of saying it is because it literally means come, look, come see. 
Some people say inviting inspection, they translated it. 
Some people say there's one wonderful Chinese Buddha saying that says awakening beckons us within everything. 
And awakening invites us within everything. 
So everything that we see and touch is inviting us, come, be awake, wake up. 
What a great idea that that's how it is. 
And it is that way in a certain way. 
Maybe I'll try to explain that. 
But come and look and look. 
And what we find then in this five characteristics of the Dharma, the first one is San Diti ko. 
The Diti does mean to come see. 
It means visible. 
So it's visible. 
Some people say it's in this very life that we can see and live here. 
Some people will translate it as to see here, to visible here and now. 
But I think to say it's visible here. 
The third one now is to come look. 
So here we both of them have, you know, seeing in the meaning of it. 
And then the fifth one on Friday is to know, to experience, to know. 
The word means both things, to know. 
So this day of seeing and knowing is really as deep in the Dharma. 
And you find the Buddha throughout his teachings, he keeps emphasizing seeing and knowing, seeing and knowing. 
And so cultivating or developing our capacity to settle into here and now, to discover a way of being here and now that is not in conflict, not fighting, not running away, escaping, not afraid of here and now, not putting layers of interpretation and wishes, expectations on here and now, coming into a simplicity of being with here and now. 
It's a lot of what we're discovering in this meditation practice here and now, here and now. 
And that gives us an opportunity then for the looking, the seeing to be relatively simple, to be uncomplicated. 
Not a lot of baggage comes along with it. 
And it's all too easy to have baggage come along. 
One of them is to look and be mindful with kind of a self-consciousness, performance anxiety, or measuring oneself. 
How am I doing? I'm not doing well enough. 
I should be further along. 
It's too difficult for me. 
All these kinds of forms of self-consciousness take us out of the simplicity of here and now, and also out of the simplicity of this seeing, what's here, just this looking, just being mindful, just aware here. 
And one of the challenges for some people will be that this simplicity of here and now and simplicity of mindfulness here is boring, that it's unpromising. 
It's not going to provide us with the rich things, the special things, the wonderful things. 
But maybe that's the price of coming into a wonderful state of being, is a willingness to be very simple without expectation, without wanting anything, so that we can put down the activity of boredom, put down the activity of selfing and wanting something and building self up. 
It's just very simple. 
And then to be able to look from that point of view, to see, to be mindful, to be aware in a way is very respectful of whatever is happening in the present moment, that each thing in the present moment is allowed to be itself without our interference and our desires, the kind of pristine primordial kind of appearance of whatever is happening in the moment. 
Okay, this is allowed to be here. 
So all our emotions, there's an art to allowing them all to be there here without being entangled, reactive, and without being pushed around by them, without being influenced by them. 
And so this simplicity of being might not seem so interesting in the, in some ways, but it's a radical alternative to being influenced by our inner life and some, you know, desires, wishes and emotions and all that. 
Something different can happen. 
But as we begin to look more at some point, what becomes interesting and fascinating is not what we see and not that we can see clearly, but we can, it's the looking itself. 
We begin appreciating more and more that the mindfulness itself, the way we are aware, awareness in itself, the inner perception, the perception we have itself, that maybe that's where the treasure is. 
Maybe there is where we find a freedom, awakening, that this wonderful to turn around and look awareness, look at perception, perceiving itself, looking the inner eye, looking and seeing itself, awareness, aware of itself in such a way that we begin shedding all the extra baggage that comes along with it, all the extra attachments, clinging, stress levels that come along with being aware, being mindful. 
And this is one of the kind of ways in which mindfulness really opens up to a deep equanimity is as the mindfulness, as the awareness begins shedding, the complexities that we add on top of it. 
It just becomes simpler and simpler awareness, simpler and simpler looking, the simplicity of it becomes the guide. 
Oh, there's where non-clinging ears. 
There's a little bit of stress there in how I'm aware. 
Oh, and as I become aware of that stress, something opens, something relaxes. 
As I become aware of the stress in mindfulness, I notice there that that awareness has no stress in it. 
So we're stepping back, we're going through these layers and layers and to finding that place where awareness has no stress, no tension associated with it. 
And then kind of staying close to that, letting the how we're aware of the world come from that place of no tension, no stress, no pushing, no straining, no resisting, no pulling away, no leaning forward. 
So that's why sometimes it's powerful to realize that, or to have this attitude or understanding that what we're looking for is in the looking. 
That we can, in being attentive, we're being attentive to how we're attending, attention and attending, I use together. 
In having attention, we're attending to the attending itself. 
In the mindfulness, we're being mindful of the how we're being mindful. 
In looking, we're mindful of how we're looking. 
In attending to anything, we're doing attention to how we're attending. 
And that is where we can understand something a lot about what's going on in our life. 
It begins shedding all the different activities within associated with attention, with a practice that involves stress, strain, tension, involves some kind of discomfort, dukkha, until we find this equanimity of simplicity, the simplicity of equanimity. 
So this idea of the Buddha says, come and look, here and now, in the here and now, with the here and now, come and look, come and look. 
So today, as you go about your day, you might take some time, maybe set a timer, you're reminded periodically, sit in FTE, whenever you have a chance, but make an assignment that today, start becoming more aware of the characteristics, the quality of your awareness itself, of your attention itself, of your mindfulness. 
Turn around and see how much extra there might be there along, and see how simple you can allow your attention to be. 
And if there's any kind of extended period of time, this simplicity of awareness, I suspect that you'll discover that your breathing shifts and changes. 
It might become more useful. 
So, I hope that it's a wonderful day of exploration, and I look forward to our time tomorrow. 
Thank you.
