 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. Great. So hello and welcome everyone. It's lovely to see you. It's lovely to be with you. I was away from happy hour last week. I was teaching a retreat at the Insight Retreat Center where many of our happy hour Sangha members were present. And it was lovely to meet you in person and those who were not present, we held you, the Sangha, in our hearts. It's just really nice to have this sense of the Sangha that's online and retreats and various ways for us to come together, which reminds me, actually, I'll say it now. I'll say it later too. I'm also teaching an in person, Metta Deilong at IMC for those of you who are local on Saturday, September 30th. So put that on your calendars if you're in the Bay Area. So with that, I'd like to share practice this evening and bring in a sense of landing into peace and quiet. And with this, with Metta, with kindness and intertwining of these two practices, which can be quite nourishing to the heart, a place of stillness. And within that, also meeting and holding with a sense of acceptance, any emotions or any thoughts there might be, you know, today, maybe you felt disappointed, frustrated, sad, we've had difficult moments. It's okay. It's really okay. As human beings, we have these moments, we have emotions. So how do we hold them with skillfulness, feel them, not exile them, and bring compassion, bring care, both for ourselves and others. So these are the themes I'd like to bring in to our practice in this moment. But with that, I'd like to invite us all to transition to landing in this body, earning awareness inward and greeting whatever is present in the heart and the mind and the body, as if you are taking a pulse, a kind pulse with kindness. What's here? Maybe there's some achiness present, maybe agitation, distraction, heaviness in the heart. Whatever is present, allowing it to be present just as it is, with kindness, relaxing the body, letting there be spaciousness, can all be here. And letting the breath be just as it is, you don't have to breathe in any special way. And tuning into the spaciousness there is around, holding all of what's present in the body and the mind. And the breath is expansive, is spacious, making peaceful calm space to be with everything just as it is. Letting the body be relaxed and breathing with whatever is present, with patience, kindness, will keep you from you letting the breath, the soothing, calming, friendly, making space if the mind is busy, distracted, it's okay, the breath can be present, making space around that it's okay, it's alright, can there be ease? it's okay, can there be ease? with kindness for whatever there is, breathing with it, breathing around it, that's all there is, there is plenty of space in the heart and the mind for everything to be here, it's okay, breathing in, breathing out, breathing in, breathing out, breathing out, breathing you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you nothing else is needed just to be what the accompanying the breath this friend making space with kindness for whatever there is the body might and heart of the spot very simple spaciousness of presence and acceptance with kindness you you you you you you you you you you it's okay it's okay there's plenty of space everything to be here just as it is you you you you you you you you you you you here here here here here here here here here here here here spatiously here with kindness you you you you you you youINA some act of kindness Take delight and generosity Just the fact that we have brought ourselves To this practice period not judging how the mind or body are but appreciating our intention Their goodness to show up just to show up Take a moment to recollect something good about this being who is you Some kind act Generous wise something Let your heart be uplifted Take your time As if you are observing your own life your own actions as a loving good friend would Stepping out of yourself for a moment Maybe it was patience, perseverance, support you offered You're heart be uplifted by the goodness Don't take these acts these little ordinary kindnesses acts of wisdom patience for granted By turning to them we help them grow Let this recollection of goodness serve As a way to feel to hold yourself with kindness and metta this being who is you May I be safe May I be happy May I be healthy May I have ease May I have the supportive conditions To help my goodness grow and shine For my own sake, the sake of all beings May which I wish myself well I wish myself well. Let's return this practice period to a close. Will you let us all create at the introduction ofBL Healing for ideas on limb internal Emily and share that with us the ethical behavior and made support the weakening of not just ourselves but all beings everywhere. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free including ourselves. Thanks everyone. Thank you for your practice. Now, before we turn to small group practice, I wanted to just say a few words about what we did tonight, a summary. So the invitation tonight was actually a very simple invitation. The invitation was to be with the breath and letting the breath make space, make space and accepting space around whatever is, accepting kind space around whatever is present in the body and the mind and the heart without pushing them away by connecting with the breath as a way of stability as to create collectiveness of the mind and kindness. And then the sense of spaciousness, spaciousness because there's so much more. We usually focus on what's difficult and our mind gets really tight and small. But this invitation for spaciousness and then realize, wow, yes, the challenge is difficulties. If there are any emotions, we can have them without being completely overwhelmed by him. There's a lot more that can be present. And at the end, I invited you to turn to recollecting your own goodness, to gladden the heart. It's one way of doing this practice that's called Buddha Nusati, the collections of the qualities of the Buddha. In this way, we're recollecting the qualities of the Buddha within the kindness, the generosity, the wisdom. So that was what we did. And whatever showed up for you or didn't show up for you is all fine. It's exactly as it needs to be. Let there be acceptance, peace, non-judgment to what needed to arise this evening. Well, depending on your time zone, wherever you are. So now I'd like to invite us to turn to practicing in small groups. And the prompt is what happens when you have a difficult emotion? What happens if you have a difficult emotion? What happens if you deny it, if you try to push it away, deny that you have it? Versus if you allow it to be, which doesn't mean that you act out of it. But if there's a sense of okay, frustration arising, sadness arising. And also if there is a sense of spaciousness around the acceptance. So maybe some words come up and if no words come up, you can just bow and say pass, hold a kind presence in the container. So I'm going to create the breakout rooms, take care of yourselves, take care of each other, be kind. And hold on one second. And let's see, creating the rooms here. Okay. All right. I think I am ready to open them. Am I ready? Actually wait, I need to do one more thing before I open them. Hold on. You can have patience. You can practice patience as I move things around. Okay, let's see what happened. I didn't mean to do that. Hold up. All right. Having some technical difficulty. Okay there. I think that's it. All right. Great. Okay. Here we go. I'm about to open their rooms. Take care of yourselves, take care of each other, be kind. Okay. And oh yes, one last thing I forgot to say. In practice, in the small groups, you have a couple of things I forgot to say. One is let's go in alphabetical order. And the second is that you only share, please, you're invited to share just something from your own practice. Just maybe share a short nugget, maybe a minute or half a minute, and then another person speak, and then another person, and then it comes back to you. So you can go around a few times. And it's not appropriate to ask questions from another, from someone else, or lead the group. Just show up with what you want to share and let people share whatever they want to share or not. Just creating as safe a space as possible for one another. As safe and accepting space. Okay. All right. Here we go. I'm going to open the rooms now. Okay. Welcome back, everyone. The rooms are closed, and we have some time for reflections. You can either raise your hand if you haven't spoken for a while in the group. You can raise your Zoom hand. If it's your physical hand, I may not see you. We can also share your reflections or questions in chat. And if you send them to me privately, I will read your reflection, not your name. If you send them to everyone, I will also read your name to attribute it to you. So what did you discover in this practice, or either the silent practice or in the sharing? What did you discover about making space with kindness for what is emotions, challenges, instead of pushing them away? Letting their kind space. Maybe with stillness even, any reflections? Sephrina. Hey. Yeah, I showed up today with a migraine, and I didn't realize how much I was pushing the pain and frustration away until I chose to really embrace it and how much more space there was and how much more acceptance I was feeling. And then by the end of the session, my migraine was gone. So it just felt really practical for me, as well as a reminder to keep acknowledging my emotions rather than pushing them away. So practically, it was really great, and emotionally, it felt really great. So thank you so much. Yay. Thank you, Sephrina. Oh, my goodness. Seeing claps and appreciations and hearts in Zoom space for your share. Thank you so much for sharing that. It's so inspiring what you shared. Beautiful, right? When we, in the moment we turn, we realize and just things shift. Yay. Yeah, I'm celebrating your practice along with others. This is so beautiful. Yeah, this is so great. Exactly what Sephrina said, that. That's great. Beautiful. And Rayne, am I saying your name right? Yes. Yes. Yeah. What I shared was that I had been in a hit and run bike accident, and I had to work through a lot of... That was in August, and I actually showed up for this group, got through it when... Anyway, back in the end of August, it was Diana that night. Anyway, fear and anxiety, having to work through that came out of that accident. That's become easy for me. What I've noticed lately is when I'm feeling really happy, I feel guilty around people, because there's still a lot of people I know are in fear and post-COVID kind of a malaise here in San Francisco. They've lost jobs just or... So something you did last Friday, we did the emanating love and being like a sun. So I noticed lately, it was one of those I've mitigated that and guilt for feeling so happy around people who are sad. It's like, I'm just going to shine and share my joy. And just, yeah, because I don't want to give it up, but it was just a great tool that you gave Friday to help me have that. Beautiful. Thank you so much, Rayne. Such wisdom in applying that to what's arising, as you've said, with the sense of guilt or shame, like others happy and it's bad for me to be... I realize actually, I can give it away. I can be that and I can give it away. I can give my gladness, my kindness, my metta, my stillness, my peace. I'm going to give it away. It's not for me to keep. It's like a sun that shines. I'm giving it away. Ah, what an act of generosity you've chosen to do, Rayne. That's beautiful. Thank you. Thanks for sharing that. Inspiring. Ah, so lovely. Mm. And Nusha, yes, Nusha says, thanks for your kind words. It was my first retreat and it was very impactful. Yay, Nusha, Nusha just attended this seven day silent retreat at IRC, delighted that you were there, Nusha, and it was impactful for you. May you shine your light now. May you give away your happiness. May you give away your kindness and peace from the retreat. So great. Yeah. Any last reflections, comments, questions? Yeah. Question here from Sridhavi, after I noticed that I'm afraid of doing something new, then how do I address it the same way? Acknowledge that you're afraid. Don't try to push fear away. Can you see it? Acknowledge it? Okay. Breathe with it. Make space for it. And don't let it take the whole space. Don't let it suck the air out of the room. We can be here, yeah. Thank you for trying to warn me. Thank you for trying to protect me, dear fear. Yes, I see you. Okay. Okay. You be here too. And there's also wholesome intention, et cetera, et cetera. Let it have a seat on the table, but not the megaphone. So that's what I would say, Sridhavi, and see that in your own practice, how that works. So thank you all. Thank you so much for your practice. Thank you for letting your light shine, cultivating your sun and letting it shine and making space for, kind space for what there already is in this heart and mind. May we all wake up. May we be happy and support all beings in their happiness and waking up through our practice. Thanks everyone. Be well. See you on Wednesday.
