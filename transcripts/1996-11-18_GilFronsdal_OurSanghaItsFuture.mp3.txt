 Maybe slightly different than a normal Dharma talk. It's more about the Sangha here and our development. We had, during the last week, we filed papers for non-profit status as a religious organization. So the Mint Peninsula Insight Meditation Center will now be a, will have, at some point, I don't know how long the paperwork takes, non-profit status. And it's a small step, but a very significant one in the development of our Sanghas, or development of our religious community here. And so I want to talk a little bit about that and talk about what it means for our Sangha to grow and develop, which it has a lot since the years I've been involved. Interestingly enough, the Sangha, this sitting group, started over ten years ago, I think, in Menla Park at the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology. And the first teacher was Howie Cohen, who's coming down next Monday. So he drove down from San Francisco every Monday and took care of it for a number of years until his schedule didn't allow for it anymore. And then for a few years it was without a teacher, but had a wonderful man and his wife, Howard and Ingrid Nudelman, who were the mentors of the group. And then in 1990 Howard could no longer do it, and I was invited, I was asked to come and be the teacher for the group. And it's grown then from twelve, there were about twelve people in 1990 when I started. And what's kind of very happy, I think, is that a lot of those people, those twelve, are still around. At least half of them, I can easily count, and probably more. And a very stable group and committed people. So the development of the Sangha, and traditionally in Buddhism there are considered to be three important supports for Buddhist practice. And that's known as a triple refuge, the support of the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. And what often happens in Buddhist circles, I think almost everywhere, but certainly in America, is that the Buddha and the Dharma often get emphasized, and the Sangha gets de-emphasized, or not de-emphasized, but doesn't get as much press as the first two. And the importance of Sangha, the importance of religious community of fellow practitioners, is considered to be equal on par with these other two, the Buddha and the Dharma. And in fact they're considered to be three legs of a tripod supporting the practice. And I understand that a healthy spirituality, a healthy Buddhist spirituality, involves having a healthy balance of these three aspects. And the Buddha means many things, but the Buddha is the inner experience, the inner state, the inner possibility of being awake, of being present, of being compassionate. The Dharma is many things again, it's the simplest definition is the teaching, the teaching which supports that inner awakening and compassion and love. But it also is, one of the definitions of Dharma is nature, it's the nature we find ourselves, the nature of reality itself. And the Sangha is the people we practice with, fellow practitioners. And one of the things I love about the definition of Sangha is that by defining it as fellow practitioners, it's a very porous and loosely bounded community. The Sangha doesn't have an institutional identity, it never is supposed to have an institutional identity. It's not like, this is your Sangha, this is it. Many of us say this is our Sangha, but then where's the limits of the Sangha? Well, it's very porous and open, there is no, we don't have an institutional identity, it's really like membership and really solid thing. And I think that's true for all Buddhist groups, is that the Sangha is a porous and loose body of people, that is shared, people who share a common intention and practice of awakening, of presence, of compassion and love. And so I like that, because it's an informal definition, which allows for a certain kind of informality of coming and going, that people can come and go in and out of the Sangha without any barriers, either in or out. And I feel that's the way we are as a Sangha here in Palo Alto. I feel we're an informal group, relatively open doors, and people wander in and wander out. And even though informal, one of the things that's been very gratifying for me over the years that I've been here, is how much a sense of community has arisen in the people who have come here regularly. And it varies a lot from person to person, how connected they feel. We don't have a lot of organized ways of helping people get connected, but just being around each other. A lot of people, a lot of friendships are developed here, a lot of connections. And it's been very kind of, for me, a very happy thing to have watched. Sometimes I've seen some of you kind of becoming friends and doing things together, and I say, what about me? I sit up here all alone, you know. It's very lonely, you know. Not really. But anyway, it's very gratifying to see the sense of connectedness I see in the room that happens slowly. Probably more slowly than maybe it should be, because it's kind of hard, I think, to come in as a stranger into a group you don't know. But if those of you who are new, I think we should of course be more welcoming and have ways of making more connection, but we don't have a lot. But it just happens, just being together, practicing together. Now the balance between the Buddha, Dharma, and the Sangha is also a balance between individual needs and community needs, or community involvement. And this is one of the great tensions in many people's lives between solitude or individuality and community and connectedness with others. And for some people, it's a tension, those two. And depending on how they look at it any particular day, some people who are completely frightened of organized religion of any form, because really what's important is their own practice, their own independent awakening and freedom, and they don't want to get tied up in anything. And other people who feel what actually what's important is the community connection, the relationship, that maybe doesn't make any sense to talk about freedom and awakening, unless you're also talking about being connected in community. And without connection in community, freedom maybe doesn't really even exist. Even though in American culture the idea is freedom means you're out, you know, you're pwning on the plains by yourself under the stars, and no one miles around. You can do whatever you want. In Zen Buddhism there's this beautiful poem, a title of which is called, The Merging of Difference and Unity. And rather than setting up a tension between difference or duality or separation and unity or connectedness, or rather than falling into one camp or the other saying what's important is unity, or what's important is difference in diversity, what's important is cosmic oneness, what's important is duality of the sacred and the profane, all kinds of different ways that people fall down in this equation. The Zen poem points at the merging of the two, how do we bring these two together so that they coexist in a balanced and healthy way, the difference in unity, solitude and community. The Sangha is a community of practitioners that supports, encourage us in our practice, and I know that from my own experience, and I think from many people, it's very hard to sustain a serious spiritual practice alone, either to keep the momentum going, the inspiration going, or to be willing to overcome or deal with or stay present for, hang out long enough to go through some of the difficulties and demons that might arise in a spiritual practice. And having a community is a support and encouragement. And in the six years now that I've been here, I feel very, you know, I'm the teacher in some sense, but who is the teacher after all? I feel very encouraged and inspired by all of you who I sit with, and the fact that many of you come regularly and have a real commitment to practice, encourages and inspires me and my commitment to practice. And it probably goes around in circles, you know, and hopefully I can be somewhat of an inspiration and encouragement to you. I think that's part of the role of a teacher, but then also I receive it back. And Sangha is also a community of people that in some ways mirrors us in maybe healthy ways. My first inspiration to go live or be with the Buddhist community was when I noticed that when I sat in meditation, a lot of the usual head trips, usual ego trips that I had, kind of quieted down for a while, and I felt kind of integrity or kind of peace that didn't involve all my ego trips and who I wanted to be and presented myself to, how I wanted to present myself to other people. And I could see the difference between my meditation experience with myself and how I was in relationship with other people where all my old trips came back. And I didn't like the difference. I wanted to find a way to have that integrity in my daily life also. And I noticed when I went to the San Francisco Zen Center to visit that people there didn't want to play those games with me, that I was used to playing with my friends. And in meeting them they were much mirror for me. I would act out, you know, and nothing happened. They didn't play the game. You know, they weren't playing that game. So suddenly it was kind of bewildering. And it felt, and I wanted to be around people who mirrored that for me because I didn't want to live those old games anymore. I wanted to have them shown to me. But many things are mirrored in any kind of community, but certainly spiritual community. Not only our trips, but also our beauty and our potential for love and compassion and presence. Asanga is one of the three refuges. It's a place to go for refuge, for support. And again, as I said, I think it's impossible to really do this kind of spiritual practice alone. Buddhist dogma, whatever that's worth, teaches that unless you're a Buddha, it's impossible to do this path, this practice alone without the support of others. The manifestation of practice, as people become more mindful, more open-hearted, more present, less judgmental, less comparative in their relationship to other people, the tendency is for there to arise increasing amounts of compassion and sense of connectedness with others. And then it's very useful to have a community of people who not only support you in practice, but then give you an outlet, a place to meet in that open-heartedness, to meet in that connection. And I think that sometimes it's very hard in wider society to have, you know, to explore new ways of being, new sense of open-heartedness, trustfulness, of honesty, non-defensiveness. It's very hard to experiment with these ways out there in some areas in our society where people don't understand those ways of being. And so to come to a community where you can experiment with new ways. And one of the ways I practiced in Sangha in community in my early years of practice was I understood that the Buddhist Sanghas were incredibly forgiving. That's kind of the point. The Buddhist Sangha is a place where people are practicing with each other, which means that we're kind of supposed to be honest, we're supposed to be working with the difficulty, the resentments, the projections, the ideas that are going on. But more important, we're willing to hang out with each other. If there's conflict and difficulty, we're willing to hang out and not turn our backs to someone. So I kind of got a sense of all that. So I started experimenting when I first started hanging out with the Zen community, because I didn't know how to really be in relationship to other people in this new mode of being, coming from this integrity, coming in a way that didn't have all these trips involved. And so I experimented, which I tried for a while being really silent and not speaking to anyone. And it was a safe community to do it in, because they were so forgiving. And it was okay. If a week later I came and started speaking and didn't stop speaking, well, they would forget the fact that I was silent for a week and it wouldn't hold it against me. And I would try that. Sometimes I spoke all the time. I remember once working at the Greens restaurant. I was one of the cooks. And dinner was being served incredibly fast. There's all these waiters and waitresses and all these bus boys and bus girls, bus people who were coming going by. And I tried experiments of having a continuous conversation with all of them. Everyone had passed by me. And I tried to remember each conversation, because they were always coming and going. I don't remember where the conversation is left off and I pick it up. And it was a tremendous game, you know, of conversation and keeping the ball going. So anyway, part of what Asanga allows a person is a place to experiment with being different than how you normally be at work or in your normal social scenes. Asanga and Palo Alto, as I said, started 10 years ago by Howard Ingrid Nudelman at the ITP. And Howard then in 1990 or so was diagnosed with cancer. And so part of the history of this community is that one of the main people then died of cancer. And it was very moving for many of us and painful. And but I don't know, but it was the same time because he was no longer able to be the mentor. And they wanted someone to kind of lead it or be a teacher for it. And that was exactly the same time I was going to start school at Stanford. It was kind of coincided almost exactly by the week. He called me up and asked if I would come down and be a teacher. And I came and for many years I felt very shy about my role as a teacher. And I would try to call myself a mentor, call myself something different, or try to really try not to take a leadership role, but really kind of listen to what the community wanted, what Asanga wanted and try to be responsive. Because I thought I was invited. I'd been invited in. But as the community grew and grew, it became increasingly awkward and cumbersome for me to maintain that kind of stance or position that I wasn't exactly a teacher, I wasn't exactly the leader. And so I feel now that over these five, six years that in some ways I have become a teacher and I have become a leader of sorts. But what that means, we're all working out together. But I'm not so shy exactly as I used to be around at least those kinds of names. What it means I'm shy about still. But that's what I feel what the whole situation has asked of all of us. And if you have different ideas, I'd like to hear it. So in 1990 I started, there were twelve of us, and it just slowly, steadily grew. And as we grew, there became new needs for the community, our new desires for doing more practice, more things together. And one of the first needs was the need to offer beginners instruction. Because the people who came just came, they knew how to practice and new people would come and they didn't know I have a clue what to do. So I started offering beginning instructions. And that was kind of the next kind of expansion of sorts. And then there was a desire or perhaps the need, the possibility of doing one day retreats. So then we started doing one day retreats. And also we did, back then we did for a while for about a year, we did half day retreats periodically. And those were very nice. So we started doing kind of retreats for a while. Or we still do one day retreats. But we used to do maybe two, three, four times a year. And now we do it almost every month we do a one day retreat. And then there were occasional poth looks, kind of get togethers that we had. And then we grew and grew. And I was so in awe and amazed. Wow, there were twenty people who would come to this stuff. It's just like, wow, we've really grown a lot. And then it got to be thirty, oh Jesus, and thirty-five. And then the room got really tight. And sometimes it was so crowded that basically I felt like I was giving a Dharma talk to the person sitting in front of me. Two feet away or someone's facing me. That's the person I stopped to. Because they were facing face to face. And we got really crowded and full. And then Greg, who's a friend who belongs to the Quakers here, he sits with us. And because he was a friend he knew about this room. And he suggested that we move over here. And so we did. And the same week that we moved over here we jumped from something like forty people to sixty people. Somehow the news of the move just kind of generated all this interest. So we were all kind of amazed. Like where did all these people come from? Three years ago. And then we started doing monthly potlucks because we felt the need for more community and connection. And then some people felt the need for more chance to discuss and hang out with each other in a more darmic way. So I think it was Foster who started the book club which still continues. And then there were some attempts to try sitting groups, sitting times at other evenings, Wednesday and Thursday. And there were some other kind of sitting groups that kind of spawned off from this one, small ones that I think continue to this day. And then Monday started getting too full. And in the introductory course I would do Mondays from six forty five to seven thirty. But then all the beginners would be here at seven thirty when all of you came. And it looked like it was going to get out of hand. Because we've got more and more people coming from the beginning course. So we moved the beginning course to Thursday. And so I could do more thorough a job because now instead of forty five minutes we have an hour and a half for beginner instructions. But then once we had the beginning instructions going, we kind of just continue having beginners evenings on Thursdays and take some of the pressure off Monday. And so that's been worked very well for a long time. But we keep growing on Monday and Thursday keeps growing. And we've had this introductory course, I think there were eighty people the first night. And seventy I think the second which was Thanksgiving or something anyway. And then ninety the third and then seventy again the last night. And it goes out, I don't know why it changes the way it does. But anyway a lot of people. We should be glad they don't come on Mondays. And so and then we do then we started the weekend retreats for ourselves up in Jokoji, which we do. Usually we do. We try to do it twice a year, Memorial Day and some weekend in August. And then we did a senior student series for a year, which is a good idea to continue. But we're not doing it right now. And then we did for a while and we'll start up again at some point, we did the happy hour, which is we did in the afternoon five thirty six thirty. We did a gathering for doing loving kindness meditation, which was very important for us because it's very important for some people to do loving kindness meditation. There are some people for my think it's actually a more suited suitable practice than mindfulness practice. And I feel like the lack that we don't offer it again. But we will at some point. And then we do yoga now twice a week, twice a month. And now the idea is maybe to try doing a children's program once a month. And and you know, there's all these there's a lot of requests, a lot of ideas that people have because it's natural. I think as a community grows and as people invest more of their life in the practice, they wanted to include more of their life as part of the practice. They want to include more of their life and they want to go deeper and do more, more deeper kind of practice, more deeper study and involvement. And so I'm sitting here both receiving the requests from people and trying to respond. And also part of the role of a teacher is to have some sense of what the potential, the possibility of the students are, the practitioners are. And so in a very gentle way, allow for the kind of open or kind of provide for those opportunities to allow that potential to to to grow. So, for example, offering one day sittings, offering longer retreats. I feel like a lot of people here were ready for doing one day sittings. And so I didn't tell anybody you should do it, but we just offered it. And when you when you're ready, you come and do one day sittings. So I see there's a lot of potential for us to go deeper and be more involved. And so and I get a lot of requests. So how do we respond to that? There's more things we want to do. Part of the problem we have is we don't have space to do it in the friends have been extremely generous hosts letting us use this room as often as we do. But they get other requests from other groups now more and more. And we've been told that basically we can't use it much more than we already, which is probably more than they use it. So we can imagine they get a little bit nervous. And and finding other places of doing one day sittings or other kind of special workshops or retreats has been very hard and they're expensive and and finding suitable places. And Alison has done tremendous amount of work looking for places we can use. And she's kind of canonist all of Palo Alto, I think. And I've looked at various places. So what the sense I have of us is that we've kind of we've outgrown our shoes, but we can't do don't have new shoes yet to step into. So we're kind of cramped is the feeling. And maybe many of you don't feel it because it seems like a nice thing to come Monday and we sit together nicely and it's a little bit crowded. But but I feel it much more because of the position I sit in as a teacher because I hear the requests. I talked to a lot of you. I see the potential and the need. And also because I have a wonderful vision, which I hold. And I see there's a tremendous opportunity here in the mid peninsula for doing a lot more than we already do. There's a lot of like postna students, let alone Buddhist students in his area for whom there's a lot more activities we could do. We can be done that would support their practice. And I would like I have this vision, this dream of being able to offer that and set up something here very solid and stable that can really take advantage both of the opportunity and of the need and the possibility here in this area for making a very strong, viable center of Buddhist practice in this area. So. So two years ago, I was beginning to feel that I was doing more and more as a teacher and it was becoming more and more of my of my my what I did most of the time, just take care of the Sangha. And I didn't want to want for me to keep doing things and commit more of my life and make a decision that this is where I'm going to put the primary focus of my life and my livelihood into this kind of situation here, which is rather unconventional without the community being conscious of it. You know, if the community as a group was unconscious of the developments in my kind of choices and involvements, I felt a little bit funny about that. So we had a meeting. Anybody who was invited to could come to at Lillane's house and some 25 people came. So and we discussed the different ideas people had about the future for the Sangha and visions and stuff. And some people miss the old days when we were really small and intimate. Some people wanted us to see us develop and arrange and they asked me for my vision. And I told them I was reluctant to tell them my vision because I didn't see my I felt I was reluctant to kind of bring out my vision because I thought maybe my job was more to listen and then respond to the request rather than put out a big vision, which is easy to be visionary to dream. So I, they asked me and so I told them and which involved having a center, our own property for ourselves, a place where we can do as many much activities we want without having to ask for permission and requests and schedule problems with other people. And then it was realized in order to do that, we had to incorporate as a nonprofit. And so a group of people started that process and I was feeling still that I really wanted the community to come together and organize itself in a sense. So I stayed out of those meetings for a long time for incorporating kind of coming up with bylaws and stuff. And then at some point I was invited in, I came and joined the meetings and it was very difficult actually for group people to decide on bylaws and how to organize themselves. And we spent basically two years working out the process and not always so successfully a group process. I apologize and somewhat sad to say. We did our, we did, everybody did their very best and the end result is now that we did the simplest way we could do it. Kind of we streamlined the whole process in the simplest possible way. We kind of came up with bylaws and sent in papers to the government for filing. And how I understand this nonprofit status that we now formed is that it's equivalent of acquiring the Buddhist alms bowl. In Asia the Buddhist monks grew up on alms and their sustenance, their life, their sustenance for life came from what was given to them in their bowl. And in America the equivalent of that in some ways of institution is this nonprofit status. And once we have that bowl in place something can happen. We're available for something to happen. Without that status we're not available for something to happen of any kind of serious degree. And you know the story of Ajahn Sumedho in England? Ajahn Sumedho was a Californian who went to UC Berkeley. In the mid-sixties he went to Thailand and became a Theravadan Buddhist monk. And then in the late seventies he moved to England, to London to be a teacher there. And he was a forest monk and forest monks every morning go out for the alms rounds with their begging bowl. And no one in London knew, had a clue what this guy was about, you know, an orange robe and this big bowl and shaved head. But he had to go out in his alms anyway. And occasionally someone would know or they'd stop and ask him or something. One day this guy was jogging by or biking by and he stopped and says, who are you and what's your story, what's going on here? And Ajahn Sumedho explained to him that he was a Buddhist monk and it's a custom of Buddhist monks to go out every day to collect whatever food that people want to give them so they could have food for that day. And that's what he was doing. And the fellow said, oh, so you're a forest monk. Can I put a forest in your bowl? And he had been given or he had this big forest someplace outside of London that he didn't particularly want anymore. He had to eat it all, that's it. He had to eat it all. And so, and so I suppose that Ajahn Sumedho went through the paperwork and got a nonprofit status in England and probably the equivalent to what we have to do here. And then they were given this so forest, which then I think they sold it pretty quickly because for another property nearby that was more suited. But that was how that just a stranger just came up. Somebody didn't even know about Buddhism. Here you go. And so we have now the status. We will have it shortly. So who knows what will come into the baking bowl. I have a tremendous. What? A big bowl. And when I think of what we have to offer our community here, I think that it needs to should happen. It's tremendously wonderful and healthy and useful and important thing to happen. And to be able to have a Buddhist community meditation center for this community here, I think it was a great offering. And it should happen. I believe in that. But when I think about the price in Palo Alto for such a thing, then I get discouraged because the price around here is phenomenally expensive. So I don't know how it's going to happen. My faith is that it'll happen in within 20 years. But I don't want to wait 20 years. That's too long. Yes. I've thought of it a little bit and I've thought of it and look into it a little bit and I'll do it more. But still the problem is usually going to some other people's space. We're limited what we can do because they're using it also. So part of my vision is to have a community meditation center that allows us to have a regular schedule of meditation sessions in the morning, maybe the afternoon. A place where we can do evening classes like this, maybe even like a Sunday morning thing, which they do at some places, which is very nice. More classes during the week of other various kinds that other people can teach besides me. Other kinds of events, weekend retreats, maybe longer retreats, maybe small retreats of 20 people, but for maybe 10 days. To have all those things coexist in some healthy way for this community and create a sacred space. I believe our society has a great need for sacred space because of the great pain, the suffering and fragmentation and violence that exists in many parts of our culture. In a corporate culture, wherever. And I think Silicon Valley needs a contemplative place in the middle of this kind of valley. It's a balance, it's a place to go, a refuge if nothing else. As a reminder of another way of living, another way of other kinds of values that's so easy to forget when we're busy, busy, interactive lives. There's a title of a book edited by Thich Nhat Hanh about Buddhist precepts. It's an anthology of different writers. The title is called For a Future to be Possible. I think it's a beautiful title. When we teach mindfulness meditation in Buddhism, we tend to focus a lot on here and now, paying attention to being in the present moment. But I think part of being in the present moment, the deep present moment, is to actually have a relationship to the past and the future. It doesn't involve getting lost in it, but to really understanding it well. Part of understanding the future is to see our connection to the future and understand that in order for the spiritual practice, for Buddhist practice, for Buddhism, to continue, we have to pass it on to the next generations. We can't just simply practice for ourselves in our own little practice and just be quiet. It requires the Sangha itself to take responsibility for the continuity and the development. Part of this vision then is for a future to be possible, for a future for us, for our community and many generations to come. I don't know how this is going to happen, but this is one of the beginnings or a very important milestone for us. The function of such a vision, we have a vision statement, which was very beautifully done up. And as soon as we finish, maybe you can put half of them out of the door and half of them can stay here. And anybody who wants a copy of the vision statement can read it. But it's written here that this community's meditation center that I would like, that we would like to have, is supposed to have three intertwining functions. To provide a simple and quiet environment where the contemplative life can be developed and protected amidst the complexities of city living. To offer those teachings, practices and practice opportunities which complement insight meditation in supporting a balanced spiritual life from a Buddhist perspective. To be a place where people can come together to cultivate and express their practice in and through their family, social and community life. And then it just has more here. So I don't know what the next step should be. And that's the question for me, what to do next in terms of this. So how is it for you all to hear all this? What do you have to say besides that? Isn't the next step to put out the ball? To solicit contributions to fund nonprofits? I suppose that's one of the next steps, is to somehow do fundraising. One of the things I'm concerned about is the exhaustion that can come from fundraising. And I've kind of vowed, maybe more to myself than anyone, that whatever way all this happens, it has to happen hopefully in a way that none of us gets exhausted. That we keep our inspiration, it comes from a sense of surplus, a sense of abundance from us rather than a sense of tiring us out. I've seen many groups get really tired because of the strain for fundraising. So maybe it means it's slow, the process. Or maybe it means it's fast. I mean, what happens if we suddenly found a place, the perfect place, and it was from the market and we had to just raise something in three months. Or maybe we do it suddenly. I don't know. Galvanizing around something sometimes raises more money than amorphous fundraising for something in the future. But I don't know how it's going to be. I guess probably it's going to be amorphous or maybe a combination of it. I don't know what's going to come in the bowl, you see. It could be a forest. Some of you might have a forest somewhere. Some of you might, you know, or some of you have... My nose. And for me it's a little scary. Sorry? For me this is a little scary because I come here basically to get away from these things. Yeah. Not quiet down, just good. And suddenly there's this movement there now. Yes. Like I would have joined a political group. I could. Yes. I think your sentiments are very important for me. And I have a lot of trepidation or apprehension about this project also. And one of them is that I was actually reluctant to talk to all of the groups. You spend Monday evening talking about this. Because I feel like Monday evening is kind of special and sacred and we should just keep it, you know, really in the simple thing we do of sitting in a Dharma talk. And I didn't know if a lot of you would even want to hear about this kind of stuff. But I felt the responsibility and also felt it was important at least to present at this point what we're doing. And what I hope very much is that people will come like you and find a place to support you in what you want here. And not feel at all like you're being pulled into something you don't want to be part of. And you find it's a refuge, a place you can sit, and that there's not a lot of this, you know, busy fundraising activity or pressure, all these things you might expect. I want the porous and simple informal feeling to continue throughout whatever we develop. Where anybody feels they can come, they can get nurtured and they can go home without any pressure or demands on them. So what happens as we develop arises from within each of us as our inspiration rather than the group, pressure, whatever. Quite the process is really, you know, very valuable to look at in those terms because they have been for worship and being for business. And they're conducted in exactly the same spirit but they have two different purposes and you can attend only one or both. That's the way of reflecting that separate... And something like that will do. And one of the ideas I had was at some point in a few months, maybe in January, we could have a meeting some other night of the week, maybe a Sunday evening or something, and invite anybody who wants to come and to talk about what the next steps might be. And for the people who want to be part of this in whatever way, both in terms of the conversation and in terms of doing something. There's been a lot of people involved already. There's a current... There's a current people involved in the last stage of the process, kind of the final signing the documents and coming to the last meetings. There's about maybe how many? Seven, eight people? And not all of them are here. But I think it'd be okay, I didn't ask any of them if I could do this, but maybe a few of them. Maybe you can just stand for a moment. And if any of you want to talk to people who are kind of on the board or kind of involved with organizing so far, you could talk to them and tell them your fears and your inspirations because rather than, you know, I don't know if... I'm not a... It's difficult if all the focus is on me. So, you mind doing that maybe Elizabeth and just Bernice and Marty? Is Marty here? A lot of people are here today, Cheryl and Bernice and Elizabeth and who else? They're all not here today. All this hard work and Richard and Bill and Steve. Anything else? Yes. I share the appreciation for this place, a place without my practice, increasing importance of people here in Asanda. I share the excitement about the idea. And one concern that I have, similar to that, is just that hearing the word religion pop up repeatedly tonight, who were at really pretty much when you talk, is not overused. And that word together was an organizational structure. You know, bylaws and officers and all that. That's... Those particular combination of things may be uncomfortable, so I bring that up and appreciate yours and people's... Awareness at the core... the corestness of this. The same way she expressed exactly my strength. Great. Yes, Jean? I just want to say that the thing that I think was important for me is that it was maybe... Maybe I heard it before, but it's back in the times that when you said that you wanted the group to be conscious of the choices you were making as you were increasing your level of commitment by... ...shooting to spend more time on... ...the idea. I find it's important that the price of this group will pay with all the complexity that will come with all of this... ...long list of things. I'm very concerned about these issues too, and I'm committed to trying to find a way to do it that can keep... In the spirit that we've had already, can you that? And that'll be part of the trick. But you know, my sense is that... My understanding is that all groups have group process and phases they go through. And it's inevitable. You can't expect the group to stay static. And even if we want it to be that way. And so... And groups evolve through stages which sometimes... There's a lot of people talking about the honeymoon stage. There's a honeymoon stage and there's difficulty stage and there's stability stage. There's all kinds of stages they go through like any kind of relationship. But... I myself don't know how to avoid... Change in this context. Something has to happen. I mean there's many directions that something can take. But something has to happen. One of my motivations for this is that I feel very responsible to all of you. And I would like to see something here that not only lasts into the future but it takes... It offers something in a responsible way for all the commitment and interest that you all have. If you just continue the way we're on Calpra Street, you just continue in a small way. I don't know if it's sustainable. I don't know if it's sustainable for me. You know, in that way. I don't know if it's sustainable with all the pressure I feel. All the people who want something a little bit different and want something more and everything. So... And I feel actually sometimes a lot of pressure from many different directions including within me for change. Change has to happen. One of the changes that happens with groups, the fifth stage according to some people of five stages of group development, is either growth or disbandment. And that's a possibility. That's actually one of the possibilities. If we stay exactly the same, I don't know if I would stay for years and years. But however long I stay, the bigger we become, the more commitment I make to staying. But also at some point I will leave or I'll die or something will happen, right? To me? And I feel that I want to get it large enough so that two things can happen. One is large enough so we can invite in another teacher to teach with me. Because I think it's very healthy for us to have at least two teachers. And so there isn't just all this focus on one person. And so that one person... So also there's a team teaching and they support each other. And so we can large enough so we can support two teachers. And then large enough so that if something happens to me, that it becomes a place that some other teacher either can grow up out of the sun or another teacher we can invite in. But if we just stayed to twelve people or stayed forty people or stayed sixty people, we'll stay where we are right now. I think it's very hard for me to cast out across America for all the different Dharma teachers floating around and happen to find one who is willing to move to Palo Alto. But if we have more of an established... And I hope that as we go through this, that if at any point anybody is uncomfortable with anything, that part of what a Sangha means is a place where you should feel safe to say you're uncomfortable. If you don't feel like you can say you're uncomfortable either to me directly or to someone else who's kind of in the Sangha or to the whole group, then you probably shouldn't stay in the Sangha. Actually you should go away. Or figure out some way you can say it. Or find something. Don't stay in this group with feelings of discomfort without saying it. And if we can state that, then hopefully whatever way we develop can be respectful for everyone and we can do it in a healthy way. So I'll end with, if I may, a quote by Scott Peck, who wrote a book on community. A healthy organization, whether a marriage, a family or a business corporation, is not one with an absence of problems, but one that is actively and effectively addressing or healing its problems. I think that's probably a more realistic attitude. After all, the first noble truth, right? So those of you who want to just check out what the vision statement is, you can either pick it up at the back door or there's some up here. And I hope that this is inspiring for enough of you. And I hope enough of you share also my fright.
