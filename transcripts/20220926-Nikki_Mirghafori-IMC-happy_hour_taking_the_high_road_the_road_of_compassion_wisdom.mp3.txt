 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. Okay. All right. Hi. Hi. And welcome to this edition of Happy Hour. So for today's practice, I wanted to bring in a couple of different themes, but I think the lead, the way I would lead into it, or the title I would give to this practice session is choosing the high road, choosing the high road, choosing the road of kindness and compassion, choosing the high road. We live in a world. We live in a world where we interact with people. It's part of being human. It's a wonderful part of being human, all these interactions. And of course, some interactions sometimes can be challenging interactions or difficult interactions or surprising interactions. And we always have a choice. We always have a choice with every interaction, whether it's challenging, whether it's actually easeful, whether it's loving, whether it's neutral, all the interactions we have, we have a choice. We have the choice of, for the sake of today's practice, the high road or not the high road, the low road. And the high road here is the road of compassion, the road of care, the road of goodwill, the road of wisdom also. I definitely want to bring that in because compassion and kindness without wisdom can become idiot compassion, especially I love this term from the Tibetan tradition. We can be cuddling too much if we're cuddling. But the high road is one of wisdom, compassion, and sense of integrity, really a sense of integrity in our actions so that when we look back at our lives at the very end, we have a sense that we tried with every interaction as best as we were able to. And maybe not every interaction. It went flowingly well. But at least we tried as best as we were able to, to take the high road, to take the high road, the road of wisdom, compassion, care. Even if it went terribly bad, terribly wrong at the end, but at least we tried. At least we had the intentions. So I want to bring another aspect in here, and that is with respect to the difficult and challenging interactions that can arise. Sometimes it's easy to respond from a place of reactivity. It's so easy to respond from a place of reactivity and to take our time to sit, to really literally sit or do what is needed to take the time to respond with compassion, with wisdom, and not just responding, but also responding to what comes, even if it's a challenging interaction. But also another thing I want to add is sometimes, or actually all the time, it's important to be important that we don't just kind of stuff our pain down. Like, oh yeah, I'm going to take the high road and I'm just going to be wise and compassionate and then continue to stew, continue to stew. And maybe I'll show up in other ways. So that's not exactly the high road, but for the sake of our own heart, we also, if there is a pain that is left over or hurt, we need to honor that, work with that, acknowledge that, or sometimes maybe the right response is to bless it. The right response is to bless it. So what the heck do I mean by that? So I want to give you an example. And when we give Dharma talks and Dharmas, we use ourselves as an example. So I'll give a story. So I received a text that was very surprising to me from someone. And it was surprising and also hurtful. And the way I interpreted it actually was that this person was in so much pain, in so much suffering that they were saying that and yet they were pointing fingers because there was so much pain. So when I received this text in the morning, there was a sense of, oh, I need to write. This is what's going, you know, this is, wasn't the intention, this is what's going on. And I thought, wait, wait, no, no, you need to sit with this. Don't don't respond right away. I actually did a little bit of yoga. I sat and later I thought, no, this is not the kind of the place this person clearly is right now is that they're hurting so much. Things are so hard. That reason, just a case of reason and explanation is not exactly what's needed just to send goodwill, just to send goodwill. I wish you well. May you be well. May this, may you be well. And what I decided was that no explanation is needed because explanation is like, ah, ah, it gets to more explanation. It's like, ah, but they're in a place that they're really, really hurting, really, really hurting. So, so after a couple of hours, I decided, okay, just send goodwill and there was still react, they would react to it, but just let, let, let, you know, sending goodwill taking the high road of wisdom, compassion. And then I realized, oh, there was still this hurt for me that, okay, I, something was called out that just didn't feel justified. Didn't feel right. Didn't feel appropriate. And right now doesn't feel like the right time to point this out to this person. So, so sitting with this hurt and I don't want to stuff it and, and, and act out of it later. And this, this idea of blessing this hurt. Oh yeah. It's it's, um, there is care. There is care for this person. There's care there in this relationship to see, to see the goodness, to see the, and the, perhaps the divinity in this, in this hurt even that has come from a sense of care. So blessing, yes. Seeing the goodness. Um, maybe I can unpack that little, little more in the guided meditation, but, uh, that's what I mean. That's the intention for this meditation today and this, this Dharmet. So, so I'm going to, to pause with the Dharmet because I think I've said plenty to set the stage. So let's just practice together. Let's practice together. So, so I invite you to let go of all the thoughts and reflections and thinking and history and cases where you took the high road or the low road or let go. This is now the time to enter your meditation posture. Let's practice together. Ah, arrive, arrive in your seat. Arrive in your seat here. Arrive here. This moment is an opportunity to ground yourself on your body and your heart and to sit, to open up. Let go of thinking. Let go of analyzing. Let go of the past stories where you're the protagonist. You're the protagonist in this book of life. The main character of your own story. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Connecting with the breath. Each breath in the body. Breathing in. Being breathed in, being breathed out. Letting go. Letting go. Letting go of the body, letting go of the stories. Just this breath. This breath, emptying, cleansing, calming, soothing.. Inviting with each breath, in breath, inviting your own goodness. To rest in your heart. To rest in your goodness. Your intention for kindness. And well wisdom. Just this breath in this body. Grounded, stable. With each breath opening to more goodness. Each space, each breath opens more space in your heart. To rest. To rest. To rest. To rest. resting in your heart for a few minutes. No agenda, no past, no present, no future. Even letting go of the present, not holding on too tightly to this moment. Ah, maybe more space opens up when I say that. A spaciousness of infinity, when even the present is not gone too. You are not alone. Just this in-breath in the abdomen, just this out-breath. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Come on, come on. Take a moment. Take a minute. Wait a minute. Just this breath. The continuity of being breathed in, breathed out with care. Breathe out with care. Each breath calming, soothing, grounding. Breathe out with care. Breathe out with care. Breathe out with care. Breathe out with care. Breathe out with care. Breathe out with care. Breathe out with care. Breathe in with care. Breathe in with care. you can proceed to experiment with the invitations. Feeling grounded in your body, in your breath, not in your head but breathing your body and your heart. Stable. Spacious. You can invite if you like. Some recent interaction. That wasn't too challenging. Please don't go for the most challenging interaction. Please don't. Maybe even a neutral interaction with someone. Or maybe it's still in progress. It's in process. And feel into what the high road, the response and action, a reaction of integrity, kindness, wisdom, goodwill. What does it feel like in your body? Not to think about what to do. Don't think about that. Feel into the relational field with this being. Could be a neutral interaction or even a kind one, a positive one. In your body, what does the response of goodwill, kindness, generosity, feeling their humanity for a moment, the common humanity, what they're going through right now. If you could put yourself in their shoes, their circumstances. For a moment, see the world through their eyes. It is not easy to be them right now. Every human has their challenges. Thank you. Thank you. If you were in their shoes, how would you want, how would you hope people would treat you? Kindness, compassion, generosity, understanding. Coming back to your own perspective. Can you just feel into, not into actions or what to say or what to do, but into your own goodness, into your own kindness, generosity, wisdom. Just breathing, breathing into it. Not thinking, just breathing, trusting it's there. And offering in your heart's mind. Just as if a dear friend, someone you care about was going on a long trip and you wanted to give them a gift, a small gift token to take with them. As protection, thought, caring your thoughts, goodwill. And say you would hold that gift in your hands and in your heart, your mind, you would bless it with all your good intentions for this person. All you care, all your love, this object. Being blessed by your good intentions before it's given to your friend going on the long journey. The same way, this interaction that we've been sitting with, consider a gift of kindness, not a physical gift, but in your heart. A goodwill, something, an empty infinite box of goodwill that you offer that's blessed with your kindness, blessed with your goodness, with your good intentions. Of course, this imaginary box is empty. There's a sense of goodwill, kindness. You realize in the process of giving this gift blessing and giving this gift, do you feel blessed to? Recognizing your own goodness, your own capacity to be expansive, your best self. You are the one who gives you the gift. You are the one who gives you the gift. And just in case there's still any hurt or difficult feelings left from this interaction, this too can be blessed, held with care, with goodwill, and offered, offered up. And the altar of your humanity. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We don't have to carry all the hurts like rocks and bricks in our sack, making us heavier and heavier. When feeling ready, each rock could be blessed. Touched with intentionality, heart, goodwill, goodness. Let go of, offered up, placed on the altar of humanity. So many hurts, part of our human condition. To both benefit each other, hurt each other, not unique. So maybe this rock too could be blessed and left, offered up. If the time is ready. And as we bring the sitting to a place where we are ready, when we are ready, may all the rocks be released. May all beings including ourselves. Thanks everyone. Thanks for your practice. So we have a few minutes for reflections, questions, comments, complaints. It's all welcome. Especially if you haven't spoken in a while, I'd like to welcome you to share your experience. Maybe an aha moment. Eric, please. Thanks, Nikki. I just wanted to offer up a joke I made yesterday about the effort of taking the high road. My wife had mentioned a person with a bow down. She said, don't you find them so annoying? I said, I'm trying to dislike people less, but they make it so hard. Oh, yeah, it's you know, it's so interesting. One thing that comes up for me in situations like that is I have this usual reflection, this reflection that gosh, I get to interact with this person. I don't know, one wants to blue moon or one hour a week or whatever it is, or five hours a week or whatever it is, right? I get to interact with them this limited amount of time. Whereas this person gets to be in that mind and that heart, they get to be them 24 hours a day. Oh, I could have been born as them. I could have been born as them. It's so random, right? Our causes and conditions of who we end up being. So I offer that reflection. This is what I tried to bring in like, oh my goodness, this must be so hard. Must be so hard for them. So and it's not pity and it's not pitting them. It's it's really I'm I'm I could be them. I am them in some ways. So I offer that. Thanks for that reflection. If there's anything you like to add, you're welcome to. No, you're good. Okay. Yeah, any other reflections? Claire. Thank you, Mickey. I just want to say that it's very, very, very funny coincidence brought this up tonight because I do volunteer work. Yesterday, I found out that some people were added to a team without my knowing it. I didn't really want to have happen. And my go to place was how dare they am I really go way up? How dare they and what am I going to and how am I going to get them off or whatever? And then I paused and I thought, you know, it's not going to go anywhere. And it's just going to make a lot of people unhappy. And so, you know, the nice the great the the right thing to do would be to send them a note and tell them how happy I am with their work with us. And how you know, how pleased I am to have them. And that's why I just wrote it right before I came here. Because that's I know that I'll feel however they feel I'll feel better. Thanks, Claire. Thanks to the report from the field that you just went through this this contemplation. Okay, this is what I could this is what I could do. Or this is what I could do. Okay, let me reflect. What do I really want to do? Who do I really want to be in this world? Yeah, beautiful. Thank you, Claire. Thanks for that example sharing that that's lovely. Yeah, the reflections. And also type them in chat if you like, they could be privately to me, in which case I won't read their name. So you were kind of talking about like feeling hurt or offended. What happens if you feel anger? How does what's the connection? Because, right, the example I picked, there's a lot of like anger, right? And it didn't quite feel the same as matching with the new was saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So so what if there's anger? So so I'll share with you that yeah, I felt angry too. For me, there was anger too. And I felt like this, this feeling, no, the feeling of anger can can have many reasons. But in this case, I don't know if it's the same for you, but it was feeling unfairly. This is, you know, something that when that feels unfair, like, that's not it, like, doesn't feel right. And so for me, where, where I've been sitting with that, and I'll offer this, maybe relevant or supportive, supportive for the situation you're working with, is, I think it became more released, more, more easy to work with when I really put myself in their shoes, like what they are saying, how they're seeing the world right now, what's happening to them, they're in such a difficult circumstance that when I put myself in that situation, something happened to the anger, like I could start to see like, wow, so painful, where they how what they're going through, how they're seeing the world is just, oh, and that's something, something happened to the anger, it softened it. And then also, it felt like holding the anger as a blessing as a, as I was saying, again, I tried to unpack it during the guided meditation, it's hard to say, but that blessing it as yeah, I see you, I see there's there's there's a goodness, there's a there's a beauty in here. And that also released it in in a way and putting it on the altar. So I'm offering these some of the ways that I've been working with with it in this and it's not one size fits all, of course, but what? Yeah, I am. I don't know if any of this this this you've tried this meal or it hits home or not. Yeah, some of it hits, right? It feels difficult. Right? It's, it's comfortable to be angry with this person. It's comfortable to be angry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, right. You know, I've worked with them for a couple of years and they're like the most disgusting human being I've ever met in my life. You know, you know, I don't mean like, you know, they don't watch, right? I mean, they just do horrible things. Yeah. So, but, but it's, you know, it costs me to be angry, too. Yeah, exactly. That's the other thing. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, there's there is more there. And yeah, thank you. There's one quick. Let's see. Rada, I see your hand. Let's come. There's very little time I see we need to go to the practice meetings. And there was one question that's been posted in the chat very quickly. I want to address which is in your view, where's the line between blessing, hurts and conflicts and toxic positive positivity? Very good point. There is there is a difference. And that's where the wisdom comes in. That's where the wisdom comes in to know what is appropriate, what's the appropriate response. And sometimes it's not appropriate. You know what the appropriate response is to say, no, this is not appropriate. You can do this. And, and sometimes it's it's appropriate not to pick a fight with someone who's already so hurting that that they're just hurting. So that's where the wisdom comes in. But so I think that's where I would say the wisdom can tell you where the difference is between toxic positive positivity, which not helpful and and and and and and appropriate compassion. Jerry says this practice gives me hope that we may develop a different way personally and more widely of working through difficult situations that this would may survive and thrive. Hopefully, may it be so may be so. Yeah. So we usually turn to practice to small groups a minute or two earlier. But here we go. I'm going to make up the breakout rooms. And the invitation for tonight's practice is if you like sharing something about this practice or about how it was or maybe case where you're you're feeling into what's the high road, what's the lower, what's the road of wisdom and compassion without falling into toxic positive. All of that is exploring, you know, having a minute to offer something and let's do alphabetical order first person and the next person offers a nugget and then next person will then come back to you. So you go round and round and around Robin way instead of a long monologue. Make sure everybody has time to speak. OK. All right. So I'm going to create the rooms and open them up. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Please be kind. And the rooms are open. Here we go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And the time is seven o'clock. So tell you what, I'm going to stay a minute extra if there's any reflections or questions. Otherwise, let's let's close. Dedicate the merit. Thank you all for your practice for cultivating kindness, goodness, wisdom for the sake of all beings everywhere, including ourselves. OK. Take good care, everyone. Be well. And I'll stop there.
