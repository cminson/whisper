 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. Okay. All right. All the plermin... Plerim... Can I say that right? Preliminaries are done. So hi. Hello and welcome everyone to Happiar. So lovely to have you and from so many different places on this earth, so many different time zones. So, so let's start practicing together and I'll share the theme during the guided meditation and I'll say a couple of words about it later. So let's just jump in. Let's just jump in together. Finding, finding your ease, finding... Finding your seat. Finding your seat on this earth. And bringing awareness actually, your sitting bones. Let's start there today. Sitting bones, the connection of your... Bottom with the cushion, with the chair and your feet, your legs with the earth. Picking your seat. Taking your seat. And letting your sitting posture, sitting... Or maybe standing or lying down, whatever is appropriate, but I'm going to assume sitting for now. Your posture be informed. Let it rise up. Let it have a sense of uprightness, sense of dignity of taking your place on this earth. Just as the Buddha touched the earth, it is said, the night of his enlightenment. When he was being assailed by Mara, the personification of doubt, challenges, hindrances, and he touched the earth. Earth being my witness, I belong here, taking his place on the earth, a human being just like us. It's called the earth mudra. You can see it on lots of statues, the Buddha touching the earth with his hand. Let us touch the earth with our feet, with our sit bones, touching the earth. Let the earth be my witness, I am on this earth. Breathing, living, contributing, interconnected, taking my place on this earth. Let there be a sense of uprightness, of taking your place. You matter, you matter, I matter, I matter. I am part of this amazing mystery called life. I am stardust. It's amazing that I exist, this being who is me. Let the breath, this body knows how to breathe this mystery of the universe that is you. Let the breath breathe you, the breath knows how to breathe you already, don't make it into a project. The breath knows how to breathe you, so relax, soften, enjoy the breath being received in your abdomen and your sit bones. Your hands and feet, in your spine, in your heart. Let your heart rest with the breath, taking your seat, nowhere to go, nothing to do, releasing thoughts and the to-do list, taking refuge. The simplicity of this. Let the breath rest with the breath, in your spine, in your heart. Let the breath rest with the breath, in your heart, in your soul. Let the breath rest with the breath, in your heart, in your soul. Let the breath rest with the breath, in your heart, in your soul. Resting with thought, resting with the breath. Resting with appreciation. Thank you. Thank you. Just this breath. In this body, how amazing, the body knows how to breathe, and so much more, receiving the breath with awe, with appreciation. Feeling embodied, settled. Let yourself enjoy the breath, relax, let the body relax, enjoying the breath. It's okay to enjoy the wholesomeness, to be enjoyed. And if there is a little voice that says, no, I'm not supposed to enjoy my meditation, yes, you are. Let go of that misguided Puritan judgment. Thanks for your help, but it's wholesome to enjoy and practice. Thank you. Practice, let the breath be joyful, nourishing, a delightful reward, and this cultivation. Thank you. Thank you. Be happiness of sitting and being breathed and knowing. Be happiness of awareness, simply knowing. It's delicious. Even if we are knowing Dukkha, we are knowing what's challenging, not pushing it away, not fighting with it, just knowing it, knowing what is present. It was a delight to knowing, even knowing Dukkha, knowing challenges. Body can relax, the heart can relax. Knowing this, a delight of knowing, a nourishment of knowing, the awesomeness of knowing. Thank you. Thank you. Pleasure of knowing whatever is arising in the here and now, the breath, sensations, whatever it is. Relax. Enjoy knowing. Pleasure of mindfulness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If opening to all phenomena, thoughts, sensations, emotions is too much, then stay with the pleasure, the pleasure of knowing the breath. The nourishment of knowing the breath, the sensations here and now. Calming soothing, settling. Thank you. Thank you. Relishing the pleasure, the delight of awareness here and now. Your mind knows this, your heart knows how to do this. Thank you. Thank you. Such a respite, respite from the busyness of the day, our lives, just the pleasure, the loveliness of knowing this, whatever this is, the breath, the sensations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In light of knowing that you're thinking and thought is happening in this moment, really meeting the knowing. As we explore, as we open our hearts, our minds to the delight, the pleasure of knowing, of being aware, of being mindful without resistance, without pushing away aversion. And knowing whatever is here, breath, sensations, thoughts, pain, there is a delight, a pleasure, wholesome pleasure in knowing. In meeting this, the truth of this moment, just as it is. Not resisting, taking space for knowing, to permeate, to hold whatever is. There is such a delight, a mucha delight. And in the last minutes of this practice period, let us experiment, experiment with wearing a little smile. Meeting yourself with knowing, knowing whatever is present in this moment. The gesture of kindness, gesture of appreciation for the knowing, knowing what is. And see how a smile might shift. As if our arms are wide open, embracing the moment, knowing that it's like this. Wow, amazing. Yay. Let your heart smile, even if it's knowing the challenges, pain to come. It's a gift to know. Unmoved, upright. We have so much more capacity than we give ourselves credit for. As we approach the end of this sitting period, this practice, seeing our own goodness, appreciating, and we showed up, we did our best. Even if there was one moment of awareness, of knowing, yay, infinitely more, infinitely lovelier than zero moments of knowing, awareness. Appreciating this being who is me, this showed up to support myself and others in this cultivation. Trusting there is goodness, plants, seeds have been planted, seeds of goodness planted and together. Sharing this goodness with all beings everywhere. May all beings taste their own goodness, the goodness of knowing. May they open up the mystery to the awe of having a seed on this planet, however challenging it might seem. May all beings be free. May all beings be well, including myself. Thank you all. Thank you for your practice. I'll say a couple of words about what we did tonight. I invited us to first start with selling with the body, a sense of connection of the sit bones, the feet with the body, with the earth, and the sense of letting us take our seat on this earth just as the Buddha did. Letting there be a sense of a brightness, of awe that we are part of this amazing world. This body knows how to breathe, it has so many capacities. Then I invited us to feel into the delight, the pleasure, first with the breath and then knowing there is delight, there is just built-in delight and joy that we often miss. To know, to be aware in the here and now that no matter what it is we are knowing, breath, sensations, thoughts, etc. Again, at first we get our training wheels, just knowing the breath, knowing the perhaps comfortable areas of the body, then we open up more and more to other phenomena. Even though Dukkha, when we know suffering, when we know challenge, pain in the heart or in the body, there is delight. I know that from myself and I know that from many, many practitioners. There is the sense of delight to know, actually to meet what's challenging, sort of pushing it away or not going to deal with it, being afraid of it. But seeing it, just knowing it always like this. There is a sense of uprightness, there is a sense of strength, pleasure, delight. Another thing that I invited us to feel into and bring in was enjoying the delight, the pleasure of practice and the breath and the body because sometimes Buddhism gets this bad rap about being a joy-denying practice. Like you're not supposed to enjoy your practice, you're supposed to concentrate. Couldn't be further from the truth. It's a much longer talk but enjoy without attaching, without grasping, like I want more. But when it's here, of course enjoy it. Take delight in the delight that's present. Now if I want oh, that thing that just happened, I want more of that. No, that will be cause of suffering. So don't do that. But when it's here, just enjoy and let it go. Just like the poem, maybe I'll grab it when you're in breakout rooms or one who kisses a joy as it flies, lives in eternity's sunrise. So with that, I'd like to invite us now to turn to practicing in small groups, maybe groups of three. It'll be about six or seven minutes roughly. And the prompt is again, you can pass when your turn comes, you can say pass and hold silence, hold kind silence for yourself and for others. You don't have to share. When your turn comes and let's go reverse alphabetical order. When your turn comes, if you want to share something about how this was for you. Oh yeah, I related it or it wasn't, or I related with, but the body but not with Dukoh or wow, it was amazing. It actually lit up or I slept the whole time. I just woke up. It's perfectly fine. There are no wrong answers. It's just showing up and being held witness with community and holding others witness. So you'll have the chance to maybe share for a minute, the next person, if they want, they'll share for a minute, the next person's for a minute, and then you have a chance to add some more. So let it not be a long monologue, just a nugget and go around and run. And again, you can always say pass and we share from our own experience. We don't ask questions or give advice, just I statements. So creating a offering each other kindness. This is really where the practice meets the rubber meets the road, offering each other kindness and acceptance. Whatever they say couldn't be greater, couldn't be better, not asking questions or interrogating. Okay. So I've created the rooms. Again, take care of yourselves, take care of each other. What a great opportunity to chat with a couple of other practitioners about this practice. Again, the prompt has to do with how is this practice of finding joy and feeling into the joy, the light of knowing, knowing what's here right now and also wearing a smile. I forgot that wearing a smile at the end. All right, here we go. Enjoy. Take care of each other. Take care of yourselves. Opening all rooms. See you on the other side. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm more seconds and while we're waiting, okay, I think the rooms are closed. Okay, everybody's back and and great. So we have some time for for reflections. But if you haven't shared in a while or love to ask you to pull forward. Richard, your hand shot up. What's up? Okay. Tonight, I wish I could have heard the summary of the meditation before the meditation. Because you know the because I it's almost like I keep on getting my attention is always torn between let's say my breath and the instructions. And I think for me, it would be easier to hear the general outline ahead of time. So it would be easier to like follow. Yeah, yeah, okay. I appreciate hearing that. And, and yet there are advantages. I see both. I think there are advantages. This is advantages to both. And sometimes I do it that way. And sometimes I do it the other way. So yeah, thanks for your feedback, Richard. I appreciate that for you hearing the instructions while I'm giving them out loud, for some people actually cannot not upload overloading at the beginning, but just giving it piece by piece like oh yeah, here we are. But but I appreciate both ways. Thanks for sharing that Richard. Susan. Hi. The part I really liked is when you said you don't have to be a Puritan. It's okay to enjoy it. Which I took to add to my practice and also, you know, just like why can't I just add some warmth to the breath here instead of it just being clinically the breath. And then I was also applying it to like, oh, I don't have to be a Puritan and be so serious when I'm getting through my list of things work I do all day. Like, I don't have to be a Puritan. I love that. Yay. Thanks, Susan. I so having descended from one in my bloodline. Yeah, yeah. And also, it's, it's again, in the West, it feels like it's so much part of the perceived Buddhist teachings to be so serious and awakened and whereas actually delight and joy and pleasure are really important parts of the path. Really important. So, yeah. Thanks, Susan. I appreciate, I appreciate how that how you shared that really clicked for you. Yeah. May you have joy. May you enjoy all everything you do during the day, not just the breath but everything, everything on your to-do list. Kenneth, please. Yeah, I said, um, I enjoy sometimes not knowing because you have some nice Buddhist tricks. Like we'll send loving kindness out to everybody else for 20 minutes and then all of a sudden we'll send it back to us. We go, whoa. And that really works. So, I call it a Buddhist trick. I have a little, this is not a big issue, but sometimes I wake up and I don't feel good. So, I do a Tom Lynn practice and I have trouble stopping it. It just wants to go on and on. So, why is that a problem? Wait. So, just just for references, when you mentioned Tom Lynn, just for folks who may not know what that is, that's a beautiful, beautiful Buddhist Tibetan Buddhist practice of taking in, breathing in the suffering of other suffering of ourselves, suffering of the world, suffering, breathing in suffering and the imagining that the heart transforms it into peace, into, into succor and then breathing it out and such a beautiful practice. So, with every breath it feels like, oh, we're bringing peace and goodness to ourselves, to others. It's a lovely practice, is breathing with, breathing with suffering and transforming it. So, that's what Ken is talking about. What's the problem for it wanting to continue to go on? I'm not sure, but it is a very nice practice. I love it. Oh, it's a lovely practice. So, but I'm actually, I am curious, does it feel like a problem that he wants to go on? Can he just go on in the background or is it a problem? Let's explore that. I cuddle babies at the hospital and I use Tom Lynn with the babies all the time because I'm just breathing out, allowing my kindness to them and breathing in, I don't know, some kind of suffering. So, I don't know, it's just, once I started it in the morning, if I'm half asleep, it just goes on and on and on and on. I'm like, shouldn't I stop this at some point? Oh my God, are you kidding me? I'm just, I'm loving it. I see other hearts and thumbs up showing up on Zoom. I think we're all supporting you. Keep doing it. It's lovely that it's become so natural for you. It's so lovely that it's become natural for you. So, oh my goodness, this is, actually let's celebrate it. And the mind, the peace of mind that comes and says, oh, shouldn't I stop this? Why are you asking this? Why are you making a problem from something that's actually a beautiful cultivation? You've cultivated it so much that it's now become an automatic response to the suffering of the world. I'll give you an example of my own practice. I've done these practices that they just show up like when I'm doing nothing or I'm swimming or I'm just breathing or I'm sitting, it just shows up. Or even the words sometimes show up safe, happy, healthy, ease. They just show up like, oh, how nice. They're comforting and they show outside. So this is, this is the fruit of your cultivation, Ken. Enjoy it. Thank you so much for sharing that. All being support you in doing that. That's lovely. Great. That's lovely. Yeah. So Claire, I see your hand. Oh, I think that was maybe, okay. All right. So, so I, Claire disappeared. All right. So let's, let's close. Let's close and, and dedicate the merit of our practice. Oh, actually, you know what? Maybe before we close, I do want to ask you a question. If anybody wants to reflect on this, did any of you feel, did any of you feel into or have an opening or an aha moment into that what I was guiding you, especially the, you know, the big topic of tonight, the delight, the pleasure of knowing it's just so pleasant. Or was that just the doll? Like, yeah, of course we know that. Or was like, wow, there is pleasure here in knowing whatever it is. Was it a doll? Yeah, of course. Or was it an aha moment for anyone? Well, I wonder, let's see. I see a thumbs up. Is that you want to talk or are you just giving a thumbs up? And I'm not quite sure who's giving the thumbs up and long list of people. You want to raise your hand? Maybe that was just a thumbs up. So which one was it? All right, Neil. Okay, Neil, you get the last word. I'm going to choose C. I was like, what is she talking about? You know, right, right. In fact, it was what is she talking about? And when is this meditation over, right? So there was like, frustration, restlessness, all kind of like bundled in, you know, that said, you know, I felt very peaceful and it was all kind of nice. Right. But but when you were saying that, I'm like, I love it. So that that that piece and it kind of being nice. It's well, when you were saying it, it wasn't right, right. You're saying it definitely like left me frustrated. Right. But but afterward, right. Which I must say, this isn't the this isn't the first or the hundredth and first time that that, you know, that's happened. Right. I hear the instruction and I'm like, this is dumb. Right. But then but then like, maybe it works. So. Yeah. So so so no, no, your track record, Neil, both your with, you know, the goodness of your practice and any other this reflection of this is dumb, you know, comes up a lot and the frustration and maybe in this case, what I would invite you to oh, actually, I missed there was a different there was a reflection there. I love the delight in knowing it was a huge opening. Oh, Mary, thank you, Mary. I didn't see your reflection earlier. Thank you for that. So yeah. So so with what you said, Anil, I think what I would invite you is to to get to know the frustration because there is a no. So so what if you actually know the frustration instead of. Yeah. Right. So that's where the Aikido I think some of the Aikido movements of awareness and mind was like, what was it actually just to know it? Oh, yeah, I'm frustrated in this. There's frustration that is arising. Ah, wow. There's a delight in turning out of it and actually knowing it instead of being in it. So that's the invitation I'll give you if you decide to continue to practice with this. So so thank you. Thank you all for your practice and and how wonderful and may you may you open up to the delight to the pleasure of knowing made open up for you. There's such a joy to know. May all beings be well. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Thanks, everyone. See you on Wednesday.
