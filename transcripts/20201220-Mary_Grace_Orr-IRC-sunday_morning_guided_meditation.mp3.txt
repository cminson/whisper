I'd like to recap a little some of the instructions and perhaps provide you with an image for our
meditation practice that might be helpful.
So the very first evening we talked a bit first about posture, that it's possible to
practice in four different postures.
Three of them are really suitable for the meditation hall, especially if you're in a
group which is sitting and standing and lying down.
And then of course you are all familiar with walking the fourth as its own particular kind
of practice.
So looking at all of you, those of you I can see on the screen which is not the whole
group, looks like most people are sitting and perhaps sitting on a cushion, cross-legged
or kneeling on it or kneeling on a bench or sitting in a chair.
And that probably is the most common because it's stable and it's still.
We talked a lot about lying down as an alternative, especially for people who have issues with
their body and for home sitting is if possible, which sometimes of course it is not, at least
it's very difficult.
We didn't talk too much about standing, but standing is also an acceptable posture and
in fact there are monasteries in Thailand, I'm told, where they do almost nothing else
except standing practice.
And it's a very useful practice if you're sleepy and need to bring some extra alertness
because it isn't as stable as sitting, it's easy to wobble, and that the adrenaline rush
if nothing else will help to keep you awake.
So feel free to use any of those in your practice, either for what remains of the retreat or
in your practice at home.
So that said, then we moved on and we began to talk about the breath and the body being
present with that first of foundations of mindfulness, first of the domains of mindfulness,
it's another word to use.
And the lovely thing about awareness of the body is that if you are aware of the body,
you are in fact in the present moment, kind of a shortcut to the present moment.
And then we moved on to talk about the Vedana, the feeling tone that sometimes things in
your practice are pleasant, sometimes they're downright yummy, sometimes they're unpleasant
or really awful, and sometimes they are neither pleasant nor unpleasant.
And noting it can be a way to help train yourself to stay with something even when it's difficult
and even when it's yummy, because of course, difficulty leads to aversion and pleasant
leads to greed, and that's why it's so important, it's that link in the chain of suffering.
And neither is the place where sometimes we drift off and don't pay attention.
And then we talked a bit about the mind, mind, heart, being aware of the different things
that pass through the emotional storms, sometimes the waves of anger or grief or fear or joy,
or just noticing the flavor of your consciousness, and of course, noticing thoughts themselves,
which can be a really helpful practice to begin to just identify from the thoughts.
Just noticing, oh, there's a thought going through and not attaching to it.
It's a little bit tricky as a practice because thoughts are so sticky and we get so caught.
So today, as we practice, I'd like to give you this image.
Sitting there on your chair or cushion or bench, you are like the spider in her web.
And you just, you know how spiders do sometimes, they just hang out, and they're in the middle
of the web.
But then sometimes something comes along and they go off to investigate it.
And if it's something really interesting, they wrap it up for dinner.
So as you're hanging out in your web, your hanging out place is the breath and the body.
Just, that's the place to start.
It's the place to go back to when not too much is going on.
But as you're hanging out there, sometimes something comes along.
It might be an itch on the end of your nose or it might be a sound or it might be a strong
emotional state.
You might suddenly have a memory and a lot of anger.
So when that happens, you leave the resting place, let it drop into the background and
go and investigate the wave of anger.
What is itching?
What is some other kind of discomfort?
What is sound?
And you rest with those perhaps a bit because they're really what's in the forefront of
your consciousness.
And then when they subside, when it's a little less interesting, falls on its own accord back
into the background, then returning to the breath and the body.
And then maybe something else happens in a little bit, another sound or another wave.
Might even be the same wave all over again or similar.
And off you go to hang out with it and just be present.
You don't need to figure it out, just to name it and be there.
Anger is like this, hearing is like this, itching is like this.
Okay, and then back to the breath.
So there's no need to struggle to stay with the breath all the time, because sometimes
something does come along that's stronger.
And that's when, like the spider, you go off to investigate.
Let the whole thing be a bit playful and relaxed.
If you make meditation a job or a chore, it's not going to bring you back over and over
again, which brings me to what happens to the spider sometimes, because sometimes she
falls out of her web.
And so sometimes you fall out of your meditation web and get swept away with the story or line
of thought or daydreaming or maybe you just get really sleepy and go off into some hypnagogic
state.
So when you wake up, you find that you're not in your meditation web anymore and you
go back and you begin again.
So of course, probably unlike the spider, you spend a lot of time going back.
And it's a hugely important practice, learning to come back, probably one of the most profound
learnings in our practice over and over and over.
I've often thought of children walking on a log or a curb or a balance beam, and part
of the deal is sometimes you lose your balance and you fall off and they laugh for the most
part.
So that's a good attitude.
If you fall off, it's like, oh my goodness, chuck all at your own practice and then come
back and start again.
Holding yourself gently and with great kindness.
Learning to be present, learning presence is such a gift to the world, so what you're
doing is a very, very good thing.
One breath at a time.
notice where you are right now, perhaps resting with breath and body, perhaps being
with other sensations or with some mind state, if you've wandered off and gotten lost, come
back, begin again.
I'm glad I'm back.
Thank you for watching.
I'm going to turn it off, it's going to be a very good one.
I'm going to see you in a minute.
Bye.
Bye for now.
Bye.
Bye.

there's a poem that very well describes our practice
it's from Galway Canal who says
whatever what is is
is what I want
only that
but that
whatever what is is
is what I want
only that
but that
whatever is present
be with that
this is the way the breath is
this is the way fear is
this is the way being lost in a story is
this is what coming back feels like
one moment at a time
present with whatever is
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
notice where you are right now
relax into that moment
notice that it is the way it is
even before you come back to the breath at the body of your lost
notice lostness
if you're with a strong mind state
notice that
if you're with a sensation in the body of the breath be with that
be relaxed and attentive
one moment at a time
being present with the way things are
you

I think one of the most wonderful things about this practice of mindfulness
is that in an interesting way it's almost impossible to do it wrong
you can't have the wrong object of your meditation
it really is just as galway canal says whatever what is is
so whatever comes along
it's like this
and you give your attention to it
there are practices that are a little fussier
but this one isn't one of them
and so it's really learning to stay present and balanced and alert
and as you all know very well by now
it sounds so simple
and it's not easy
it is simple
but it's not easy
and it takes a lot of practice
and I think Bob and JD and I would all be quite happy to say
that even after years and years and years of practice
and some of you have had some years of practice too
we know that there's still learning
and there are some days that go better than others
so in a moment I'm going to take questions
but there's one other thing I want to tend to
I was reminded yesterday by one of you
that I had inadvertently used a gendered pronoun
when I referred to JD
in my own defense I live on the island of Hawaii
where things are pretty backward
and I'm not as practiced at that as I should be
so I would certainly apologize to JD
and to any of you that I offended that way
and it's a steep learning curve
you all know that
and we're working on it
so I just wanted you all to know that
in case anyone else has noticed and worried about it
so maybe I'll also say about the day so you'll know
so after this there will be a walk-in
and then at the sitting that for you is at 11.45
at the end of that sitting
the managers will be coming in
and there will be a lot of information
about the end of the retreat for you to have
and then in the afternoon
there will be a sitting at 2
is that right as usual
it will only be a half an hour
and it will segue into the closing of the retreat
so in those times
or when we're really going to be dealing with reentry
and life after the retreats and all of that
so now that you know that
are there any questions about the practice
or about something I said yesterday
that wasn't clear
if you'll just use the mechanical hand raised thing
then I can see who you are
please Yorisha
if you'd unmute yourself dear
just about the poem that you read
I really really enjoyed it
and I was trying to write the
I know it was like three lines
but I looked it up in the document
it's not there yet
the poems from yesterday and today
will be in the document
probably later today
as I have time to do it
but I just haven't yet
so yeah thank you
it really helped so thank you
it's a great poem
I try to bring it to every retreat
so
thank you so much
and your instructions have really helped
thank you
thank you
Sarah please would you unmute yourself
I've been
trying to figure out the difference between
a feeling tone
and an emotion
and myself
getting wrapped up
in a whole
line of thoughts around
you know
what is what
thank you
well
it's an interesting question
I mean mostly for the most part
emotions things like anger
and fear
and joy
desire even
lust
and they have feeling tones
right
so the feeling tone is actually the
pleasantness or the unpleasantness
of it
and it's the place where we get pulled in
so sometimes
sometimes even
anger can be pleasant
you know maybe something's happened
and you really annoyed and it's
taking up lots of space in your mind
and it's good to be that angry
and to be figuring out
what you're going to do next and so you get caught
right
and sometimes
I got really interested at one point
I realized that when I was wandering
off in a story it didn't feel so good
it was kind of unpleasant
which helped me to loosen up
from that a bit
so they are different
and I think maybe it will help
but the pleasantness and unpleasantness
is also being qualities
of mind states
some mind states are pleasant
and some are unpleasant
does that help?
very much, thank you
okay great, thank you
Mary Lou
please
thank you
I do want to listen to
your last night's talk again
after the retreat
that I spaced out during part of it
but if you could
clarify, you mentioned
when you started you said intention
and view
and if I understand correctly
the intention using the metaphor
of trying to escape
our intention is to escape
our greed, hatred
and delusion
what we're living in
and what's the view?
well that's the question, isn't it?
there are lots of views
in a way, right?
the views are what you begin to see
the wise view
is what understanding
comes
so all of you have had
wise view because
there's a way in which you know
to practice, you're here
right?
maybe
something comes along and you really get it
oh my goodness
impermanence, it's so impermanent
you know, I always love to think
of things like
where's breakfast? it's gone
you know, it's back there with the dinosaurs
and so we begin to understand
about impermanence or maybe it's some insight
into the nature of suffering
or self, so those are the views
so in many ways there are many
many, many views
it seems to happen as the view gets
bigger and bigger and bigger
as our practice deepens
so they're both
part of the eightfold path
so wise view and
wise intention are the
first two on the list
and they are constantly
changing as we work
with the other elements of
that list
so it's not really a linear progression
at all, it's very much more a hologram
does that help?
yes it does, thank you
thank you
Eric, please
hi Mary Grace, thank you very much
I had a question
about walking meditation
and when doing it
I was wondering
you know, a lot of what I've been doing
has been focusing on the sensations
in my feet and lower legs
so it feels more of like
a samadhi kind of practice
and I was wondering if there was
a way to be mindful of like
a motion, you know, of mind states
or of the Vedana's
you're better
I get excited hard
because I'm moving and I have to
you know, it's hard to multitask basically
well don't
that's often when I
again, it's been so short
we haven't had chance to really give instructions
a lot
my recommendation
is that if a strong mind state comes up
that you stop
and don't multitask
and give your attention to that mind state
and just stand there
so here you are doing standing practice
for a moment
and noticing that mind state
and then when it settles down a little bit
when it's not quite so compelling
then you can bring your attention back to walking again
and then you can proceed
it's also true that
sometimes
it's really true like in a place like Spirit Rock
or IRC or any place
where you're outside
sometimes it's like
wow, look at that tree
or that flower or whatever
and then you stop
and you open the awareness
to that
conversely however
if you're really really working
Samadhi because it is a Samadhi practice
then
you can
know people who wear glasses
and when you're excited to take their glasses off
when they're walking
you keep the view really down
so you're not bringing in any of that outside stuff
so a little bit
it's where you want to go
with your practice at that particular point in time
great, that's super helpful
thank you very much and thanks for all your wisdom and instruction
thank you
okay, I think this is the last one
Kumi please
I
want to thank you so very much
for
for you
and your wisdom
and
did you say
the difference between feeling and emotion
feeling
that's
Vedana is
it's helpful to use the word Vedana
because it's
and it gets translated feeling
and the problem is that
people confuse it
with what we normally refer to
in our culture and in the English language
as feelings
so it's not your feelings
it's not your anger
or your sadness or any of those things
it's the feeling tone
so let's leave out
tone it's the
the flavor maybe
of your experience
that is so
take a spoonful
of something
and you put it in your mouth
and you go oh, delicious
you know or if you see a flower
and it's beautiful
that's a pleasant experience
there may arise some emotions
maybe it's
a flower that you have associated
with the funeral of your beloved father
or something
and all of a sudden all the sadness is there
the Vedana
is not the sadness
and as I said
to the earlier question the sadness
may have its own Vedana
sometimes sadness is very
sweet
sometimes sadness brings up
a great deal of love
for whoever it was
so the sadness itself might have
a somewhat pleasant feeling tone
or it might be really
unpleasant
so there are two different things
I got
the story I like to tell about
this is that when I was first
taught these things it was taught
in a way that I confused them
and I thought that
Vedana, that feeling tones were feelings
and so I described it that way
in some of my early teachings until
some student corrected me
and said why don't you ever talk about
the second foundation of mindfulness
I went but I do
she said well I don't think so
it's not feelings
and I had to go back
and clarify and she was of course
totally right that's why you should correct
your teachers on occasion you know
we don't know everything for sure
but does that help
it seems like feeling
is
the big picture
emotions are part of the feeling
or something
you could say that
Vedana
is not as specific
maybe
as an emotion is
and you might I would encourage you
to just get used to the word Vedana
because that keeps us away from the confusion
yeah
and you mentioned about
maybe I should ask you later
yeah
about your
10 o'clock on Sunday
that will come up later
yeah
that information will be available
thank you
alright my dears
so you have
really
until the sitting this afternoon
as a retreat
and I was mentioning to JD
and Bob
one of my tricks for being on a retreat
which is when it gets down to the last
day
so I just tell myself
I have three more days
and so I invite you
to have this morning
as though it were three more days
let yourself be
in retreat
walking now for a while
then sitting for a bit
and then
eating in whatever mindful way
you do
and then another sitting
and then we can turn outward
and begin
to really talk about
what happens afterwards
there will be some social time
after the retreat ends
we'll leave the zoom room open
so you can hang out if you want
so enjoy
your sitting and walking
and when the mind does
wander into next week bring it back
thank you
Thank you for watching!
