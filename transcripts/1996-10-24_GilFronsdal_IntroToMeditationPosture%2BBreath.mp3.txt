 Maybe I'll start by asking you all, how many of you have had instructions in meditation before? And how many of you are brand new to meditation? And how many of you who have had meditation instruction before, or have done meditation before, have not done this particular kind of mindfulness meditation? And okay, I live up on skyline up above Palo Alto. I don't know what the weather was like down here today, but up there at core the whole day. And it was pouring still today when I came down now. And there was something very nice about the first day of full rain up there in the season. And then coming down here to talk about meditation. I think that the, perhaps the rain up there, the mood that I had, wasn't exactly melancholy, but a very intimate kind of at-home feeling that just came with being at home and feeling the rain. And I associate meditation with a kind of at-homeness and holding experience warmly, closely to oneself, within oneself, kind of being at home with oneself, in oneself. Which I think is very much different than how many of us live our lives, and very different from the way that much influence in our culture gets us to live our lives. So I think that the work life, the school life, has a lot of pressures in our life. And so we're constantly losing touch with ourselves, in a sense. And our mind races around, trying to get many things done to be efficient. And many people find themselves, just because of the stress and the busyness of their life, strangers to themselves. And then there's a whole other set of people who, because being intimate with themselves, being awake, paying attention to what's happening in the present, is very painful. And so the idea of being at home with oneself means to be awake and be clear and be aware of what's happening in one's experience with oneself and the world around us. And as we know, there's a tremendous movement, tremendous tendency in American culture to avoid being present for what's going on. Tremendous rate of alcoholism and drug addiction, drug use, almost all of which is some form or other of saying, well, this present moment is not acceptable. I don't want to be at home in it or be present for it. So I will do something to forget it or avoid it or change who I am. So the idea of being at home with oneself. Today I felt very comfortable because I was up there in the nice rain, rainstorm. But what does it mean to be at home with oneself when our personal experiences, the experiences of the world around us are difficult and painful? Meditation practice is not the mindfulness practice that we're teaching here. It's not a practice. It's basically a practice about how we hold our experience. Rather than what kind of experience we have. So the image that comes to my mind, which is used sometimes in meditation, is if you're holding a young baby bird, if you find a little baby bird on the ground and you pick it up, you need to hold it gently enough, but you need to hold it so that it won't fall out of your hands. If your hand is too open, it will fall out of your hands and hurt itself. But if you hold it too tightly, you're going to hurt the bird also. So you have to hold it with kind of love and care, kind of very gently with this kind of gentle, nurturing hold. So meditation has a lot to do with how we hold our experience rather than what our experience actually is, which is actually very different from how many people think when they come to do a meditation class. Because most people when they come to a meditation class, for good reasons, it isn't that they came for the wrong reasons, but come for reasons, for example, they feel too stressed in their life or they want to cope with something better. They feel more kind of too agitated or too busy or whatever. And so they want to find some way to calm themselves down or feel better or just cope with the stress of their normal life. Meditation can provide that, but it's best to think of that as a byproduct. Because mindfulness meditation is not about changing anything, but rather is finding a new way to hold what our experience actually is, to hold it with compassion, to hold it with care, to hold it without reactivity, without pushing it away or grasping onto it like you can't let go of it all, can't change, you can't become something different. So the how, the how we hold ourselves, the how we're present becomes very important. But maybe I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself. The fundamental idea in mindfulness meditation, as in most forms of meditation, involves a deep appreciation for the present moment. This moment that we live in, this moment, the very moment we find ourselves in, is the moment where most of the things that are most precious for us in our life are available to us. I think most of us, if we took a poll, say, what is most important in your life? Those are kinds of things which you only know about, the only experience, if you're in the present for them. Most people don't say that daydreaming about the past or fantasizing about the future or planning the future are the most precious experiences of their life. But rather it's love, it's compassion, it's friendship, it's beauty, it's being at peace. All these kinds of experiences are experiences that are only available if we're in the present moment. So the beginning of meditation practice and the beginning of Buddhist practice, because this meditation practice I'm going to teach you comes out of the Buddhist tradition, is an appreciation for the value of being in the present moment. To take enough time to slow down enough to have it a priority enough to actually... What is actually happening now, right now? What is my experience right now? Rather than being lost in all the many places we tend to get lost. And lost means that you're not cognizant, you're not aware, you're not present for what is going on. Maybe in retrospect you realized what you were doing, but in the moment there's no consciousness, no presence within that. So the beginning of meditation is this appreciation of the present moment. And for that, the beginning of meditation is learning how to find ourselves in the present moment in the most simple possible way. So the first day of this kind of instructions we talk about very simple things. We talk mostly about following the breath, being attentive to the breath, using mindfulness of the breathing, meditation on the breath, as a tool or an aid for helping us come and find ourselves in the present moment. As these weeks go on, what I'll be doing is expanding the instructions to include more and more realms of our life and our experience. Because the idea of mindfulness practice is not just simply a meditation practice that's applicable or useful only when you're sitting in formal meditation, but it's a way in which you can bring awareness, bring presence, bring a certain kind of relatedness to all our experiences throughout our day and all our activities. And it's rather arbitrary to distinguish between the mind or the heart in meditation and the one outside. And as a person's meditation deepens, I think naturally there's a tendency to understand, oh, whatever I'm learning in meditation is equally true in my daily life. And there's an application of the practice into our normal life. So for example, we learn how to be present for ourselves in this very simple posture and simple activity of meditation. And then perhaps you begin to learn, what is it like to be present and mindful as I wash my dishes, or as I drive, or as I'm talking with my friends, or as I do my work, or whatever you're doing, rather than lost in anxiety or fear or fantasy or just in the past or in the future or in many places we get lost. So we'll expand the instructions. And so today it's very simple. The next week, which is Halloween, we'll do the body, how to include the body and physical experiences into the meditation, which is a very important one for many of us because the body is a source of great difficulty, either because of our concepts and ideas about it get in the way, or because many of us have pains and difficulties with our body. So how to include those things as part of the meditation is an offering that we give here. And I think it offers an erratically different way of working with many of our physical experiences than is common in our culture where, again, taking aspirin or pain medication or trying to best avoid it numb out is often an operating mode. So next week we include the body. How to include the body in a meditative life, in a mindful life. And then the third day we'll expand it to include emotions. So rather than thinking that emotions are outside the scope of meditative life or mindfulness, they actually get included within it. And the idea in Buddhist practice is that there's no outside. There's nothing which is outside of what's willing and can pay attention to. And it's because there's no outside that in Buddhism, the Buddhist understanding is that mindfulness meditation or our awareness itself is sacred. It's a sacred realm or sacred aspect of our life. So we enter into the sacred life by not holding anything outside as being unacceptable. And I think you'll probably notice in yourself, if you start paying attention, probably you notice it in our culture and your friends, how many of us keep parts of our life at a distance. We don't want to look at that. So for example, in myself, when I was younger, I was the kind of person who was not supposed to be angry. So if you're that kind of person, being angry is kind of unacceptable. And so actually when I got angry, I'd keep that at a distance. And I wouldn't even recognize that I was angry because that was unacceptable. That was kept outside. So what do we keep outside? So anyway, so everything is included. And that's kind of the task of these five weeks, the show how to include everything within the way in which we hold our experience, how all experiences can be held in a wakeful and free way. So the third day is emotions. The fourth day will be talking about thoughts and how to include our thinking life within a meditative life. And then the fifth week we'll talk more about how to integrate all this then into a normal life, a daily life. So that's the plan for the next five weeks. So my name is Gil Fransdell and I've been teaching here in Palo Alto I think for about six years now. I've been doing Buddhist meditation practices for over 20 years. And I did many years as Zen Buddhism and I was ordained as a Zen priest, a Zen monk and spent a lot of time in monasteries in Japan and then in Southeast Asia where I was introduced to the practice I'm teaching you here. The mindfulness practice comes from the Buddhism of Southeast Asia, Thailand, Burma and Sri Lanka. And so I practiced there for a long time. And then I came back to this country in the late 80s and in 1990 I started a graduate school, a graduate doctoral program at Stanford in guess what, in Buddhist studies. And that's my whole life. As Buddhism, it's my dedication. And then the sitting group here started off as a small Monday evening sitting group that when I started with a group there was about 12 people who came. And then in the five, six years we've been here it's grown steadily and now just introductory courses quite big. And we meet twice a week, I think most of you might know, we meet Mondays and Thursdays. Thursdays is more the basic meditation practice. That's what we talk about. That's when I give the introductory course. And when the introductory course is over then we continue with talking about basic meditation themes. It's more suited for people newer to meditation or people who want to focus more narrowly on meditation itself. Monday evening is the evening where the people who speak, myself usually, I might talk about anything that occurs to me that seems remotely connected to meditation. Sometimes you might wonder what the connection is. And we're connected to other meditation groups in the Bay Area who do teacher's practice also. It's quite a large network of other teachers and other groups. And there's often a table out there, there's some literature about that. There's a newsletter, two newsletters, one for our local group and one bigger one for the Bay Area community. And then we have a lot of other people who are interested in the meditation theme. The way in which we teach in this tradition is that the dedication is to teach freely, is not to charge for the teaching. And there's many reasons for that. One of them is because that's the way many of us receive the teachings in Asia, as we were given to it freely. One of the reasons is to make the teachings as available as freely as possible so people's means don't in any kind of way inhibit the accessibility of receiving the instructions or the teaching. So that's the way it's offered, it's offered freely. However, there's also what we do is we put two baskets out there in the hallway. And they're the equivalent of what in traditional Buddhism is called the monk's begging bowl. The monk would go around and have a bowl and the people, the villagers or whatever, would support the monk by putting food or whatever requisites they needed in the bowl. And we're not a monastic community here in America, we're lay people. And so rather than a bowl, we put out this basket. And that's your chance then to support this, whatever we're doing here, whatever way you see it. And there's two baskets. One basket, it says rent. And I think it says dana. Dana is the Buddhist word for donation. It means both donation and generosity. So one is for rent, and that is because we have to pay for rent for this room here. And there's no one who's going to pay for it except for us. So that's what it's there for. And if everybody put a dollar in there, they'll more than cover the cost for rent. And we have a few other small expenses like the telephone that we keep and things. And then the other basket is for myself or for the teacher. That's usually me. And that is if you want to support what I do. And 95% of my livelihood comes from people making donations for all the... I teach all over the place. So that's where my livelihood is from. So it's offered freely, and then there's opportunity for you, if you'd like, to support so this stuff, this kind of teaching, this kind of activity can go on. And I find it very interesting. Money is a very odd thing in our culture, as many of you know. But the way we teach in our tradition is to teach freely. But we experimented once or twice at a large center we have in Marin of charging for their introductory course. And we charge $60 for six weeks. And what was very interesting, what's very interesting is that when we don't charge and do it freely this way, we do it here. That no matter, even if it's the best meditation teacher who does the course, there's usually 50% of the people drop out by the end. But when we charge $60, there's almost no drop out at all. So what does that mean? What does it mean about what we value and how we value things? What does it mean? I don't know. So there are many ways actually of using mindfulness practice. It's been introduced, it's very popular now in the United States. It's particularly become popular in pain and stress reduction clinics. And there's been a whole movement now in hospitals all over to introduce mindfulness-based pain and stress management that comes very directly to rise as it came out of this Buddhist meditation practice by people who studied the Buddhist practice, extracurated, took the practice out of Buddhism and offered in hospitals so no one would recognize it as being Buddhism anymore. Well, it isn't Buddhism anymore, it's just a wonderful practice. So it's possible to do this practice for stress reduction, for pain management. It's possible just to help us cope a little better with our life, our anxiety and problems. It's also a spiritual practice and it's a very powerful spiritual practice for those who are interested in that part. So you can choose. It's being offered freely in a sense for you to use it as you would like. No one's being asked to become a Buddhist, no one's being asked to take it on as a spiritual practice, but that's certainly part of what is being offered. And those of you who are interested in that part of it can come and talk to me or find ways to incorporate that aspect into your life or into your practice also. So we will start with talking about posture. So mindfulness meditation is about feeling at home in our presence, is cultivating presence and awareness in the present moment and somehow feeling composed or at home within ourselves as we've experienced ourselves in the world around us. To do that, it helps to be somewhat composed or balanced or comfortable in one's posture. Posture is understood in Buddhism to be very important because posture is kind of an expression of and as a correspondence of our inner psychological or spiritual tendencies. I think it's no surprise perhaps that we have the English word posture for how we hold ourselves and the word posturing. People here, they're posturing for position or the notes. There's a way in which our posture expresses a lot. So we want to take a posture which helps us conducive to being both comfortable and at home with ourselves and also alert those two things. Most people, if you think about comfortable posture, it means you kind of sprawl out on the couch. But rather, a comfortable posture is one where the muscles can be aligned and upright but not tense. So one of the best ways of sitting traditionally is to sit on the floor cross-legged this way. You don't have to sit this way. It's fine to sit in a chair. But I'll start by giving instructions for how to sit cross-legged. The idea of sitting cross-legged, the value of it, part of it, is that it gives you a very stable base to sit with because you have a tripod. You have your two knees and your butt. And tripods are fairly stable. So the stability of a tripod allows you to hold your back up fairly easily compared to almost any other way of sitting. Can someone open the door back there? So the idea, the way to sit cross-legged on the floor is to sit kind of the way that I'm sitting now, if you can see it. And that is to sit with one leg flat in front of the other. There are other ways of sitting, but this I recommend is usually the best way of sitting. With none of the legs not crossing each other, just one in front of the other like this. Part of the reason for this is that it's probably the most symmetrical way of having legs. If we don't sit symmetrically, then there's a tendency of listening to one side. And then if you want to sit straight, so that means you have to kind of straighten out, and then there's kind of a curve in the lower back. You're stretching your body and kind of one side of the body more than others, and that becomes a yoga teacher's nightmare. So you want to sit in a symmetrical way. Now it's possible to sit the other ways. There's sitting what's called half lotus, putting one foot up on the other thigh, but again here you're leaning to one side. It's possible to sit full lotus, which is kind of the classic way of sitting, at least in the sculptures, statues. And that's with both legs up on the thighs. And this is fairly symmetrical, but not as symmetrical as the way I showed you. And most of you can't sit this way. So this actually works fairly well. In sitting this way, it's best to sit up on a cushion of some sort. Because if you sit flat on the ground, the tendency is for the lower back to cave out. And then the lower back gets tired, and then it gets tired, and then it hurts, and then it goes out. So if you sit up on something so your hips are higher than your knees, then it creates a little bit of curve in the lower part of your back. It's easier to stay upright for some time. And also it allows you to tip the pelvis forward a little bit. If the pelvis goes forward, kind of tips forward, it's easy to get the knees down and have that tripod. So there's various ways of sitting. Many people like to sit on these round cushions called zafus, and they're available. Alison here, she actually sells them. She has kind of a mail order or whatever. And it's probably the cheapest way of getting it in this area is to get it from Alison. But if you sit on these round ones, what you want to do is most people have a tendency of sitting right up on top. The idea is to sit on the front third of it. Because then you're sitting on the slant so it tips the pelvis forward and creates a little bit of a curve in the lower back. If you can't get your knees down, then you can experiment with sitting higher. Usually it's a matter of opening the hips, not of stretching the knees. If the hips are too tight, then it's hard to get the knees down. But if you sit higher you are, the easier you get the knees down. Within a trade-off, because at some point you're sitting so high it becomes a slide and you slide off. And if it wasn't for the sliding effect, all of us could sit this way, but at a certain height. So you can experiment with different heights. Some people like to sit on knees, crescent moon pillows. That's just another way of sitting, which is sometimes nice. If you can't get your knees down, but you're sitting more or less this way, what you can do, like for you, you could probably do it if you sat a little bit higher. But if you couldn't, what you could do is you can put something, this is too fast, but you can put something and prop it up underneath your knee so your knee is not hanging in the air. And so that kind of can take some of the strain off. So then we want to sit in the way that your back is straight. Again, there's a correspondence with our inner life and with the way we hold our posture. And because of that, the encouragement in Buddhism at least is not to use a back rest when you meditate, because the idea in Buddhism is to become self-reliant. And if you're not being self-reliant physically, it's a little bit harder to find that inner self-reliance. But if you need to use a back rest, there's no problem with using it. And many people need to use it, and it's fine to use it. But if it's possible to avoid it, then it's best to avoid it. Don't just use a back rest because you're lazy. So it is to have the back straight, and there's various ways to help you. You can take both kinds of hands or fists and put them either side of your hips on the ground and lift yourself almost off your cushion, and then have your chest come up. And then as you let go, let your shoulders roll back. And then you'll find yourself, I think, sitting a little bit more upright and easier and more open and more comfortable. Do you want to try this? Because this is extra. It's extra. Yeah, please. There's two of them here, if anybody else wants to try. And then it's nice to keep the head balanced on the shoulders, which means not having the head sticking forward too much or leaning to one side, but rather having it balanced. And the usual instructions is to take the chin and tuck it back and down slightly. And partly that instruction arises because when people think a lot in meditation, sometimes their chin goes up like this. And it's said that if you keep your chin down slightly, it controls the excessive mind that thinks too much, though you won't believe it. And another way of saying that is you create a little bit of space between the last vertebrae and your skull. It can help a little bit. In our tradition, we meditate with the eyes closed and we just gently close the eyes. And the mouth is kept closed, and it's best to keep the tongue resting up against the roof of the mouth. The hands can be in any posture, which is symmetrical. The usual Buddhist ways that have your hands together in front of you. And it can be resting on your heels or it can be held up by themselves. Some people prefer to have them held up in front of your belly button. Some people, if they sit this way, the way I've recommended, and have their hands on their ankle or on their heel, there's a tendency for the arms to pull the shoulders forward and it puts strain on the shoulders. And then what you can do is take a little pillow or something or roll up a towel and put it on your foot to hold your hands up a little bit higher. Or you can have your hands on your thighs, kind of on your knees, up or down or whatever way you want to sit. If you're sitting in a chair, again, it's best if it's possible not to use the backrest but to sit away from the backrest. It's fine to use the backrest if you need to. If you need to use the backrest, the preferred way is to use something that supports only your lower back. So if you press hard up against a cushion against your lower back and you get this very strong feeling in your lower back that keeps your upper back easily supported and upright, you want to mimic that if you have to use a backrest. Some people have to use the backrest for their whole back and that's fine also. You can do mindfulness in any posture at all. You can do it lying down. Some people can only do it lying down because they can't even sit. When you're sitting on a chair, again, it's best to have your knees lower than your hips. Sometimes people like to put a little cushion on their chair so they can kind of raise up a little bit. You want to have both feet squarely on the floor. So you're sitting in a solid place, both feet kind of parallel and squarely on the floor. Sit high enough so you get that little bit of strength or curve in the lower part of the back. That's why sometimes a little cushion can help. You certainly don't want to sit in such a way that you tend to slump out so that puts a real strain on your back. The rest is the same, keeping your back upright and your hands in whatever way you want and your eyes closed. The idea is to be comfortable, but the idea is to be both comfortable and alert and to take a posture that feels alert, but also doesn't put a strain or puts tension on your body. Any questions about posture? Anybody have any particular concerns? Yes? Do you have the hands rest on the knees? You can rest them on the knees. There's a tendency sometimes if they're on their knees themselves, it tends to pull the shoulders forward also. So you might experiment and it might be better for you to have them a little bit further back. Yes? The event of severe discomfort, is it that you should have a better focus on that thing? We'll talk about that next week. Until then, don't have any. But until then, you're welcome to shift your posture and just make yourself comfortable again. The idea of coming home and being intimate with oneself, being settled on oneself, being quite present in the present moment in a continuous fashion, is helped greatly by holding the body still. You don't need to hold the body still, but it really helps. So in formal meditation practice, it's really helpful to try to maintain the body still. So learning how to include discomfort as part of the meditation then becomes important rather than always running away from it. Some people will constantly fidget, constantly try to never find the right posture and always adjust and you'll never really settle on yourself. So for now you can change your posture and then next week the instructions might help. Yes? Would the present be very supposed to be like that? Like that? Half or third? Oh, sitting on the front half or the front third. There's quite a slope there. So you can just sit as you. I don't have a good sense except experiment. Yes? So whether you're just still working on that flexibility, but can sit comfortably, for example, with one knee, neck, is that an acceptable alternative? It's completely acceptable. And actually in Thailand, that's the way women meditate, sitting that way there. That's the women's meditation posture. There are other ways of sitting on the floor. One is you can take a pillow like this and put it between your ankles and sit down. And also this is a nice alternative. If you're getting tired of sitting cross-legged, you can sit this way. And some people sit on benches. Anybody have a bench today? There's these meditation benches you'll see sometimes. They allow you to sit on your knees this way also, but they support all your weight. So you don't have a lot of weight on your ankles and your knees. Anything else in the posture? Does it matter which leg goes in front? It doesn't matter so much unless you're a yoga teacher. And the yoga teacher, what the yoga teacher would say is every other time you meditate, you should alternate legs. Because even though it's relatively symmetrical, it's not completely. And you create a little imbalance if you're always sitting the same way. So yoga teachers are kind of like your moms. They usually know better, but you take their advice. So I leave it for you. And those of you in the chair, are you comfortable enough? Do you have the idea? So why don't we try it? We've been sitting for a while now, so if you want to take a minute or so to stand, just to stretch. And then I'll give you the first instruction. How about wearing glasses or things like that? For the last many years, I've kept my glasses on when I meditate. But the first ten years of meditation, I always took them off. So it's up to you. Alternate everything. And, Julie, some of these questions are good questions. But the spirit of mindfulness meditation is someone in the spirit of experimentation, investigation, of trial and error, where you become your own kind of authority for what works for you, rather than hearing from someone else how you do the practice. Actually, I believe no one can really teach you how to do mindfulness. The instructions I give you is really by necessity, is really pretty cursory. And the way that you learn is by trying it yourself. And then it becomes kind of a trial and error, and finding out what works for me, and how do I find my way to be most awake, most intimate, most present. I was kind of question about lying down. You just mentioned by the way you can do anything, speaking or even lying down. I just want to write down and let's know if this is just as effective in meditation. It can be just as effective. But what the tendency is when we lay down, is to fall asleep. It's a lot easier to fall asleep. If you never fall asleep, then it's less of a problem lying down. Some people need to do their meditation lying down, so it's fine. But if you don't fall asleep, it's more or less a fine thing to do. There are some other advantages to sitting this way. And I don't feel like going into them. They're more pragmatic advantages, nothing absolute. But there are some advantages to sitting this way, to almost any other posture. But if it works much better for you to lie down, please. But the interesting question is, how are you measuring how it works for you? That's the question. Because some people measure success in meditation by becoming calm or relaxed. And that's fine if you want to do that. But the point of this meditation is necessarily just to become calm or relaxed. The point of the meditation, because that's an experience, that's a way of being. The point of mindfulness is how do you hold your experience? So, for example, if I'm feeling angry, can I hold that anger in a gentle, accepting way? Or do I hate the anger and hate myself for being angry and desperately try to push it away or ignore it or do I hate it? Or repress it? Or blame myself for it? Or do I indulge in it and validate everything about it and validate myself for being angry and create an ideology to go with it? That's not a kind of open-handed, free relationship with it. It's the way we hold it is important. So if something about our present life is unacceptable to us and we're trying to change it, we haven't really learned how to hold it in a new way. So what happens when people use meditation to become calm and relaxed, which is a fine thing to do. But you notice that if you do that, then you might hold the calmness, the calm state with a little bit of attachment. And that little bit of attachment, if you do mindfulness practice in a consistent way and really mature in the practice, at some point or other, that little bit of attachment to calm, you'll realize that it's not to your best interest and you'll let go of it. But sometimes it might take a while to realize that. Okay. So take a posture, which is upright, alert, but comfortable. And close your eyes. And then at the beginning of a period of meditation, it's often nice to take a few deep breaths, two or three or four, using the breath to connect to your body as you breathe in and as you breathe out, relaxing, letting go. And then after a few deep breaths, you can breathe normally. And it's very important to realize that in mindfulness meditation, there's no particular way to breathe. It's fine to breathe whatever way you happen to be breathing when you sit down to pay attention to your breath. And then also at the beginning of a sitting, it's nice to go through your body and relax the larger muscle groups in the body that might be tense. So for example, you might start at the top of your body and relax your forehead. You might relax your eyes. It's nice to relax the shoulders. They might not relax much. They don't have to, but if it's easy, you can just let go. Sometimes you can relax and soften the stomach. Let the stomach hang out. It's considered inappropriate in our culture to have the stomach hang out, but in the culture of meditation, it's considered advantageous to let the stomach be soft. And then sitting here, how is it that your body experiences itself? As if the whole body was an organ of awareness, of perception. Can you drop down into your body and feel the body's experience of itself? Feeling the sense of presence within the body. And then within the body, as part of the body, can you become now aware of your breathing? Not so much thinking about the breath, but how does the breath experience itself? Where in your body are the sensations that tell you that you're breathing? And if you have trouble finding your experience of breathing in your body, you can put your hand on your abdomen and feel the rising and falling as you breathe. So as you find yourself breathing, let your awareness rest itself in this space. In this experience of breathing. As the mind wanders away and thinks and gets distracted, whenever you notice that, come back and bring your sense of being at home, being present. Bring back your awareness. And whenever your mind wanders away or gets distracted, that's fine. There's no need to judge it or be concerned. Even if for a thousand times in a period of sitting your mind wanders away, what's important is that each time you notice it, that you gently, softly settle the awareness again on the breath. Using the breath as a way of being in the present moment, cultivating presence, cultivating the ability to be present by connecting with your breathing. The secret of meditation is to be very simple, with no expectation of what's to happen. Not trying to make anything happen except being present, resting in the presence of the breath. Like you'd rest in the presence of the beloved. Thank you. Thank you. Allowing yourself to let go of your thoughts and concerns. Allowing yourself to be very simple. Feeling this in-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Letting your awareness follow the breath. Feeling the breath within the breath, within the body. Following the in-breath, following the out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. And there's no need to worry about how well you're doing. Just whenever you remember, come back to the breathing. As if the breath was going to guide you. Be your guide. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. And then we'll continue one last minute. In this last minute, be as intimate as you can with the experience of breathing. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath. Feeling this out-breath.

I just wanted to get any other suggestions about how to make a habit of daily meditation and how to improve that sort of thought. One is feeling that it's important enough for you, a priority enough. And how you figure out that it's a high enough priority is really up to you. Hopefully the instructions I gave and what I say about it somehow resonates enough that you for yourself realize, oh this is something I want to at least try out and it's important enough for me to try out. So being clear on your priorities and what's important for you in your life and not getting as distracted by all kinds of superficial priorities. It's very common enough you sit down and meditate and you realize, oh, I have to clean the refrigerator. And that becomes much more important than meditating. So not allowing such things to kind of get in the way. But having a set time if it's possible without your meditation time, it also can help to have a set place in your house. Sometimes like in a bedroom or something, if you take a corner and that corner is the only thing that happens in that corner is meditation. So it has associations and you keep it there so that it's always reminding you. It makes it a little bit easier to go and make that possibility. So, I don't know. Just do it. I just heard some news, all sorts of like when your hands are together, where one hand stops and the other one begins, not like they're all together. Meditating. This is a little bit getting ahead of ourselves from many people who are new. But one of the ways in which the mind works, it creates concepts of things. And the concepts of things is often what we're relating to, not what's directly happening. And concepts to some degree are flexible. It can be flexible. So for example, the difference between a stool is a foot stool and sometimes a stool, the same stool, is a stool to sit on. We have a concept we can apply to it or sometimes a table is a table and sometimes a table is a massage table and sometimes a table is a work table. I don't know if I'm making the point. But to some certain degree, concepts are more arbitrary than most people realize. But often the mind makes concepts of things and then it relates to the concept. What happens in meditation when we get very quiet, that functioning of the mind gets put a little bit to rest and we begin to experience how things are experienced directly, unmediated by concepts. When we experience things unmediated by concepts, then the normal conceptual understanding of things begins to dissolve. And sometimes in meditation then we have kind of strange experiences like you feel you don't see the beginning and the end of the hands. Or suddenly you feel like, anyway, it can be kind of unusual experiences happen in the body because we're not processing it through our normal concepts and just not to worry about. It's actually considered very useful. It's very important in mindfulness to learn the difference between how something actually is and what we think it is. And that's part of one of the insights that gets developed as we go into this and go deeper into it. To distinguish between the actual experience and our interpretation of the experience, the concept we have of the hands. And so with your example, you're able to relax enough so you're not adding concepts to your hand all the time. If you're not adding concepts to your hand, the normal ones, then the normal boundaries between the hands will, to some degree, begin to dissolve. Does that make sense? Yes? Well, one of the things you should be clear about is your partner really wants to do it. And don't try to finagle them into doing it or tell them what a good idea it is. But if they want to do it, I don't know. I think it depends. I don't know. Different people do it. I think it's nice to sit with someone, have company. I think it's very supportive to sit with people. But I know people who sit in different rooms. I actually prefer the common that I know of. It seems to be a relaxed thing. They like sitting in different places in the house and so that's what they do. My wife and I, we sit together. I usually sit down first and then sooner or later she joins me. I don't have anything to tell you about. I don't have anything to say. It's nice to have support. It's very nice to come to a weekly sitting group. That's one way to help sustain a regular meditation practice, is to come to a weekly sitting group because there's a tremendous amount of support and encouragement and learning that happens just with sitting with other people. So you're welcome to come here Wednesday or Thursday or Monday. There's other sitting groups around. There's a Zen Center in Mountain View. There's sitting groups all over the place now in San Jose. So find something that's compatible for you and get some ... Yes? Is there a text that you would suggest? There's several, four or five very nice introductory, more or less introductory books in mindfulness. This practice is called mindfulness meditation, sometimes called insight meditation. The Buddhist word is vipassana. Vipassana means literally clear seeing or special seeing. Two very basic nice books. One is called The Experience of Insight by Joseph Goldstein. Another one is A Gradual Awakening by Stephen Levine. A third one, which is very nice, it came out recently, is very moving because this person ... The first two are more like instructions. The third one I'll say now is ... He gives a lot of instructions, but also it's a lot of his personal account of how it was for him to practice and his great difficulties with his practice, and he had a very traumatic life. It's called In the Lap of the Buddha by Gavin Harrison. All three books should be easy to find. They're quite readable. Yes? It's kind of fallen away from this course. I used to do it, and I haven't for a couple of years. What happens is I do five weeks, and then the weeks after that I just continue, for those who want to keep coming. I just kind of continue with further instructions. Then usually at some point or other I'll cover walking meditation. Maybe I'm not doing the job the way I should, but the way it goes. There's ... Alison sells also tapes of talks and stuff that I give. One of the tapes she sells ... A series, she sells tapes from one of the introductory courses from a year or two ago. If you miss one of these, you could pick up that particular day from some years ago. It's basically the same stuff. I think also in that series you have one on walking meditation. If you can't wait, get the tape. The breath is ... Mindfulness of the breathing is very useful to do, not only as a meditation practice, but as a grounding technique throughout your day. If you find yourself the safe way in your supermarket line, nothing else to do but look at the National Enquirer, then instead, you might just sit there and just follow your breath. Stand there and be with your breath. If you're at a stop sign, or a stop sign usually, but it may stop light, just be with your breath a little bit. Take a few minutes in the middle of the day at work and just take a ... It's called a breather, right? Take a couple of minutes just to be very gently, softly with your breath. It's very helpful, I think, of doing those two things. Strengthen your presence and leaving yourself alone and relaxing a little bit. Any other concerns or questions? This core ... As you say, mindfulness practice doesn't require you to meditate formally this way. You can do mindfulness practice without just using this as a tool in your daily life. The instructions over the next weeks will really show you how it can be a tool in your daily life. You don't have to do the meditation if you don't want to do it, but it really works best. The way that this kind of course, five-week course, works best is if you do follow the instructions for the week and imply it at home, once a day at home at least. For this next week, if you're new, sit for 15 minutes. If you're not new, you might sit for longer. Just really focus on mindfulness and the breathing, being at ease, being simple, not worrying about anything, just coming back to the breath, being within breath, not worrying about being scattered most of the time whenever you remember to come back to the breath. Then if you do that for this one week, then it'll become easier to incorporate the instructions for next week when we talk about how to include the body. Also, I'm very eager to get some feedback from people about how it is as you try this out. It could just be some feedback or some reports of how it is or a little bit of your difficulties or the delights about it or whatever. I know, so I speak to your concerns and where you're at rather than just me going on and on and on. At the beginning of each class, I'll ask anybody if anybody has any comments or reports or something you want to say. Okay? So thank you all.
