 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. It can be helpful at the beginning of a sitting to simply arrive. Let yourself take some time to remember yourself in this moment. Sitting in this body, in this place, in your room, wherever you are, at this time. Being with yourself in this moment. And perhaps also to connect with an intention or a remembering of the value of this practice of being with yourself. Being present. How helpful it is, how supportive it is, not only to do it in these formal ways, but how that supports us throughout our day. These connections, connection with ourselves being here and reminding ourselves of the value. This is not intended to try to create pressure on the mind, but more to help it remember why it might want to be present. Even if what is happening might be a little challenging at times. We learn the value, we experience the value of being with the difficulty and see the mind can be more at ease with the difficulty when it's present with it, than when it's not present with it, when it's caught in the difficulty, struggling with or against the difficulty. And so remembering the value. Perhaps also connecting with relaxation of body. How helpful that is. Relaxation of mind. Silence. And perhaps using to support relaxation. A gentle inclination or invitation to relax. Dropping a thought of maybe the body can relax or may the body relax into the mind and body and see. How does the mind and body respond to that invitation? Rather than trying to do relaxation, essentially taking a relaxed approach to relaxation rather than a doing approach. Maybe the body can relax. Maybe the mind can relax. Not opening to receive whatever is happening, whatever is obvious in experience. You could, if it's supportive for yourself, choose to connect to a particular area of experience such as the breath or hearing. And receive that. Just allowing it to come to our senses, allowing the breath to contact the body, and then being aware of how that is happening. Where with hearing, sounds will contact the ear and we can simply receive the sense, the field of the sense, will receive that experience. Not much we need to do to make that happen. Our bodies, our minds know how to do this. Know how to feel, know how to hear. So receiving. Or some of you, receiving whatever is obvious, not necessarily choosing a particular field of experience, but just settling back and taking in body sensations, sounds. Perhaps other sensations, smells or tastes. Or if your eyes are open, sights. Allowing the senses to do their work and simply aware. Receiving. Whatever is obvious. A field of senses in Buddhist psychology also includes the sense of the mind. And so this receiving also includes receiving thoughts, emotions. Best aware perhaps of those coming through being received by our senses. A mindfulness instructions around the senses encourages us to get to know the senses themselves. The contact of pressure, heat, the body. The contact of pitch and tone in the ear. The awareness of a thought arising or an emotion arising. And also to get interested in when there might be resistance or craving. Kind of a push-pull around what is coming to the senses. Perhaps there's a sound. Maybe we like it or we don't like it. The awareness of that relationship to our senses. Then when we become aware of a relationship to our senses, liking that is happening, not liking or stronger, aversion, anger, fear, confusion. When we become aware of that, we are then aware of the sense of the mind. So we're right in the encouragement. Know what's happening. We don't necessarily have to try to fix it or change it. Sometimes our mind can simply hold that, oh there's that sound happening and not liking is happening. And the basic encouragement for our mindfulness practice is really simple. Relax. Be with yourself. And recognize what is obvious. With a little bit of interest about how we are relating to what's obvious. Silence.
