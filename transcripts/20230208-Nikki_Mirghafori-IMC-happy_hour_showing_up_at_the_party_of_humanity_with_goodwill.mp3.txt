 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Here we go. Great. So hello and welcome everyone. Welcome to happy hour. Lovely to be with you. Lovely to see you. So first I would like to make an announcement. And the happy announcement is that happy hour is going to be continuing to be offered five days a week. And yay. And with Diana stepping out, stepping away as the co-leader for Tuesdays and Thursdays, Liz Powell has accepted our invitation to step in as a co-leader and take over the Tuesday and Thursday. And those of you who are on the happy hour, Google groups have already received a note earlier today. Thank you for sending that out, Neil. In some bio background about Liz and you've probably already met her at happy hour. She's been a regular sub at happy hour. She's lovely, deep practitioner, deeply dedicated to service at IMC and IRC. And just so absolutely delighted that she will be stepping in to support the Sangha.

So please give her a warm welcome when she comes in the chat as well as in the Google groups and a warm, mental, filled welcome. We're just absolutely delighted, yay, that she'll be supporting happy hour. So, so with that important announcement out of the way, I'm going to invite us to start meditating together and the theme will be will be introduced during the meditation. So let's begin together. Let's sit together. So arriving. Ah, arriving. Taking our seat, taking our seat on this earth. Taking our seat in this moment, however it shows up. It's not a mistake. It's not a problem. This is what is presenting itself, this opportunity for being alive, for learning, for growing, or cultivating, for serving. So opening our heart to whatever is present right now and relaxing around it. Relaxing your heart, your body. Calming, soothing, settling the heart. With just quiet breath being received. Just this breath, just this in breath, just this out breath. Thank you. Letting go of whatever is not needed right now. Lots, preoccupations. Not needed. Thank you. Please come back later, not now. I'm giving my heart to itself with the breath in the body. It might be helpful to feel a particular part of the body, maybe the hands or your feet or your abdomen, to help get settled. Thank you. Picking refuge. And the breath of simplicity, of just sitting and being breathed. Release, release, smilingly. Thank you, not now. I am doing my best. I am doing my best. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'd like to invite you, if you wish, to imagine you are at this gathering, this party, this convivial gathering of beings, of many beings, of many many beings, those who were born and have passed away, those who are alive, those who haven't been born yet. You are in this gathering, this communion, this party of these beings, past, present, and future. Perhaps you're dancing, or those who passed away. You may know them, you may not know them. Other people, other beings in this world who are alive, you may know them, you may not know them. You may know them, and you may know them. You may know them, and you may know them. You may know them, and you may know them. You may know them, and you may know them. You may know them, and you may know them. You may know them, and you may know them. You may know them, and you may know them. You may know them, and you may know them. You may know them, and you may know them. You may know them, and you may know them. You may know those from your past, from the past, you have some appreciation for them, gratitude. Those in the presence, in the present time, alive in this world, you have met good will. You may know them, may you be safe, mere beings, may you be happy, may you be healthy, may you have ease, just as I wish it for myself, I wish the same for you, may all of us have well-being. And those who are not born yet, wishing them all the goodness in the world. They'll have their own challenges, surely, just as you have yours and this generation and those in the past. It's celebrating that we are all intertwined, we are and this together, sharing metta for yourself, for others, past, present, future, in any way that works for you. And you are leaning into any aspect of this image that works best for you and definitely seeing yourself as part of the party. You are part of this. Of course you are. You're a human being. You're not separate. You might see, or feel, you're not separate. That's a delusion. May all beings be well. May my love be of service. With each breath, stay embodied. Share your metta with each breath. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And we see our life, the thread of our life. This fabric of humanity intertwined with all the other threads. This important thread, every single one important, unique. Doing our part. Intertwined, threaded. May all beings, may all threads be well, be free, including myself. Taking your place, taking your seat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sit to a close, acknowledging our place and all of humanity. I am alive. I am here. I am here. I am here. I am here. I'm here for everyone, my own awakening and everybody else's and all things people. May all things be free, including myself. this and exploring this image, this practice with me. Using different perceptions, perspectives can be quite opening in a way of, you know, for especially caught in our little problems or big problems, just opening it up. Oh yeah. Wow, I am part of humanity. Past, present, and contributing. How can I show up as best as possible, opening, opening our perspective, our perception? So I'd like to invite us as we engage in small groups together, the question, the question I'd like to invite us to practice together with, really, it's breakout groups are breakthrough groups. Break out rooms are breakthrough rooms is where we can have these conversations or hold space or just hold space. And some of the people you're in the party with in this imaginary party with, guess what? Some of those people are present in different parts of the world and are going to join you in these breakout rooms. So you're going to dance with them. You're going to appreciate their uniqueness and you're going to bring your own uniqueness and wish them well. They wish you well. So showing up and the prompt is if you like to share something about this meditation practice, if there was an aha moment, it's a challenge, and there's no right or wrong, maybe just fell asleep and that's perfectly fine. Show up as you are. Show up as you are with your full humanity, with your beautiful full humanity, with your humility. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Let's go reverse alphabetical order. And what else? Yeah, make sure you just say, maybe a minute of share or a few sentences and leave space for others. Leave space for others to share without asking questions, without directing the group. Really just show up with what you want to share and then step back, let somebody else share. And you can also hold silence with metta. It's just a great opportunity to practice together. Okay. I've created breakout rooms and I'm going to open them up and take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Here we go. Okay, the rooms are closed. Everybody's back. Welcome back, everyone. We've got minutes for maybe just one or two reflections. You can type them in chat or raise your Zoom hat, especially if you haven't spoken recently. I'd love to hear from folks who may not have spoken, just balancing the voices a bit. So what did you notice? What came up? Either during the meditation or in the small groups? Arora, please. I'm daring myself to speak today. I read this Rumi poem this morning. This just came up and reminded me of this exercise. So this is just a little bit of it. On every trip have only one objection. Objective. To meet those who are friends inside presence. If you stay home, keep the same purpose. To meet the innermost presence as it lives in people. I don't know. I just felt like in my group, I was just feeling my group members' goodness. It felt really sweet. That feels really sweet. Thanks for sharing. Yeah, beautiful. Your experiences, the sweetness inspired by the Rumi poem translation and the meditation, the theme. Thank you. Abraham, our last reflection. Oh, sorry. I don't know. You didn't intend to raise your hand? I saw it at 7 o'clock. Actually, no, that's fine. I'm actually experimenting with 15 minutes, but it's all good. But please, go ahead, Abraham. What's up? I really liked your direction to see our uniqueness in a vast field of beings, whether we knew them or didn't. As you know, and a lot of people here might not, but you know, I've been losing my hearing. And I used to be quite a musician and an actor and very extroverted and involved with people. And I've been struggling with, you know, I should just retire to a room. And I just, I like what my friends are saying to me about the joy that I bring, and how the friendship I have, and how friendly I am. And it warms my heart. And frankly, I would rather be a super friendly human being than a really great musician. So I just really like that emphasis on seeing ourselves and taking in something and having that to offer to others. So I liked it. Thanks. Oh, thank you, Abraham. Thank you so much for sharing that. I couldn't have said it any more beautifully than you just did. And to paraphrase you, I'd rather, I think you said something like I'd rather, gosh, how did you say this? I'd rather have met, I'd rather be known for my goodness and kindness and goodwill than be a great musician, just be known for that. And beautiful. I feel moved. Thank you so much for sharing that. And also, I see people are giving thumbs up and hearts. That's quite lovely. And it reminds me of a quote by, who was it who said this? I'll tell the quote, and I'm sure one of you will remember who said it. It's an African American woman poet, that people won't remember what you say, but how you make them feel. So that's what's remembered. And it's the author of the, even the Caged Bird Sings. Oh my God, I have these associations. I can't remember her name. Drawing a blank. Anybody in chat? Maya Angelou. Maya Angelou. I actually went to see her. And yeah, many, many years ago when she came to Berkeley, it was quite powerful. So yes, people remember how you make them feel and how we remember how we make others feel and vice versa. Beautiful. So celebrating Metta. Thank you all. Thank you for engaging with this practice and showing up to the party of humanity with your Metta, with your goodwill, nothing else needed. Just wear that cloak. That's all that's needed. So thank you all. Thank you for your practice, for your cultivation, for your showing up. May all beings be well. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Thanks everyone. Be well.
