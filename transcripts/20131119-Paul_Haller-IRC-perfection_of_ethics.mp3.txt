I was just realizing this is the first time I've given a Dharma talk in this room.
It's kind of exciting.
The immersion of a meditation retreat is
an extraordinary and somewhat mysterious event.
My own experience is that over the years, having done several of them,
the basics always apply.
It's come back to presence, don't struggle against your experience,
preserve your diligence and dedication, and don't get in your own way.
And then as you do them, you just start to discover the kind of yogic journey that's engaged.
First two or three days depend upon a number of factors.
There's one sutra that talks about the 37 factors of a wikin.
So if you've heard of the seven and thought, okay, I could handle that,
multiply it by six or five.
There's many factors coming into play.
Some of them we can attend to deliberately, some of them
we give over to without quite knowing what it is we're going over to.
It's a very interesting process.
Probably everybody in this room by this point has experienced,
whether they noticed or not, that they sat a period of meditation
and it felt a little swampy or a little heavy or something.
And then they walked out the door, walked on the stairs,
and it felt lighter or a little easier to be present or a little brighter.
The mind was a little brighter.
It's an interesting way that we're engaging or being
below consciousness, below our cognitive process,
not below consciousness, below our cognitive process.
And if you're like Gil and I, and foolish enough to spend time looking at all the different approaches
that have arisen, and you say, oh, in this school, this is emphasized.
In Rinzai Zen, this energetic application is emphasized.
This is how you engage and stimulate awareness.
I'm not quite sure how to characterize Tibetan Buddhism.
It's so vast where every other, it seems to include many of the other schools.
But it's interesting to me to listen to Gil and reflect on what makes the most sense to me.
And I hear a resonance. There's something fruitful in setting a stage externally and internally,
a stage that allows the natural attributes of our being to flourish and support awakening.
And here's a poem that, to my mind, comes at this in an interesting way, a short poem.
It's hard not to love the world, but possible.
When I'm like this, even the swallows are not God, even the yellow school bus,
even the children inside wanting to get out are not God.
The poet's name is Jim Moore.
Something in us that brings us here, something in us
upholds Buddha Dharma Sangha, even if we don't use those words.
There's something in our being that has drawn us to this way
and invited us. It made sense to us to make this sort of dedicated heroic commitment.
Something in us, as the poet says, that loves the world, that wants our life and all life to
blossom. Not to say that's how we're living all the time, not to say that we're always
imbued with the attributes of that or seeing the world with those kind eyes and kind heart,
but still something in us brought us here with that kind of virtuous endeavor.
And that kind of virtuous endeavor, as the poet says,
is inversed. With that endeavor, the yellow school bus has its own being, it has its completeness.
Whether you want to say that's God or anything else, it doesn't really matter. Call it what you want
and the swallows and the children in the bus not wanting to be in the bus.
They're too alive to be held back, to be contained in some artificial restriction.
And even that attribute of the human personality we can cherish.
And how do we offer that kindliness, that spaciousness, that generosity to ourselves?
In a way, this is the invitation of the first parameter, that kind of generosity.
That the whole of existence is about giving and receiving. The yellow school bus
is precious and the person receiving it is receiving a gift and bestowing upon it
a precious gratitude.
There's a little chant in Zen where we say, giveer, receiver and gift are intertwined.
They arise into this intimate relationship through generosity, through gratitude,
through giving and receiving.
Something in us knows it, something in us feels it, something in us lives it.
And then as the poet says, it's hard not to love the world but possible.
We are seemingly capable of thinking and feeling and acting in contradiction to that.
And so the second parameter is sila, virtue, sometimes morality, but I would say closer
to its heart, it's the way of being that maybe a poetic way to say would be draws the best out of us.
A way of being that sets this stage for that to blossom.
And part of what I think both Gil and I have been saying is this way of coming at retreat,
coming to retreat, being in retreat, this respect
for our innate being.
The simple skillfulness that just addressing our human dilemma.
Okay, we're capable, we're completely capable of these wonderful things
and yet we draw in and we give out all sorts of other kind of negativities and resistance
and confusions.
So one half of sila we could say is upholding this virtue and then the other half of sila is
how do you work skillfully with this?
And it does seem like most of us, if not all of us, our minds get more attracted to the struggle,
the shortcoming, the feeling of empowerment. We're giving and receiving seems either distant
or dangerous or inaccessible or even just unappealing and in a way the practice is very simple.
Yes, yes, what is happening is happening
rather than no, it's not what I wanted. No, I don't like it. No, I'd rather it was different.
No, what was that? I was too busy with some notes.
As I think we all discover it at a certain point, one of the first rewards we get from
practicing awareness is that we get closer to our no.
And that's a very delicate proposition for us. That no is not simply because we're lazy, mean
spirited, stupid people. Somewhere in that no is the dilemma of our life.
How is it that as I search for intimacy, I separate?
How is it that I uphold the virtue of giving and receiving?
I experience it as dangerous or unappealing at times.
How is it that as I deeply and sincerely wish to be grounded upright, open and awake
when I enter into that mandala, all hell breaks loose.
And in part of the yogic journey of practice
is to enter that fire, sitting here rather comfortably, well fed, it's not too cold, too hot.
It doesn't seem such an intimidating or offensive proposition.
But we know from our practice that it seems like it brings us right to the edge.
Maybe it feels like it pushes us over the edge. This is more than I can handle.
I'm not good enough. However, no takes shape.
So, in a way, the discipline of Silla asks us to be
sincere about taking care of ourselves. It asks us to be sincere about
believing in our own capacity for generosity.
It asks us to be sincere about being willing to bring a benevolence to our own process.
And it's certainly my experience as a student and also as a teacher,
something extraordinary paradoxical for us. When we taste that, when we feel that we all
sigh with relief and maybe even a tear, this is such a source of benefaction,
such a generous invitation for well-being. And the paradox is infusing our practice with it
seems so mysteriously difficult. And yet I would say not to skip over it or trivialize it,
take it for granted, but more almost with a compassionate patience. Take yourself by the hand
and remind yourself. Benevolence, generosity, patience,
it helps to create a steadiness. It's like when the mind and the heart become agitated,
the factors like courage and trust, they like fly out the window in that agitation.
They're replaced by mean-spirited, judgmental, critical mind and heart.
So one aspect, one very significant aspect of Silla is
in this positive regard, in this upholding the virtuous engagement of practice.
Virtuous in that it sets a conducive environment, it sets the stage in a positive way.
In a way, we're even the yellow school bus, we're even standing in line to go to lunch,
you know, has its own extraordinary appeal. And we listen to the bell being hit and we bow.
And something about the interconnectedness of life is obvious. We feel it. It's right there.
It doesn't need any explanation or definition. We're part of it, we're the recipient of it.
And Silla extends like this, you know, that we create the environment and we participate in
the environment, you know, the conduct of how we behave when we're on a retreat.
Close the door quietly because if you slam it, it might be disturbing to someone else.
But as you close the door quietly, you experience your own thoughtfulness and
carefulness and generosity, you know, so you receive a gift.
And the absence of a loud frightening noise for someone else, they receive as gift.
And the environment becomes safer for us all.
And those more vulnerable and tender parts of us
start to consider, often not in our conscious mind, start to consider,
hmm, this may be a place where it's okay to be. This may be a place where the usual preoccupations
can be allowed to start peeling off, where the visceral holdings in the body and in the heart
and in the mind can start to soften and loosen. So Silla reaches out into the environment
and that reaches back into this extraordinary way of being that's increased, that's heightened,
that's sensitized when we enter retreat. There's a way in which, you know, this poem
in its inverse, you know, this way of loving the world where the world shines in its own being. A
lot of the time the journey to that place is through territory where the world doesn't shine.
And it's through territory where there isn't a shining, simple, obvious expression.
There's something more complex and difficult,
clouded and obscured by the contracted and painful workings of our being.
And that's the territory we journey through. And to do that journey,
the supportive environment, the trusting environment
support us, help us, bring us into it.
There's a way in which we will only fall apart when it feels safe to do so.
I remember once I was in an environment where a lot of trauma had happened,
and actually it was where I grew up, but then there was a time when all this civil unrest
and sectarian violence had caused all that trauma very fortunately and blessedly really diminished.
And in that diminishment, then the post-trauma disorder arose up. It was like when there was
active violence and you actually needed to be careful to stay alive and keep your loved ones alive,
it was too dangerous to fall apart. And the danger goes down and then something else.
Our Zen teacher that I know, Gil and I both know him well, he worked as a therapist with
homeless people and he did it for about 11 years. And if you've asked him, well, how does it affect
you seeing all the raw, ugly side of what can happen? And he said, oh, I'm handling it pretty well.
And then he retired. And then after about six months,
he noticed all these difficult symptoms. Now it was safe to unwind all that had been pent up.
So in a way, we're creating an environment so you can fall apart.
Or to put it another way, we settle into our unsettledness. The things that we've been holding
at bay, the things that was too dangerous to let ourselves feel, even the yearnings
that we stayed busy so they couldn't tug on us. Well, guess what? Now you've got all the time
for that to happen. And this is why the basics are so valuable. I remember working with
several teachers, you know, in going to them and wanting some grand solution to the turmoil of
the pain I was in. Keep going. Stay with the basics. Pay attention to it. Notice it. Feel it.
Keep going. So this aspect of Silla, it supports
with benevolence and it supports with this aspect of discipline. Stay with the practice.
And maybe we could say, invite in those moments. Because if you pay attention,
you'll notice even if something murky, difficult, painful is happening, still
you walk down the stairs, maybe outside, and something comes forth.
The vitality of being has been quickened even in the murky contraction.
So even as we turn towards what inevitably arises out of karmic life,
we still uphold the moments where the virtue of the world shines. They may be small.
They may be just the way you notice someone doing walking meditation.
A gentle, steady presence.
And it reminds you, you have this great gift of Sangha. You're with like-minded people.
They're not looking at you funny. They don't think you're weird for doing this. They're doing it too.
So this is this ride. This is the aspect of Silla. And then the other aspect of Silla is
the yogic internal alignment. This is where, as we set the stage that something in us can come
forth and say, let it be. If this difficult feeling comes, let it be. If this annoying
pattern of mind that always seems to be poking at something in a negative way, let it be.
This sense of contraction emotionally, somatically, let it be.
The nature of our mind and other aspects of our response is to
fix it, control it, point out what's wrong with it.
And normally that kind of energy is being displaced out. Some of it is always we save
for ourselves, but a lot of it we displace out. But as you get on retreat and you're not talking,
it's a whole lot more difficult to blame others. You get a bigger experience of yourself.
And with this let it be, rather than create a complexity of
what can happen for us. You start to exhibit a certain expression of being,
and then you want to push it down. Maybe you just simply want to sit there calmly
with some concentration. So you push down the unruliness. But pushing down unruliness,
it's a little bit like pushing a ball underwater. It's just going to find some other way
to come up. Or you push it down, and when you stop pushing down, it pops up anyway.
And then internally that creates its own more complicated way of being.
It stirs us up.
It makes, yes, a more elusive word.
No seems to be a more appropriate response to the occasion.
So the internal aspect of Silla is how do we start to create,
how do we start to manifest this alignment? Or what we might say, the benevolent vow of practice
starts to connect to, flow through the workings of a karmic life.
And in the language of Zen, this is the great khan of our existence. This is the great inquiry.
In some ways,
saddled, open, grateful presence is very simple. It's like, here it is, fine.
The karmic world is so complex. It has so many concerns, so many difficult emotions,
so many places where we're hesitant, resistant, find it difficult to connect to.
And yet it sees very characteristics where we discover how to practice.
How do you discover how to let go? You discover it by noticing where you're holding tight.
And how do you discover by generosity? You discover where fearful holding back
seems to be the most appropriate response. And how do you study these things? You study them
by getting close and experiencing what's happening. It's not making up ideas,
it's not conjuring up potential, possible causalities. It's getting close to experience
directly what's going on. And in our practice, we have this notion,
citta-bhavana, cultivation of consciousness. The body, the breath, the mental disposition,
they are agents in this meeting and experiencing what's happening.
We engage
in experience to learn how to engage in experience.
We engage with the body, we engage with the breath, we engage with the mind.
And as we engage them, we're in a learning process.
And they become both a teaching and an agent in connecting to the complex attributes of a human
existence. It's a wonderfully called me. I remember reading somewhere,
Suzuki Roshi, you know, one of us talks, he said, we're also incredibly selfish. I think he said,
90 or 95 percent of our thinking is about me. So how wonderfully studying me is how the Dharma
rises. We're already there, so the first part's done. But the yoga of body, you know, the basic
yoga of body, stability, uprightness, openness, that can receive the breath,
that the flow of life through the body becomes constant teaching about the flow of life.
That the mind and the whole environment is always influx,
becomes a teaching about the vitality of life.
It becomes a teaching on how contact, awareness with what's happening,
isn't a static thing. It's closer to surfing, you know, it's constantly flowing.
Not to say that shamatha, single-pointedness, doesn't have its place,
but it's an agent in the process, in the inquiry of a persona.
And this existence is always influx. And so the investigation has this versatility,
this adaptability. So the basics become directed attention, receptive attention,
intertwined. We discover what kind of relationship they have. We discover how that relationship
comes into being in the service of awareness of whatever happens.
And this attribute of Sila,
we are the student to be taught by everything that arises.
And sometimes this is a wonderful support and technique. You know,
usually something arises, we've experienced it before, we're inclined to reintroduce
the usual emotional, psychological thought pattern. Oh, yeah, that again. Oh, yeah,
that always bothers me. And I always, whatever, and then I always, whatever, and then terrible,
terrible things happen. And is this practice ever going to work? I mean,
but just to come at it sideways. And what's happening?
And what's the experience that gives rise to that thought? And what are the details of the
conclusion that I'm creating? And how is that affecting the body?
And we learn, you know, when we bring that kind of investigation, we can learn from
a deeply painful emotion. We can learn from some insistent narrative that's going on in our head.
What am I saying? Who am I saying it to?
What's the underlying feeling that makes it so energized and determined?
And of course, when we put it into words, it sounds like, oh, and it's all about thinking.
Ask yourselves those questions in those articulated phrases, but as intimately as possible.
Can we draw it in closer than words?
It's already closer than words. Can we allow it to be that way?
In the place where we discover the yoga of closer than words is the body and the breath.
And one of the fierce teachers of intimacy and body and breath is the discomfort that
arises in our body. It's unpleasant in case you haven't noticed. Can we not contract?
Or maybe more modestly, can contracting not be the only thing we're doing?
Can we touch the sensation?
You know, that guided meditation guild was doing about the sensations in the hands.
It's not so much that you should be able to tick off all six characteristics he mentioned as
can you invite an intimacy of involvement that can notice these whatever characteristics you
notice? Can you invite an intimate involvement that goes beyond words?
Sometimes it's helpful, you know, to label tingling, throbbing.
Sometimes at a certain point that helps to draw us into the territory. It helps to draw us into
connection. But can it also draw us into contact, into experience the contact as contact?
And as we experience contact as contact,
something extraordinary can happen there. We can see that part of the contraction and the
pain and the discomfort in an amazing way is sort of self-generated. It's part of it is response to
unpleasant. And in a visceral way, we're starting to get at, we're starting to experience and learn
about some of the visceral aspects of dukkha. And as we start to get at that and we breathe into it
and we allow it, we're starting to experience some of the attributes of liberation.
And how interesting that this can happen in the CM territory
as the discomfort, the physical discomfort and pain that happens in our bodies.
But by no means to think that this is the only place, you know. We do ourselves an enormous
disservice if we think that, if we act like that, we will wear ourselves out. The moment when the
bell rings and you get to uncross your legs, that's a wonderful moment to pay close attention to.
Because there is also the release. There there's also floating, emerging, immersion into ease.
You can feel the way pain circulates the body and you can feel its tendency towards tension and
then you release it and you can feel this kind of influx of sukha, pleasant physical sensation.
You can feel how it softens the breath and softens the mind.
You can feel how it nourishes and reassures on a visceral level.
So this too, this is also chitta-bhava now.
And as we explore in this way, we're exploring this yogic alignment.
And as we explore this yogic alignment, we explore how it can offer an uprightness in the
complexity of a human life. We explore how it can add a sense of trust in the process.
I mean really what this whole process is asking of is like do the practice,
bring whatever arises into connection and awareness and it will unfold. How will it unfold?
Don't know. That's the marvelous complexity of being alive.
And if we were to fix on a goal, it would distract us from what's happening.
So in some ways we can say sila is to go beyond, go beyond
the fixed definitions of the condition. It takes us beyond it.
So it covers a range. It covers a range from
pay attention to how much sleep you get,
getting enough water to drink, enough food to eat,
just taking care of body and mind to this extraordinary subtle explorations of what's
possible within our human body. And as we attend to this human life with both of these,
and give them both the attention they deserve, this is a physically stressful thing to do,
what you're doing. It's physically demanding. Take care of your body.
Take care of its basic needs. It's just a practical thing.
And attend to these intimate yogic workings of your being too.
They're an extraordinary ally in the process of awakening. They will support, they will help
the stabilization, the energy, the attentiveness that our attributes.
What's the plan? What time are we supposed to end?
No? No, at five. What prompted me to say all that?
But I did. And I hope something in it was useful.
And don't worry if there were parts of it you didn't like or didn't agree with.
So what? Maybe there were parts you did like and you did agree with. Stick with those.
And also, maybe more interestingly, if there were parts of it that stimulated
that kind of inquiry, part of the human condition is a natural curiosity.
Usually we overdo it. We become too solidly connected to our understandings and our judgments.
And then that sort of trips us up. But that curiosity, that inquiry, that investigation,
what's going on? All the time, but gently,
when you sit down, what are you expecting to happen? Can it just be you wide open?
Can it be some part of you that just says, engage the basics and don't know what's supposed to happen?
Can it be some part of you that just says, this is a step by step process.
Whether arises is what is.
And what is it? That kind of step by step, willing to learn, willing to open.
Okay. If a good measure, I'll redo that a little poem again.
It's hard not to love the world, but possible. When I'm like this, even the swallows are not God.
Even the yellow school bus, even the children inside wanting out are not God.
