For this week, starting today, I ’ll be talking about the fifth 
of the five faculties  – the faculty of wisdom. The Buddhist 
word in Pali for wisdom is paññā . It can be translated in 
different ways. Sometimes it ’s translated as 
‘discernment. ’ Sometimes I ’ve rendered it as ‘insight. ’  
 
The advantage of words like discernment and insight, is 
that they  suggest the idea of an understanding, a seeing , 
that happens in the situations we ’re in. Wisdom can 
imply that we ’ve learned some knowledge, some 
understanding of how things work. And we bring that 
along with us in our life, and apply it or are rea dy to use

important. But we also have the capacity to see, to have 
a certain presence and attention in the present moment  
– to have a wisdom faculty operating, where we discern ; 
we see deeply into exp erience. So the truth of it gets 
revealed and understood in the moment , as it is. It ’s 
obvious  – that’s how it works. That ’s how it is.  
 
The wisdom faculty is a capacity we all have, meaning 
it’s just a natural functioning of our inner life. We all have 
this faculty. The word wisdom can seem somewhat lofty, 
and for some of us it may seem beyond reach because 
only great , wise people have wisdom. But the practice 
shows us that as we settle in and l isten deeply, as we 
have the capacity for real attention to what ’s going on, 
listening deeply to ourselves, deeply to the world – our 
psychophysical system will begin to discern what ’s 
happening. We ’ll begin to see more and more clearly 
what is happening s o that we can respond wisely in 
ways that are useful and supportive for us. This use, the 
application or the maturing of the wisdom faculty 
happens gradually over time. There ’s progress in the 
cultivation, development , and ripening of wisdom as we 
do this practice.  
 
For many people, the first form of this wisdom is the 
wisdom that arises in the forge of suffering  – in the great

 - 3 - difficulties and challenges of our lives. It ’s been said in 
the ancient Buddh ist teachings, that everyone comes to 
Buddhist practice through suffering , when  somehow 
things don’t  seem quite right. Something is 
uncomfortable . Something seems off. Something really 
hurts . It’s challenging , overwhelming, difficult. 
Sometimes the suffering that brings us to practice is 
when nothing else works. Everything else we’ve tried 
has not really helped us with the issues of our li fe.  
 
I had the experience of reaching rock bottom . All my 
attempts to find a way out of my suffering didn ’t work. So 
finally I tried just letting go, but even that didn ’t work. 
And finally, at rock bottom, I guess I let go in a fuller way 
than when I first tried  letting go. Basically, I just kind of 
gave up . And only then did the practice really arise in me  
– not because I applied myself , or understood what to do  
– but rather giving up in this very radical way tapped into 
a simplicity of being that wasn ’t my intention. I wasn ’t 
trying to do anything anymore, or be anybody, 
accomplish something, or defend myself. Ju st being in 
that space opened up a new possibility. And that new 
possibility inspired me greatly in doing the practice.  
 
I could give you a whole autobiography of all the 
different ways I ’ve suffered. And  for each of us , it would 
probably make an interest ing story, "The Autobiography

 - 4 - of My Suffering." Hopefully, the way that autobiography 
works in Buddhism would be seeing how the 
autobiography of my suffering led me into the practice – 
how it really inspired me to engage in a path that ’s 
meant to bring us to the other side of suffering  – to bring 
not just relief from suffering, but a full , deep release from 
it.  
 
The vehicle for doing that has a lot to do with our own 
capacity to see, to listen, to be mindful, and to be 
present for our experience. It ’s not easy. But it ’s a lot 
easier if we begin with faith (the first of the five faculties) 
– faith that when we’re listening deeply, when we’re 
present deeply, our whole psychophysical system does 
know the way towards healing . It knows the way to 
resolve things . It knows  the path to release  – the path to 
healing what ails us , given  the challenges we have.  
 
It’s a remarkable journey to step away from the story -
making person that we often are. Many times we’re in 
the story -making mind. That mind is very small. 
Sometimes it works well. It creates wonderful stories that 
are opening and freeing  – but it ’s a very limited part of 
who we are. And sometimes it’s too limited to really help 
us work through some of the great di fficulties we have. 
Certainly stories , ideas and memories are important. We 
can appreciate the m. But then we go beyond the  stories,

 - 5 - and quiet the mind enough so that we can open up, and 
really feel and be present, and sense what ’s here.  
 
If what we feel i s suffering, then the wisdom faculty is the 
discernment that says, "I ’m going to learn in a different 
way. I ’m going to find a different way to live this life ," and 
then to have faith that this is possible. There is a practice 
to be done. And we see that t he faculties of wisdom and 
faith are mutually supportive of each other. There ’s 
discernment , and the seeing possibility. We don ’t really 
know the outcome . We don ’t yet really have an 
experience for ourselves. But we have faith in th e 
possibility  – the discernment and insight that  says, "Yes, 
this is my suffering." We listen to it, rather than  cower ing 
from it, or seeing it as hopeless . We have the courage . 
Or we have  kindness  and compassion for ourselves. We 
hold our suffering with faith, wisdom, compassion, and a 
sense of possibility.  
 
One function of this initiating faith and initiating wisdom 
is that they teach us, "Yes, it ’s time to be present. This is 
the time to ho ld all this in attention, to listen deeply, to be 
present for our experience." This prepares us for h ow we 
find ourselves beyond that, and the practice keeps 
unfolding beyond this initial moment of discernment, 
insight, wisdom, and inspiration. “Yes, I ’m suffering, no 
doubt. It ’s okay to open widely, to make space for it, hold

 - 6 - it in the body just long enough so that I can be inspired. 
Yes, I ’m going to practice. ” 
 
And then part of the next step of wisdom is to have 
discernment of what the wise way is to be with our 
challenges and our suffering. Not only to open to it and 
feel it  – which can be overwhelming sometimes – but to 
have some wisdom and understanding of how to see the 
different options, how to be present for what is difficult, 
or how to be inspir ed, and how to take the next step with 
our suffering, how to practice with it. That would be the 
second form of wisdom , which  we’ll talk about tomorrow.  
 
But for today, I basically had two things in mind. One 
was to talk to you about the initiating wisdom . That has a 
lot to do with seeing suffering, and being inspired by our 
faith that there is an alternative : a possibility of freedom 
from suffering, release from suffering. That was one 
thing I was hoping to convey.  
 
The other was to be inspired to have f aith in that 
possibility. Then we have a kind of ballast, strength, 
settle dness , or rootedness , knowing  that this is a good 
thing to do , and that we can do it. That, I think, i s why 
the wisdom faculty follows the first four faculties . With 
just enough fait h, courageous engagement, mindful 
listening, and unification , being  gathered together  – this

 - 7 - bring s all of ourselves to the table of practice . Then we ’ll 
find our way with our suffering.  
 
So, whatever personal challenges you have, whatever 
suffering exist s in this world, may it be the forge, the 
seedbed, for the arising of both your wisdom and your 
faith.  
 
We’ll continue tomorrow. Thank you very, very much.
