 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. A warm welcome to everybody. It's nice to see you all. It's nice to practice with others. What about... I'm reading your post for everyone saying, after I zoom a bomb, or how funny does that such poor light? Yeah, so if something odd happens during this, so we'll just work with it. So tonight I wanted to share these verses that are from the Dhammapada. The Dhammapada is probably the most popular, most common text from the early Buddhism, from the earliest layer. It's been translated, I don't know, I've heard like maybe 20 times, 20 different translators, 25 different translators. And it's quite something to... I did do this for a little bit, comparing translations. They're wildly different. And maybe I'll just say a small thing about that. And that these are written in verse, and poorly in verse is done with a particular meter. You know, there has to be a long syllable in the third position and then a short syllable after that. There's different meters, but there's very specific rules about how the words can go. So in the same way that Shakespeare is in pentameter or something like that, the same thing is done with Pali. But in order for them to match the meter, they kind of like throw grammar out the window. And so they use... They're very creative with their grammar. Sometimes they don't use verbs or don't use objects or subjects. And so the translators really have to do a lot of work. And if your translator is either fantastic because you get to express your creativity here, or maybe it's just really terrible because you're trying to be precise with it. So just a little bit about the verse and Pali. And now I'm going to read one that I think is... I don't know, for me is touching. It's just four lines. And this is very common in Pali that some things will just be four lines. It's kind of like a standard size. Here it is. And for those of you who care about these things, this is verse number 80 in the Dhammapada. And it goes like this. Just as a farmer irrigates a field, as a Fletcher fashions an arrow... I didn't know that this word Fletcher is the name of somebody who makes arrows. So I'll start from the beginning. Just as a farmer irrigates a field, as a Fletcher fashions an arrow, as a carpenter shapes wood, so the wise person tames themself. It's very interesting. So all these, the farmer, the Fletcher and the carpenter, they're, like I might even say, defined by what they do. You're getting a field. At that moment you're a farmer. You're making, fashioning, shaping an arrow. At that moment you're a Fletcher. Working with wood, carpenter. Maybe we could today use different words of woods maker, wood worker. But taming oneself is a wise person. And so, and we can, to be sure, right, the same, this could be the same individual, the farmer, the Fletcher, the carpenter and the wise person. And I don't think that there's just one thing that identifies a person and that's how they are all the time and forevermore and something like this. But this idea of what you're doing, the activities you're doing being associated with how you're, how other people know you perhaps, how you might know yourself at that time. Just as a farmer irrigates a field, as a Fletcher fashions an arrow, as a carpenter shapes wood, so the wise person tames themself. So this word, tames, gets translated different ways. I think it's looking at the etymology, I think it's probably a good translation to do, tames. And I kind of like this word, tames, because it acknowledges, dare I say, the wildness that sometimes we have within us, right? This part that's untamed that seems like it's going, whichever way it's going in response to what it wants or what it doesn't want or something like this, right? It's not that our inner life is neat and tidy and logical and these types of things, but instead it has a certain amount of wildness, some non-linearity, some feeling threatened or wanting to defend or something like this. So, and taming, it's a little bit different than domesticating, let's say. Taming, isn't removing the wildness, isn't turning this individual, this creature, this being into something it isn't. Instead, it's just directing the energy of this wildness in a more helpful direction, maybe dialing it down in a way that's helpful. They don't become horses, maybe they become wild horses. They don't become tigers or something, of course, right? They're still horses, but maybe have this different behavior. I say this never having tamed a horse, nor have I ever seen wild horses. So, but just the idea that they don't get transformed into something different. It's just a redirection. And so, in this way, a wise person tames themselves. They recognize that's in the way that energy or movements of the mind, movements of the heart, movements of speech, actions of speech, that maybe aren't so helpful. So, we just tame them. We turn them in a certain direction. We turn down the volume of certain aspects, maybe turn up the volume of other aspects. I know that sometimes people feel that this word taming is problematic. My wish here is to point to the positive sides of this, just this recognition that shaping maybe is right up where this verse here is using kind of like shapes. So, maybe taming is like shaping, but I chose taming to highlight that, just to kind of honor that part of ourselves, which feels wild. So, what I love so much about practice is just honoring and respecting all parts of ourselves. We're not asked to be completely somebody we're not. We're not asked to trans-morgify ourselves into something different. But just to recognize, we could use a little bit of taming. And of course, I'm going to talk about how loving kindness practice is a way in which this taming can happen. This directing the mind again and again and again, loving kindness to warm heartedness to just warmth, care, respect. It's a way in which the mind becomes familiar with, comfortable with, and can really start to recognize that some of the ease, some of the peace, some of the well-being that comes with loving kindness, metta, may have greater access, easier access than when we practice. So, one way to tame is to let that wild heart, the wild mind inside of us just recognize, get accustomed to warm heartedness, some settledness, some peace and well-being, maybe in some way kind of like leading the wildness towards water that's nourishing and supporting, towards food that is nourishing and supporting. Like, go this direction. Here's what you're looking for. Okay, so with that as an introduction, let's do some practice. Taking a meditation posture, one that supports the sense of ease and comfort, especially with metta practice, comfort is important. We don't want to be struggling or fighting with, in some kind of way, with physical discomfort if we don't have to. But then it also gets a little bit tricky, right? We don't want to get so comfortable that we just immediately fall asleep after closing our eyes or having a little more ease. So, we're starting by just tuning into the experience of having a body at this moment. Feeling into the bodily sensations. What's happening today, right now, in this bodily experience? Okay. Okay. We can rest our attention on the sensations of breathing. Providing a place for this wild mind to land. Feeling the stretching, expansion, contraction of the chest, the movement of the belly, we're feeling the coolness and the warmth of the air going in and out of the nose. Whatever feels the most supportive, the most accessible for you right now, just resting the attention there. Okay. And when the mind wanders, this is up to do. This has to be a problem. Just very simply, gently begin again. Just a reminder that this practice, mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of breathing, is always available. If for whatever reason, loving kindness practice doesn't feel right, you can always come back to this practice. Then to begin loving kindness, we'll start where it's easy. No reason to start anywhere else. Start where it's easy. In fact, we could stay here the entire time. Where it's easy is with a being that's straightforward, uncomplicated to feel warmth or care, kindness, respect, love. This might be somebody that you know would have a relationship with. Might be somebody you don't know but has touched you in some way, maybe an author, a teacher, a speaker, maybe a furry family member, or imaginary kittens, puppies, babies, whomever that may be, is bringing this lovable being to mind and connecting. Often, it's helpful to visualize the lovable being. To allow the heart to tune into the positive feelings, the warmth that it has for this being. It may not be there, this warmth, perfectly fine. Where creating the conditions for that to be felt doesn't mean that it'll be there. Perfectly fine. There's no warmth in particular. But to support the mind and the heart, to tame the mind and heart, perhaps, we can say these phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. Honoring and respecting ourselves, our inner life, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, our inner self, the inner self, our inner self, our inner self. The wise person tames themselves. One way we do this is to nourish and support our hearts and minds. And then to expand our loving kindness to ourselves. In my view, it's important to always include ourselves. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be safe. May I be healthy. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. To practice having warm heartedness towards all of those people we don't know. Really create the conditions for our life to unfold in a way that brings more ease, more peace, more freedom. And if we didn't have this openness, this warm heartedness towards those we didn't know. Sometimes more difficult, but it can be powerful to have an individual in mind rather than a generic unknown person. Maybe somebody that's on this Zoom call, somebody you see occasionally in the neighborhood, and bring them to mind. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. And we'll end with a little bit of equanimity practice. This practice bring to mind somebody you care about, but it's a little bit irksome or bothersome sometimes. For this practice, we use this phrase. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. So this idea of loving kindness practice is a way to tame ourselves. And I'm using this word tame only in the positive way it occurred to me while we were meditating that, oh, yeah, sometimes there's can be cruelty involved or something. And I'm not pointing to that at all. Just this idea of, you know, honoring, I'm using this word, wildness, maybe there's maybe you have a better word. Unruling us maybe. It's just part of us. Vitality, it's part of our human experience. We don't have to make it go away. We don't have to make it be different. We're just directing it a certain way. And then we might find that as it gets as the whole being gets nourished and supported, that things start to shift and unfold and show up differently. Naturally with us without our having to force things to be a particular way or no demand that they be a particular way instead we're creating the conditions in which things can tame themselves. So can be helpful to be into to talk about some of these ideas with others. Share a little bit about your experience and or talk about what this idea wise person taming themselves and its relationship to loving kindness practice. Maybe you have a better word than tame. Or maybe you have this idea of maybe there's an addition to loving kindness practice. There's some other things that kind of help. I don't know what the word it, you know, some like I'm trying to come up with alternative to this word tame shape, maybe, or something like this. And this is something you can talk about in your small groups. So you'll be in groups of three or four. And you'll be in there for. Let's see here. I think 12 minutes or so. opportunity to talk about this and share some of these ideas. And here we go. I'll just reminder I know you guys know this but I think it's helpful to just say again and again. That it's these breakout rooms. One way like an opportunity that they really provide is for one person to say one thing, and then it goes to the next person they say one thing that goes to the third person they say one thing and then it comes back around to the first person and they say something like, Oh, wait, I only have 30 seconds left and something like this. And also kind of like even the playing field between the introverts and the extroverts, and maybe one last thing that I'll say we might say is the most important is these breakout rooms are an opportunity for us to learn from people who are in the breakout rooms are an opportunity for us to learn from each other, as opposed to tell other people how much you know. So it's a way to like stimulate new ideas or have some new thoughts or some new approaches that perhaps you hadn't thought of before. There's so much wisdom in these groups. So, you know, the people that come to hubby are there's a lot of warm heartedness and wisdom so an opportunity to draw from our collective goodness and wisdom. So if it's helpful, you can go in the order of the last digit of your phone number. So if your phone number ends in zero, we would go first. Okay, here we go. Okay, so welcome back. Welcome back. I don't have a lot of time but does somebody have a question or a comment or something they'd like to share. Did you guys come up with a better word than tame. Yes, truly. Let's see if I can unmute you. I can do this ask to unmute, but you're muted. I think this happens automatically when you leave it. Oh, right. Okay. So unmuted unmuted now. Yes. Okay. Well, you came up with redirect. And I like that very much. And I just want to say that I, the small group was so rich. And so warm and wonderful that, and this happens often so I'm very grateful to you, Diana and to the group. Thank you, Judy I'm happy to hear this. I'll be your muted to. It's a fashionable thing to do these days. Here we go. You probably want me to stay muted for the whole time, but I'm going to talk. You know, I come from the, from the Renzi, then tradition. And I miss all that suffering. You know, this is so easy. That's it. Yeah yeah Renzi has more than I can imagine. There's no heat, there's no heat, you know. I just wanted to. I just wanted to offer that tamed taming is not a bad term for me you mentioned not having had much experience around horses well. I've been to horses a few days, a few days a week and ridden Mustangs off the Nevada range and done all that stuff. But to me taming horses I mentioned it on my breakout mates. I was told down to providing leadership and direction and, and sometimes firm physical direction because horses can be firm physical thousand pound animals. Yeah, but ultimately providing leadership and direction with with a sense of meta can lead to a relationship that's emotionally synergistic and mutually supportive and as I was telling these guys without going into any stories. Without being overly dramatic literally was life and death situations with bigger, you know, 2000 2500 pound animals. And then you find out about that relationship and how it can be so beautiful can be a very beautiful thing. Wow. Thank you Greg. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah, leadership and direction with my time. Nice. Nice. Thank you. And I'm glad that these relationships protected you and these other settings to write that you're here to share it so thank you Greg. Okay, so with a heart filled with appreciation and gratitude. Claire I see that you have your hand up. Is there something you like to say before we just really quickly because I have done a fair amount of practice in a tradition that's similar to what you were doing tonight, and the two words that always come to my mind are focus and discipline, particularly discipline, more than training, because it's not training to me is something that comes from outside of me that this comes from within me. So I think I've used the word discipline more than training. Nice discipline and focus. Great. Okay, so if you'd like we can unmute and say goodbye all together in a way. So, bye and thank you. Bye. Thank you. Bye you. Good night.
