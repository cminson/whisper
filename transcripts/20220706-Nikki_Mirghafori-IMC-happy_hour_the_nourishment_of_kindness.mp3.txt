The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Okay, so, so hello and welcome, hello and welcome everyone, warmly welcome to this
rendition of Happy Hour. Lovely to be with you wherever you're joining, whether on Zoom, on
YouTube, hello to our friends on YouTube, and whether you're listening later. Warm greetings,
warm welcome and greetings. And as a part of the warm welcome and greetings that I extend to you,
and as our informal beginning where we say hello, to extend a warm welcome to ourselves,
no matter who you are, where you are, what to your background, whether you're new to this practice,
whether you've done it from many, many times, feeling welcomed, welcoming yourself,
welcoming yourself, that you, that you belong here, that you absolutely belong here,
welcoming yourself. So, oh yes, and here comes information about Happy Hour Google groups,
I'm going to post it there. Thank you, Neil, for sharing that. Oops, I sent it to Neil instead.
Okay, it's technical difficulty here too, there. So, so information about Happy Hour Google groups
is in chat. Again, if you're new, it's a low, pretty low traffic mailing list where information is
shared. So, maybe it's good that actually it's recorded because we usually don't record information
about the Happy Hour Google group, so maybe other folks who listen to the audio recording
later would like to hear about it anyway. So, so for today's practice, I'd like to invite us to
the practice of Metta, practice of loving-tineness Metta,
as a nourishment, seeing Metta as a nourishment, nourishment of the heart.
And a couple of different perspectives I'll bring in during our guided meditation. One is
that, you know, there are challenges, there are challenges in being human for every single one
of us. It's not easy being human, living a life as a human being on this earth. It's,
it's, there are challenges and, and Metta is a way to resource ourselves, to nourish ourselves,
to, to support ourselves, and others to nourish our heart, to nourish our heart with, with courage,
with, with strength, with, with kindness, the sense of nourishment that this practice can give us,
and the sense that you don't have to do anything or be anyone to deserve
this nourishment, this kindness, this goodness, just because you're alive, just because you breathe,
just because you're human. Being human is hard enough, it's challenging it enough,
so you don't have to have accomplished all the items on your to-do list or done this or done that,
or, oh, you should have been kinder to that person today, oh, because you were not kinder or more
supportive or more helpful because you lost your temper, oh, now you don't deserve the nourishment
of Metta, quite the opposite, quite the opposite, that, oh, because perhaps you lost your temper,
because you lost your stability, oh, you need the stability, you need the nourishment of Metta
to support you, to hold you, to, to, to bring the sense of stability, to provide this
sense of stability so that you can be more kind, you can be more kind to others, more kind to
yourself. This nourishment is both a support, is not just a reward, but it's also a support,
so, so many different ways to, to, for us to consider relating to Metta, this practice,
the least of which is you should, the least of which is you should be kind, you should
be nice to yourself, you should, this just sense of should that actually belittles us,
makes us feeling, oh, I should do this practice of, oh, being kind, may I be safe, may you be
safe, may you be happy, that belittles us, that actually takes the part of the nourishment away,
let it be an aspiration, let it, let this practice be an aspiration, for what is possible,
what is possible for yourself, or this heart, for this being, who is you, who you kind of know,
but you don't quite completely know what this being, who is you, is capable of.
So let, let Metta be, not be just, not just be a nourishment, but a sense of aspiration,
of what is possible, what is possible in ways you cannot even imagine, you cannot even imagine,
in kindness, in stability, in nourishment, in compassion, for yourself or others.
So I've said plenty, that's all I want to say to frame our practice of Metta for tonight.
So, so without further ado, let's start meditating together. So,
so arriving, arriving in your seat,
arriving, whether you're sitting, lying down, standing,
lying, no difference, all the postures that Buddha talked about.
Assuming perhaps that you're standing, and yet that you're sitting this moment,
ah, landing, letting your body fully land in this chair. Oh sweetheart,
can you call yourself sweetheart, dear,
dear, darling, whatever words of endearment,
you can borrow, you can borrow my voice, if it supports you or not.
Oh sweetheart, it's been hard, maybe it's been a hard day.
Ah,
letting your body, your heart soften, relax, land,
land, in this moment, in this chair, in this cushion.
No expectations, no judgment in this moment.
Let them take a well-deserved vacation, they work so hard, expectation and judgment,
they work over time.
Let them take a well-deserved vacation, in this moment, they can come back later,
tell yourself, but right now,
ah, offering yourself safety, it's okay sweetheart, it's okay.
Letting the body be soft, the forehead relax, the jaw
soft, the neck, shoulders, ah, the chest, the arms, the hands, resting, heavy,
heavy, sit bones,
released, releasing their weight onto the chair,
the upper legs, lower legs and feet,
relaxed,
and if there is any tension anywhere in the body, discomfort, it's okay.
Maybe being specially kind to the part that hurts or is achy, oh sweetheart,
oh dear foot, dear back, dear neck,
and letting the breath move through your body,
through your chest, your abdomen, calming soothing.
And can you forgive yourself in this moment, letting your heart rest?
Maybe you have not been a good foot soldier today,
with the to-do list,
or you've been less kind,
and the usual are possible to yourself, to others, or whatever.
And this moment releasing as much as possible,
there's nothing you need to be or do in order to deserve metta,
kindness,
and perhaps imagining, letting yourself see
the Buddha, or Kuan Yin, the Paragon of Compassion,
or maybe for you it's Jesus, or whether Teresa, or another embodiment, or someone you know in your life,
as the Paragon of Kindness, unconditional acceptance.
Maybe you can see yourself crawling onto their lap,
as if you were a child, a young one, tired,
and you're held, you're held with unconditional love and acceptance.
There's nothing you have to do or be just because you are, you live.
It's challenging enough to be human, this mess of the human condition, with its joys and sorrows,
just being held, whether you're self-receive or relaxed,
this compassionate being, kind being, knows your story, knows your ups and downs, your challenges.
They know you are trying, you've tried your best,
and it could have been any different, it would have been, given the causes and conditions,
completely accept and hold you with care, and let you feel nourished and held,
awakening in you, a sense of fullness, enoughness,
resilience, and uprightness when we're seen, when we feel held,
just as we are accepted, seen.
Our heart grows, kindness with aspiration,
aspiration for our full values, living our values, so let yourself feel held,
receiving kindness, acceptance,
every cell of your body,
drinking it up, nourished, your heart nourished.
You are okay.
you
you
you
If you find that your mind is wandering with thoughts,
it's okay, it's all right.
Oh, dear mind, dear heart, it's okay.
Inviting the thought to be released gently,
letting it come back later after you're finished meditating,
and we're now returning the sense of nourishment with each breath, each in-breath, each out-breath.
Maybe you add your own good wishes, good will
to that of the compassionate image for yourself.
May I be safe,
feeling held.
Stay with you to be safe from inner and outer harm, wishing yourself, may I be safe
from inner and outer harm,
harm that I cause myself, and harm that is external.
Fully knowing that complete safety is not possible in this world,
yet we offer this wish as a blessing, an act of kindness,
good will to ourselves. May I be safe from inner and outer harm,
feeling that nourishment is the goodness of this wish.
Wow, I'm wishing myself well,
really connecting with the intention to take care of this being that is you.
May I be safe from inner and outer harm.
And forgiving yourself for all the times has not been possible, and it's okay,
we offer it as a wish in this moment. The second metaphor is, may I be happy
and have joy in my heart. I wish myself happiness,
just as this compassionate loving image fully accepts me and wishes me happiness,
I wish myself happiness, may I be happy. The third metaphor is the compassionate image,
compassionate being, accepts me and wishes health and well-being, physical well-being,
I too wish myself the same, may I be healthy as much as possible, may I be healthy and strong
as much as possible, connecting with the goodness of this wish, this offering.
And the fourth metaphor is, may my life flow with these and I take care of myself happily.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Connecting with the breath, with the good wishes on our own, in silence, exploring this nourishment
of matter.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And if judgments arise or distractions, can you include them? Can you be kind to them also?
Include them in the space of meta-kindness, benevolence.
Come sit, have tea, distracting thought, it's okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It is said that when the Buddha was sitting under the Bodhi tree the night of his enlightenment,
that Mara, the personification of all the challenging mind states, threw thousands and
thousands of arrows at him. And all the arrows, when they approached him, became flowers and landed.
What of all these thoughts, perhaps judgments, these arrows
coming towards you are met with kindness, your kindness.
Now you're a terrible meditator, oh sweetheart, kindness. You're so distracted. Oh dear thought,
disarming, transforming all the arrows to flowers one by one.
So that when we are finished with our sit,
just feel the flowers around us, that we can offer to ourselves and to others, to the world.
Symbolizing our minute by minute
act of transformation of each thought, each mind moment's actions with kindness, goodwill.
As we bring this practice period to a close, offering all the goodness collectively of our
heart, our practice, all the flowers, generously to all beings everywhere.
May all beings be free, may all beings be happy,
may all the arrows be transformed to flowers, internally, externally.
Thank you for your practice friends.
So we have time for reflections, questions.
And you can type them in chat if you like, if you type them to me. Privately I will not read your name,
just your reflection out loud, just type to everyone, then I'll read your name also
to attribute it to you, you can raise your hand if you like.
And the invitation always is at this point, if there's anything that arose, either a question
or maybe an aha moment, something opened up, to offer that as a flower, as a gesture of kindness,
to yourself and the whole Sangha, it's not to impress or it's just sharing your practice
with yourself, with others.
Thank you so much. It was a particularly appropriate topic for me tonight.
And the thing that I was wrestling with a little bit was welcoming thoughts
and just sort of incessant thoughts. And at some point just getting tired, just going,
wow, when is this going to stop? And I just sort of concluded that I just need to,
I don't know, just take care of myself a little bit more and just sort of this
thinking about the inner harm and just trying to soothe myself a little bit.
Anyway, I just offer that to what I was thinking. Thank you.
Yeah. Thank you, Don. Thank you for offering that. Appreciate it. It's like to reflect on the couple
of things that you mentioned. One is this, you know, sometimes there's this incessant thoughts
that come up and then there's a sense of, wow, enough already. Okay. There's so much. And then
the heart is like, wow, the heart is tired. Like, oh, sweetheart, I need rest from all these thoughts.
So I need rest. I need refuge from all this incessant thinking. And maybe the idea here is not so much
to, I would say, not to push away the thoughts. Maybe I saw your hand gesture as pushing away
and like, ah, so that could bring up aversion, like, get away from me. Terrible thoughts.
Like, ah, that can bring up a sense of conflict. So bringing up sense of conflict is never helpful.
But instead, oh, dear mind, oh, that is producing all these thoughts. Oh, let me take care of you.
Let me nourish you, which is where you went. Oh, let me nourish you. Let me nourish you by
giving you some space, some time, some refuge, some silence. There are lots of different,
yeah. So yes, so thank you for offering that in what came up for you, which is the space of
nourishment. And it's okay. There's nothing wrong with realizing that, oh, yeah, we need more
nourishment. We are hard. We need more silence. We need, because the incessant thought probably,
yeah, the pattern comes up because we are thinking so much and we're in the midst of so much,
maybe different things. So thank you for that, Don. One reflection privately. Thanks for the
meditation. I found that it was very difficult to sit with a compassionate image and the words
of the loving kindness meditation. I think it is because I have a lot of self hatred to contend
with still. Then of course, I let in judgment and felt bad about not being able to let it in.
Is there any way to work through this? Yeah. Thank you for this reflection. And
it's, many people go through this. It's, it is, so it's not uncommon. So
when letting the judgment in and felt feeling bad about being able to let it in is okay. So
in that moment, my recommendation is whatever is on top. So when you're feeling bad, so say,
you let the judgment in, like, oh, you're a terrible meditator or, you know, like, ouch,
that moment, see where, where the kindness can land and not to, and if you're feeling bad,
oh, maybe you feel bad. Oh, I feel bad that I let the judgment in. Ouch. Could there be some kindness?
Oh, dear, you're feeling bad. What is there anywhere the kindness can land on? Can it get a
full told anywhere? Like sometimes there are all these recriminations or judgment upon judgment
upon judgment and feeling bad upon feeling bad upon that I feel bad that I'm not a good meditator.
And I feel bad that I feel bad that I'm not that I let that in and see if kindness can land on any,
any level, anywhere, just a tiny bit, just a dew drop, just a dew drop. It's okay, sweetie,
it's all right. This is hard. And it could just be a really this is hard. Yeah, I'm having a hard
time. I'm having a hard time right now. It could be could be just that that could be the foothold.
So that's what I would recommend. I'm having a hard time right now. Just that.
Yeah, another reflection. When I Google the definition of loving kindness last night,
this is only my second week of practice stated compassion for others. Where does self compassion
belong in this definition? Yeah, it's meta. It's this is a much bigger question, but very briefly
as you're, as you're beginning this practice, welcome. Metta, meta is a slightly different
practice from compassion. There's a lot here. But basically, it's both for ourselves, for others,
people we know, people we don't know, people we have difficulty with kindness is 360 degrees
all around this meta, this kindness. And it definitely includes us. And in fact, we need to
fill our own cup first before we give it to others, so that we don't go around saying love me, love
me, be kind to me. There's so much more, but I'll offer that. And Jamie, thank you for the reminder
that I'm no less deserving of meta than any of the beings I care about. I still need to be reminded
of this. Yeah, thank you, Jamie. Thanks for that reflection. So the time has come for us to turn
our attention to practicing in community in small groups of three. And the way this works, especially
if you're new to happy hour, there will be very breakout groups that I will create right now in
a moment. And the invitation in the groups and they're about six, seven minutes or so. The invitation
is to each person will say just one thing offer one thing from their own experience. And what
was this practice like for you can say I'm new. I didn't know what I was doing. I was distracted
all the time. It's perfectly fine. Just offer a little bit or maybe when it comes and but you
hold it in kindness, like God, I don't know what I'm doing. It's okay. Other people will hold you
in kindness too. It's so nourishing to be in a space where people can hold you also with kindness
and lack of judgment. And it encourages you to hold yourself with kindness and lack of judgment.
And then maybe, and then you say one nugget, not a long month along, maybe just one nugget,
one thing. And then the next person will say one thing or maybe they say pass. I want to hold
silence for others right now. That's perfectly fine. No judgment. The next person then then come
back to you again. So you'll go around a few times, speak from your own experience, not asking
questions of others, managing their experience, managing the group, just show up with kindness
for yourself. And magic often happens. So here we go. So take and you need to enter the groups on
your own. Here we go. Opening all rooms. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other.

Okay. Hello. Oops. Everyone is back. Hold on. Let me
ah, usually it gives a minute. Not sure what happened here. A minute to close.
Seems like it's close right away. Okay. Things keep. Oh, no, no, it that it. No, it is true.
It it. There's another 15 seconds. I think just bunch of people jumped out.
Huh. Yeah, some people haven't come back yet. All good. Things haven't changed in Zoom.
That drastically. All right. We'll wait four more seconds until everyone joins. Comes back.
Okay. Now. Now all the rooms are closed. And um, and let's see. I'm going to ask. Let's see here.
Here. There. Um, you to everyone. Okay. So I see Richard's hand is up there. Richard, please.
Well, our group decided. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Yeah.
You know, to to the people in our group, we're not, we're feeling off the last couple of days.
And then for some reason, magically, this meditation made us both happy. So we decided to
start a startup, you know, to become wealthy. We've just bottled this, you know, and sell it as a pill
or something. Oh, yes. Yay. May you spread. May you spread meta in so many ways. It's,
what what an enterprising thought, you know, it's, it's so sweet. I wish it worked, but yes,
spread it, spread it in all other ways. In every way you can. That's great. I'm delighted to hear
that, that magically somehow folks started to feel better after having felt off for a couple of days.
That is really the nourishment of meta. I mean, that statement right there. Thank you for sharing
that. Richard, really appreciate that, including all the humor with that. It's that's basically,
it's the nourishment of meta. It nourishes us even when we've been off kilter, we come back home,
we come back to center, and then we're more able to offer it to others. Think about bottling it up
and sharing it with others. So thank you so much for that, Richard. And thank you to all of you,
to every single one of you who is practicing and joining, cultivating your heart for your own sake
and the sake of all those, those lives, ours touches. May all beings be well. May all beings be free.
Thank you all. And now stop the recording.
