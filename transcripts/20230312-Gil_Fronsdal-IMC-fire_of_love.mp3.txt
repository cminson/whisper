 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. There's an expression in English of fighting fire with fire. Little strange topics for today given it's raining. But fighting fire with fire, in my understanding of the history of the origins of this expression, it had to do with farmers in the early 1800s and the Prairies of Central Prairies of the United States when there were prairie fires. They learned to set smaller fires in front of the approaching large prairie fire, in order to protect themselves. And maybe unfortunately the expression eventually became also understood to fight violence with violence. That whatever someone brings you, you bring the same. There is a, I think a marvelous story, perhaps a myth, a fable, of the very first months of the Buddha's teaching of him fighting fire with fire. So I want to tell you the story. He was wandering around in northern India and he needed a place to stay for the night. And he came upon a large group, he says 500 people who, ascetics or spiritual practitioners, redundceans who were living on the edge of a river, who were fire worshippers. And they had a firehouse, kind of maybe like a place where they did the fire ceremonies and did their religious life. And so he came upon them and he said to the leader of them, that it would be possible for me to spend the night in your firehouse. He needed a place to stay. And the man said, oh yes, it would be very happy for you to stay there. However, there's a ferocious, a large, powerful serpent, fire serpent living in the house. And it would be dangerous for you to go and spend the night there. But he said, oh no, I'll be fine. Could I please stay there? And because it was so dangerous, that man thought it was so dangerous for the Buddha to do it, the Buddha had to ask three times. And in India, ancient India, if you ask three times, you usually don't say no the third time. So he said, okay. So the Buddha went and explained that he went in and sat down, made himself his seat inside the firehouse, sat down cross-legged and established himself in an upright sitting posture and brought forth mindfulness. So he was going to, often the Buddha would sit and meditate through the night. That was his idea of a good night's sleep, maybe. And so, sure enough, this dragon came out. This serpent came out and was, I guess, upset that someone was in his house. And so he approached the Buddha and started shooting smoke at the Buddha. And the Buddha thought that was interesting. And he said, well, what if I match the smoke with smoke? And that infuriated the serpent. So then he started with projecting flames, ferocious flames at the Buddha. And the Buddha thought, well, what if I match the fire with fire without hurting, without harming the serpent? And that's the magic thing, without harming the serpent. And then he says, and then filled with goodwill, filled with loving kindness, care for the serpent, the Buddha matched fire for fire. So he wasn't trying to harm the serpent, but he was matching fire with fire. And so people outside could see the flames and the smokes billowing out of this firehouse. Oh, no, the ascetic gautama, the Buddha, certainly he's going to succumb. This would be his end. But in the morning, the Buddha came out with this big, terrible serpent. And his begging bowl curled up, and he handed it to the fire worshiper and said, here. And the Buddha was no less, you know, worse off than before he went in. So one of the things, the images of this that stands out for me is the Buddha sat in meditation first. So he was sitting for the Buddha in a strong posture, in a wrecked, upright, present posture, posture where you can be really present for something, for life, for yourself, whatever's going on, without leaning in and without pulling back, without getting activated and without crumbling down, collapsing. This danger came at him, and he kept his strong position, his balanced position. In a sense, a kind of neutral position, but also in a sense a very strong position, a posture of strength, but a posture of strength which is unassertive, a power of strength which is not asserting power over anyone, not being aggressive, just there, present. And when the serpent came and attacked him, the Buddha responded somehow in kind. But was it really with smoke? Was it really in flames? There is another teaching somewhere else where the Buddha is talking to a person who's a wood-gatherer, as a profession, gathering woods for fire. And the Buddha, in the course of their conversation, says to him, I have given up the burning of wood. I burned the blaze of wisdom within. So he doesn't light the fire of wood, he lights the fire within. And so the inner fire of light, but the idea of flame, of inner fire, is also a little bit of a representation of some kind of strength and power. But it's inner. And so the serpent comes towards the Buddha, and the Buddha keeps sitting there and doesn't move. But I imagine that he looks the serpent right in the eye, and flinchingly. And that's, you know, maybe this is a myth, but that's a powerful idea. That danger comes and you neither turn away, you don't turn the other cheek, but you also don't attack. It's not eye for an eye kind of thing. For the Buddha, it's the fire, I would suggest, the fire of loving kindness. Is loving kindness a match to the anger of this terrible serpent? Apparently the Buddha thought it was. Can loving kindness, something like kindness, be powerful and strong? Or how do we let our love have a strength and power to it that can meet the challenges of our life? That's kind of the question. Is it possible? And I think that often enough in our kind of Buddhist scene, where we emphasize a tremendous amount of compassion and loving kindness and these things, sometimes it goes along with a kind of meekness, a kind of not, you know, just kind of accommodating or accepting others and not trying very careful. The idea of not harming, sometimes it's interpreted, make sure no one feels hurt. And that's a big difference between harming and people feeling hurt. Sometimes harm and hurt are two different things. If you tell me that, you know, that I'm a pretty lousy teacher because I'm wearing, I guess, a red shirt, I don't think you're harming me to say that, but I might feel hurt if my identity is tied up with my shirt. So if I make it, so you have to kind of go along and help me with this distinction I'm making between hurt and harm. There's a distinction that is very important here. So we have a tremendous emphasis on not harming, but even with that, we can't be responsible that some people will feel hurt when there's no assertion, no, nothing, you know, we're not trying to do anything. And sometimes simply being present in a strong way, some people feel intimidated by that. Sometimes holding our ground is taken as being assertive. Sometimes not giving in and accepting what people are saying is taken as an offense. And maybe all these things are true sometimes. But I think there's some kind of an under shadow side of our Buddhist tradition that I've seen over the decades I've been in it, of people being a little bit kind of ready to lower themselves, weaken themselves or diminish themselves in order to make other people comfortable. There's a time for that for sure. But the shadow side is that sometimes done too often. And so the flip side of that is often not learned in our tradition, I think. And I could be wrong and you can correct me. But what's not really emphasized that often is the idea to become a strong person. Maybe even become a powerful person, but in what way? Strong and powerful in yourself, for yourself, in a certain kind of way, over yourself. So I'll give you some examples, or at least one, of something that was very small. At the time, I haven't thought about it for decades, but recently I've been thinking about it. I said, wow, that represents a real turning point for me in my Buddhist practice that I did this. And how did I come across this idea to do this, to do this practice? And I kind of thought back at my early years, my first year, when I was kind of a full-time Zen student. So I was living at the San Francisco Zen Center, which is a, and they have a farm in Marin County called the Green Gulch Farm. So I was working as a farmhand there and doing a lot of farm work. And one day with another person, I had to carry some very heavy equipment from one side of the farm to the other, just the two of us. And it was kind of a long walk, and it was really painful for my hands to hold this. I don't remember what it was like with my arms, but it really dug into my hands. And I said, okay, well, my attitude, oh, this is interesting. Let me see if I can manage this without having any reactivity in my mind. Can my mind stay at ease while my hands were feeling this pain? And so I don't know how well I did. I can't proudly say that I succeeded somehow. But what I succeeded to do was to maintain the practice of doing this, looking at it, looking at my reactivity, letting it go, trying to decouple the pain in my hand from the state of my mind. And this decoupling that I was trying to do there then represented a kind of a continued way in which I practiced where I tried to find, see my reactivity in my mind and see where I had choice not to give into it, not to pick it up, to leave it alone. And this I think is so where did I learn that? And I think I learned it by sitting in meditation, that as I sat in meditation, there was first a physical stillness that was hard to learn to do, but I had to not give into the impulse to move, to itch myself or to avoid discomfort. And that was a tough thing to learn, to not have the physical reactivity to it. I learned to do that, okay. But then the next stage was to, you know, what you're left with then is kind of like the mind. And I discovered how much my mind reacted. I discovered that the reactivity of the mind often made other pain much worse, physical pain, emotional pain much worse. So I learned to watch my mind closely and see, okay, let go. Don't do that. Don't go along with that. Go back to the breath. Go back to here. And I was going back to some peaceful place. And so over, so I think that's where I started to learn this, what was going on in my mind, tracking my mind. So when I was carrying this heavy equipment across the farm, it had become now a reference point for it, not just in meditation, but in daily life as well, to track my mind, to see what my mind was doing and to exercise some choice about what goes on in my mind, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing, what I was doing. And I had some choice about what I pursue, how I practice with it, what I'm involved in. And in some sense, I was cultivating a kind of self-control, a certain kind of agency strength over my reactivity to not give in to it. And I learned to not have the serpent have the upper hand. And so then, you know, I don't know if that was the first time I really started doing this in daily life with this heavy equipment, but it was, you know, represented a kind of direction that my practice went then, that really the track was going on in my mind. The next phase that happened, after a few more years of Zen practice, was that I discovered that as I had this little more control over my mind, which meant not so much that I could then use it assertively or, you know, make something happen in the world, that it was a power over leaving the mind alone, with not infusing the mind or having the mind caught up in reactivity. That's where the control was. And as I became less and less reactive in my mind, what became important was love. Love, compassion, care, tenderness. That's what kind of, there was space now for these other ways of being to well up, wellspring within, of a lot of goodness that hadn't had space before, because it was crowded out by my reactivity. It was crowded out by all the thoughts and stories and ideas and proliferations of imaginations that I had. And as those quieted down, there was space to feel and sense something deeper within. And it became a very special time at some point, or a choice I made at some point, where I realized that compassion, love, kindness was partly a choice, not to do it so much, but a choice to lose it. The choice to lose touch with it was a kind of a subconscious, unconscious choice that my mind would make if I gave in to my reactivity, if I got caught up in the swirling thoughts and ideas and fantasies of my mind that closed that part of me out. And so at some point I kind of made a commitment to love, to compassion, not because I was going to work hard now to be compassionate. That never was interesting for me. But rather, I was going to work hard at not covering it over, not having it be available for myself or to be flowing through. And so over time I learned this wonderful thing, and so many different sides and flavors and qualities that are really beautiful to have. But it could also be very strong. Love can be powerful, or maybe say differently, love can be matched or be supported by or come along with a kind of inner strength that we learn to carry with us. An inner strength that is comparable in daily life to the Buddha statue here, the Buddha sitting upright, strong, neither assertive nor pulling back, neither attacking nor afraid, neither giving up nor requiring anyone else to give up. But very present looking people, looking everyone, he has a very soft gaze that usually the statues of the Buddha in meditation, usually they always have him with his eyes half open. And one of the theological, Buddhological theories for that is that Buddha is always connected to the world. But with soft eyes, a soft gaze, can the strength and presence of meeting challenges, angry people, can we have such strength that we can meet with soft eyes? Can we meet anger, not with anger, but with love? So when the Buddha fought fire with fire, I would suggest that there was two different kinds of fire. Maybe the serpent was a fire of anger, for the Buddha it was a fire of love. And the Buddha said that hatred and anger is never overcome by hatred, it's always overcome by love. So can that be something strong? And I would emphatically say yes. But it's not a strength of reactivity, it's not a strength that is so much a doing, except it's a strength of getting out of the way. So a natural presence, our ability to really be present and stay for what's happening, has a chance to kind of flower here for us and be really present in a strong, full way. I had a neighbor once who was really angry at some noise workers were making when we were on the property, and came over and yelled at me. Just came over and yelled at me, I was very angry, furious, it was completely unreasonable, the whole thing. But anyway, I don't know exactly why. And so I stood there, just looking at him. I felt kind of uncomfortable, a little bit afraid. So it wasn't like I was just kind of fearless. But I stood there, I didn't back away, I didn't attack, I just stood there and looked at him. I did wonder, how long can someone have a monologue like this? And then when he finally stopped, I just looked at him calmly and I said, you know, when you're talking this way, I feel afraid. I don't think I was expressing fear, but I just, it was kind of true, but it wasn't like, I just looked at him and said, that's what's happening. And in a sense, that was my meeting fire with fire. I just said, this is what's happening. And he immediately calmed down. He immediately kind of apologized and left. And that's the last time that neighbor has yelled at me. And we're kind of friends now again. But, you know, so I think I wouldn't have been able to do that unless I'd learned to track my reactivity, to track my fear and how I relate to fear and how fear sometimes gets the upper hand and I believe it and I, you know, the usual kind of hindrances around fear might have come up. It might have been the fear of, you know, when hindrances is anger, you know, to blame him and it won't attack. Another is to shut down. Another is to get all restless and not know what to do. All kinds of things can happen there. The reactivity part. But, you know, by knowing and tracking my ability, how I'm reactive, I was able to have how I was be much more the realm of my choice. I'll just stay here and be here with it. I'm not going to give in to these habits. And then I was able to make a wiser choice. And one wiser choice was just stay watch. I was pretty confident this was not a person who was going to be violent even though the voice was strong. But also, so strength. Some of you know that Martin Luther King has a wonderful writing in a book called The Strength to Love. How often do you associate love with strength? How often do you bring forth something in the family of love, all the different qualities that we call family of love? How often do you bring it forth in a way so it's present in a strong way? Not strong because it's infused with what we want, desire, which is often mixed love, complicated, and which often gives love a lot of strength, because we want something. But what is it love that is not entangled with desire, that is offered to the world without assertion, without need, without wanting something, without leaning forward, without pulling back, but allows us to be very present, upright, alert, available for the world, and available for wisdom and care flowing up within us so that the wisest part of us can then decide to choose what to do. So lately I've been thinking of this as being a kind of strength, but also I'm thinking maybe to start using the expression self-control, which is kind of taboo in our Buddhist scene, first because of the word self, and second because there's a lot of teachings that don't try to control your experience. And both these caveats I think are important. But sometimes there is, a very important part of Buddhist practice is in fact being able to control yourself. Not controlling what happens, but controlling the reactivity with which you respond to what's happening, including your reactivity to your reactivity. Some reactivity you can't help doing, but then at some point we have some choice. At some point we take some control over the situation, even if all it is, which is not a small thing, is I'm going to be mindful of this. I'm going to not shoot a second arrow. That's taking control, that's taking agency, that's taking engaging in the practice. And the self part is self-control. It's a non-philosophical, non-metaphysical self. It's like, if you say I'm going to go pee, that I is not a metaphysical problem. There's no I in Buddhism. I'm going to go pee, no you can't use that. Well, you could do it for me then? So it's that kind of simple way. Who else is going to care for you, because you care of all the waste products in your mind? Don't expect that. Other people do it for you. So this wonderful little tale of the Buddha fighting fire with fire, which I interpret to be, that he fought the fire of hatred with the fire of love. What does it take for you to have that as a strength? So you can match whatever comes your way with something that's comparably powerful, something that's effective, something that matches what comes your way. The Buddha and his teachings put a very high value on this capacity to do this. Very high value to do this, no matter how difficult the challenges we have. And some of the stories in the middle of teachings of how to do this are kind of outrageous. The challenges that he described that you should always have loving-kindness. And maybe it's religious hyperbole, that he's talking of these examples. But it puts an emphasis, like, wow, it is possible to develop oneself. It is possible to grow something so that we don't become victims of what life brings. But we become the first responder that's ready to meet any fire that comes our way with something that can put it out. So I hope that gave you something to think about and reflect on. And maybe it's wonderful, this idea of this Buddha in the firehouse. It's kind of a symbolic kind of tale that maybe can be interpreted in other ways as well, or kind of be applied or elaborated if you think about it. So maybe you'll do that. So I thought that rather than taking questions today, maybe I'd like to suggest, those of you who are willing to stay, that you form little groups of maybe three and have a little discussion about what this talk has evoked for you. And we have about 15 minutes or 10 minutes. So we'll probably take maybe six, seven minutes for that, and then we'll come back as a big group, and then we can take some questions and hear a little bit more. And then we'll take a break, and then at 11 o'clock we'll have the community meeting. So if you don't mind, turn to someone near you and three or so people and introduce yourself. And if you're not interested in staying, then thank you for being here.
