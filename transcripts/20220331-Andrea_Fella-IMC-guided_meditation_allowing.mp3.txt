 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Arriving with yourself in this moment, in this place, in this time, can you be here with yourself? And maybe in a simple way, just connecting with how are you. How are you in this moment? In a way, our mindfulness practice is about kind of just keeping checking in, checking in, each moment. How are you right now? Like a dear friend might ask you, how are you, and not expect any particular answer. Maybe mindfulness can be that friend, be like a friend. Just able to be open, allowing of exactly how you are. And it can be supportive to incline towards some relaxation. Maybe the body can relax. Sometimes it can be useful to just scan the body and notice where there may be areas of tension and consciously relaxing certain areas of the body if you notice there's tension. And sometimes we can settle back a bit more and drop in a request. Check in and ask or request the body and mind. Maybe there can be some relaxation. May the body relax. And it's dropping that request like a little pebble into a pond and then seeing what happens. How do the body and mind respond to that invitation? Maybe the body can relax. Maybe the mind can relax. Relaxation of body, of mind is such a helpful support. It's a condition that supports our natural capacity to be aware. When the body is relaxed, it supports the mind relaxing. And when the mind is relaxed, it's not so caught in thoughts of past or future. What it tends to do when the mind is relaxed is to just be available for what's here. So just be available to notice how you are. So perhaps you can recognize that you're aware in a simple way. And what is a hobbyist? What's already available and being known? What's the easiest thing to be with right now? What's the most obvious, simplest experience to be aware of? And it's body sensation. It's often one of the most obvious things happening. Might be hearing. There might be a few moments of noticing a body sensation and then a shift to hearing. If we can stay connected with just the simple knowing that we're aware. It doesn't matter that the attention shifts from one thing to another. Kind of almost a curiosity about how the attention moves. We don't have to hold it still. So maybe it notices body sensation or pressure or heat or coolness, attention, the vibration of pulsing. Maybe it notices hearing. Maybe it also notices a mood or an emotion or a thought. Exploring the possibility of settling back and just being curious about what experience wants to show up right now. What experience is coming to you? A receptive sense with the mindfulness, receiving experience. And whatever is being received, can there be a perspective or an openness to allowing? Not resisting, not fighting, not trying to hold on to, but allowing experience to arise, pass away, something else arise, as it does. And at times it can be helpful to allow the attention to collect around some particular aspect of experience. If that feels more easeful to you, that's fine. Maybe collecting with the breath or just body sensation feels a little more restful for you. With meditation, I think that's a useful guideline. Being with experience in a way that allows some ease, allows some sense of rest, rest with alertness. What supports that for you? For some, that's settling back and just letting experience show up, not choosing, not needing to guide or direct the attention. For others, it can be much more restful to connect with some particular aspect of experience. Letting the combination of restfulness with alertness be kind of a guide. And however you explore the mindfulness for this remainder of this sitting, remembering the possibility of allowing that whatever is happening, whatever is arising in this moment, the possibility of holding that with some measure of ease and okayness. It's okay that this is happening right now. It can be met, held within this field of awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
