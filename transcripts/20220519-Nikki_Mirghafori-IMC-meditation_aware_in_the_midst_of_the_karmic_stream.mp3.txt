The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Greetings friends, greetings. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, good day,
whatever time zone you're joining in. May it be, may it be mindful, may it be
good, may it be wholesome with awareness. Lovely to be with you in this moment in
time and to practice together, to practice together. So let us continue, let us
continue today with our exploration with the important profound teaching of karma.
So without further ado, let's practice together. Let's land in our bodies,
arrive, and of course I'll say more later about the theme for today. So arriving,
arriving here, every moment, every moment a new arrival, every moment a new arrival,
this self, this what we call a self, this being every moment a new one, new
sensations, new thoughts, no emotions, no experiences. Hello, hello, hello,
greeting, greeting, all that's arriving in this moment, all that has been passed
down and is arriving in this moment, and all that is being passed on, this moment
right here, just on the edge of receiving and passing on, and yet with its own
intentionality, with its own creation, forming formations. So let us form
wholesome formations of awareness, appreciation, wakefulness, alertness,
ease, peace, arriving, arriving, spaciously, in this moment, in this body.
Letting the breath be received, each breath, each in breath, the entirety of
the in-breath, the entirety of the out-breath, the pauses in between.
Soothing, calming the mind, calming your restless mind,
an agitated heart, soothing, calming the body, all formations, awareness of this
breath, in the body.
Soothing, calming the mind, calming the body, all formations, awareness of this
breath, let the breath be natural, let awareness be natural, not forced, it's
already here, let the body be natural, nature, we are nature,
receiving from nature, giving to nature, our breath are being intertwined with
nature.
And if thoughts arise, as they will, not a problem, it's what the natural inclination
of this mind is, in this moment. So not to see it as a problem, having a
spacious heart, with a spacious awareness, spacious, easeful breath, letting it
arise and pass without getting entangled, staying aware, staying in the
station of awareness, let's do what's arising, what's being handed down, coming
downstream, coming downstream from earlier actions, thoughts, forming
formations, nowhere, spacious, knowing.
And as awareness knows,
sensations in the body, the breath, thoughts, emotions, sounds, whatever is
arising, see it as what is passed down through causes and conditions, through
past actions, formations, doings, makings, especially thoughts, patterns
that are on. As the stream passes through, observe, know, be aware, no need for
judgment for the person you were previously. Are you even the same person
you were a year ago? The self, letting go of that concept for a moment and just
seeing these streams that arise, arrive in this moment, and deciding,
intending for the stream of kindness, awareness wisdom to be passed down from
this moment, so not judging, not hating, not being greedy about what arises,
meeting with kindness, with spaciousness, as much as possible, and if that's not
possible, can there be acceptance and ease, equanimity, that it's not possible
in this moment? That too is planting the seeds of ease and equanimity and wisdom
instead of being reactive, entangled, watching the stream being passed down
and adding drops as if taking a dropper that has color in it and dropping a drop
or two of kindness, acceptance, ease, wisdom, patience, spaciousness into the
stream, into the stream in this present moment. As the stream is passed down, one
breath at a time.
The stream is passed down, one breath at a time, one breath at a time, one breath
at a time, one breath, one breath at a time, one breath at a time, one breath
at a time.
