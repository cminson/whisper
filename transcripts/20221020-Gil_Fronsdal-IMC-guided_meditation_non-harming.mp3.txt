 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello. And at the moment I'm imagining that all of you who are present here for our YouTube meditation is welcoming each other. We're all welcoming each other, we're all greeting each other and appreciating the shared companionship to the degree to which doing the same thing at the same time and sharing the same focus here. So thank you for being here. So one way or the other when we come to do meditation, we are ascribing or assigning some meaning to what we're doing. Some sense of purpose, some sense of the values of what it's for, some sense of the context of it in our wider life, some way in which it serves kind of maybe ultimate values we have, religious values, spiritual values, all kinds of ways in which are there on the edges or at the center of doing meditation. And one of them is our values and some people clearly bring along values when they meditate, maybe things that they've inherited from their society, their family, and some of them are deeply unconscious, it's just a matter of fact. And some of them evolve and develop in the course of meditation practice, engagement with Buddhism that we acquire new values. So whether it's an old value or a new value, one of the central values for Buddhism, and I would propose for people who mature in this practice of meditation, is non-harming, that there's a very thorough going devotion, interest, sensitivity to living a life of not harming at all. And often that idea is attributed to, is assigned to the idea of not harming anything outside of ourselves, the other people, the world. And that's true. But in meditation, the primary care around not harming is not harming oneself. And what we learn about not harming ourselves through meditation is directly applicable to how we live that life in the world around us. That the very things that we do that cause harm to ourselves are one way or the other a support for that spilling out onto others in the world. So to sit and meditate where there's care given that we don't harm ourselves, and that takes the form of not criticizing ourselves, not being upset or angry with ourselves. But of course we will be sometimes. The very significant part of this practice is to appreciate the degree to which you don't have to take responsibility for the particular impulses, thoughts, feelings when they first appear. What we take responsibility for is how then we respond to them, react to them. So if there is a hostile thought that arises in the mind, maybe hostile towards oneself, the teachings of not taking it personally, just that's what the mind is doing. Don't define ourselves by it. But in the wake of it, what is the non-harming thing to do? Not be hostile towards hostility, not to hostile to ourselves, not pull away and shut down and give up and all kinds of things that we do. What is the non-harming thing that can be done in this practice is simply to see it clearly with kindness. And if kindness is too much, just to see it clearly. So for whatever arises in this meditation, when it first arises, let it be known. And in that knowing, practice non-harming, radical non-harming, as you sit here and practice. So to begin with an upright, or maybe say it differently for those of you who don't sit upright, a dignified posture. Something about how you dispose your body, the posture of your body, is to kind of embodies your dignity, your value, your importance. Maybe in a way that lets your chest avoid collapsing or crunching up. A way in which your neck is a little bit straightened and gently close the eyes. And feeling the contact with whatever supports your weight. And almost as if the inhale begins there, taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. If you want to get a little more benefit from taking these initial deep breaths, calmly count to five on the inhale, count to five on the exhale. To have your inhale be that long. And then letting your breathing return to normal, letting go of the counting. And sitting here quietly, devotedly to being present with your mindfulness, present with the breathing. And devoted towards to non-harming, not responding to anything in ways that cause harm in attitude, motivation, belief. And if you do, let go the best you can. And perhaps your mindfulness is a non-harming wind that blows gently on whatever it is you're aware of. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. So I drop the concept of non-harming into you. And let the ripples of non-harming spread out to touch all of who you are. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And if you do, let go of the counting. And then as we come to the end of the sitting, to turn our attention to how we will be living our life the next day or so, and independent of all the things or the few things that we'll be doing, if all we do is to live a life dedicated to non-harming, that would be enough. You don't have to be kind. You don't have to be compassionate and loving. You don't have to wish everyone well. But a radical non-harming to become for someone, everyone else becomes someone who is safe. Someone for whom no one needs to fear. No one feels aggression or assertion or dominance. No one receives judgments, prejudice. Everyone is seen through eyes rooted in not causing any harm inwardly and outwardly. Just this is one of the greatest ways of living a life. May it be that on this next day, whatever benefit we receive from this meditation, from our practice, from being mindful, may it serve to support being in this world in a non-harming way. May all beings benefit from our harmlessness. Thank you.
