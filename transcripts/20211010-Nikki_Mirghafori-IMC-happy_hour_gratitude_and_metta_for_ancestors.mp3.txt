 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay. So, so hello everyone. Hello and welcome to Happy Hour, wherever in the world you are in this moment. And today being Thanksgiving Day in Canada, as Kim just shared with us, and also being Indigenous people today in the United States, the theme I'd like to invite us to engage with is, as of course I'll introduce it in the guided meditation. So those who are new, whatever you need to know will be shared with you in the guided meditation. Just relax and let arise whatever needs to arise. So, so the theme is one of gratitude and metta for, for ancestors, for those who have come before us. Now we might have known some of our ancestors, you might have known our parents. Maybe we knew our grandparents. Maybe we heard of our great grandparents. Maybe not, but these are people just like us who walked the earth and had challenges, had hopes, had dreams. And we are this being who is us in this moment, this being who is us, represents their hopes and dreams for the future. They may not have envisioned us or known us, but maybe they thought, you know, if we go so many generations back, sense of sending to the future the best of them, the best they were able to give, the best they were able to offer. So a theme of metta, gratitude, and I don't want to get too heady about it because I want to talk too much about it. Talking too much might feel overwhelming, but for us to just settle in as always into our bodies with our breath in this moment, and then we'll have some invitations and see what comes up. See what you might get in touch with, which may not have been present before, may not have been aware of before, and what might bring up a sense of connection and aliveness and brightness, spark in your heart and heart and mind. So let's explore together. Let's be curious. See what comes up. Let's have humility. So with that, let's get started landing in our bodies. Then arriving in this moment, this being, this being who is me, this being, who breathes, sits, walks the earth, this amazing, incredible, beautiful, sometimes confusing being whom I've privileged to get to know more and more as I live and get to support the cultivation of, this being who does the best they can, continues to want to grow, which is why they're showing up here, connecting with this person, with this being who is me. If you're greeting yourself at your own door, opening the door of your heart, who's there? It's me. Hi, welcome. Come in. Come in. Sit, rest, relax. Ah, you don't have to be anyone, do anything. You're accepted just as the way you, just the way you are in this moment. Friend, I don't judge you. I don't expect anything of you. Just come and sit, rest. Just rest and be, friend. All right. All right. All right. All right. Simply aware. And if thoughts are arising, if the mind is going on trips and thinking, it's okay. Minds do that. Like little puppies, they get excited. It's okay. Come back, sweet puppy. Come back to your mind, to your awareness. Let's rest. Ah, finding awareness to rest. The belly and the lower abdomen. And greet the breath. We save each breath. And you might find, you will find the puppy you will set off again, and it's okay. Don't yank the leash back, lovingly. Hugg, caress, pat, pet. Awareness back gently. And slowly. For it to rest, rest with the breath. To rest and be nourished with the breath. Beware of the breath in the abdomen. Simple. Good. And the inner breath also receiving, or being received by awareness. And the awareness also receiving, not just the breath in the abdomen, but in the sit bones where your bottom connects with the cushion. Your feet connected to the earth, your legs. All the contact points, feet, legs. Bottom of the cushion, your hands. Sensations of breath and contact points can help the mind settle, just arrive here, now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. awareness, awareness, intertwined with care, with kindness, non-judgment, perceiving the breath and the sensations of the body to help our heart arrive and settle before we turn our awareness to metta, just arriving and settling another couple minutes. Thank you. I'd now like to invite you, if you would, as you continue to stay connected to the body, not going to the head, but let the center of gravity be low, your abdomen, your sit bones, resting, the body relaxing, settled. If you would open your heart to someone, you're descended from a parent, a grandparent, someone who you've been with earlier, with whom you have a connection to, you appreciate, you're grateful for, you feel their care, their love, something about them. It may not be that their entirety was loving or lovable, but just one aspect might be their entirety of their being, was loving and lovable. And maybe just one aspect you really appreciate, you connect to, bring this being, this person to your mind's eye, to your heart, inviting them, hello. If other people want to come in, bow to them and say, a little while, one person at a time, inviting this one person first, letting yourself open to, sensing them, feeling them. It might be alive or passed away, the arc of their life, the felt sense of this being. The felt sense may be an image of them, how they talked, their mannerisms, how they made you feel, just the sense, using whatever senses are most available to you. For some, maybe imagining an embrace, a hug, or maybe if you're very little, sitting on a lap, whatever really conjures up for you, the felt sense of this being, this person. And if other persons, relatives, ancestors want to come in, invite them, have them sit there, let them know that they're not there, let them know that they're there. Opening to a sense of appreciation, gratitude, for their care, their love, their, whatever they want, their gifts, gifts of time, affection, attention. Or maybe they're passionate about something that they passed on to you. They nurtured something in you. Maybe they saw you, they really saw you. Whatever works for you makes it how it works for you, these invitations. Some may work, some may not. Make it, make it yours. And the heart that is open to appreciation, gratitude, giving thanks. Is naturally brightened with gladness, with happiness. The mind could veer to guilt or not having done enough, etc. But bring the mind back, it's okay, dear mind, it's okay. Dear puppy, come back. Let's stay with seeing the goodness and gratitude, appreciation. Let's intend our mind, intend our mind to stay. Let's see how this puppy, sweet puppy stay with seeing the good, with seeing the gifts, with appreciation. And notice if your heart feels open, naturally open to the generosity of metta and love. And if so, receiving love and giving love, loving and being loved. Whether this person is alive or past. And loving them through the beyond. Thank you. And notice now if other parents, ancestors want to join this circle, join this first person, join, being appreciated, you feel their love, sharing your appreciation, love for them. Acknowledging that sometimes our ancestors might have been complex characters just as we are. They've had their own causes and conditions. They did the best they could given their background, their upbringing, their circumstances, their cultural conditioning, family. Appreciating the good. You might have been, you might have acted the same way, being born into their body, life, and genes. Appreciating the good. Giving and receiving. Your own time, allowing more ancestors to join. Maybe people you've only seen photographs of, or just heard names of, or maybe not even that. Their bloods run through your veins, these human beings. You are their child. Thank you for having existed. Thank you for doing the best you could and having the offspring who became my parent, my grandparent, my great-great-great-great-grandparent. We are connected in this web of humanity. The ancestors. Honoring, appreciating. The challenges, the goodness, the beauty. And if it gets too much at any point, just come back to the easiest. Maybe just parent or parents. Your grandparents keep it limited. It's okay. It's okay to know what works for you. An experiment if you would. If you would, by putting upon your heart center, connecting with yourself, being who is me, keeping your hand to your heart, being touched with sincerity. Appreciating, loving, especially the complicated lives that may not have been so easy. Lives that may not have been so easy. Calling forth parents, the ancestors. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to heart bringing to mind, inviting your friends, your sangha, and their ancestors. This web of humanity, they're connected to, you're connected to so many cultures from around the world, Western, Eastern, Indigenous. Northern, Southern, this planet Earth, all have walked this Earth, and walked this Earth today. This Earth as a living organism, all its people, the creation, the complexity, the beauty, the beauty, the beauty of being human. Wishing well, may all beings be well. May all beings be happy, may all beings be free. Thank you all. Thank you for your practice. So bringing in sense of appreciation, gratitude, thanksgiving thanks for our ancestors. Allowing metta to arise from that, and sense of interconnection. So many beings, so many cultures. This web of humanity, we're not alone, even though we might feel like an island, especially during COVID times. We are not. We are not. We are the being whom they have sent into the future. Here we are. So I'd love to open up for questions, for comments, for reflections. The chat is open. At this point, if you chat, send reflections directly to me, I will only read your reflection, not your name. If it's to everyone, I'll read your reflection and name. You can also raise your hand. When reflection comes, compassion for Black Americans cut off from their family histories by slavery. Yes, thank you for bringing that in. Yes, so much can open up in this practice and seeing the pain, the challenge of histories and also historical trauma and pains of ancestors that many people carry, many of us carry. Thank you for bringing that in. Compassion, awareness. I'd love to hear more what came up for you, what happened, what was challenging, what did you discover, Kim says, that was beautiful. Thank you, you are so welcome. He says, the complexities of my ancestors, what a rich stew. Yes, yeah. Anybody wants to raise their hand and share anything, your voice bringing your voice into the container. I like the connections to all of us, even if we may seem alone. Yes. Yeah. So I wait, I wait more reflections, or maybe a hand to come up if you like to say what this was like for you. So I see one person is clapping. That's a clap. So it's not a raised hand, but I think I know who that is. Is that you, Hugh, you want to say something? Deborah says I'm still processing a lot of grief over the loss of both my parents in the past five years. This brought up gratitude and tears. Thank you, Deborah. Yes, you. Just to add to the complexities of my ancestors, what a rich stew. And now the complexities of this worldwide saga. What a rich stew. Yeah, yeah, yeah, indeed. Thank you. Thank you. And Yerba says on YouTube, this theme was beautiful and profound for me. Thank you. This opened up a lot for me. David says, Thank you, Nikki. Thank you, Sangha from David Oak Harbor, Washington. Grateful for our ancestors intending atonement. And I see Mark's hand is up and day and let's see. Mark, please. Before I speak, Diana wants to say something. Diana, if your hand is physical, I haven't seen it, my dear, unless it's your your zoom hand. See, I don't see too many of you because of the privacy and so. There you are. I see you, Diana. There you go. Sorry, I was really stuck because I am feeling sad. I don't have a whole train of ancestors I know about. My parents put them down. We saw them in distant pictures. It was kind of grim. And yet I remembered my mother used to talk about an ancestor who came across the country to California in a Conestoga covered wagon. And she always talked about this person didn't know her. So I thought, what the heck? That's going to be an ancestor. I know nothing about her. What you're talking about, their life must have been what kind of cultural conditions that must have been. So now I have an ancestor to appreciate. It's great. Thanks. Yeah, thank you for that. And I have to say also for me, as I was practicing, you know, there are so many of my ancestors, I don't know. And I just imagine, oh, yeah, that person must have had a father and mother. And my kids won't come in. I don't even know your names. Welcome. Welcome. Because of course we have lots of ancestors, even if we don't know them. So that's the beauty of us being here as human beings. Of course we have ancestors. Mark, please. Well, I used to go visit my mother. I moved to the West Coast and she was still on the East Coast where I grew up. And I tried to visit four times a year. I made it at least three anyway. And I would stay for a week to visit. And about 13 years ago, I went for one of these visits and, you know, flew in and got there pretty late at night and rang the bell. And she met me and we went into the living room and hugged. And she just, it was one of those hugs where it was, she was just pulling me inside of her and she said, oh, I just love you so much. And it wasn't that she'd never said that before, but not often. It was just one of those rare, rare moments of just pulling you inside. And so we had to visit, which was fine and great. And I went back to the West Coast and two weeks later I got a call and she had had a stroke and she died. And I was just so grateful for that moment just at the end from her. And this meditation brought that all back again. It was just just lovely. Thank you. What a gift Mark. And thank you for sharing that beautiful moment of love with all of us. I feel graced. I feel the grace of her love, gracing all of us, pulling you in and pulling all of us into that love. That's just so lovely. Yeah, beautiful. Thank you, Mark. Yeah. And Nick, I see your hand and 650 at this time is when we transition into small groups. So keep your, so we're going to come back to you after the groups. Is that okay? Yeah, great. So beautiful. So let us turn and come into bring, invite each other into a small group practice period of just six minutes with one another. And, and to bring our ancestors into the room with us so it's going to be a very crowded room, all of us bringing our ancestors and each other's ancestors too and just acknowledging that we all were all descended, we're all descended, all these human beings who, one of you wrote in your note is, is recognizing that they probably did the best they could, recognizing they did the best they could. So, so with this, I'm opening the rooms. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Here we go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And the rooms are getting close in about 10 seconds. Okay, rooms are closed. Everyone is back. Welcome back, everyone. So, Nick, you had your hand up. Is it, are you still relevant? Yes, no, give me thumbs up. Yes. Okay, here you go. I'll do it. Thanks, Nikki. I appreciate it being part of the group and it was very sticky a little bit uncomfortable I knew this day would come, we would talk, I'd be in a meditation group and that it would be talking about ancestors and my ancestors are, you know, I have ancestors through, you know, in America for like eight generations, and they were involved in everything, battles, you know, and, you know, building fortunes and unfortunately all the bad things they were involved in to that. So my point was that I try not to romanticize their actions, and just kind of focus on well they had a lot of strength, certainly had strength and determination. And I'm sure I got some of that, you know, I could, I've had my own successes, but you know, anyhow, that was the point that I wanted to make. Yeah, thank you so much, Nick. Thank you for bringing that in. Yes. Absolutely. Not to romanticize our ancestors were wonderful, beautiful and flawed people just like us. They had a mixed bag, just like we are. And they had good intentions in the way they saw their intentions and complicated, especially with the history and who knows maybe history will look back at and say you well, yep they had good intentions and they really messed up in these ways they messed up the environment. And so, so to appreciate both. It's a both and it's a both and appreciate the goodness and given what they knew they did the best they could. And yeah, they were flawed in many ways and so are we so. Yes, and all of that, all of that appreciating all of that. Yeah, so thank you Nick so important to bring that and really appreciate you bringing that in. Yeah, so dear ones, the time has come it's already seven or minute past seven so thank you for engaging with this interesting challenging opening practice to see our interconnectedness and all in all these ways. Thank you for showing up and cultivating your heart and and and awareness in in unfathomable ways. May you be well may all beings everywhere. Be well, safe and happy. Thank you. I can't always stop.
