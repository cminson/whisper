So, good morning and for those of you tracking the buzz, it's the mute box that we have.
So I disconnected the mute box and bypassed it and hopefully we're working on a fix for it.
So it'll come at some point.
But the result is that when I turn the mic on and off now there you'll hear a click.
So, good morning.
So one of the interesting or very important areas for meditation
and the deepening of meditation or as I like sometimes to think the filling out of meditation.
I like the word filling out because the idea of including all of ourselves, going deep sometimes is kind of bypassing,
can be bypassing or putting aside things.
But filling out that some of the language of meditation is things like being settled and settling all of who we are or becoming composed or unified.
So, composing ourselves are all of who we are here in a certain kind of balance or harmony or unity, unification.
And that's difficult to do if we prioritize certain parts of our life over other parts.
Sometimes we prioritize our thinking and then we get focused on the thoughts and ideas and we lose touch with our body and the present moment.
Sometimes we prioritize our emotions and everything is seen through our emotions or by our emotions or felt in the emotional realm.
And sometimes we can prioritize the body.
And in Buddhism, ancient Buddhist practice, the body seems to have been a huge priority but not as the expense of these other areas of our life.
But it's the beginning place of filling out, of being inclusive, of not getting stuck in the places we usually get stuck in.
Where we get stuck prioritizing.
And one way to prioritize is we identify with it.
It becomes the kind of the location in which we live.
We live in our thoughts, we live in our emotions.
And as soon as we do that, we're living in a partial way.
Through mindfulness of the body, there's a way in which we learn how to be inclusive of it all.
In a sense, the body can hold the emotions, the body can hold the thoughts, but even more than the body, it's the fluidity of experience.
It's the softness of experience, of awareness.
In a sense, we begin living in awareness where things are soft and open and inclusive, composed, unified.
And one of the ways of doing that is to be centered in the body.
So we'll start that way and I'll try to guide you through a little bit of experience or sense of this being composed, settled, unified as a means for being calm.
So to gently close your eyes and without much else, become aware of your body.
Whatever way your body is now, maybe without even fixing it or relaxing, just take a few moments to feel how it actually is now.
As if you're doing so for the first time, like meeting a new person and you're just present and taking them in.
And then gently as a way of including your body, more of your body, take a deep breath where you feel the expansion of the torso widely, globally.
Doing that a few times and then with the exhale, also globally settling into this body, gathering the body together as you exhale.
Deep breath in and then in the exhale, relaxing the body.
And then to let your breathing return to normal and then continuing to experience your body globally as you breathe.
As you inhale, feel the body globally. As you exhale, let your body settle, relax wherever there's tightness and holding.
And then settling into just the experience of the body breathing.
And then settling into just the experience of the body breathing.
But for now, as your body is breathing, imagine the body is like a balloon filled with water.
A waterbed perhaps. And when you just as fluid and the whole balloon moves with the water jostling around, someone touches it and the whole thing kind of moves, is fluid.
So as you experience your body breathing, the movements of the body.
Feel the fluidity of them as if they're water moving, moving water in a bag or waterbed.
And feel how that movement and fluidity is kind of a global experience in your body in whatever way that's easy for you.
With a settling as you exhale, a settling of the water.
And the body has a rhythm of expanding and settling.
And then rather than prioritizing your body or your thoughts or your feelings, prioritize the fluidity of the movements in your body.
And letting the awareness surf on them or float on them.
Whatever feelings you have in your body, pleasant or unpleasant, whatever emotions you have.
Let them all be included within the rhythm of the body's fluidity, movement, changing.
Relax into the movement. It could be very, very subtle pulsing and vibrating.
Whatever distracted mind there is as you exhale, let it relax into the gentle movements of the body.
Relax into the movement.
And as if awareness is floating on the sensations that arise and pass.
The sensations which may be the fluidity of the sensations in the body that come and go.
Awareness that holds it all floats on it all.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
And what are you prioritizing? Where are you living with your awareness?
Your thinking, your emotions, a particular concern of the body.
Can you relax the prioritization to open awareness up, to open the body up?
So everything is included in a kind of openness that's fluid.
Relax into the movement.
And with a global awareness, let it all be present.
Let all of it be centered on the experience of breathing.
As if the movement begins and ends with breathing.
As if breathing is the heartbeat of the global experience that doesn't prioritize anything.
Includes everything while being centered on breathing.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
On the exhale, relaxing back into the place where breathing begins.
And if you feel any calm or tranquility, perhaps you can feel it.
Perhaps you can feel the movements of breathing moving out through that calmness.
Coming and going through it.
Kind of like you're forest bathing in your own calmness.
As if you're being nourished, nurtured in a broad, inclusive calmness.
That everything occurs within.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Relax into the movement.
Being settled on oneself can be calming.
Calmness can be a way to settle on oneself.
To be settled here in the present moment.
This can be a gift that we bring with us into the world.
The ability to be calm and settled with what we're doing.
Calm and settled in our conversations with others.
Not rushing on, multi-tasking.
But offering the gift of presence to another person.
We can do this with our work and our activities and our driving.
Whatever we're doing, we provide the gift with our settled calm attention.
So we're really here for this life.
Here for our experience.
Here for what's around us.
And it has an impact.
Others will feel it.
The world will feel it in ways.
As we meditate, as we come to appreciate the treasure of calm, settled attention.
May we learn how to bring that into the world.
To bring some of the best qualities of human beings with it.
Generosity and love and care, wisdom that thrive in settled calm attention.
May this practice be for the welfare and happiness of everyone.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
And may all beings everywhere be free.
