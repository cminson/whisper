 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. www.r The Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California www.r So hello everyone and welcome. And when my children were young, we had this children's book that had drawings that were magnifications of 10. And these books would start with, I think they went different directions. Maybe they would start, but one common one was would start like far out in space, maybe see the world in the middle of our solar system maybe, or a galaxy. And then each page would take a power of 10 closer in until just the world, then just a particular maybe continent and then get closer and it'd be just a city and closer just be the park in the city and then the lawn in the city and then the grass and the few pieces of grass in the city. And then going closer and it would be somehow close up of the cells and they go into the cells and see pieces of the cells and maybe DNA and then get closer still and there would be molecules and atoms and closer still and just electrons and protons and in vast space. And it was kind of a remarkable thing to kind of change the perspectives and see things in so many different ways. And meditation is, can be a little bit the same way. And which direction we go varies. And sometimes it's going inward into a vast space of just a few electrons and sometimes it's outwards into a vast empty space in a galactic systems or something. And sometimes it's nice to have the idea of going back and forth between these two different perspectives, vast and large and very small and close in and but I think starting where we're at as human beings. And then I think oftentimes meditation is more like starting where we're at and learning to be fully present for where we're at regardless where we are and the powers of 10. And as we relax and settle and quiet it's kind of like moving inwards and becoming closer and more intimate and here until we're kind of powers of 10 and just go in and in to come to a place where the most intimate, the most expansive, the most freeing is kind of like this vast space. And it feels like we're home in some ways. And then we return and come back to this human perspective and hopefully bring with us the freedom. So to take a alert, upright posture and lowering your gaze gently, letting your gaze be relaxed and then to gently close your eyes and to begin here at this human realm of your life here and in the place where you live, maybe surrounded by your neighborhood of maybe other homes, apartment buildings, maybe you live rurally, surrounded by fields or forests, mountains, just kind of where you are and the environment around you, maybe as far as you can walk for five minutes as if this too is part of your world, part of who you are in a sense. So here in the middle of this neighborhood, this land under the sky, here you are in a sense sitting on the earth here and then bring your attention in closer and if you're sitting in a room be aware of sitting in a room. This is the power of 10 maybe coming inward or if you're sitting outside, it's just not what you can walk five minutes in any direction to but here what you can see, what you can feel around you. In Buddhism we have this idea that any location where someone meditates is kind of like the center of your world, your experiential world, the world of your perceptions and if you come closer in to just here in this body feeling how this body connects to this place, the weight of the body, pull of gravity and where those meet in the cushion surfaces your body touches. Here, definitively here, this spot, the center of your universe. In this body, breathe, maybe as you breathe you feel movements of your chest torso against your clothes. Maybe you feel that whatever your hands are contacting your thighs, your knees, each other. Here, this body that has been your companion one way or the other for years. Now, centering yourself in this body, taking a few long slow deep breaths, relaxing into the body on the exhale. Breathing normally and as you exhale with a normal breath, perhaps there can be a quieting, a gentling of your thinking mind. Maybe not dramatically, but a little bit of a quieting, calming of the thinking mind. With a lot of thinking, it's kind of easy to feel removed from one's self, one's body, one's lived experience. Letting go of your thoughts, letting go into this living body, feeling it from the inside out. Maybe coming in closer, power of 10 kind of movement, feeling that particular location in your body where you feel most, you most feel your sense of aliveness. The place in your body that most represents or is associated with the living here in this moment. And perhaps if it's easy, allow this location in your body to be gently massaged, rocked by the breathing. By the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out, by the rhythm of the body moving as you breathe........ As you exhale, can you settle in, let go into, deeper within, like a power of 10, centering yourself, either at the center of where you're most alive or centering yourself where the breathing begins, where the breathing ends. The place in your body, the ending and beginning of breathing. Like you're entering into a beautiful grove of trees, leaving the world behind. Enter into your depth of your body, leaving your thoughts behind.................................................................................................................................
