Practice Note : Practicing with an 
Attitude of Compassion

In the practice of  walking meditation and sitting 
meditation, one thing is the practice you do  – follow ing 
your breath  or follow ing your steps as you walk . Another 
thing is  the attitude you have as you do the practice . 
One thing we like to pay attention to is the attitude we 
have in  being present. Many  times it’s easy to be 
focused on trying to do something – to be present, 
concentrated, not drift off, stay connected to the 
breathing or whatever the meditation practice is that 
you’re doing  – and to not notice the attitude that comes 
along with doing it. There could be striving, reluctanc e, 
or judgments about ho w things are . There could  be a 
feeling of “This is too difficult ,” or “I’ll get to it eventually. ” 
A lot of different attitudes can be embedded in how we 
practice . Sometimes it’s useful to step back and look at 
our attitude . In noticing this, it may be  possible to bring 
forth a more useful attitude than the one we just happen 
to have.  
 
If it’s available to you, one of the most useful attitudes is 
having some compassion for the moment . When you’re sitting , mostly just with yourself when  you’re meditatin g, 
there can be  a field, an atmosphere or attitude of 
compassion for what is unfolding for you. If the mind 
wanders , or if you judge yourself negatively, you may  
have a negative attitude towards  what’s happening . 
There can be a lot of suffering , strong emo tions , or 
struggles that come  up.  
 
Whatever  is happening, whether it’s joyful or difficult, 
see if you can receive it with an attitude of care, 
compassion , and empathy . It’s as  if you recognize that 
it’s a challenge to be a human being , and whatever is 
happening to you has happened to many people before. 
You’re not unique. So be willing to step back and treat 
yourself with kindness, empathy , and compassion as 
you would treat someone you’re friendly with , making 
space to let them be who they are. To sit and practice 
here with an attitude of compassion can make it a lot 
easier to settle and relax into the present moment.  
 
If that’s helpful, you might consider it. Thank you.
