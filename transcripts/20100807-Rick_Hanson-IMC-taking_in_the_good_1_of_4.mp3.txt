The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org.
To introduce myself, I'm professionally
a neuropsychologist and have also been
engaged in actually creating and leading workshops since
the young age of, I don't know what, 22 or something. So I'm 57, so that's about
35 years ago. My early training was
out, you know, in addition to going to UCLA, was at the height of
the human potential movement. So I definitely learned how to play
rock and roll before I went off to Juilliard, which is to say psychology graduate
school, you know, and studied at the feet of Freud and Young and
others. So that's been some of my background. I got exposed to
the Dharma in 1974. I began meditating then
and have been trained at, say, in a number of traditions over the last 15 years.
I've found my home
spiritually, if you will, in Buddhism and in particular
in the Vipassana Insight. Original
roots of Buddhism, the teachings of the Buddha himself
which of course is the lineage that this center
and Gil and others are grounded in, although Gil certainly
has background in Zen as well. So that's a bit about my background.
I've been married for quite a while, three thick and thin. My first book was called
Mother Nurture, which Penguin published in 2002, which was about
taking good care of mothers over the long haul, which I think is
probably the most highly leveraged way we could change the planet in a single generation.
Which means also, of course, taking care of partners and
relationships after kids come along. So that was my beginning there. I've been in the trenches.
My wife and I have two kids. Right now they're 22 and 20 and
they're still worrying us when in particular beds. Seems like it's all working out there.
I go to practice, truly.
That's some of my background. I got very interested starting about
five years ago with the intersection between
as I'll talk a little bit further,
neuroscience and psychology and dharma practice.
I've had a long interest in the brain and have studied it for a long time, but this idea
of really bringing these two together has been something that's
just become really a great source of personal benefit
as well as, I think, wonderfully valuable and
interesting teachings and practices. And so that's what we'll be
exploring today. Related to that, I wrote a book you may know about
Buddha's Brain. I highly recommend it. It's author's a really good guy.
A few other people thought it was good too, including Jack
Field and Dan Siegel and Joseph Goldstein and Gil and a few other people
as well. So that. Okay, so topics for
today. This is what I hope to get into today. And I should jump out
actually to a logistical point. This day will
probably be about a third or so practices. I find
that people really want to discuss this material. And so it tends to be about
two-thirds presentation discussion about a third practices.
So the slide set, rather than having you have a
handout and kind of getting lost in the handout, what it'll do is very
happily email you a PDF of the slide set. And you might, you can
also get tons of information on the website for the institute
I founded, the Wellspring Institute for Neuroscience and Contemplative Wisdom,
which is wisebrained.org, which you can see there on the
first slide or the second slide rather, as well as my personal website
rickhanson.net. Okay, so the slide set for this workshop
will be posted there as a PDF. Also slide sets from other workshops
as well as lots of articles, talks, links to cool science
sites, cool Dharma sites, and kind of a greatest hits of scientific
papers, as well as a bunch of other stuff. So that's what's on those sites.
I have a sign up list if you'd like to get the wisebrained bulletin
which goes out monthly. It's freely offered as is
everything on those sites. And as well as this
weekly newsletter I do called Just One Thing, which has a simple practice
every week. It's very short and sweet. It's gotten a lot
of nice response. At this point about 11,000 people get that newsletter
Just One Thing, which has really touched me. The practice
last week was try a softer tone.
This week is set no one out of your heart. So
you can see that's the nature of the practices.
So if you want to get on that email list, I put a yellow pad on the counter
underneath the window just to the right over there. It's pretty obvious. It's kind of by itself.
I really respect email privacy. I don't inundate people. If you ever
want to get off my email list, it's really easy to do that. You can always unsubscribe.
I'll never give your email addresses to others. And so that's
a good way to get the wisebrained bulletin, the Just One Thing newsletter,
other information I sometimes send out. And if you want to opt
out of that, you can always do that. And that also is a way for me to send you the slide
set. If for any reason you just want the slides alone, just put
by your name, Just Slides, and I'll just give you the slides, and I won't subscribe
you to other stuff. Okay? That was complicated, but hopefully
clear. Alright, topics. This is what I hope we talk about today.
The first topic sounds kind of fancy, right?
Self-directed neuroplasticity. It basically
means using the mind to change the brain to benefit the whole being
as well as every other being you touch, which could include ultimately
all beings everywhere. And so that's our first topic. What does that actually mean?
How does that work? What's the intersection of mental activity
and changes in neural structure? In other words, if we engage the path of
awakening as the Buddha set out, how do our practices
on that path gradually change our own brain? And
what are some main themes or call-outs from understanding
that that help us gradually pull weeds
and plant flowers in the garden of the brain? In other words, how do we
over time progressively create the causes and conditions of
happiness and benefit for ourselves and others, and gradually over
time in the brain itself, which is the final common pathway
of all the causes and conditions flowing through us that lead to happiness or
suffering? How do we also in the brain itself alter the causes and conditions
of suffering and harm? So that's a consideration here.
That's the first topic we'll get into that, including some cool pictures of the brain and things like that.
The second main topic is a consideration of right mindfulness
and right effort. Immediately when you think about
using the mind actively to change the brain, it raises questions
of what's the proper balance of right mindfulness, which has a
fundamentally sort of receptive, even inert, not quite passive,
but a sort of receptive quality to it, as well as
wise effort, right effort, which is more active, where we really are
trying to release the things that hurt and harm us and others
and promote the things that are causes of happiness and benefit. How do we weave those
together? That's a real consideration for people. And then we're going to get into
the bad news, which is the challenge of the brain's negativity bias.
To preview that topic, Mother Nature
over the course of three and a half billion years of evolution of organisms,
600 million years of evolution of the nervous system
has been brilliant at crafting a nervous system
that's fantastic for passing on gene copies.
On the other hand, while Mother Nature is really tilted toward
passing on gene copies, she accomplishes that in large part
by being tilted against quality of life,
which creates a fundamental challenge for us every day.
On the other hand, there's a great opportunity there for
if it's the brain that makes the suffer, it's also in the brain
that we can create the causes and conditions of liberation
from that suffering. And that negativity bias sets up a real
challenge that has to do with the main focus of today, which is
in the language of Pali, which is the
language of the earliest surviving written record of the Buddhist teachings,
the term Bhavana, which means cultivation. How do we
gradually cultivate wholesome qualities of heart and
mind? How do we gradually cultivate wholesome
modes of being with others? How do we cultivate wholesome
modes of being with ourselves? How do we do that? How do we gradually
grow that in the body and mind, which means growing it in the
brain and the nervous system altogether? How do we actually do that?
That's what we want. We want to grow that, don't we? How do we
actually do that in the face of this negativity bias
in the brain, which makes the brain like Velcro for negative
experiences, but Teflon for positive ones? So one
thing we're going to do a lot today, which I'm very happy about,
is focus on good things, good facts, and good experiences,
and really savoring them, and doing that in terms of
different categories of good experiences according to
three fundamental motivational systems in the brain, and
marinate in well-being. One of the things that the Buddha really recommended
in spite of his bad rep as a very bummer teacher,
all right? Dour teacher, suffering, bummer,
suffering, right? He really recommended
in all kinds of ways, marinating in well-being.
He didn't use that phrase, but that's my phrase. Okay, so we're
going to talk about that, which then is really about the last topic, which will be
half of today. Half of today will be the first three topics. The other half will be
variations on the final topic. That final topic
taking in the good. It has lots of implications,
of course, for spiritual practice, for gradually cultivating
steadiness of mind, bodhichitta, and open heart,
loving kindness, and all the rest. It also has enormous implications
for daily life, for dealing with stresses,
fox news, the economy, layoffs,
fear and loathing in Las Vegas, all of that,
let alone the people that we live with and look at across the dinner table
or wake up next to. You know, as Jean-Paul Sartre famously said, hell is other
people. So, you know,
in terms of the trenches of real, real life,
these practices that we're going to explore today have many, many, many implications
and they have lots of implications if you're in the helping professions or
work with children. We really get into some of those implications as well.
How many of you get paid to help others? I'm included in the
hand wave. Alright, it's roughly half. Therapists, physicians, health care practitioners,
body workers, different people of different kinds,
educators as well. You know, the implications here of taking in the good
are pretty significant. Okay, so some framing here
as I alluded to earlier, we'll be working at the center of these three circles. I think
that intersection is the sweet spot. You may know
a fairly well-known Sutta from the Buddha called the Heartwood Sutta
where he talks about that, you know, the real point of practice
is complete liberation. You know, that's the real Heartwood of practice. And visual
guide that I am, I somehow see a tree rooted at the center of those three circles
growing up and out, you know, with bearing lots of fruit and
lots of good things. So that's what we're going to be working mainly today.
To create a little more context here,
I think that this intersection of, you could say, neuropsychology in the
one hand, the Western tradition, and then contemplative practice
broadly defined as well as Buddhist contemplative practice in particular, on the other
hand, is an example much as Oppenheimer spoke of where
if you put two things together, you can have lots of synergies, you can have lots
of cross validity checks, and you can have lots of skillful
means that emerge out of that intersection. Now
in terms of addressing it, even though
I will be talking about brain science, which is just exploding with
information, it's estimated that the amount of knowledge about your brain,
my brain, the three pounds of tofu inside the coconut, right?
Right here and right now, somehow still mysteriously making sense
of the sound waves bouncing on your eardrums and somehow generating meaning
as a result. The amount of knowledge about that system
has roughly doubled in the last 20 years. Scientists know, which is to say
people know about twice as much today about this brain
than they did in 1990, which is pretty remarkable. On the other hand, it's a
super young science, especially compared to older sciences like
chemistry or astronomy, and certainly compared to a 2500
year old contemplative tradition like Buddhism.
As the Buddha himself said, don't believe anything you hear, in other words
or don't take it just at face value. This is the
Kalamazhuta. Really, really kick the tires.
Really, really see what makes sense for you personally and
leave the rest. So as
Dogen said, little questioning, little enlightenment, great
questioning, great enlightenment. As my son said
who did a couple of teen retreats up at a Bayagiri, he came back one time
and just kind of said, you know dad, those Ajans have game.
I like that. I think Dogen had major game.
Dogen's hard car, his writings.
Okay. All right. So any, oh, logistical
note, feel free to get up and use the restrooms while we're going and we will have
some formal breaks. The formal breaks will be fairly brief.
I will open it up for specific times for question and discussion
and along the way, if I'm saying something that just doesn't make sense to you,
please stick your hand up and ask a question or say what doesn't
make sense to you. Let's see. I think I've covered
logistics in general. Any logistical questions? Oh, by the way,
this is being recorded. It'll be posted on the Sati website.
I may end up putting a link to it on my own site, but it'll be available
here. Okay. Any, yeah.
We ask that people use the microphone
when they speak. Great. So wait till the microphone comes to you.
People pass it to him. Thanks. Okay, great.
Okay, great. All right. I'm getting excited.
My engines are revving. This material is great. All right. Here we go.
So let's do a practice. And in this practice
I will make five specific suggestions. And then
we will just focus on the breath alone
for about five minutes. One of the important themes
here that's not going to be emphasized today, but I want to call
it out, is the importance of steadying the mind. It's interesting when I
encountered Buddhism in the West, particularly the
Vipassana style, starting really about 15-ish plus
years ago. It was a long time before I learned about
one of the three pillars of practice, which is the Samadhi
pillar of practice, or concentration, steadying the mind. So I think that
that absence is actually being increasingly rectified
by Buddhist teachers, but for quite a while people just were not going to talk about
concentration very much, certainly in the Vipassana tradition. I think out of fear
that people would judge themselves for not being able to succeed at it. But in the Buddha's
teachings himself, he really stressed the importance of steadying the mind,
even to the point of profound absorption, which is
what's given in right concentration, which is one of the eight elements of the
Eightfold Path. It's not the Noble Sevenfold Path.
It includes concentration, which is tantamount to the
Janas, these four non-ordinary states of
absorption. So if we are to engage in the Noble Eightfold Path, we really need to come
to terms with those deep states of absorption, and
the foundation of that capacity is in
everyday steadiness of mind. So
taking on a challenge like paying attention to every single breath
for five minutes in a row, that's on the order of about 75 breaths for most
people, is not that easy, especially in the beginning. The typical
threshold is around four to six breaths. Right? I've been there.
I'm still there sometimes. So I'm going to do five specific
neurologically savvy practices that promote steadiness of mind,
and then I'll explain what was happening inside your brain when you were doing them,
and then that'll be our entree. That'll be an experiential entree to some
material that can otherwise maybe be a little heady. But that's the rationale for
these five practices. Okay? Now as with any practice,
go your own way. I'll use attention to the breath as the
object of awareness, but do, you know, feel very free to depart
from attention on the breath. Some people, especially those with a trauma history,
find attention to the body, and in particular attention to the breath to be quite
alarming. Feel very free to put your attention elsewhere. Also feel free to
adapt my suggestions to your own needs. Dwell longer on
something if you want to, or move on from something else.
If you just want to sit here and relax and space out, that's okay too.
You know, take care of yourself. Okay? So with that in mind,
let's begin. So the basics of meditation
are given here. Most of you have meditated before,
perhaps a few have not. So for all of us,
I think it always helps to remember the fundamentals as in any
area of skillfulness. Training to mind
is a matter of growing skillfulness. So finding a posture that's
comfortable and alert.
Finding
basic goodwill and
good heart and good intention.
And then resting attention in the breath.
And if not the breath, something else like a phrase
such as may all beings be happy
or may I be at peace
or an image with
perhaps your eyes open, the carpet in front of you, six feet or so.
You can have your eyes open or closed.
You're not trying to control the breathing.
And
all the while you are
opening to, even encouraging
positive factors like
a growing disengagement from
every day to due lists, email
blogs, unfolded laundry
and bringing
attention increasingly into the present moment.
As well as encouraging other factors like
a growing peacefulness,
openness,
presence.
So to the first suggestion
set an intention for this sitting
such as staying present with each
and every breath
or a more general intention
such as coming home
to yourself.
And explore setting this intention both
top down as a kind of instruction to yourself
often represented in language
as I've done so far.
As well as setting an intention bottom
up in the form of a felt
sense of the
realization of the intention as a here
now reality.
Perhaps getting a sense of embodying this intention
through in a sense channeling
someone who really represents it for you
like a teacher who seems really mindful
or the Buddha himself.
Giving yourself over to this intention
and letting it live you.
Alright, the second suggestion.
As we move through the suggestions
it's good to retain some sense
of the previous suggestions as in the background.
And so now for the second suggestion
really relax
for example
take three or more
long exhalations
so you're exhaling considerably longer than you're inhaling.
And as you exhale really relax your tongue.
Sinking into a kind of home base
of deep relaxation.
Sinking into a kind of home base
of deep relaxation.
Sinking into a kind of home base
of deep relaxation.
Sinking into a kind of home base.
The third suggestion
is to open to
and gently encourage
yourself as safe as you reasonably can.
Not absolutely safe
because there is no such thing
but safer.
Sinking into mind a sense of being in a protected setting.
Among good people.
Bringing to mind
a felt sense of your own strength
and other resources inside you
and in your life
that enable you to deal with whatever life brings.
So that in truth you can afford to feel safer.
Notice any vigilance
or anxiety.
See if you can let that go.
Notice any guardedness
or sense of bracing against life.
Let that go too.
Letting yourself feel as safe as you reasonably can.
Letting yourself feel safe.
Letting yourself feel safe.
Letting yourself feel safe.
And the fourth suggestion
is to open to and gently encourage without strain
a basic sense of well-being.
In other words, opening to and encouraging
as much happiness as you can feel right now.
Bringing to mind, for example, some things you feel grateful for.
Noticing any resistance to feeling happy.
And letting that go as you can.
And opening again to things you feel glad about.
Perhaps letting a little half-smile cross your face
in the traditional suggestion that encourages joy.
One of the Buddha's factors of awakening.
Without strain.
As the Buddha said,
gladdening the heart.
And the final suggestion.
Sense and intend that the benefits of this practice,
whatever they are for you,
are linking into you like water into a sponge.
Sifting down into the mind.
A golden light coming into your body and heart.
A jewel in the treasure chest of your heart.
The benefits of practice,
are linking into you as you sink into them.
A jewel in the treasure chest.
A jewel in the treasure chest of your heart.
And now, with the results of these five suggestions,
whatever they are,
still present with you,
with intention,
relaxation,
a greater sense of safety,
some subtle but perhaps quite pervading happiness,
and the internalization of the benefits of this practice,
let's stay present with each individual breath
for the next five minutes.
If you lose track, that's fine, just come back to it.
Think of this as a kind of renunciation practice for five minutes
in which you give over to the breath
and let go of everything else.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One I had never thought of was the safety instruction,
and I thought that was very good,
because I realized that I carry a lot of fear
that I'm not even aware of.
You know, it's kind of always on the line,
just the fear of survival or whatever could come my way,
and just saying that was really, really helpful.
Thank you.
I'll explain more about that, but skillful means,
because if we don't feel safe,
and I think it's appropriate to feel scared
when there's a tiger in the bushes,
but as we'll get to later,
we live in a world of paper tiger paranoia.
If we're anxious and vigilant,
particularly as a default,
we hardly even notice it.
Just like fish don't notice their web.
When we're in that vigilant, hyperaroused, needlessly anxious state,
besides it being unnecessary suffering,
it also distracts us from bringing resources inside
for internal presencing,
because if we don't feel safe,
we're naturally very vigilant what's out there.
So by feeling safer, we can bring some of the sentinels in
that are at the battlements scanning for barbarians,
and give them a break, let them have a nap,
three hots in a cot, as they say,
or bring them to work for something like steadiness of attention.
So thank you.
It's interesting that the Buddha had his own awakening
with his back to the Bodhi tree.
The tree had his back,
because that's where threats come from,
and it forced Mara and the other forces of delusion
to come at him from the front.
As a Christian minister pointed out to me recently,
currently in the Bible,
to pick another contemplative tradition, if you will,
God has said to have said,
be not afraid.
And I think how many, just the mudra of the Buddha,
the hand up, be not afraid.
That's the skillful means,
not just a kind of sentimental exhortation.
Okay.
Another person, right here?
Okay, you want to bring him the mic?
Or maybe that's simple.
Great. Thank you very much.
All right.
Is that on? Is your mic on?
Marine, is his mic on?
Oh yeah, it must be on, right? No?
Is it on? Yeah. No.
Louder?
I guess what's been coming up for me recently,
and came up in this session,
came up last week,
a holotropic breathwork workshop,
was beginning to emphasize the exercise
that you just brought us through as a creative act.
I'm so used to trying to just let it all go in meditation
in various ways,
but that there's an active role for me to say,
why don't I try to let go of this?
What if I create this environment right now?
I don't want to let go of this, actively hold that off,
really sink in here,
adopt this point of view,
and it's sort of a counterpoint to letting it all be.
It's about letting it all be,
but it's about creatively working.
We're going to close this door,
put this incense on, do this, do that,
and then I can let it all be.
And finding that perfect manager,
and this is what kind of comes up for me,
I came up last week in the breathing exercises,
that I need to play an active role
in creating this inner environment.
That's great.
I really appreciate you saying that,
and we'll explore that a little bit more.
That's that balance of right mindfulness and right effort.
You said it so articulately,
and you'll hear me say some of what you just said
in my own way in a little bit,
but thank you so much. You're exactly right.
And how to navigate, right?
How to chart that,
and moment to moment, you know,
is a real art of practice,
and we'll get more into that a little bit later.
Very good. Thank you.
Well, how about I keep going?
If I could, I want to talk about what was,
hopefully, happening inside your brain
when you were doing some of those practices,
and as with all the neuro material today,
there will be no test, okay?
And so I'll move along through this stuff,
and don't need to remember the words in particular,
although if you have any interest
in or background in this area,
it might be relevant to you.
The first suggestion, setting an intention,
involves top-down prefrontal cortex,
the frontal part of the brain just behind the forehead.
Language centers for most people
are on the left-hand side of the brain as well,
in the temporal lobes,
and when we do that,
we basically prime all kinds of systems in the brain
to line up and get organized
and go in a particular direction.
I wanted to emphasize the notion of bottom-up intentionality
because it doesn't get a lot of press,
but it's actually really important,
and it relates to a very hot area of research these days
called embodied cognition.
It's the understanding that much of the thinking,
the reasoning, and so forth,
that has been held out in the Western traditions
to be very refined and high-level,
and heavenly and all the rest of that,
actually is very grounded on lower levels
of sensory motor learning and understandings, if you will.
So setting intentions from the bottom-up,
including through getting a felt sense
of the realization of the intention,
as well as a sense of channeling someone
as an exemplar of that intention for you,
like yourself on a good day
or others who are teachers or historical figures
or things of that sort,
that's a great way to put top-town and bottom-up together
and then giving oneself over to that intention
and letting the intention breathe you.
That, for me, at least, is a very powerful practice,
and one thing just to call out that I didn't mention,
but it's worth doing it,
it's related to an intention.
It really helps to bring to awareness
a felt sense of the rewards of that intention.
In other words, the rewards of presence of mind,
the rewards of mindfulness,
the rewards of steadiness of mind.
And so if we link rewards,
which have an emotional valence to them,
they need to feel emotionally positive,
if we link those to the intention,
then the mind and the brain,
the brain naturally goes after those rewards.
At the high level,
the mind is incredible and brilliant.
At low levels, it's really dumb.
It's simple, it's basic.
It literally is like holding a carrot before the donkey.
The brain just keeps going after that carrot,
that reward,
and then it stays after that particular intention,
such as staying with every single breath for five minutes.
Second suggestion, relax.
Related in part to the quick back and forth we had about safety,
when the body is not relaxed
when we're in a state as we are typically chronically
in the West,
and probably in the rest of the world too,
at least some of the time,
but certainly in the sort of industrial nations of the world,
there's this chronic activation of the stress response system,
this fight-or-flight sympathetic wing of the nervous system.
And when we're in that state of just being keyed up
or a little rattled
or having a lot of information coming at us
and feeling inundated by it,
or being upset about anything,
because key point,
being upset activates the stress response fight-or-flight system.
Feeling anxious, feeling irritated,
feeling bad about oneself,
feeling bummed,
that lights up that hot sympathetic nervous system.
So when that's going on, it's hard to bring attention inward
because it makes attention very skittery.
Our ancestors, we'll get to later,
who are all mellow,
or let me put it differently,
they weren't our ancestors as you'll see,
but imagine monkeys or squirrels or iguanas or little crabs.
They were really chill, okay?
Like, wow, look at the light on the water.
Wow, this is so far out.
Just eating my banana here.
It's really great.
I'm being here now, like, listening to Gil.
This is great.
So present, wow.
They got eaten.
They got chomped.
They didn't notice, alas, the shadow coming up,
or the crackle of a twig,
or that funny feeling in the back of their neck.
The ancestors that stayed alive and passed on their genes,
and we are their great-great-great-grandchildren today,
sitting at the top of the food chain,
they were the ones who were the most nervous and cranky.
Okay? That's the brain.
And so when those systems are activated,
as they are so easily,
it's just hard to bring attention inward
for any kind of inner work,
including paying attention to something as boring as the breath,
breath after breath after breath, 75 breaths in a row.
So that's why it's really useful to relax,
to use the activation of the parasympathetic wing
of the nervous system,
which is the rest and digest wing
that calms the fight-or-flight sympathetic nervous system.
Several nice ways to activate the parasympathetic nervous system
are long exhalations,
because it's involved with exhaling.
The heart rate slows down a little bit.
When we exhale, it speeds up a little bit when we inhale.
So, you know, three to ten long exhalations
really will tend to calm someone down really quite quickly.
Another one is to relax the tongue, right?
Rest and digest.
So digestion, parasympathetic fibers fill the mouth.
And so if we relax the tongue,
that employs the parasympathetic nervous system
and also sends a rippling cascade of signals throughout it
to chill out.
Okay? Relax.
Next, feeling as safe as you reasonably can.
For some people, that's difficult,
because it's alarming to feel safer.
Because it's when you feel safe that they get you.
You know, it's when you lowered your guard and your family, right?
Or your last job or last marriage or whatever,
or last weekend with the in-laws or whatever,
that that's when they get you, right?
So it can make people feel alarmed or frightened.
And I think that's part of the art of practice, then,
is to work with that and to be thoughtful about that.
That's why taking a bit of an inventory
about what's reasonable.
In other words,
we are really in a protected setting right now.
We are among good people right now.
And even more importantly,
you are just chock full of resources.
Everything from, you know, strength of character,
intelligence to the credit cards in your wallet or your purse.
You know, these are resources to deal with life.
And taking into account these resources
is a way to help oneself feel, you know,
increasingly as safe as one reasonably can,
for all the reasons I gave in our little back and forth there.
The fourth suggestion also can be controversial for people,
because it prompts the natural response
along the lines of, wait a second here,
is this just being Pollyanna-ish?
Or wait a second here,
aren't we just supposed to be present with suffering?
And of course, there's a place for being present with suffering.
On the other hand,
evoking positive emotion
is a theme that runs throughout the Dharma,
throughout the Buddhist teaching.
For example, one of the seven factors
in the enlightenment of awakening is bliss.
It's rapture, PT, bliss.
Two of the five factors of concentration traditionally,
steadiness of mind,
because that's what was the point of those five suggestions.
Two of the five factors are bliss, again, or joy.
And joy is on a spectrum, by the way,
which is important to appreciate,
running from, you know,
extreme and intense happiness and elation even.
Joy, being really joyful through contentment,
which is a milder but still affectively
emotionally positive state in which
there's no wish for the present moment
to be anything other than what it is.
Contentment is a close cousin to equanimity,
and contentment is also a taste of the awakened mind,
because when we're grounded in contentment,
craving is cooled out for at least that time,
because there's no wish for the present moment
to be anything other than what it is.
Contentment is a really, really underrated
and wonderful state of mind.
And then that shades even further into an even quieter state
that still is emotionally positive of tranquility.
That's the spectrum of joy, okay?
So when we're opening to and encouraging gently,
we don't want to fall into the pitfall of stressing about it
or getting mad at ourselves or mad at me.
It does happen.
What does he want me to be happy?
Happy on cue.
What is it?
What do you think I am?
A human jukebox?
Well, yeah, I do, actually.
Or, more exactly, I think your brain is a jukebox.
I think mine's a jukebox, too, right?
It's programmed.
It plays all these songs all the time.
It gets triggered.
We have these stimulus response cascades.
The problem is, what are the usual songs?
I've been cheated and mistreated.
When will I be loved?
That's the song, or just all these irritations.
That's the typical thing.
Things happen, they trigger us.
A lot of times, it bubbles up from the inside out
and it triggers us, right?
So, okay, we'll get to this later.
This is a place for letting that song run, you know,
to the point that's useful.
But on the other hand, it's completely appropriate
to develop a more dexterous capacity toward good ends
of being able to push other buttons
and protect the buttons that are problematic
in the jukebox of the brain.
And one of the practices of that, as the Buddha recommends,
is to cultivate certain factors,
such as, in terms of steadiness of mind, bliss and joy.
Interesting neurologically, besides helping us feel good,
positive emotion, particularly high levels of positive emotion,
promotes steadiness of mind in a number of ways.
One, they're motivating, right?
If there's a basic positive emotion associated with something
we want to help ourselves want more and more
and tip naturally increasingly into,
the brain will naturally increasingly incline in that direction.
In the traditional saying,
the mind takes the shape of what it rests upon.
The brain takes the shape of what is repeatedly activated.
So, if we activate positive emotion,
particularly positive emotion associated
with our wholesome intentions,
like a growing steadiness of mind,
then the brain will gradually incline in that direction.
I think in many ways the key to happy life
is to help ourselves, over time,
increasingly want the things that are good for us
that we don't initially want, right?
It's easy to pursue the things that are good for us that we want.
We all know what our growing edge is.
I know what my growing edge is, right?
And what's around that?
It's to help ourselves want, you know, more wholesome things.
I think the essence of wisdom in a lot of ways
is to choose a greater happiness over a lesser one.
It's easy to choose good over bad.
The tough choices are good over good, right?
And that's a lot of what practice is about,
is helping ourselves increasingly choose,
increasingly incline toward a more sublime or more noble,
a more pervading, a wiser happiness
than the typical forms of happiness we lean toward.
So that's why coupling positive emotion
with wholesome intentions is so powerful.
Second, the neurotransmitters that are associated
with positive emotion, and there are a number of neurotransmitters,
but these two in particular, dopamine and norepinephrine,
promote the formation of synapses.
In other words, they promote the formation of neural structure.
So if we want to help the lessons of life stick to our ribs,
which is a key theme today, right?
If we want to prevent, in other words, the lessons of practice,
hard-won lessons, it's not easy to practice so much of the time.
If we want to help those hard-won lessons,
not slip through our fingers, you know,
like sand through our fingers in an hourglass,
if we want to help them stick to our ribs,
it really is great to have some positive emotion associated with it,
because that promotes synaptic formation.
It promotes the formation of neural structures,
which is the embodiment in the brain
of the lessons of life sticking to our ribs.
The third way in which positive emotion
promotes steadiness of mind has to do with how attention works,
through a neurological mechanism that's really cool.
The basic idea is this.
If we're studying a mind through a focus on some object of attention,
like the breath, or a loving-kindness phrase like,
you know, may you be happy, or some investigation,
or in everyday life, we're trying to stay attentive in a business meeting
that's in the afternoon, someone's droning on,
or we really want to keep our head in the game
when it's time to have a conversation with our partner, right?
You know, one of those conversations,
where your partner's, you know, when something's wrong,
and it's probably you, you know, right?
Get away, but instead of that, you know,
you know, lean in rather than the natural responses to lean back,
that leaning in is a good thing, you know, it's enlightened self-interest,
how to help ourselves steady our mind for that.
How do we do that?
Well, what that means is that we are retaining some object of attention
in what can be called the global workspace of consciousness.
That's a term from Bernard Barr's,
who actually was one of my main dissertation advisors a while ago,
and in the brain, in the upper, outer frontal regions of the forehead,
is the substrate of working memory, right?
That's where RAM, RAM's located all through the brain,
but that's kind of the headquarters of random access memory.
You know, you like those chips, if you need it like a memory implant
or more memory, you know, it's kind of up here,
you know, in the upper part of the brain.
Anyway, in that substrate, there is a gate that lets information in,
or closes the gate and keeps new information out
so that you can retain a focus on whatever it is you're trying to pay attention to,
like the sensations of breathing.
So learning how to govern that gate is skillful means, right?
The essence of steadiness of mind,
particularly at the beginnings of the stages of steadiness of mind
when it's more willful and deliberate and kind of executive,
is to keep that gate closed so that we can stay with whatever it is we're focused on.
What keeps that gate closed and what pops it open?
Well, the mechanism is simple but ingenious.
Basically, dopamine, a neurotransmitter, tracks rewards, right?
So as long as there is a steady stream of rewards, the gate stays closed.
If the rewards drop, the gate pops open
to look for new things that might be rewarding to keep our ancestors alive.
Additionally, if there's a spike in rewards, the gate opens
because maybe there's some even newer, cooler thing to suddenly start wanting.
To use an example, imagine a monkey in a tree.
This monkey is working on the bananas in this tree.
It's all good, nice, moderate, steady stream of dopamine.
The monkey doesn't think about other trees.
Why think about other trees when you're getting rewarded for the bananas in this tree?
The bananas start running out in this tree.
Dopamine levels drop, pop, gate opens up, looking around for other trees.
Alternately, sitting in this tree, chomping on these bananas, it's all good.
Moderate levels of dopamine, steady state.
Suddenly, a really cute other monkey swings onto a branch nearby.
Whoa, new opportunity, spike of dopamine, gate pops open.
Forget the bananas, what's your sign?
That's how it works.
And you can just watch it in your own mind.
If the object of attention is rewarding, then you stay right with it.
If suddenly something comes along that seems like new and important to pay attention to,
dopamine also tracks threats because in effect it's rewarding to get rid of the threat.
Then you'll get distracted.
So if there's steady, high levels of positive emotion, A, dopamine is steady,
which keeps the gate closed, and if the positive emotion is high,
dopamine levels are high and therefore at the top of their range, so you can't get a spike.
When we're absorbed, particularly in deeper concentration practices,
when we're absorbed in bliss and we're just kind of awash in it,
even if it's often a very subtle feeling of great, peaceful, wonderful, sublime tranquility,
as the Buddha said, the highest happiness is peace.
It's still very luscious and very rewarding, albeit subtle.
At that point, the positive affect, the reward of it all is so high that it's hitting a ceiling.
There's no possibility of a spike.
See how that works neurologically?
And I think that's why traditionally, as I said, two of the five factors of steadiness of mind
involve high levels, high steady levels of positive emotion.
My own practice really took off about, I don't know when, 8, 10 years ago,
when I was turned on to concentration by Christina Feldman, who's been a major teacher for me,
and positive emotion.
Those two, steadiness of mind and really working with positive emotion, has been really wonderful.
It doesn't mean ignoring the sorrows, it can mean they could be present.
We could be angry, we can be in pain, we can have a depressed mood, we could be worried about something,
but it's held in a much larger space.
To use the traditional metaphor, if you take a tablespoon of salt and you pour it into a cup of water,
stir it up and drink the water, ooh, it tastes horrible, right?
But if you take the same quantity of salt, the same quantity of sorrow, the same quality of anger,
the same quantity of pain, and you pour it into a big, clean bucket of water,
stir it around, and then drink a cup, you hardly taste the salt at all.
Same amount of salt, but held in a much faster space, including a basic space of positive well-being.
Okay, question or comment?
Yeah, Mike?
Well, you're talking about practice and giving your dopamine to its peak level.
Is the notion that training your mind in that during practice will then transfer to life experience,
so a typical life experience now may deliver more dopamine than prior to engaging in regular practice?
Great question. So the short answer is yes.
In other words, what we...it's kind of at a basic level, it's pretty mechanical.
It's like if you, you know, lift a weight, a light weight a few times, you get a little benefit,
build out a few more, you know, muscle fibers.
If you take a heavier weight and you do it repeatedly and then routinely, like many times a week,
you get more of a build out, and then it transfers into other situations as well.
What gradually does happen is that the thermostat setting of positive emotion,
people call that, you know, sort of the, you could just think it's called hedonic, you know,
it means hedonism, happiness, you know, a state of being.
That can actually change for people. That's that point.
A lot of research has shown that while people have a basic set point, that set point can change with practice,
up or down. Horrible life experiences can push it toward, you know, the down and depressed end of the spectrum,
whereas positive life experiences and positive practices can gradually move it up.
And as we'll say more later, a lot of what practice is about, and that's the major theme of today,
is I think actually it's clearing out pain, sorrow, suffering.
It's clearing out suffering and its causes from implicit memory,
which is a major aspect of memory I'll get into later, which is distinct from explicit memory,
which is memory of recollections.
But implicit memory, basically, are the residues of lived experience, slowly sifting down into us,
you know, moment by moment, second by second by life.
That's implicit memory, which shapes our mood, the inner atmosphere and landscape of the mind,
as well as our basic expectations, our response tendencies, our, you know, perceptual biases,
what we look for, what we ignore, that is grounded in implicit memory.
That's below the waterline. We're mostly not aware of what's going on in implicit memory.
But that's really where the action is, right?
So, as we gradually shape implicit memory over time,
we gradually increasingly default into, you know, more positive states.
Now, part of what we're doing there, I think, and it gets at a big controversy in Buddhism for thousands of years,
I think part of what we're doing is we're inclining the mind in positive directions.
We're also uncovering the natural state of basic contentment and basic calm and basic caring
and basic creativity, the four C's, which are the default home base of the brain,
which I'll be talking about after lunch.
So, it's okay to have both be true.
We're both training the mind, increasingly, and we are also uncovering what's always already the case,
which is good news.
Okay. How about one more, and I know we want to take a bit of a formal break in a minute here,
so I want to kind of wrap this section up, and I'll stick around during the break, too, to talk if you like.
Okay. One last thing, then.
Absorbing the benefits. That'll be a major theme today.
And, of taking in the good, one reason why it's so important is because the brain's default settings
increasingly tilt implicit memory in a negative direction.
So, paradoxically, as I said, Mother Nature has tilted four gene copies but against quality of life.
By being actively for ourselves, we just level the playing field.
But then, at least, it's fair. It's a level playing field.
And one way to do that fairly routinely is to deliberately sense and intend that whatever is beneficial,
whatever is wholesome, whatever insight you've gotten, whatever positive state of mind practice has opened up for you,
or you've experienced a transmission around, when the good things are happening,
taking that little 5, 10, 20, 30-second moment to sense and intend that it sinks in.
That can become increasingly just a way of life, which then increasingly makes the brain like Velcro for positive experiences,
which then helps it be increasingly slippery or Teflon-like for negative ones.
So, the next thing I'm going to talk about is why the brain matters on the path of awakening.
But, as we'll say more later, the brain is part of the body and bodies have bladders, so let's take a break.
So, how about 15 minutes? Please be back by that clock at 5 minutes to 11. Thank you.
