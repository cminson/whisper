Dharmette: Stability  and Constancy  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

In Pāli, the word for impermanence  can also be 
translated as inconstancy or instability. In some 
traditional circles t he emphasis on it tends to be so 
strong that what is overlooked is the importance of 
stability or constancy in our lives. I think it is important to 
recognize that the human heart has a great need for a 
certain degree of stability and constancy.  
 
You see it in children growing up without stability in the ir 
family life : they grow up frightened, closed, angry, and 
troubled. Without the constancy of contact, of being 
seen or being heard and loved, then a child will always 
be looking for that when growing olde r. But if there is 
constancy and stability in the home, a child can relax.  
 
Society does a lot better with stability. Societies that are 
unstable economically, socially, politically can leave 
individuals deeply troubled.  Violence and other kinds of 
problem s can arise in an unstable society. Social 
stability is also very important for people. Stability of 
livelihood is very important. To be insecure around 
one’s livelihood can be one of the great challenges of a 
life. To have emotional stability is very impo rtant. When emotions are unstable, you don’t know what is going to 
come hitting you one day or  one hour to the next. It can 
be difficult to want to go out into the world if you don’t 
know what kind of w aves of grief, anger, or fear  might 
come . So emotional  stability is a very important part of 
human life.  
 
An impo rtant part of D harma practice is to find a reliable 
sense of stability to support our ability to meet , confront , 
and work with our fear of instability or impermanence, 
and to be able to see that aspect of our life which is 
inconstant, which is always  in flux. For people who don’t 
have some basic psychological stability, it can be  very 
hard to deal with some of  the insights that come out of 
meditation. In our tradition it is important  to have insight 
into impermanence, but this can be very challenging for 
some people because that is not what their life needs to 
be about. If their life has so much instability to begin 
with, then to be told that everything is unstable makes  
their life even more difficult.  
 
Traditionally in Buddhism, there is emphasis that these 
deeper insights come  in their own time and place in a 
developmental model of growth. For many people it is 
helpful to know  that meditation practice belongs to a 
developmental model of maturity. Different insights, 
understandings , and practices are relevant at different 
stages of a person’s growth. Classically, one of the 
things that is important is to have some degree  of psychological stability in one’s practice.  It’s not that you 
have to resolve all of your psychological challenges , but 
there is a basic psychological stability that will be 
beneficial .  
 
For example,  to live by the precepts in such a way that 
they become a support for practice is essential. It is 
important to feel stable and at ease around our ethical 
life – not so that we avoid looking bad , or that we have 
to feel like we have to be a moral person, but rather to 
feel from the inside that our commitment to an ethical 
life is someth ing that supports us. Ethical integrity 
support s us in that we don’t feel remorse , regret , or 
shame. We can show up in different comm unities and 
feel a certain level of dignity and strength because we 
know we haven’t done anything  blameworthy . That kind 
of inner ethical stability  is considered very important in 
this tradition.  
 
There is also stability that comes from learning how to 
relate to our community and our society in healthy, 
useful ways. We can feel some confidence in our ability 
to relate to the world around us. Confidence is a kind of 
stability. There are several ways in which this  tradition 
talks about cultivating confidence . One way is ethics. 
Another is the practice of generosity.  Not necessarily 
meaning to give money to people , but instead having 
the capacity to be generous in relationships with people, 
and having  that as a strength that support s an inner healthy life. And  then there is lovingkindness practice , 
which also can create more stability  for us . I say this as 
a way for  you to consider that stability and  constancy 
are very important. Just as a child might need it, your 
heart might need it as well.  
 
Over many years of practice, o ne of the things I have 
found very helpful is the constancy of practice itself. To 
know that there was no wavering in the commitment 
that I wo uld practice every day . Actually I didn’t practice 
every day; I practiced six days a week. I nitially  I was 
trained at the Zen Center , where they always took 
Sunday s off. I thought that was a good idea. So in my 
first years , when I was living and practicing  alone, I 
meditated twice a day for forty minutes , but I never 
meditated on Sunday. I don’t know if every day is the 
best thing , but I do know that that constancy is a thread 
or a foundation that support s one’s life. It is not required 
to have a happy life , but this is what I do as a basis of 
support.  
 
The question I offer you is : To what degree ca n you be 
supported by stability or  constancy that helps you to go 
further in the practice ? Without that , it is often harder. I 
think that for some people, having a meditation center 
like IMC in their community provides a very important 
reference point. I think it is helpful  for a community to 
have a place in the neighborhood  to come back to. It is 
an importa nt reference point in peoples’  lives. We try to create a stable place for people here.  
 
It is possible that by overemphasizing impermanence, 
our tradition does a disservice for people , because it 
underemphasizes the importance of stability, constancy, 
continuity , and commitment . Another thing I have 
learned is the importance of  commitment in one’s 
practice. I think I was lucky in that my first training was 
in Zen, because it stresses the idea of vows and 
commitments . When  you have something you are 
committed to , you have the stability to  follow through. 
It’s not like I’ll get around to it when I feel like it , or if it’s 
a good day, I’ll pick it up , or if it’s a bad day and I’ll pick 
it up. Or I’ll get around to it eventual ly. Then there is no 
constancy in the practice.  
 
To have a stable intention that you follow through is 
very important. Every person will have their own way in 
practice. There will be variation, but you might want to 
give some consideration to the role tha t stability or 
constancy might have as a foundation for any further 
mediation or spiritual practice you may do.
