Good evening. 
A very warm welcome. 
Maybe in some cases that's literal. 
It's a little bit of a heat wave happening here in the Bay Area. 
But not only literal, kind of heartfelt welcome also. 
So we'll start this evening with a guided meditation. 
And with this we'll just take an alert upright posture. 
In a way that expresses your intention to be meditating right now. 
So you might be sitting upright or maybe it's better for your body if you're lying down. 
But a posture that is in alignment with your intention to meditate to be a little bit more quiet and settled and work with the mind. 
In a simple, relaxed, easy way, we can just bring our awareness to the sensations of the body of what it's like to be here right now. 
What it's like to come to your meditation posture or your meditation cushion. 
I like this idea of arriving. 
Sometimes it feels like there's fragments of our mind, I guess, of course that are elsewhere. 
But to kind of allow them to all come here to this moment, this experience. 
It can be helpful to feel the pressure of the chair or the cushion against your body. 
Sometimes some really tangible experience could serve as an anchor to help bring us here now. 
So is there a way in which you can sit and know you're sitting? As opposed to being lost in a dreamscape or planning for the future or something like this. 
Just to simply know actually you're here now. 
Another support for arriving, for being here, is to do a gentle, easy body scan. 
With the intention that is to help support our being connected to our bodily experience. 
So I like to start at the top of the head, top of the body. 
And it's not uncommon to hold tension around the eyes or the mouth. 
So it can be helpful to bring our awareness to those areas. 
Not that we have to get rid of the tension. 
It might be that bringing our attention to them allows them to soften, relax, let go. 
The neck and the shoulders, other places where we hold tension. 
And we can just feel into the upper back and the lower back connecting to this part of our experience. 
And the chest, sometimes it's helpful to do a really, really small movement of tucking the chin that opens up the back a little bit. 
So a small movement, the chin, and the same way there can be a really small movement in the chest. 
Kind of like moving the shoulders back, just a really, really small amount in a way that's comfortable but might open the chest a little bit. 
And the belly, letting the belly relax. 
And feeling the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body. 
Feeling supported, connected. 
Our upper legs, lower legs, and feet. 
Upper arms, lower arms, and hands. 
In a simple, relaxed way, notice what the hands are touching. 
Is it smooth or rough? Is it warm or cold? Or just noticing? And we can also notice the sensations in the hands when it feels like to have hands. 
That is, there might be throbbing or tingling. 
And then we can bring our awareness to the sensations of breathing. 
The movement of the chest or the belly. 
Perhaps the feeling of the air going in and out of the nose. 
Of course, nothing in particular needs to be happening. 
We're just noticing the sensations of breathing. 
And as best we can, to not have expectations about what's supposed to happen here. 
But in a simple way, just being with our experience. 
And we can also notice the sensations of breathing. 
And we can also notice the sensations of breathing. 
You might find yourself lost in complicated, elaborate stories or scenarios. 
You don't have to make it a problem. 
Just very simply, gently begin again. 
And we can also notice the sensations of breathing. 
And we can also notice the sensations of breathing. 
What would it be like? What would it be like if you were to keep your meditation very simple and complicated? Be with the breath. 
And when you notice that you're not, just very simply come back to the breath. 
We don't need to add anything extra. 
We don't need to add anything extra. 
We don't need to add anything extra. 
We don't need to add anything extra. 
We don't need to add anything extra. 
We don't need to add anything extra. 
We don't need to add anything extra. 
We don't need to add anything extra. 
So the practice is to keep it very simple. 
We're just noticing the sensations of breathing. 
And we might also notice what it feels like when it's not simple and it feels like it's complicated or excessively elaborate with lots of thinking and stories. 
So let us very simply bring our attention to the sensations of breathing.
