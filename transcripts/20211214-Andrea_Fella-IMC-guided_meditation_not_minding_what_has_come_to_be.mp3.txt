Arriving with yourself.
Being with yourself.
Aware of how you are in this moment.
This kind of landing with awareness in your physical experience.
How your body is, how your mind is.
Just taking it in, opening to, with some honesty, this is how it is right now.
This is what has come to be.
And can there be a sense of allowing what has come to be.
Allowing being with the experience as it is.
And perhaps a way of supporting that allowing is to see if there can be a little bit of relaxation with what is.
Sometimes that relaxation can be supported by a kind of inclining towards a relaxation of body and mind.
Sometimes as I'm settling into a meditation and connect with the body and mind,
I just drop in a kind of a gentle request, an invitation, we could say.
May the body relax.
I'm not trying to do that relaxation, but just seeing how the body and mind respond to that invitation.
Sometimes our system has a sense of how to relax with something.
If we just give it the opportunity.
May the body relax.
May the mind relax.
May the body relax.
Sometimes relaxation can also be supported by scanning through consciously, checking in to areas of the body.
Noticing where there may be areas of tension and seeing sometimes just the attention or the recognition of,
that area's tense can support there to be a little bit of softening or releasing of that tension.
Sometimes just the awareness of it will support that relaxation and sometimes there can be a conscious softening.
We let go of certain tension.
Yet there can be times we may notice certain tension that is not able to be relaxed,
either with that invitation or with a conscious realization or recognition, wow, that area's tense.
And there's just not kind of a way in to relaxing that area.
In that case, kind of like allowing a bigger container for that experience.
Maybe that tension can be held with that kind of sense of allowing a relaxed holding of tension, aware that's how it is.
Sometimes we might fight to try to relax and that's counterproductive.
So sometimes it's just the recognition, oh yeah, there's tension.
That's what is a little opening to some balance of mind with that tension.
There may be some measure of relaxation or some opening to how you are in this moment.
Connecting to whatever is most obvious, whatever is easiest to notice in your experience.
That may be the breath.
It may be some body sensation that's strong, pleasant or unpleasant.
Maybe a sound, again, pleasant or unpleasant.
Whether pleasant or unpleasant, mindfulness has the capacity to simply hold it aware of this, receiving what is, what has come to be.
Much as a mirror will reflect whatever is put in front of it and not be affected.
Mindfulness has the capacity to take, to receive all of our human experience.
Whatever is happening, mindfulness can receive it.
Sometimes we can touch into that simple quality of just aware and how that awareness doesn't mind whatever it is aware of.
We may be able to taste just a little bit of the flavor of not minding.
Awareness doesn't mind.
The job of awareness is just to receive whatever is here to offer information to our system.
Can we taste that not minding?
Maybe at little moments here and there, a little taste of, oh yes, this is happening.
I don't mind this.
Mindfulness can meet anything.
And there are times when we can't taste that not minding, we can't have that sense of, it's okay, whatever is happening is okay.
You might in that place just be curious, even for just a moment, can you be okay with things not being okay?
Making a bigger, even bigger container.
Oh, what's happening is this is going on and I'm not okay with it.
Oh, I can be okay with that.
Kind of like the mirror steps back a bit to take in a little bit more of the picture.
But there can be times where we may need to, if we find that we can't be mindful, that the mindfulness gets lost or pulled into reactivity,
then it can be useful to find some simple experience.
Maybe just the sensations of your hands touching wherever they are, or maybe opening to hearing,
or maybe the contact of your body against the chair,
sometimes even the breath can support this, turning the attention towards something a little more neutral,
using something that allows the mind to connect again with being aware of experience in the present moment.
And maybe in connecting with something where there's a little more ease to connect,
you might taste again or taste perhaps that flavor of awareness, not minding what it's meeting.
Just meeting it, not trying to push it away or make something of it, but just meeting it.
This is the experience of a breath.
This is the experience of hearing right now.
Maybe touching into or tasting that quality of not minding.
Just a few moments.
