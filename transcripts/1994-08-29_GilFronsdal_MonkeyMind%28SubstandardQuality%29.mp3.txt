 If you don't know this particular expression, you might be much more familiar with the actual mind itself. The kind of term that I use for that expression for myself is this kind of surface chatter of the mind. And there's all this kind of incessant, busy, not always busy, but a surface chatter of mind that sometimes has nothing to do with anything in particular, or sometimes has a lot to do with our self-centeredness or our eco-centeredness. And I think part of the reason, there are two reasons why it's called the monkey mind. One is that monkeys are supposed to swing from tree to tree, constantly grabbing every branch of all four limbs, all five limbs, right? And so that's how our mind is constantly grabbing everything. That's one reason. And the other reason is, apparently, you've probably heard this before also, is apparently one way of trapping monkeys is you take a coca out and you hollow out a hole and you put some wonderful treat inside, but the hole is just big enough so that the monkey can put his hand in flat, kind of. So when you grab the candy, you make a fist, and the fist can't get out. And the monkeys are so greedy that even though they're stuck in a strap, because if coca is tied to some tree or something, they see the hunter coming. They don't want to let go of what they're holding onto, so they just can't get out of the trap. And so it's very easy for the hunter to catch. And so maybe that's also kind of a little bit like our mind. It's really caught on something, really caught something that seems juicy, important. But it's a surface stuff. It's also this world of self-centeredness. And all these surface ideas that we have of who we are and what we should be doing and what we don't like, all these things are talked to each other across the surface of the mind. And it gets very complicated in just having relationships with stuff within the surface mind rather than anything deeper or anything outside of the surface mind. Sometimes people from very deep, wholesome kind of intention from deeper in the heart are motivated to do something. So for example, someone wants to go to medical school and become a doctor. And then they go to medical school and they accrue all these bills and loans. And then they feel, well, in order to kind of pay out the loans, they need to make a lot of money as a doctor. And then in order to make a lot of money, the doctor needs to have a good appearance. So the people will pay a lot. So I need to get a very nice car and a suit. And then, but if I want to get this nice car, then I have to worry because my spouse and my sister and other things, you know, that volunteer simplicity is where it's at. So, you know, I have to kind of negotiate, you know, maybe kind of hide the fact that I'm interested in expensive looking cars so I can pay back my loans. Because really what I wanted to do was to serve people. And I don't know if that's maybe a silly example, but I think you get the idea that you can start with some very wholesome intention. And as we try to kind of find ways to make it work, it gets more and more complicated. It's proliferation of concerns of Papansha and Pali, and Pali's Papansha. And then these proliferation of concerns start talking to each other. And you start having, only having relationships with themselves rather than having relationships with deeper intention that started it all. So the surface mind. Trungpa, the Tibetan teacher, said, The epitome of the human realm is one big traffic jam of discursive thoughts. And it's often said that the world of self-centeredness is in this world of proliferation, which is often talking to itself. And maybe self-centeredness, and maybe another better word is self-noddedness. It's not just simply self-centered, but that centers a knot. And sometimes we have to be like Alexander, the Gordian knot. As a knot unravels, as we quiet the mind in meditation, there's a possibility of dropping below the surface mind and seeing what's deeper down there. However, calmness is not necessarily the same thing as dropping below the surface mind. It's possible to become very calm. But simply you've calmed the busyness of the surface mind. But it's still the surface mind just happening slowly. The superficiality of the concerns are still prevalent. I want to read this quote. To allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns, to surrender to too many demands, to commit oneself to too many projects, to want to help everyone and everything, is to succumb to violence. By Thomas Murphy. We are distracted by distraction. We are distracted from distraction by distraction. The surface mind, the monkey mind. So as we settle in various ways of doing it, meditation is one way, and finding what's below the surface mind, we begin discovering other aspects of ourselves, of our personal reality, and other aspects also of the world around us, of the reality around us. And these discoveries then are very important. In the Theravana tradition, I don't know how many of you know, the Theravana tradition is a tradition that this meditation comes out of, more or less a tradition we teach from. The word itself means the way of the elders. And I kind of like that, the way of the elders. I respect for the people who have gained wisdom in their years. In the way of the elders, they talk a lot about vipassana, mindful meditation, being in development of seeing what's below the surface, or seeing everything actually. To begin seeing underneath the surface are the deeper realms and processes of reality. And they also talk about three characteristics that you see, the process nature of our experience of reality. That it's impermanent, unsatisfactory, and there's no self, there's no agent. However, it's somewhat static, that kind of description. We talk only about seeing what's there. As we drop below the surface mind, the monkey mind, it's not just simply a matter of seeing those kind of elements, they're static. It's not exactly static, but there's also seeing the relationships we have with ourselves, within ourselves, and the relationships we have to the world, around us, and to other people. And one way of talking about this practice is beginning to plummet down to what our deepest requests might be, to discover what our innermost request is, to discover what our deepest intention is. So it isn't simply a matter of seeing, oh, reality is impermanent, but actually feeling, in some sense, maybe empowered, or feeling some kind of connectedness, there's some very deep intention about how you want to live your life. It's not only a matter of seeing reality, which is the way often vipassana traditionally is talked about, seeing the nature of reality, but it goes beyond that to how you're going to live your life. And that's sometimes forgotten. And you can find that, to some degree, by plummeting down to the depths of your heart, deepest intention. And that's one thing that happens when we crack through the surface shadow. We begin finding that. So intention becomes very important for Buddhism, and Buddhism has often been described as a religion of intention. What is the intention by which we live life? What is the intention by which we carry ourselves up into the world? Can we discover the intentions we already operate on? And then, can we see if there is something deeper, a deeper form of intention? One of the implications of Buddhist doctrine, Buddhist teaching, is that all there really is, is relationships. That the reality of life is not so much things, not so much a single self here, but it's the combination of relationships that we have and that are found in the world. It's beginning to understand the nature of these relationships and taking care of them. So as we drop below the surface mind, we begin seeing something about underlying truths, underlying kind of laws of our reality, of our experience. And as I said already, it's often some of these rules or laws, laws of life, are often described as these three characteristics, impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and no-self. But there are others which are very important also. And I'd like to read one of them. It comes from the Buddha. And this is kind of a universal kind of law you find in many religions. But instead of adopting it as a law because your religious tradition tells you, when we drop below the surface chowder of the mind, we begin seeing how the cause and effect relationship, how these relationships work within ourselves and outside of ourselves, and we see that this is actually the case. So this is from the Dhammapada. Look how he abused me and beat me, how he threw me down and robbed me. Live with such thoughts and you live in hate. Look how he abused me and beat me, how he threw me down and robbed me. Abandon such thoughts and live in love. In this world, hate never yet dispelled hate. Only love dispels hate. This is a law, ancient and inexhaustible. Hate is never conquered or hate is never overcome by hate. Hate is overcome only by love. This is chanted repeatedly, when there's a central chance of Theravada tradition in Southeast Asia. I think this is one of these kind of laws, I don't know if laws is the best word, I don't like to wear exactly them. I couldn't think of a better one today. I wanted to read some passages from this book, called The Peace Pilgrim. How many of you have not seen this book? Most of you have seen it? That's impressive. This is a fantastic book about a woman who walked across the United States for about 28 years, and she was born in the Korean War in 1953, the time she died in 1981. She just walked, and she had a shirt that said Peace Pilgrim across it. This weekend, when I was going to read from this book, I was looking back at the book again to see what her name was, so I could tell people her name. I discovered that nowhere in the book is her name told. She never told anybody her name when she started pilgrimage. She'd just known everywhere for 28 years as a peace program. What's important is the message and not the messenger. She only had what she could carry in the pockets of her tunic, that she had made for herself. Basically, she had a toothbrush and a few things. She had no money. There was 28 years she didn't have anything to do with money, didn't carry a penny. She just walked across the country and was taken care of. She never asked anything from anybody. She just walked, and people would ask, What are you up to? She would explain, Come and have dinner. Come and stay with me. Sometimes she wouldn't, and she'd go days at a time hungry. She never went more than three days without food. She had trained herself by fasting for 45 days once, so she knew that that's no problem. So she walked for peace. I guess she's a Christian. She talks about Christianity, so it's a little bit unusual. It's kind of Christianity, perhaps. I'm going to read a quote where the word God is normal. I'm going to change the word God because I think she wouldn't mind. It's something I feel I could read. Before reading the quote, maybe I'll read her definition of God. Maybe then it would be okay for me. She wanted to know in high school, what is God, what is God? She had a burning desire to know what God was. And no one could really tell her. So she went out into the woods by herself for a long walk through the night and then discovered this kind of on her own, I guess. So her answer was that we human beings just lump together everything in the universe which is beyond the capacity of all of us. And to all those things together, some of us give the name God. Well, that set me on a search. The first thing I did was to look at a tree, and I said, there's one. All of us working together couldn't create that one tree. Even if it looked like a tree, it wouldn't grow. There's a creative force beyond us. Then I looked at my beloved stars at night, and there's another. There's a sustaining power that keeps planets in the orbits. So that's kind of a nice definition of God, I thought. Buddhism doesn't care too much one way or the other if there is a God or not. It doesn't seem to matter to Buddhists. And that means also that because it doesn't really matter, you can belong to any religion. You can be an atheist, you can be a religion, be a Christian, or Jew, or whatever. And still practice Buddhism is no problem. Buddhism also says that the universe is created by sustaining force, sustaining creative power. But in Buddhism, that power is a sustaining power that creates the world, the universe. It includes ourself. We're also part of what creates it. And Buddhism puts a lot of emphasis on that part that we also created through our intentions. And one Indian Buddhist philosopher said, the world is created by our intentions. So this is what she said, saying, we seem always ready to pay the price for war. Almost gladly we give our time and our treasure, our limbs, and even our lives for war. But we expect to get peace for nothing. We expect to be able to flagrantly disobey nature's laws and get peace as a result. Well, we won't get peace for nothing. And we won't get peace by disobeying laws of nature. We'll get peace only when we are willing to pay the price of peace. And to a world drunk with power, corrupted by greed, deluded by false prophets, the price of peace may seem high indeed. For the price of peace is obedience to the higher laws. And this is interesting after what I just read from the Buddha. Evil can only be overcome by good and hatred by love. Only a good means can attain a good end. The price of peace is to abandon fear and replace it with faith. And I would think that if we obey God's laws, we will receive God's blessings. So I would change that sentence too. The price of peace is to abandon fear and replace it with trust. Trust? Yes, that's enough. But the price of peace is to abandon hate and allow love to reign supreme in our hearts. Love for all our fellow human beings over the world. The price of peace is to abandon arrogance and replace it with repentance and humility, remembering that the way of peace is the way of love. The price of peace is to abandon greed and replace it with giving, so that none will be spiritually injured by having more than they need. While others in the world still have less than they need. Interesting statement. So none will be spiritually injured by having more than they need. Did you ever think that way? I know I was being prepared for the pilgrimage when I made certain choices. For instance, I was in grammar school when I was offered cigarettes from a package, which I did not smoke, but my friends did. In high school I was offered all kinds of alcohol, which I did not drink, but my friends did. And just after my student days, I was faced with a kind of test, because all of my friends at that time used both alcohol and tobacco. There was such a push towards conformity in those days. They call it peer pressure now. That they actually looked down on me because I didn't do those things. And gathered in someone's living room, I said to them, Look, life is a series of choices, and nobody can stop you from making your choices. But I have a right to make my own choices too, and I have chosen freedom. No one walks so safely as one who walks humbly and harmlessly with great love and great faith. For such a person gets through to the good in others, and there is good in everyone, and therefore cannot be harmed. This works between individuals, it works between groups, and it would work between nations if nations had the courage to try it. Once I was hit by a disturbed teenage boy whom I had taken for a walk. He wanted to go hiking, but was afraid he might break a leg and be left laying there. Everyone was afraid to go with him. He was a great big fellow and looked like a football player, and he was known to be violent at times. They had once beaten his mother so badly that she had to spend several weeks in the hospital. Everybody was afraid of him, so I offered to go with him. As we got up to the first hilltop, everything was going fine. Then a thunderstorm came along. He was very terrified because a thunder shower was very close. Suddenly he went off the beam and came for me, hitting at me. I didn't run away, although I guess I could have. He had a heavy pack on his back. But even while he was hitting me, I could only feel the deepest compassion towards him. How terrible to be so psychologically sick that you would be able to hit a defenseless old woman. I bathed his hatred with love even while he hit me. As a result, the hitting stopped. He said, If you didn't hit back, my mother always hits back. The delayed reaction because of his disturbance had reached the good in him. Oh, it's there, no matter how deeply it is buried. And he experienced remorse and complete self-condemnation. What are a few bruises on my body in comparison with the transformation of the human life? To make the long story short, he was never violent again. He is a useful person in this world today. And there was this time when another man stopped his car to talk with me. He looked at me not unkindly, but with extreme surprise and curiosity. As though he had just glimpsed a live dinosaur. In this day and age, he exclaimed, with all the wonderful opportunities the world has to offer, what under the sun may you get out and walk a pilgrimage for peace? In this day and age, I answered, I have taughters on the brink of a nuclear war of annihilation. It is not surprising that one life is dedicated to the cause of peace, but rather it is surprising that many lives are not similarly dedicated. Another time, a truck driver pulled his truck to the side of the road and said, I heard you say over the television something about the endless energy, and I just wanted to tell you that I had it one time. I was marooned in a town by a flood. I got so bored that I finally offered to help, and I got interested in getting people out. I worked without eating, I worked without sleeping, and I wasn't tired. But I don't have it anymore. And I said, well, what are you working for now? Money, he said. And I said, that should be quite incidental. You have the endless energy only when you are working for the good of the whole. You have to stop working for your little selfish interest. How often are you worrying about the present moment? The present is usually all right. If you're worrying, you're either agonizing over the past, which you should have forgotten long ago, or else you're apprehensive over the future, which hasn't even come yet. We tend to skim right over the present moment. It is the only moment God gives us, gives any of us to live. If you don't live the present moment, you never get around to living at all. And if you do live the present moment, you tend not to worry. For me, every moment is a new and wonderful opportunity to be of service. If you find inner peace, but this is not because they try and fail, it is because they do not try. I perceive the entirely self-centered life as not worth living. If what you are doing will not benefit others besides yourself, it is not worth doing. So if you went to Miss Amazing Children Mission, she affected many, many people's lives, and she became apparently very popular. I never heard of her, Phil, after she died. But she was invited, the first ten years, mostly she walked. She walked all the time after that, but then she had so many speaking engagements. And she was on television and radios and all over that. A few times in the fifties, she was arrested for vagrancy, and she happened back then. And once she got arrested for vagrancy, and they took all her stuff away, which wasn't much, but she kept her correspondence, most recent correspondence in her shirt. And then when they put her in jail overnight, and they looked through her correspondence, and there was a letter from the governor of that state. I let her out. But she went into jail, and beaming, smiling, and they put her into this room with four other women in jail. And the women looked at her and said, whenever women come into jail, they're either crying or growling. And you're smiling, what's going on with you? And she said to them, if you had a day off at home, what would you do? And there everyone got them singing and telling stories, and they had a great time. So she devoted herself to a life of simplicity, radical simplicity. And claims, she writes, that she's lived in joy the whole time she's in Pilderich. She's been 28 years of joy. Buddhism puts a lot of value also on simplicity, living simple life. One of the virtues in Buddhism is to be content with few things, to find contentment with few things, not need a lot. And what that means for anyone, it means a different thing for different people, what anybody needs. And she says that herself in here. She says, if you have family with children, you need to have a secure home with certain things. Everybody shouldn't be at peace for them like she is, and do that. I think that's a poverty like she is. She lives very much like the way a traditional Buddhist monk or nun would live, or does still live, some of them. Traditionally Buddhist monks don't keep any money, they don't have any money at all. And they spend a lot of time just walking. And they're not allowed to keep any food overnight. They have to give it away, if they have any left over by noon. And it means the next day you don't have any money. It's the next day you wake up and you don't have any food either. So basically you go out and see what happens. You have a begging bowl, and usually in those cultures people know what the person is about. So people usually feel the bowl. But she's been more amazing because she didn't even have a begging bowl, or any cultural context of what she was doing. And many, many, many Westerners who are ordained as monks in Asia came back to America committed to continue following the monastic life here in America. And after some months usually, they decided it was too difficult, they couldn't do it. And they gave up their homes. And here's this woman who managed too beautifully. But just like she says, it's not a matter of giving up all your wealth, you have to find out for yourself what it is, what you need to have. Buddhism said the same thing. It's interesting a little bit that Buddhism traditionally in India didn't put down wealth. Sometimes we feel that you're really wealthy. Some people in our culture think it's a little bit funny and really wealthy, maybe. And money has kind of bad, I think it's a bad rap in the West. But in Buddhism, wealth was considered to be a result of past good intentions. You got it all being. Now, maybe that's kind of naive. But there's a sutra, a scripture, that's called the Sigalaka Sutta. This means some advice to lay people, advice on how the lay person should live. Now read this little stock, a piece of it. The friend who is a helper, and the friend in times both good and bad, the friend who shows the way that's right, the friend who's full of sympathy, these four kinds of friends, the wise should know at their true worth. And they should cherish them with care, just like a mother with her dearest child. The wise man trained in discipline, sorry, that's his language, the wise man trained in discipline shines out like a beacon fire. He gathers wealth just as the bee gathers honey. And he gathers wealth just as the bee gathers honey. So in terms of making your money, your wealth or your livelihood, can you make your money the same way that a bee gathers honey, nectar? But the bee doesn't disturb the flower. It doesn't take away the fragrance from the flower, the beauty from the flower. The flower is kind of left untouched. And when you go back to your livelihood, make your money. Can you make your money the same way? Or can your company do it? With wealth so gained, the layman, the layperson, can devote it to his people's good. The layperson should divide his or her wealth into four parts. This will bring the most advantage. One part should be enjoyed in whatever way you want. The second part should be put to work. And the fourth part should be set aside as reserve in times of need. So, I don't know if you think about that. That's his first part? Two parts, I'm sorry, the two parts should be put to work, not the second part. So half of it should be put back into work, invested in it. I'm a little bit surprised because the feeling in Buddhism, a lot of these contexts, is if you have wealth, it's only good to have wealth if you use it for other people's benefit. And that's not one of the four parts. So, I'm not looking for it. Isn't that what they mean by putting it to work? It could mean for it to work. Not necessarily, it can make a moment. The first part, where you enjoy it, I will. It's said in Buddhism that you shouldn't give unless your joy in giving is greater than the joy of the person receiving. So, the surface mind, the chatur mind, there's an expression in Buddhism that's called noble silence. The silence that happens in the monkey mind is quiet, is deeper and more profound than any kind of external silence you have ever known. Do you have anything you would ask for, for this evening? I think it needs to be acted. Let's be linked. She was talking about non-overcoming faith. It seems to me that there's a step-ject skip that is in my experience when I feel that I can hurt myself. It doesn't do just to forgive the Christian and some quasi-Christian notion. One of the first things that has to happen, is to really realize that I'm hurting it out. He has a lot of compassion for being so constituted that I am hurt as an un-complicated person. Then what happens is, what this person did to you is become irrelevant. He was just crushing it. After I had fully seen, put her in, I was hurting her head and I was losing the passion for it. Then, they really interviewed you first, you know, within the other person. You come so far, and you're not going to be hurt. And this is a rather amazing part. Now, there had to be a beautiful part of what you know, of the body of the priest. And no one has ever hurt that child, or anything such as that. Of course, it's very important to honor, respect and acknowledge what's really going on with us in terms of our feelings, and not to gloss over them, because of the kind of idealistic stance about love. And in a sense, perhaps, if you understand your own choices, your own responsibility, it's easy to kind of let it go, in a sense. I think for this peace pilgrim, this man came to her with all this hate. And she didn't have any hate. All she had was love. But it wasn't that she didn't care. It wasn't that it didn't matter for her. I think it mattered very much for her, what was going on and his well-being. So it's not simply a matter of kind of resolving your own deal, your own side of it, and then kind of walking away. I think the relationship is still very important. And if we just walk away from it, and not try to take care of it in some realistic way, we do also kind of additional violence to ourselves at times. But we have to start with where we are, and respect ourselves, and take everything into account. It's too easy, I think, to take religious teachings and plug them in, program them in to the surface mind, to the monkey mind. And it just becomes one more thing the monkey mind is trying to deal with, and has nothing to do with what's more deeply going on. So if you care about love and never really love, and you do it just from the surface mind, it doesn't have much sincerity, it doesn't work. The movement of positive thinking that has been somewhat popular in the West, is looked upon a little bit skeptically by Buddhists, because it's too easy for just to be kind of reorganizing the surface mind, and not really kind of reaching down to the roots. This book is available for free, this piece called The Book. And after she died, five of her friends, also anonymous, gathered together for writing and stuff that she had jotted together over the years, and put it into this book, and then offered it for free. And for many years it's the only way you can get it for free. And now they've come out with a trade version, trade copy, that you can buy bookstores, but you don't have to go out from the bookstore. Just the bookstores, they want everybody to be happy, so you can make a bookstore and be happy too. And you can just write away to this address that's in their jacket, and they'll send it to you. And then it says somewhere, so this copy doesn't say this, another copy that I've seen, it says something about if you'd like to make a donation, the donation will go towards further printings. But you know, it's basically a note, but it's free. Yes? Can you read the book? You're into this evening? Your book is here? Oh, yes. And it's on their copyright page in the back, and the copyright says, this book is copyrighted only to prevent it being misused. People working for peace, spiritual development, and the growth of human awareness throughout the world are willing permission to reproduce material from this book. Okay, thank you all. Good night. Thank you.
