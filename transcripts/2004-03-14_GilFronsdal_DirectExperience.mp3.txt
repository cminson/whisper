 I'm at Spirit Rock most of this month teaching a month-long retreat and I'm home a little bit on the weekends and our speaker who was scheduled for today couldn't come so I thought I would stop in, fill in. One of the remarkable things about mindfulness practice that's very evident in a long retreat like this month-long is that there's a kind of deepening and deeper and deeper, deepening and deepening connections that people have with their direct experience. Some of that is learned by seeing very clearly how we keep ourselves separate from our immediate experience, our lived experience. Then as people tune in and relax into it, deeper and deeper aspects of what's actually here, always here, becomes more and more evident in that concentrated stillness of the practice. A lot of it has to do with, you see on the retreat, people having learning a deeper and deeper trust that it's okay to be present for their lived experience, their immediate experiences as it's actually lived, as it's actually experienced as direct experience, becomes evident that many of us live much of our lives somewhat removed from our direct experience. We can, most obviously, in thinking about the future a lot or planning or thinking about the past, reviewing it, living in fantasy a lot, but even if we're somewhat in the present moment, we can be somewhat removed from it by how we relate to the present moment. We might know that maybe our body has some kind of injury and pain, and so we know that's what's going on, but we haven't really stopped carefully, fully to really sense our way feel, what that pain is really like in and of itself. We might go off and kind of react and look on the internet about everything we can about that injury and how to heal it and talk to our doctors or whatever, but talk to our friends or something, somehow keep ourselves removed from just relaxing this being. What is this experience in and of itself? Emotions are that way a lot. Emotions tend to come together with a lot of stories that we tell ourselves about why we feel the way we do or why we should or shouldn't feel the way we are feeling, and so we might somewhat know how we're experiencing, what we're experiencing emotionally, but there's also a tendency to keep ourselves removed from it. If it's painful emotions, people are kind of braced themselves against it or don't want to really feel it fully. They want to somehow get rid of it or make it different than what it is, and so you see here on the retreat, some people slowly are relaxing enough to find the trust or finding they have no other alternative, but to really feel the immediacy, the directness of what is going on for them. If you go down to the banks of a river and with a bucket and you take a bucket full of water out of the river and then walk around the countryside telling people that, look, I have the river here, I think it doesn't quite work, does it? Now you have a bucket of water, but it's not really the experience of the river. You don't see the current of the river, you don't see the boats floating in the river or the fish, or you don't see the way the river kind of waves and ripples of the river. The whole experience of riverness is not in the bucket, and many of us are sitting kind of at the banks of the direct experience of life as it flows and moves, moves, constantly moving. The present moment is a moving moment. It doesn't, it kind of like goes into the future. Every moment of the future comes to us or whatever way, I don't know where it goes, but you know, it's constantly flowing, things are changing, and then something happens and it's like we pick up the bucket and we go around, we relate to that memory, that thought, that concern about something that just happened, and many a times our involvement with the present moment, to the degree which we're tuned into it, is retrospective. Something's happened, oh, so you're, you know, you're driving your car, and then someone cuts you off in the traffic, which is an unfortunate event perhaps, but it's possible to spend the next five, ten minutes reflecting and thinking about that person, about what you're going to do to that person, or can you catch up to that person and get a good look and really stare the person in the eye, you know, or whatever, you know, or various ways in which we are thinking about what just happened, and in a sense it can take us away from the continuation of the flow of traffic, what's happening in the present moment. Part of the art of mindfulness is having a trust of can you stay in the present moment experience in a much more deeper and fuller way. The experience of freedom, as I said in the beginning in Buddhism, is through the doorway of our lived experience, the immediacy of our experience. I heard a story this week, in the early 80s, there was a somewhat eccentric Vipassana teacher teaching at IMS for, I guess, a three-month course, and one day she was going to give a Dharma talk and she had the staff there bring all the library books from the library, they had extensive library, and pile them up on the stage where the speaker speaks, and so all these books were there, and then she picked up one book and opened it, I don't think it was at random, and read one line, and the line said, the entire, the essence of the Dharma is letting go, and she closed the book and she left, with all those books on the stage left there. It's not exactly pointing to direct experience, but the direct experience is where we learn to let go, by sensing our way of feeling it being there. The direct experience is where we find some of the most valuable things of life, in the present moment as we live it, joy and love and peace and freedom. So what was it like for some of you to spend half an hour with your lived experience? Trusting, of course, you had it, right? So with your hands, it was easy to slip back into your stories. Not my hands, my hands are too fat, they're too thin, they're too this, they're too that. I said, I didn't do my nails today, and so, you know. I kind of got sort of around the time, and then after a while he said, it's okay, don't fill your hands, or something's that effective, drop that coch that I don't have to be so hard-witted. That's very good. Awareness itself, in and of itself, is a very simple and easy aspect of human life. It's when we want to do something with it, direct it or hold it a certain way or accomplish something, that sometimes it gets quite difficult. If you did nothing at all, awareness would operate. You might not be aware of what you would like to be aware of, but do you always need to be aware of what you want to be aware of? Meditation sometimes to relax your awareness quite deeply and let reality show itself can be quite profound. Yeah? I enjoyed it immensely. Years ago, going to, you know, sweeping, so it's a little more interactive, and being, you know, having a guided meditation ability was so relaxing, and just sort of, just letting the experience of whatever arises in that particular part of the body was really wonderful. Where it got a little tricky as we got into awareness, knowing itself, the one who knows, you know, that element there, it didn't feel too much different. I didn't notice a big shift between that and peace. There was sort of a continuity at one point, because I really couldn't grab it. There wasn't anything there, so it was kind of interesting to just be patient and see what happens. That was peaceful. Great, thank you. Anybody have difficulties? I just always find it very difficult focusing on the body, and this time I was much more aware of how nuance, subtle, and obsession is there. Try not to take that into consideration. And I have often had the sensation that I can only do it just after my left arm, and the right side. Part of the value of beginning to pay attention to the lived experience, the present experience, the bodily experience, is to become aware of the things that take us away from it, to keep us removed from it. And that's really part of the value, to see that, to really see clearly how the mind operates, how the reactions of judgments, how the story making operates. And you really get to know that well. I think it's very easy for meditators to somehow, then to kind of to learn about present moment experience, to learn about being in their body, and then think, oh, I'm wrong or bad because I can't do that. There's no such thing as being wrong or bad because you can't do that. But the attempt to do that can highlight and make clear all the other things that are going on, so we can learn from that and see it, and by seeing it clearly find our way through that. When the Chinese received Buddhism, it was very confusing for them, because they received they started receiving Buddhism around the first century. And by the time they'd been five or six centuries of developments of Indian Buddhism, and then they got it all at once. The Indians kind of saw all the different schools and all the different historical layers and kind of knew where it all kind of fit, but the Chinese just got it all in a sense. And as scholars say, it took the Chinese about 500 years to begin to understand what Buddhism was about. But there was a huge intellectual endeavor in China, but trying to make sense of all these different schools of Indian Buddhism, all the different, you know, all that. And around the year, around the sixth, seventh or eighth century, was kind of the pinnacle of this great intellectual synthesis of Buddhism that was going on in China. There was a famous Zen teacher, a scholar named Sunmi, who was synthesizing all this, and he synthesized it all in one sentence. And the sentence is, liberation beckons us from within everything. Isn't that nice? There's a summary of all of Buddhism. And one of the reasons I like it is that everything then, everything that's a thing, everything which is a lived experience, whether it's even judgments or thoughts or sensations of your hands, there's something in there that somehow can be felt as or seen as or understood as an invitation to come and be liberated here, find your liberation here, find how to be free here. So there's nothing, there's no need to turn away from anything and nor has become liberated. In fact, to turn away from anything is in the opposite direction of liberation. The movement of, towards liberation, is one of inclusivity, of incorporating or seeing everything, of not shutting down, not turning away, not saying in a sense no to anything, but learning how to find liberation, how to find freedom or your peace in whatever the experience you're having right now. So right now, not tomorrow or the next time you meditate, but as you're sitting here now listening to my voice, sensing and feeling the room that you're in, the light of the room, the experience of your body against the chair and the cushion, your thoughts you're having as you listen to me say this, all this and the immediacy of right now is where liberation is beckoning you, inviting you, if you'd like to take the opportunity, if you want to enter into that in a way that's direct and immediate, to find the liberation that's there. Is that possible? So I hope that you certainly enjoy your lived experience, that you explore it and play in it, practice with it, wake up to it, become more sensitive to it, and certainly appreciate the great opportunity that's inherent in our direct experience of our lived life. And perhaps in noticing that the opportunity to also start noticing what is lost when we spend a long time away from our direct experience. And the longer we're away from it, I think the more that is lost. So may you all enjoy your direct experience.
