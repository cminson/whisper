 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. And this will transition us to the next part of our unfolding ritual, which involves speaking and listening. And so today, not surprisingly, the topic I had in mind to share is a ritual and our Dharma practice. I realized that this is not a popular topic in the Western Theravada Centers, and especially maybe lay community centers. And there can be certain, we can have a certain kind of relationship when the word ritual gets uttered. And some may consider this as superficial, or even cultural baggage, or not necessary as part of the Buddhist practice. And I can totally relate to that. And for me, I've been to Chinese temples with lots of rich rituals and involves incense burning and money making. And so I can feel a sense of baggage associated with it. And yet, rituals, whether they are seen, unseen, known, unknown, they are part of many religious traditions and spiritual life. In some of the cultures, like the culture I came from, the Asian culture, rituals are quite significant and prominent. I remember once visiting Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi, who lives in a Chinese monastery. And I asked him, what is the biggest difference between the Western Theravada traditions and the Chinese Buddhism in his experience, given that he's living in a Chinese monastery. And he said, much is in common, but where he lives, there were a lot of rituals and they can be quite long, hours and hours of bowing. And so, often they are involved in bowing, chanting different forms in the rituals. And they are rich in a lot of different cultures, like myself, coming from the Asian culture. In the Western Theravada Center, like this, Insight Meditation Center, many of us come to the center may not even notice any ritual whatsoever. But rituals are here. And so, those of you who come through the door, maybe not so obvious for those who are online on YouTube, but entering into IMC, what we often do is put our shoes on the shelves and we come into the meditation hall. Some people bow in front of the Buddha statue and then we take our seat. And at the end of the session, often people bow out and leave. And so, there are these rituals present, even in a center like this. But many of us may or may not associate with them as rituals. And so, today I wanted to kind of maybe highlight some of the dimensions of it. So, I personally wasn't paying attention to the effects of rituals until much later in my own Buddhist path. But as I reflect back, I can say that in many ways, rituals played quite a significant role in my own Dharma life. I just didn't realize it for a long time. And I remember the first time, first exposure to this was when I first came to the United States. Very shortly, I lost my grandpa, who was very close to us. He lived with our family the whole of my life, basically, until that time. And he passed away in China. And it was very clear that I wouldn't be able to make my way back to be with him in any way, for a wide variety of reasons I just got here. So, I was very confused and a little lost and just not sure what to do. And I happened to go to a Pure Land Buddhist Dhasanga in my university town there, through a college roommate that I stayed with. And not knowing what's possible, I just told them that this is the situation I'm in. And they spontaneously put together a ritual. And that honored, remembered my grandpa for who he was, and honored him. And I just offered a very brief kind of a description. They put this kind of very beautiful and yet simple ritual around it, and offered a chanting and offered a blessing for him to have a blessed afterlife, which I didn't really know, but it did something to my heart. I felt quite at ease, and I felt that there was some kind of a closure out of this. And so that was first encounter of the Buddhist ritual. And in some maybe miraculous ways, it probably created a certain affinity between myself and Buddhists and Buddhism. And I got very curious about it and began kind of exploring and seeking the Buddhist practices and the teachings. And rituals can have many potent functions in our spiritual life. I wanted to share this quote from an article that Gil Fransdell wrote about rituals in Buddhism. And so here is what he said. Rituals are a form of language that expresses many dimensions of our human condition, including our relationship to others and to our spiritual life. And then later on in the article, it says, rituals share many characteristics with poetry, theater, dance, evoking emotions, intuition, and new perspectives. Because rituals touch more aspects of our mind and heart than simple prose and the didactic explanations, rituals, like the arts, can enrich our lives and engage the full range of our being. And so I really resonated with that quite a lot. So today I want to share just a few dimensions of the functions and the effects of rituals in our Dharma practice. Maybe as pointers, there may be many other dimensions that's accessible to some of you, but these are just a few that I may be pointing out today. So the first one is the relationship of rituals and our hearts. And so in a way, when we engage in rituals wholeheartedly, rituals themselves become a heart practice. It's like a Brahma Viharas. It becomes a heart practice. They can touch and open our hearts and our beings deeply. And so for myself, in my own case, rituals had opened my heart in ways that may be beyond my own logical analytical mind. They touched something deeper inside of me. In our traditions, simple bowing, when we do it wholeheartedly, it can become expressions of many beautiful qualities of our heart. Reverence, reverence towards whatever we're bowing towards could even just be earth, sky, and everything in between, animated, unanimated. And so there can be a deep sense of reverence. Another possibility, bowing, it carries a deep sense of gratitude, humility, and this gesture of two hands coming together can also symbolize harmony, coming in harmony, and unifying in some way in our being. And so for me, recent months, I've been carrying out a ritual of 108 bows each morning before my own meditation practice. And this particular practice was called force because for a while I was experiencing or encountering a lot of illness, aging, death, some really close, my own family, family members, relatives, and people I know of and people I don't know well, and just kind of there's a lot going on there. And so I felt a calling in my heart to express a deeper sense of care and love and compassion. And one day I just decided I'm going to do this 108 bows each morning and dedicating each bow to whoever comes to my mind for their well-being and peace. And I had thought that maybe after a while people are getting better than at some point I'll stop. But new people keep on getting added to this list, so it hasn't stopped. And yet this practice has really becoming my own metta practice or brahma vihara practice, not necessarily sitting still on a cushion but in a form of a bowing. And so simple practices like this can really open our heart in new ways that we may not be opening to previously. The second function or effect about rituals is that the process of ritual involves making ourselves available to that unfolding process. And so when we offer ourselves up to this process, the process can become a force of transformation. And ritual often leads participants through a process and opens people to new perspectives or new insights. But the transformation is only possible if we put down some of the self-centered agendas. I want to get something. As I remember going to the Chinese temple before, oftentimes people go there, want to get something, even if it's something in the belief system that, you know, will get blessed by something. But the process of a ritual really is an invitation to open to something rather than getting something. One of the most significant Buddhist rituals that function as this kind of transformation is the ritual of taking refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, the Triple Gem. Some of you probably have done this refuge ceremony yourselves, and others may have done this on retreats. We often do refuge ceremony at the beginning of the retreat. For the duration of the retreat, we take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. And taking refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha for life and beyond evokes an alignment of our life with something that we may aspire to. And so for some people, this can be quite significant, and it has a lot of implications, maybe making commitment on how we live our lives. I remember for myself many years ago when I did this refuge ceremony with my monastic teacher, who's my preceptor, offered this refuge ceremony to me. And so in this refuge ceremony, he offered me a small card. On that, there was my Chinese Dharma name, and the date that the refuge ceremony took place. And it has the refuges and precepts on the two sides of the little card. So at the end of this ceremony, I felt as if I was reborn into a new life, and kind of like a birthday into the Buddha's lineage. And so I was rather significant, it was a kind of gut feeling, very intuitive sense, but it was rather significant. The transformation happens very gradually over time, but if I reflect back, this was a significant ritual in my life. I really began to shift little by little in how I choose to live my life. And this may be the case for some people who's done a ritual like that. And the third one, maybe one of the most important one function about ritual is that rituals, when they're done consciously with a heightened awareness, it opens us up to many dimensions of our inner being that may be otherwise unseen and unknown. And I remember sometimes, especially on the early phase of my practice, sometimes coming to the practice, we can carry this kind of a mainstream materialistic attitude, I'm coming here to get something or get rid of something that we don't like. And so let's get really quick, we just get to our sitting question and then we sit. And then when it ends, we dash out. And so when we show up with kind of this narrow focus and narrow or narrowing ourselves to this set of things that we want and we want to gain and we want to get, then the practice probably have a different effect on us. It's always using it as something to get some more things and get rid of some things we don't like. I'll share another example that was a vivid teaching of this sort for myself. I was in a Chinese Sangha for a long time. We had a beloved Taiwanese Dharma teacher who wants coming to offer a teaching. We haven't seen her for a long time. So we were all very enthusiastic. We got to our little center early and we set up the desk and the mic and we were all sitting on the front row waiting. And so by the time the teacher showed up and she walked down the hallway, it was really just a living room in an old house in Sunnyvale. It was not a big place, but she just walked into the room and get to the desk and sat down. And then he just looked around in the room and kind of different parts of the room. And then her head landed on a corner of the room where there was a big pile of messy cables all around, kind of cables that connects to the mic and was a big spaghetti right over in the corner. And so she turned her face, looked at us and then said, that too is the practice. So we were all sitting on the front row really embarrassed. Like what? And I really don't remember much about the talk, but I didn't remember this. That was a significant teaching for me. That when we began to open the field of our practice, ritual is a vehicle for us to begin to open to all of these processes around and included in our practice, including the sitting and the talking and speaking and how we show up. And so as a ritual, each ritual has a beginning, a middle and end. And so when we walk into our space, and this is a part of the beginning, how we walk into the space, how we take our seat. And I was inviting even in our sitting meditation as a process of a ritual and how we began this process of a meditation. What are the orientations that we have? And so open ourselves up to all of these different dimensions of it. As when we consider our practice as a ritual, there may be a sense of sacredness that can come in. And that as if it's kind of touching our heart right there. And sometimes when I consider this meditation as a whole field of ritual, whatever practice we're engaging in, we're already bringing the heart practice with us. And we're kind of integrating all of these dimensions into our practice. And I want to just take a pause to see what's coming up right now. One thing that comes up for me right now is that in our relationship with meditation, often we're offered with meditation instructions around breath, body, emotions in our thoughts. Instead of considering those are instructions for our meditation, we can maybe see them as a description of the unfolding meditative process. Kind of describing a process of a ritual, meditative ritual. And when we see it this way, it may help us to kind of let go of me doing this, me doing the instructions. Instead, we're kind of offering ourselves to this process of meditation, or it's a meditation process, meditative process being offered to us through the words and the phrases that are offered in the instructions. So in this way, we may be receiving all of these instructions through a sense of opening to something rather than getting something, receiving something. And there are many possibilities when this is done. There can be different kind of beauty that come in. For me today, in the middle of the meditation, I opened my eyes. Look at all the folks who are sitting here and imagining the folks meditating on the YouTube together. And so there was an immediate sense of belonging to the community that came along and belonging to maybe the world that we're part of. And when we're not cluttered by our thoughts of wanting and desires, clarity can also come in. And this is where the new perspectives can come in. And as part of the insight practice, the insights may come along. Maybe not even expressed in words just yet. Maybe it's some form of embodied way, how we walk out this meditation hall when we finish. And so allow this ritual process to be expansive, maybe including all different elements that come along with it. And sometimes I'm considering the Dharma practice. If Dharma practice itself is an overarching kind of ritual that has its beginning, middle and end, we can consider many, it has many, many rituals within, like mandala fractals, kind of in our session today as we walk into IMC. And all the way to the end, we had many rituals of sitting meditation. We had a ritual of Dharma talk engaging with speaking and listening. And we may have another small ritual towards the end where there is a community gathering. And can we consider incorporating this kind of dimensions in our practice? Can we treat each day as if we're living a ritual of the day? How do we wake up? How do we want to live the day? And how do we want to end the day? And so I don't have kind of a fixed idea about this, but the invitation is for you to consider the possibility and how it might affect you in your own practice. And so there may be many different forms of rituals needed for different seasons and different situations and on different days. Yet no matter what rituals we engage in, it's an opportunity to live with a clear heart, a clear mind and open heart. And so may the ritual of our practice allow us to touch the depths of our being. May it support all beings. So thank you for your kind attention. And we'll open up for some reflections and questions and sharing you may have. You may have your own relationships with this. Yeah. I asked this with a lot of hesitation, kind of thought about it, whether I should ask or not. And what I call of myself is not ours to any rituals as such, especially being raised in India, you know, it's part of culture. And I have been from not being okay with them, but being okay with them. Although, and I'm not too versed with the Theravada style of literature or, you know, books or what, before I have read. And from what I've heard, there is something called path to enlightenment. And from being a one time stream enter to being in our hunt, the first step it says, and I don't know where this comes from, but it does say the one time stream enter loses of what probably I don't know his or her self. Right. Right. Right. Rights and rituals. Yeah. So it's, I mean, it took, it took a lot to ask this question because I felt I don't want to sound. Yeah. Yeah. Or cocky or whatever. Thank you. The idea is it's hard for what I call of myself or ego, whatever, to reconcile that fact with, or maybe it's just a sense of attachment to rituals. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a great question. I kind of contemplated whether to talk about that or not. And it's interesting that the Pali term gets translated as a rights and rituals, but the Pali meaning is not necessarily rights and rituals. And so what it's really signifying is the first stage of awakening is letting go of a dogmatic holding of certain rules. And so, in fact, yeah, the direct translation wouldn't map to rights and rituals. And in the broader Buddhist seeing, especially monastics, Buddhism, rituals are always a big part of it. And then, and how we hold them is what we're asking. And so are we holding them as I must do this and, you know, and what's the first first stage of awakening is letting go of a dogmatic holding. But it allows us to open up to discern what is the supportive of our own heart and mind on the path of awakening and what is not. And so today what I'm offering is the possibility of considering the dimensions of ritual that might be supportive in our practice and not necessarily saying that we must all do this. This is it. And so that becomes a dogmatic holding. Does that kind of make sense? Yeah. Thank you. So we, now I think about it, every evening my wife and I do a sitting for 20 minutes. It's kind of become ritualistic in the way it's evolved. It's not anything we said. This has to be done this way or that way. You know, in fact, it wouldn't be formally approved, so to speak, because the cat gets on her lap because it's so settled and we do this. And it's evolved out of necessity of, you know, especially my wife's challenges with sleeping due to the heavenly messengers and the world situation and all these different things. And this seems to have helped calm her down, helped her sleep and helps me too, of course. And that is a way I guess I could see how rituals evolve in that way. Yeah, beautiful. And then part of what I was hoping to point to is to begin to become conscious of how these processes and elements of ritual can have different effects on us. And so for me, it was many years not realizing it's actually doing something to my own heart and mind, but becoming conscious of it. Oh, this can be very supportive. And this can be. And then we began to able to learn what really supports us and what does not support us. And so this, yeah, this recognition has a role. Yeah. So noticing and recognizing, oh, this has become part of my life. Yeah. Yeah. Great. Thank you so much for your talk. What came to mind for me was many years ago, I was bothered, pretty deeply bothered by feelings. My mother had passed away and I hadn't been with her at the time. So I felt bad about that. And I looked over my life with her and thought of like a number of times I had been unkind or not as kind as I could have been. I couldn't really forgive myself for that. So somehow I came up with this idea of creating a ritual for myself because I felt like I would write on a little piece of paper, every unkind thing that I could think of. Of course, there were lots of little pieces of paper. Then I made a, I filled a pan with water and one by one at my gas stove, I burned these and threw them in the water, threw them in the water. And then at the end, I could like toss out the water and I felt as if my mother was just, if she had been alive, she was holding me and saying, I know you love me. And I forgive you. And it really worked. So that was just a one time ritual, but it was powerful for me. Yeah, beautiful. Thank you for sharing that story. A grief, a grief ritual is powerful for many people that, for myself, in the sense of my grandpa passing away, there definitely some sense of grief and confusion. And offers such a closure and healing. And so, yeah, absolutely. And open to new possibilities. And that's also another form of transforming, you know, because otherwise we could be holding a lot of regrets or it's just kind of attracting us. And as it becomes a process, allow things that are unprocessed to be held in safety and kindness. And so that it can get processed. Yeah. Thank you. So one more there. Thank you. My, this is a question for you, I guess, just my experience with rituals, there's been periods of time where I've hesitated participating in them. And then I've gone back to look at maybe I should give it a second chance or third, fourth chance. How is that a typical cycle? Yeah, yeah. Yes, I appreciate this question. And I think I'm kind of connected with the first question also in some way. Sometimes we may have been exposed to the way of doing rituals that are harmful to us and we can kind of shut off ourselves. And I certainly had a very dismissive attitude towards them at the very beginning because of my own exposure. It's like going to this big temple and that people just smoky and crowded and just busy getting things. And I just kind of felt very lost in them. And I didn't have a very, I didn't have any really positive relationship with them until I began to notice. And, you know, some of the rituals I participate, maybe not even aware, kind of a state at my subconscious level. And I wasn't really aware what was happening. But I didn't know that it's doing something to me and through, began to become aware. Oh, this wasn't kind of how what it is, kind of like what how I associated with it before. And so I began to open to the possibility that, oh, this may have something different to offer to me. And so, yes, we can go through some of the cycles and especially some of the rituals can be done in very dogmatic way. You got to do this, that, that, that, that, that. And we make and feel very distant with that kind of attitude. Thank you for the question. Yeah. It's kind of like a whole territory. And so I just invite maybe considering open to this a little by little and and becoming aware of the effects on us. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we need to. Yes. Yes, I will be around for a little while. So I probably just are we just going to be outside or in the community hall. OK, I'll stand somewhere. So thank you, everyone, for being here. And let's maybe end with a typical ritual in our in our scene. And that is a dedication of a marriage. So may we all just take a moment to settle in our bodies on our seats, maybe just bring forth this last a few hours being together any form of a goodness that you can touch in your own being in small ways, big ways. And allow this goodness to expand and touch your whole being. May it supports our well being. And may the glow of the goodness expand in all directions. And may it support all beings everywhere. May all beings have well being. May all beings be free. Thank you.
