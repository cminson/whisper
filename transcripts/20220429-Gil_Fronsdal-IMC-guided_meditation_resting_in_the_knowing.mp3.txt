 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So good morning everyone. Here we are on the last day of discussing the Four Noble Truths. And in terms of how it relates to meditation, it's central to the whole process in Buddhism. But what I'd like to emphasize for this meditation is that an important word in the wording, description of the Four Noble Truths, that's often overlooked. And that is the word understanding. To understand the Noble Truth of Suffering. To understand the Noble Truth of the arising of suffering. To understand the Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering. And to understand the Noble Truth of the practice leading to the cessation of suffering. And so you see the word understanding keeps getting repeated. And we tend to kind of look at the rest of the sentences to understand. We mean we have to understand something. We have to understand what its meaning of the statements are. But half of what we're doing also is beginning to appreciate more and more value, recognize the understanding, the awareness, the knowing that goes on. And it's kind of a little bit maybe the secret that rather than solving the Four Noble Truths and seeing them, understanding them, a big part of what we're doing is heightening our recognition, our appreciation of the mind's ability to be attentive. And that takes many forms. One of them is to understand, to know, to be conscious of. And as this sense of, as a sense of, attentiveness, awareness, knowing, clear comprehension, mindfulness becomes stronger. It becomes a refuge. It becomes a place to abide in. And it becomes a place where we feel safe, present, as we're able to look out into the world or look into our own suffering in an effective way. It is, we're not blinded by or absorbed or about what suffering is, but we appreciate the ability to step back and just hold it in awareness. So for this meditation, maybe there's some way that you can switch the paradigm of how minds often operate, where they're concerned about something. And if we do mindfulness, we're trying to be mindful of something. And that's all fine, but there's a whole other half of what's happening. And that is the awareness itself, the knowing, the attentiveness, the clear comprehension. I use a lot of words because different people resonate with different words or their minds work differently. So their attentiveness is different using different capacities. So I see some felt sense. Felt sense to feel what's going on is also another way. If we don't get caught up in how we feel, but are able to rest and be receptive in that feeling sense that we have. So let's see how that goes today. So beginning the meditation and lowering your gaze if their eyes are open looking down and not looking at anything in particular, but the eyes see there is seeing that seeing which has no effort to see. Maybe things are not in focus, but still the eyes are taking in light and receptive receptivity of the eyes and then gently closing your eyes. And there's the receptivity of hearing where it maybe it doesn't matter so much what you hear, but if you can hear something, appreciate the hearing, the hearingness of hearing, the receptivity of the ears. And then there's the sensations of your body, sensing the body, not searching for sensations, but the way the body is receptive to sensations. Sensations appear, are present, and being appreciating the receptivity of our sensing the body. If you feel any holding or tension in the body, maybe on the exhale, relax the holding, soften. Letting yourself just take a few moments to breathe consciously, to breathe attentively. Where the attentiveness to breathing is appreciated as something important, just attentiveness itself. The fact that we're conscious is kind of a miracle. And to be conscious is always something that happens in the present moment. To appreciate being conscious is to appreciate the present. A consciousness which is not searching or trying to do something, but is more receptive. As you exhale, perhaps you can relax any tension or pressure around or within your field of attentiveness, around consciousness, being conscious. Perhaps allowing the sensations or the experience of breathing to be like a gentle wind blowing across the field of consciousness or gentle waves washing up across the beach, coming and going on the beach. The beach being consciousness, being conscious. When a new sensation arises, a sound feeling in your body, a thought, a feeling, the beginning of a new in-breath or beginning of a new out-breath, when things arise in awareness, appreciate how that arising can remind you of being aware itself, of knowing itself. Things are known, sensed, felt, experienced. The arising of something new is an occasion to appreciate that we're conscious. Perhaps you can notice being conscious, being aware, that you can notice now what arises effortlessly in awareness. Maybe it's something unexpected. What arises effortlessly and is known effortlessly can be anything at all. A new sound, a new sensation, a repeated sound, repeated sensation, whatever it is, maybe initially before we get involved in it. There's an effortless knowing, recognition, and appreciate that part of the mind that is attentive effortlessly. The part of the mind that's not choosing what to attend to, not directing the mind, part of the mind that just is, and experiences arise are known, sensed, felt, knowing, kind of attentiveness that has this effortless quality to be receptive, open, become aware of something that's uncomfortable here and now. Your body, some emotions, some feeling, some thoughts you're having, anything that's uncomfortable or stressful or, and see if you can know it with that kind of awareness, the receptive, open, effortless awareness where discomfort is just known, but it's not a problem for this effortless mind, effortless consciousness, where the mind being conscious of it is more appreciated, more valued than the discomfort. So and then bring to mind some suffering you have in your life. Maybe remember it, think about it, but rather than prioritizing the thinking about it, prioritize the awareness that knows it quietly, peacefully, prioritize the capacity to be conscious as you are reminded of your suffering. So so so take a few long, slow, deep breaths, comfortably long and relax, let go as you exhale, settle deeply, more deeply into this body, relax, settle in good And then as we come to the end of this sitting, maybe relaxing into a simple capacity for being aware or consciously aware of the energy of the body. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, maybe relaxing into a simple capacity for being aware or consciously aware of the place where things are just known, receptively or effortlessly. And from this place of receptivity, maybe clarity, maybe even a kind of stillness gaze upon the world kindly, gaze upon yourself kindly with compassion, gaze upon yourself kindly with compassion for the suffering of the world, with compassion for your own suffering. And perhaps from someplace deep within, someplace that feels maybe a place of home or a place of integrity, it can express the kindness, the compassion, with the aspiration, the generosity of wishing yourself well, wishing yourself happiness, safety, peace and freedom. Safety, peace and freedom. And then gazing out across the world, a world where there's abundance of suffering and not getting caught in that suffering, appreciating being conscious of it and the kind of place of conscious stillness or openness. That's a powerful channel for your compassion for the world, where your aspiration, your generosity for the world might be taken in with the words, given with the words, may others be happy, may others be safe, may others be peaceful, may others be free. Thank you. And it might be nice if those of you who'd like, well, I'm drinking my water here. If you want to put some comments, brief comments in the chats about what that meditation was like, it might be nice to see, it might be helpful for me for the little talk I'm going to give now.
