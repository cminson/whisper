 I always loved coming to California. I find it a very pleasant place and a place that would be very difficult to be sad and depressed in. I was telling my friend the other night, this is like heaven, I love to hear. Actually in a way I propose to what I wanted to talk about today too. The other night we looked at attending to the body and why we attend to the body and the insights that are derived from doing that. Today I wanted to talk about feeling, the experience of feeling and how we attend to that and the insights that are derived from doing that as well. This pleasant feeling about the weather can be one that can be contemplated and understood from within. It's a very important topic because feeling in Buddhist circles is often talked about as the key to liberation. The capacity to have a direct experience of feeling and contemplate it appropriately can literally take us all the way to freedom. There's a lot of different reasons why and I hope to be able to offer some thoughts that help and shed some light on that today. Just understanding what it is and how it operates is kind of the basis of it all. One considers that according to the Buddhist teachings that at birth basically were when there is incarnation, we get issued this body and mind. I mean it goes with the territory. It's part of the experience and how we experience is through the physical and the mental realms. Through the body essentially we see here smell taste and touch and through the mind we think and feel. These experiences are taking place at what the Buddha called the six sense doors and the eye door, the ear door, etc. It's a point at which contact takes place and from the moment that we're born until the moment that we die he tells us that if you pay attention you'll notice that there is a constant experience at these levels, these six sense doors, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, thinking, feeling. Our discussion of feeling really starts here because what he says is that that moment of contact, that moment of direct experience at one of these sensory levels is always accompanied by or has what he calls a feeling tone. It cannot be separated from it. The experience of feeling he's describing as we find things either pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant nor unpleasant. So each moment of contact has this kind of tone to it. For myself I remember early on in practice I would take these teachings and I just really wanted to get it and see it. I had a tremendous earnestness in my own practice. So I picked this particular teaching up and I was determined to actually see feeling arise, to discern it as distinct from contact. It was kind of like another thing I did which I don't recommend doing early on in my practice where I was sitting a long retreat, a three-month retreat at IMS and I was getting, I was very frustrated with the fact that I was enjoying sleep too much you know and like wanting to stay in bed in the morning and you know couldn't wait to go to bed in the evening, that kind of thing. And so I was, I took it upon myself to decide, determined to actually see the moment of where one goes unconscious you know. I wanted to see that happen because I had this idea that there was something in that if I could just see it you know that that would remedy the whole thing. So I stayed up this one night and sat on my cushion and I was the only one in the hall and you know it's one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock and I'm still there and I still hadn't fallen asleep and still hadn't seen this moment you know and then just all of a sudden it's like from one moment to the next you know the whole body just went, you know, I just did this dive bomb forward and hit my head on the floor and it was like oh okay, you know, that's what it is you know and and you know seeing the foolishness in that moment the whole idea is that you go unconscious you know you're not going to see it you know it just happens and you know it was very similar to this to trying to see feeling you know that maybe it was a little bit foolish to try to discern it as distinct from contact because that's the point he's making in this teaching that it happens every moment of contact is inseparable from this feeling tone and so the effort then is one of just noticing the constant parade of pleasant unpleasant and neither moments you know and just tuning into that and then you know when I gave up the idea of trying to discern it as distinct then one just tunes into the actual experience of it and I began to notice over time you know that you can get very sensitized to this experience it's like for one moment to the next if you're tuning in at a subtle feeling level it's almost like you start to see life as this constant parade of contraction and expansion and sort of nothing you know so that the pleasant and the unpleasant and the neither are experienced very directly in this way so that you know I started to feel it more like it has a very visceral quality to it very much something you feel not just in the mind but in the body and so you know I started to notice it is like you know this this like ah this constant movement of experience of that and then feeling that the neither is sort of like you know nothing not a whole lot going on but there is you know this was sort of a puzzle to me at first what was he saying neither pleasant nor unpleasant but when you start to notice the contraction and the expansion you know then you also notice that there's a lot in between there you know it's like every now and then you have a good laugh and every now and then you have a good cry but a lot of it is just kind of neither you know a lot of life is that so actually this is very important I'll talk some about this in a minute because we need to tune into this as much as the other two so the part of it was it wasn't so important to see it it was important to feel it and the other bit about it why it's so important is that one begins to discern what happens next you know when you don't see it or when you aren't quite tuned into it the tendency which is highly highly conditioned and all of us it's actually something that I think has its roots sort of in our reptilian brain you know it's very instinctive impulse is to get more of things that we find pleasant and get away from things that we find unpleasant and just sort of check out you know just so that when when there's not a whole lot happening so that's the tendency very very strong the Buddha calls it proliferation essentially but the end product of that proliferation are these states of greed hatred and delusion which is you know they these figure very strongly in the teachings because they constitute our suffering you know not only is the experience of these painful and difficult but they make us do things you know that cause a lot of suffering for ourselves and others so the idea here then is just to begin to notice what's going on just noticing this little internal response you know it like with something that's pleasant it's sort of like a giddiness that begins to happen yes I like that you know I want more get me more you know and with the feeling of something that's unpleasant it's it's like you know you get that yuck and you get that contraction in the gut you know get me out of here this isn't fun I'm not enjoying this that kind of expression and the neither I remember the first time I actually think I tuned into this in a very precise way I had actually had this thought it was like hey where'd everybody go it was like oh there was like something exciting happening and now it's not happening anymore or something difficult happening and now it's not happening it's just there's nothing you know just that that feeling that actually makes one want to take a nap or you know turn on the television or go get something to eat or something you know there's not not much happening so these moments of feeling are what we're trying to tune into to get to the actual experience of those and in a way leave it at that because in these moments of escalation the actual experience of feeling escapes us we're actually almost in a finger snap caught in greed hatred and delusion without even seeing it happen so you know it's sort of like turn around and stay with the actual experience now I think this is all very important to begin to notice this just to begin to notice these strong tendencies and recognize that the conditions that they established the greed the hatred and delusion are are karmically very weighty which means that we're going to suffer when we're caught in these states and the whole focus of the Buddhist teachings is to free us from suffering so you know I think this is why the Buddha gives so much attention to this he wants us to stop suffering you know tune in to the experience of pleasure pain and neither and that will actually be a non suffering state let me just read just the language that he uses here and this is in the Satipatthana Sutra which is that as you know the main instruction on the meditation practice how what we need to become aware of and very specifically how to be aware of that so when he's talking about contemplating feeling he says and how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu abide contemplating feeling as feeling here when feeling a pleasant feeling a bhikkhu understands I feel a pleasant feeling when feeling a painful feeling he understands I feel a painful feeling and when feeling a neither painful nor pleasant feeling he understands I feel a neither painful nor pleasant feeling and he goes on to discern that even more precisely looking at world what he calls worldly and unworldly pleasant and unpleasant feelings which is very interesting as an aside where he's actually making the distinction between pleasure that comes from the sense realm you know strawberry cheesecake or something like that and pleasure that comes from renunciation of the sense realm which is very important to begin to see because as practitioners you begin to notice that there's a great happiness in surrendering the sense realm you know there's a great sense of disease when we're feeling one can't you know this is like the unworldly experience so I think the language is very important he's saying be notice feeling and some of the translations say in the feeling and some say as feeling which either way I think it's getting across the message that he's trying to get across be in the experience of feeling which means not in all our thoughts about it but actually in the direct experience of feeling and noticing it as feeling you know without adding anything to it so this is all this is all very very helpful in terms of instruction and what to do and how to do it I think just as an aside too I wanted to make note that the teachings offer a lot in terms of helping us understand this as well because the Buddha tells us that everything up until this point you know having a body in mind having the sense doors having contact at the sense doors and even having the experience of pleasure and pain and neither that all of this has been set in place there is this is all up until this point of the fruit of past actions it's what we call results in karma there's nothing to be done about it you can't change the fact of any of this you know which is a marvelous release in one sense in and of itself just to get that to grok that fully that the actual experience of pleasure and pain and neither is the truth of pleasure is totally inevitable and unavoidable you know so I don't know about you but that sort of helps me just go oh okay and so this tendency to argue about that or want it to be some other way can be short circuited right then and there but I think that he's also saying in that in no uncertain terms that even though this tendency to move into greed hatred and delusion from these three is not the experience is strong that that bit is not set in place that bit is not for ordained that bit we have some way to manage and in a way control you don't you don't have to do that and so this is like the incredible hopefulness and the Buddhist teachings that there is the potential and the very real potential and opportunity for freedom from suffering because these states are the suffering state you know as I said in and of them themselves they are painful and they cause us to act in ways that cause harm for ourselves and other people so this whole thing can be short circuited you know that's that's the potential here and what he's saying is that a lot of it has to do with tuning in to this actual experience of feeling and getting more and more precise in our discernment of it and our experience of it so really the practice involves two approaches two things that are going on at the same time first of it for all is just noticing this distinction between pleasure and greed unpleasant feeling and the aversion that will follow it and neither and the checking out just noticing beginning to really get keen on those two because you can see it you can see it happen and that that's critical just to be just that much without even doing anything about it just noticing that is huge it begins to break the habit you know that right there will begin to break the habit but the other bit which I think it's really really interesting practice is developing the capacity to actually be fully with the pleasure the pain and the neither that's and that's huge because actually in a way we have to as practitioners not only be willing but able to take on literally take on this highly instinctive tendency you know it's almost like our evolution or our instinctive tendencies are actually counter enlightenment you know because we keep following these experiences of pleasure and pain and neither and so what he's saying I think is you know pull in on the reins a little bit hold it up there go notice the experience of these three and leave it at that notice it see feeling in feeling see feeling as feeling and leave it at that that but that if you see what's being said in there that means literally in a way turning around and facing the monster you know because it's like everything is pushing us in another direction so stay with the actual experience and it's enlightening because a lot of our impulse and compulsion is moving in this other direction so just kind of take that force on and when we do that you know it's I mean to me this is what practice is all about this is the the nuts and bolts of practice right here you know it's it's being willing to stay with these three and have insight into them and understand this as part of our experience as human beings there's no avoiding pleasure pain and neither and you get you get some wonderful surprises when you start to practice like this many years ago I had a really strong experience in this regard with something that happened in my life that I wouldn't have expected it to be a source of such release and such understanding but it was a situation where I was house sitting an animal sitting for a friend and she had two cats and a dog and before she left for the weekend she sat me down and gave me all the instructions you know what when to feed how to feed you know who to feed and all of this and and just filling me in on their behaviors so that I would be familiar with them and and with the cat one of the cats she was saying oh well this one you know she tends to go out at night and hunt and she may not come back you know before you go to bed but don't worry about it there's a kitty door she knows her way in she'll find her way in and you know just you know don't worry about it she'll be she'll be there in the morning so sure enough the second night you know it was time for me to go to bed and the cat wasn't back and so I was concerned and I went out in the yard and I looked for and I called her and and all that but she didn't come and then I remember the instruction you know it's okay so so finds her way back it'll be okay and I went to bed and the next morning my friend came back pretty early and as she walked in the back door I could see that she was holding the cat in her hand and she was dead and she had been run over by a car in the night you know I didn't know it obviously and it's a horrible thing to have happened I mean you know you don't want this kind of thing to happen when you're taking care of your your friends animals you know and as all that thinking that horrible thinking feeling and we stood there and you know looked at each other and talked about it a bit and you know went over the instructions again did I get it right you know just obviously very anxious and nervous and sad about this experience and you know I noticed in my mind going over and over and over just in those few minutes even you know what did I do what could I have done did I do it right did I do it wrong did she tell me everything that you know she's doing the same thing you know but then in the moment remembering to open to what's going on to actually connect with what is happening and it was so powerful when I did that it was like the enormity of the pain of what I was feeling in that moment just rushed in when I stopped you can watch the mind come up with all kinds of things to try to get away from that and all the figuring out and going over and the rules and the regulations and did I do it right and did she tell it right and all of that is this subtle little way to actually get away from what's actually happening. And in that moment it just went you know it just went in and I just you know burst out crying you know like the cats dead you know it's like really feeling the pain of that the loss of that but this is what happens you know these things happen and that's the potential I think that he's talking about here to connect with pain. To connect with the experience of pain and loss and birth and sickness and aging and death and all of that is not like this morbid morbid thing you know that he's getting out in the first noble truth for example but actually an invitation to really feel and get it that it's like this. It's like this and the direct experience of that constitutes insight into Dukkha it constitutes a very profound realization of the way that it is and it completely short circuits any bit in us that wants it to be otherwise you know can you feel that it's like that that bit that no you know it's not I don't want it to be like this. And and yet he's saying that that is the suffering open to the actual experience of it and I mean all that I can say is that the actual direct experience of what happened. Yes very painful but also incredibly present and authentic and real such that there is this twisted kind of joy in it you know a presence that I wouldn't have anticipated. You know with just a simple kind of opening to the actual experience of difficulty you know very real and very freeing moment. So I think this is part of the promise of what he's saying in this kind of opening. Now you could understand that we would have difficulty opening to pain but there is this a complementary difficulty in opening to pleasure. It's the weirdest thing but when you start to watch it it's so true it's like the the experience of pleasure is so delightful that in a finger snap we're into this experience of wanting more. And that movement of the mind into wanting more is actually pulling us out of the pleasure. And maybe this is coming from a greedy type but you know it's like it's a little carrot to dangle you know if you stop doing that I promise you a lot more pleasure. A lot more happiness derived from this experience of pleasure because one isn't moving away from it you know what is what is actually allowing the fullness of it. But to come face to face with pleasure involves coming face to face with the insight into impermanence you know because it doesn't last. But you know and that's what I think we're kind of trying to get away from in the movement into getting more. You can feel it can you feel it right it's right there it's like get more get more get more. Well what if you know that there isn't any getting more you know what if you know that it's not like that it's just waves of happiness and sadness and we're experiencing them. You know then you can you can just kind of let yourself go into it and it's like oh you know because this is great and now it's over you know and it is great and now it's over. And that there's just so much delight in that you know life is like full of so much pleasure. You know we don't we're missing it we're actually missing it because of the tendency the strong tendency towards greed towards getting more. Or towards holding on to it you know it's sad you know because I think a lot of people suffer from unhappiness that is the way it's so unnecessary there's just so much happiness. There's so much delight and there'll be a lot more when we can open to pleasure but also open to the truth of impermanence. It doesn't last but that's okay you know it's like it's good enough you can't it's like you can't you can't linger in pleasure forever anyway. It would start to hurt after a while you know. Well a friend and I used to do this just to explore pleasure we we had what we called our ice cream Ben and Jerry's and particularly meditation. Where you sit get it each get a container of Ben and Jerry's and sit across the table from each other you know and take a spoonful of it. And watch and you know learn about pleasure from it learn about it you know you can learn about a whole lot of things from this meditation it's huge. I really highly recommend it. You put some put something really delicious in your mouth you know and just watch what happens it's fascinating it's like you know we would watch how that that impulse to get more was so strong that that would still be in your mouth and the hand would be going to the next scoop. You know it's like and I think actually part of that was interesting to notice part of that is also not saying impermanence it is delicious but then it goes it the mind will already go to another form of consciousness you can have it in your mouth and you're thinking about it instead of tasting it or looking at it instead of tasting it so you know it kind of just in that movement of consciousness. You sort of lose it but also just the experience of the pleasure is these waves and so you can see this movement to constantly be trying to make it get more because we want that pleasant feeling to last. You know it's very fascinating to watch it and watch what happens if you obstructed in any way. You know we would reach across the table and hold each other's hands you know it's not let the other one get more you know watch watch what happens. Very interesting you know you see how aversion and hatred can be born out of frustration. Absolutely having your wish for pleasure frustrated in one way or another is really funny but very very rich practice and getting to see this movement and learning to stay with pleasure. Actually I found over the years that it ends up being a great way to stop taking so much. You know what I mean. It's like we keep lots of times we might overeat because we want the pleasant taste we want the pleasure to keep going and it's like this is eating is not something that belongs to you know this category is it. Yes it's pleasant but you know you eat and nourish the body and not to keep pleasure going. But that gets distorted in the attachment the clinging to pleasant feeling. So I encourage you to try that one out. It's very very rich rich area of practice. Now I think it has to be said that we can take comfort in the realization here that while there's no guarantee that good feelings will last or that they'll even happen. It's also true that they're unavoidable. So really taking that to heart and recognizing that a lot of the frenzy around getting pleasant feeling is coming from not realizing this. You know remember this bumper sticker a number of years back that said poop happens. You know I always thought at the time that something complimentary should be put out there that pleasure happens. You know it happens and it seems to happen in inverse proportion to how much I want it to happen. You know it's like this is longing for it to happen is actually one of the biggest obstacles. You know if you just get that out of the way then we'll notice the parade of it the constant parade of it there. There are these wonderful happy feelings and they will happen whether we like it or not. It's amazing you know like one of the one of the stories that I loved them. I don't know if any of you saw Babette's Feast a number of years ago. It was this great film and there's so many things in it that were good. But the one that really got me was when Babette wanted to make a dinner for this religious group and they were very concerned about sensory pleasures and they really did not want to allow themselves to experience sense pleasures because and actually you know that can be quite skillful. You know but you know they were afraid of movement into you know diabolical states out of that or something you know. And so inadvertently they had accepted this invitation for her to make this wonderful this dinner but they didn't know what a fabulous cook she was. And so as they saw her preparations and realized the great effort that was going into this and the fact that this was going to be a hugely delicious feast you know they became very frightened and they made a determination among themselves that they would go ahead and let her do it and they would go ahead and eat the food. But they were not going to talk about it and they were not going to enjoy it you know. And so this was a quiet little pact that they made on the side. But it was fascinating what got me about this scene where. OK so they followed through on that. But then in the eating of it it was delicious. It was pleasant. And there's nothing you can do about that. And so you could see during the course of this that what was happening since they had determined not to acknowledge that and to try not to feel it. But because the pleasure was there all the same it got internalized you know. And they started to have all these great happy feelings. And they were making up for past wounds and past offenses. And during the course of the meal this one was apologizing to that one and fixing this little exchange. And you know so like these happy feelings were coming out in other ways you know because they weren't expressing it through delight in the food. You know it was a great scene to see you can't avoid it. Things will make you happy. Whether you like it or not. Pleasure arises out of conditions and the conditions do exist. They'll be there. You know you don't have to control it. You don't have to make it happen. And actually this came as a great surprise to me in my own practice. You know because I always thought I could make it happen. And I think we get deluded about this because there's a lot of things that you can do to establish conditions that will make it that are appropriate conditions to induce pleasant feelings. You know. Oh we're all going to get together. We're going to go to this restaurant. We're going to do this. We're going to do that. We're going to have such a great time. And lots of times we do. And so that just that little thing in there can dilute us about the extent of our control over pleasure. You know. But you just have to contemplate that a little bit to realize that you can do all of that. And it might not happen right. We've all had that experience. I think one of the reasons why we can have such difficulty like around the holidays or special family events and things like this. Everybody is so hyped for pleasure. And somebody says something crosswise or you know does that thing they do or something like that. And the whole the whole system falls apart. You know. Because it's not in the setting up of conditions. It may or may not happen. Even if everything is right for it to happen. And it may it may just be that we're not there for it. I mean you know I've certainly done that one a lot where you just check out in one reason or for one way or another. Maybe you have a headache and you're in pain or you get distracted and we're thinking about something else altogether. You know. There's been lots of times for example where I might have prepared a great meal and then you know sit down in front of the television or something to watch it. To watch television while I'm eating the meal. And then it's like all of a sudden the news is over. The plate is empty. And I didn't experience either of them. You know. It's like what that kind of phenomenon. You know. You're setting it up but it doesn't it doesn't happen because you're not there. Not there for it. So just noticing these kinds of things. I think this is all in the realm of very very rich and interesting practice. And then the crux of it is that the wisdom will arise when we stop trying to manipulate the world so that it's a it's a pleasant place all the time. You know. So that we can avoid the difficulty all of the time. And this is really the middle way. You know. The wise person doesn't make a problem out of either of these extremes. The wise person just lets it be what it is. So we need to say something about neither pleasure nor displeasure. And one of my teachers says that this is really most of life. This is really you know he says 98 percent. You can quarrel with that percentage if you like. But I think it's an important point. You know that it's really most of it. And much of it he refers to as the ordinary. You know just the ordinariness of life. And it's from not seeing that and from not getting that that we're scrambling so much to make pleasure happen and to avoid pain. And so that you can see the huge potential and opening to neither pleasure nor pain. Just opening to the fact that you know brushing teeth combing hair going grocery shopping. You know ironing clothes shaving whatever you know that this is a lot of it. And to be there for it. Is it is very very very rich. You know what happens is that we're walking around in the days most of the time because we're not really connecting with that simple reality. And just getting lost in wanting it to be some other way or just lost in the dullness of it all. And I think this is especially important in our culture because you know we have to realize that our culture really preys to the end of the day. And so we have to set priorities on this kind of lack of stimulation that the situation where nothing much is happening and presents all dangles all kinds of things to lure us out of this ordinariness of life. you know, to encourage us to seek stimulation, but that's better somehow, you know. You just watch this over the months and years of practice. You can feel the enormous itch that we're conditioned to live in, you know, just out of not opening to nothing, nothing much happening. My teacher says to actually make a practice out of being bored. Just allow that experience and linger with it and find a way to be okay with it, because it, and it'll cease being boredom. It'll just be the way it is, you know, which is fine. You know, I love that. I've actually found that to be a very rich area of practice. Just to drop down into the body, to drop into the actual experience of life being what it is right now, you know, whatever that is. So the idea here then is to notice this tendency to go towards pleasure, to want more. Notice the tendency to get away from the difficult, to want less of that, and notice the unskillful ways that we relate to nothing, neither pleasure nor pain happening. And just try to stay with those feelings. Just try to stay with that experience and trust it. You know, a lot is happening in practice and just doing that. That can be huge. And I think it has to be said that what the Buddha is saying here too is that it is like an invitation in the doing of the practice like this, that you begin to open to these wonderful states that are buried, you know, in the scramble to get more and get away, you know. And one of them, one of them just has to do with being able to be with pleasant feeling and not have to have more of it. You know, this is huge. I did a practice for a little while just going around to shops that I love, you know, and just noticing things that I like and recognizing that that tendency is strong and that it's okay. I can look at all these beautiful things and I can like them and not have to have them. You know, making that discernment and in the doing of that there was this wonderful feeling of appreciation and contentment, like not having to have means you can appreciate what is. It's a very rare state actually because of the potential, the tendency towards greed. Appreciation and contentment are not common. Finding things unpleasant and not having to get away from them, you know, just connecting with that, what does that feel like, what is the experience of that. This is actually the inroad right here to these wonderful states of compassion and endurance and patience, you know, just to be able to be with difficulty. Wow. That's a very mature state of mind, to be able to be with difficulty and we find in the doing of that right there in the wisdom and the capacity to do that, right there lives the compassion. You know, the heart just naturally opens and wants to comfort and bring about ease and not out of a version. Can you feel that? It's not out of a version when we're really open to it. It's out of compassion and understanding. You know, that's huge. That's beautiful. And the last one, finding things neither pleasant nor unpleasant and not having to check out, you know, not moving into dull and dreamy states around that, just feeling that, that to me, that experience has been one of establishing a certain peace of mind, you know, a certain tranquility. It's like, it's okay. It's not great, it's not awful, it's just kind of, and it's fine. This is actually the companion or the way that we mature into equanimity. This is this beautiful state of being okay with things as they are, not having a quarrel with anything. So I offer you these thoughts this morning. I hope they're helpful in your practice and maybe in some small way, conduced to some greater happiness for you. Thank you.
