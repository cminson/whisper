The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

We come to the last talk on grief, five-part talk.
And grief is a very human experience to be had.
And especially if we see it as the pain that comes from loss.
And it's a pain with loss, there's an absence, something is missing.
And what do we fill that space, that empty space with?
And how complicated does it get for us?
And one of the ways of practicing is to create the capacity to hold grief simply.
To stay in the empty space without filling it with our judgments, our desires, our wishes, our fears.
And keep it just very simple.
And doing so is a way of, I would like to say, respecting our grief.
Not feeling that grief is wrong or bad or should be gotten rid of.
But it's something to make space for, to allow for, to breathe with.
Now to do this well, it helps a lot if we include as part of our mindfulness of grief, the relationship we have to grief.
There is grief on one hand and then there's the attitudes we have towards the grief.
And those attitudes sometimes can be more intense or more difficult than the grief itself.
There can be attitudes that grieving is wrong.
Or there can be attitudes that we need to grieve.
We have to grieve and we have to grieve so that everyone can see us.
We have an obligation to grieve.
There can be ideas that I certainly should have grieved enough.
Or I shouldn't be still grieving.
There could be ideas that successful human life doesn't experience the intensity and the difficulties of grief.
So these are all secondary ideas.
Another secondary kind of relationship to grief is some people cling to grief.
They hold on to it.
Some people out of a sense of loyalty to what they've lost or to the person who's died.
That if they let go of the grief, it's somehow betrayal.
Or somehow that really means that they're going to lose that person.
And somehow the grief fills the vacuum that's too difficult to sit with by itself.
And so to hold on to it all.
And so with the practice of mindfulness, we learn to notice the attitude we have towards grief.
And maybe not right away.
Maybe if it's an intense loss, maybe not the first day or two or a week or some point.
But at some point we can ask ourselves, what's my attitude?
What's my belief about this grief?
What relationship do I have towards it?
And moving towards having a simpler and simpler relationship to it
where we're not adding layers of relatedness and judgments and ideas about the grief
and in a sense liberating the grief from these imposition of these attitudes
and relationships and needs and fears that we might have in relationship to grief itself.
And as we begin to do this work, then we can be with the grief, even if it's very intense.
Maybe with a simpler way.
Maybe not in meditation, but maybe in a walk.
Maybe even a walk with a friend.
Maybe journaling, maybe doing a ritual like we talked about yesterday.
But to be there with simpler, and then what we start discovering slowly, slowly,
sometimes is that the grief is not a singular, unitary thing.
But it's made up of different emotions, different ideas, different beliefs,
different memories, different aspirations.
And we begin to separate out some of this to see that some of what's in grief itself
is an attitude, a second arrow towards what's happening.
That part of grief for some people is anger.
And the anger itself is a hostility towards something that's happening that we don't like.
And to see it that way, it's an attitude towards something,
allows us then to begin simplifying and being present for the very thing that we're angry with,
as opposed to staying angry with it from a distance.
Or there might be fear, that we might be afraid of fear.
And slowly we begin to learn not to add the fear to the fear, just be afraid.
As we begin kind of being present and seeing the different elements of grief,
we might see that it isn't only maybe a person who died that we're feeling grief for,
but they're grieving other aspects of that relationship.
Some people grieve the loss of financial security when a breadwinner dies
and is not unsure what's going to be.
And that sense part of the grief is the uncertainty, the fear of what's happening,
the loss of a whole way of living.
And it's not just the person, but the way of living.
It might be the relationships we have with other people,
that the person who died is the hub for a set of relationships.
And so the loss is much bigger than the loss of the person.
To begin teasing apart the different elements of it and seeing that we have attitudes,
we relate to it, we bring a certain kind of desires, wishes, fears, attachments to
all these different component parts.
And then slowly, kindly, caringly, compassionately, beginning exploring
what is extra, what is not needed.
And I think of this process as a process of liberation.
Not that we're becoming free, but that we are liberating the grief.
And in the middle of intense grief, you might not have any,
it might even be disrespectful to this idea that somehow we're not letting the grief be free.
But slowly, over time, we discover where in the grief, where in relationship to the grief,
we haven't given freedom to the grief, gotten out of the way of it.
Let it just be there in a simple way, or maybe not simple,
but letting the grief be there without the complexities of our attitudes, judgments,
fears, and attachments. And slowly begin letting go of this,
anything that's extra with the grief.
And sometimes grief can even be pleasant or satisfying or, I don't know,
have a feeling of rightness to it when we've freed the grief enough,
when it's freed from ourselves in a certain way.
This is a difficult task to do because we're the one who's grieving,
but we're also the one who's giving freedom to the grief.
And so not identifying so fully with the grief that it's my grief or I am the grief.
And this takes time. This takes practice.
This takes something that is maybe not understood by people who don't have a mindfulness practice
or don't have not well established in the capacity to be resting in awareness
and has discovered how to have a capacity to hold the difficult states
and expanding that capacity rather than fixing things, rather than criticizing things,
rather than running away. The movement of practice is to keep opening
so we have greater and greater capacity to be with the challenges and the joys of life.
And this increased capacity is directly connected to giving freedom to our experience,
giving freedom to the world, giving freedom to our feelings,
and maybe dropping the idea that you will be free,
but rather that there will be freedom given to all things.
May all things exist with a certain freedom from our clinging, our anger, our aversion,
our confusion, our delusion, our bias and our projections.
May we learn to live giving a generous attention, kind attention to each and everything,
including our grief.
So I hope that this discussion about grief
and the last few weeks I've been teaching about emotions and anger
gives you a sense of how to practice with the emotions and challenges.
And I think we'll continue somehow with this theme of emotions
and things connected to emotions as a way of next week and so forth.
I think it's a rich area of life and hopefully you find it beneficial and interesting
to see the application of mindfulness and practice
to these very personally areas of emotions in our inner life.
So thank you very much.
