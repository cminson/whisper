The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So we come then to the end of this week's theme, which is ourselves.
And I'd like to tell you of a somewhat famous quote by a Japanese Zen master named Dogen.
And it has, I want to quote two sentences that have this dual nature of Buddhist practice, dual processes.
So he says, to study Buddhism is to study the self.
To study the self is to forget the self.
So those are the two I want to emphasize.
He continues to say something like to forget the self is to be awakened by all beings, to be confirmed by all beings.
And by this idea that we can still, we can study oneself and in the process, forget oneself.
One can practice with oneself, what can observe and be present for oneself.
And at the same time, the process is that of forgetting ourselves.
And this dual nature might sound paradoxical or contradictory.
But as I've been saying lately, there are a number of things that humans do that have that dual nature.
And one of them is hospitality, that we both act energetically and fully engage in the process of being host,
while simultaneously putting some of our own desires for ourselves aside so we can be the good host and care for someone else.
That same movement is present with respect, with generosity and perhaps with a healthy love,
that when we love someone, that if we want to express it and act on it in some healthy, appropriate ways,
there's also kind of a letting go of self in the process.
Hopefully it's not about just my own needs, desires, pleasures, feelings,
but it's also about the other person and caring for that person.
So kind of a little bit of putting oneself aside.
And this dual nature of engaging in practice, in a practice that is, to some degree, studying ourselves,
and then in the process of forgetting ourselves.
I think it's a beautiful kind of expression of the movement of practice.
And there's a number of ways that this can work.
And one is that, first I want to say that sometimes because meditation practice, mindfulness practice,
has a kind of self-reference, like we're paying attention to our own breathing,
we're paying attention to our body sensations, our thoughts,
and meditation we often close our eyes, we're just with our own experience.
It's very easy for that to be confused with self-consciousness and in extreme situations,
even narcissism, that an excessive preoccupation with oneself, putting oneself as every little detail of ourselves,
is so impactful and meaningful and important and always says something about ourselves,
says something about defining ourselves, or judging ourselves, or proving ourselves,
or we need to be someone comparing ourselves to others.
So it can, so there's a little bit dangerous, this mindfulness practice, if we bring a lot of self along.
But to turn the attention to do the practice of mindfulness moment by moment,
and in meditation maybe just being with the inner experience, the breathing, the body, the thoughts,
it's all settling at everything, focusing on it, to do it well, to really, well means to really give yourself over to it.
So there's not much room for distractions.
If we kind of sit down laxidasically, a lot of distractions, a lot of our concerns can come pouring in.
But if we sit down to practice in a really, in a relaxed way, but in a dedicated way,
this is important, this is clearly what I'm going to do in the beginning of meditation
to kind of actually affirm that this is what I'm doing now.
Not don't sit down casually and just let the mind continue to think,
but this clarity of really giving oneself over to the meditation practice to the present moment.
What that does is it takes some of the energy of attention away from our self preoccupations,
self concerns, self ruminations that we have.
And it's amazing how much self preoccupation a human being can have.
And I think many meditators will be surprised how self-centered many of the thinking is.
Distracted thoughts, being caught up in thoughts.
We're the central character in our thoughts in one way or the other.
We have some role, a lot of thoughts are in relationship to ourselves.
But as we kind of give ourselves over to some mindfulness of breathing,
there's less energy and attention going into that self-concern.
And if we really give ourselves over well to it, there's a forgetting of self, forgetting of everyday concerns.
Just like what we do if you're reading a really good book,
or if you're involved in some delightful craft or art project or music playing or something,
that you're really absorbed in it, there's a forgetting of yourself, forgetting of your daily concerns.
Even though there might be a lot of attention to some parts, aspects of yourself to do the task well,
the mental activity of self preoccupation concern is not there.
So just simply kind of being able to give ourselves over to the practice.
There's a forgetting of self in it, hopefully in a healthy way.
As the practice deepens, we start seeing deeper forms of attachment, stress, clinging, contractions,
that are there around self.
And one of them can be just simply in the nature of how we're doing the practice.
The practice itself brings a long baggage of self, of association with what it means to be the practitioner, the doer.
And there's a simplification process that goes on in meditation practice,
where everything that's extra, that's not needed, we start seeing as extra,
as actually not only extra, but often a little bit stressful compared to the deeper and deeper calm that's being experienced.
And so we start kind of relaxing the grip of self,
relaxing the preoccupation of self that can be quite deep, even subconscious sometimes.
And there's a deeper and deeper forgetting of self.
And that goes deeper and deeper until at some point whatever happens in meditation and our experience,
there's no orientation, no inclination to define ourselves by any of it, to appropriate any of it,
to either be against it or for it, just to kind of see it clearly in the freedom of the mind,
in the mind, in the heart that is untroubled by it, but also doesn't attribute a self to it,
doesn't project ideas of me, myself and mind on it.
And this kind of forgetting or putting down or relaxing me, myself and mind thinking,
me, myself and mind preoccupations, me, myself and mind tightness and contraction
the fear that sometimes comes with that or the push and the resistance,
the ambition that comes with it, are all kind of this forgetting of all that.
So there's a movement of studying the self in order to forget the self.
Where forgetting the self here is one of the most, it's like taking a delightful vacation.
Everyone should have a vacation and it's nice to have a vacation from self.
It doesn't mean that you're not going to pick it up again or you're not going to take care of yourself
or it doesn't mean you have to have a big debate about the philosophical nature of what the self is and isn't.
It just means that you've radically kind of given yourself a vacation, a break, a pause, a sacred pause
where self-concerned, self-preoccupation is no longer present.
And it has been discovered simply by settling into the present moment
and practicing simple attention and concentration.
Just this, just this, just this breath, just this in-breath, just this out-breath,
just this sound, just this thought, just a thought, just a simplicity,
more and more simple to be with each moment as it arises, as it passes, as it occurs,
be in the flow of the present moment, the flow of the occurrence right now
with no retrospective thinking, even two seconds before.
What was that that just happened? That was great.
Even that can fall away.
And no anticipatory thinking.
It's just the flow of this moment absorbed in it, delighted in it, like you're playing music
and just absorbed in the music of the moment.
Or doing a craft or an art or reading a book or maybe playing with a child
that's just so delightful just to be there in the moment
where the child know before and after forgetting of self.
And this is one of the great pleasures of life
and it's one of the great sources of wisdom and freedom as well.
So we started this week with respecting the self
and this whole movement that we're talking about here is a form of profound respect
of freeing ourselves from suffering, respecting ourselves enough not to suffer,
not to contribute to our suffering by a healthy kind of forgetting of self preoccupation.
So thank you very much.
