 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So good morning. Good morning to some afternoon and evening. Lovely to see where everyone's calling in from. It's raining here in Berkeley, which is very unusual for this time of year. It feels whenever it rains. Even in the rainy season, it feels very good these days in California. So I'll share a few thoughts and we'll sit and have our usual form. So this is from a book from Kieran Sattaya, a philosopher. He's talking about goals, the goal-directed life, the value of goals, and then the limits of goals. It says, what gives purpose to your life is having goals, yet in pursuing them, you either fail, not good, or in succeeding, bring them to a close. If what you care about is achievement, earning a promotion, having a child, writing a book, saving a life, the completion of your project may be of value, but it means that the project can no longer be your guide. Sure, you have other goals and you can formulate new ones. The problem is not the risk of running out. It is that your engagement with value is self-destructive. The way in which you relate to the activities that matter most to you is by trying to complete them and so expel them from your life. Your days are devoted to ending, one by one, the activities that give them meaning. For me, that captures something important, important really about what the Buddha said of dukkha, of unsatisfactoriness. That if we live exclusively in this goal-directed life, our relationship to those projects is self-destructive. We complete things and expel them from our life and then have to look for more. And there's something fatiguing for the heart in that. Now, is meditation like that too? I think in some ways you can say, yeah, meditation is a goal-oriented activity to heal, to wake up. But if it's not just a goal-oriented activity, some of meditation practice is about stepping out of goal orientation entirely and resting with nowhere to go and no goals to achieve and nothing to do other than be present. And so it's confusing, I think, for us practitioners to sense the goal-directed dimension of practice, but then also the language and philosophy like atelic, not goal-directed. And atelic activities are only ever done in the present moment. That's where it happens. And so this morning we'll just try to guide us in that atelic side of practice, of really stepping out of the realm of goal orientation where we strive and achieve and expel our goals from our life. Something in the heart is restored when we take a walk with nowhere to go or listen to a loved one with nothing to achieve or sit in meditation with nowhere to go, nothing that needs to happen whatsoever. So please find your posture. Thank you. Just arriving right here. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe using your body breathing as a way of arriving. Maybe there is something that is just gently put down. But from here on out, and this set, we're not trying to go anywhere. We're not trying to engineer concentration. Not seeking insight or even tranquility. Just a little bit fed up with the relentlessness of our goal seeking. And so we put it down all at once. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So deep is the habit of goal making, striving, and expelling goals from our life that we turn our meditation into a two. And we turn ourselves into a self-improvement project. But for now, we surrender all notions of progress, of regress, of moving somewhere, anywhere. No refuge outside this moment. And the anchor, if you have one, the breath at the nostrils or belly, the whole body, sound, the whole sphere of sensory experience, whatever the anchor is, it's only a way of reminding you to surrender striving to be here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thinking can be a powerful tool for solving or achieving goals, strategizing. But we're practicing non-achievement. And so our thinking, strategizing, simulating futures, problem solving, it's not wrong, it's just beside the point. It's just a way that our goal making creeps in the side door. And so we keep relaxing into all that's already here, keep relaxing into non-achievement. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Everything that strives in us finally gets to rest. And everything that evaluates and contests our enough-ness also gets to rest. Because the only refuge is the imperfection of this moment and its beauty and brokenness. This is the only point. This is the only point. This is the only point. This is the only point. This is the only point. This is the only point. This is the only point. This is the only point. This is the only point.
