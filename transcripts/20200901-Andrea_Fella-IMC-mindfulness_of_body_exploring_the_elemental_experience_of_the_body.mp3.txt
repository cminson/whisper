Good morning. 
So continuing this theme of mindfulness of the body from the prior weeks. 
And an exploration, a deeper exploration of the Satipatanasuta, the Buddha's instructions on mindfulness. 
In the four foundations of mindfulness, these four areas the Buddha pointed to as places for us to cultivate this quality of mindfulness. 
It encompasses the entirety of our human experience, these four foundations. 
And yet the Buddha is kind of pointing to particular ways to explore our experience. 
Starting with the body, the first foundation, the first foundation is connected very strongly with the physicality of our experience. 
Noticing the breath, noticing body movements, aware of postures, aware of this elemental aspect of experience. 
And then the second and third foundations are really about exploring the mind. 
The fourth foundation kind of weaves everything together, looks at relationships between experiences. 
And so I think in many ways it makes sense that the teaching starts with the body, because it's an obvious area of experience. 
It's a place where it's pretty easy to connect. 
And I also think that this kind of exploration of the body, noticing the postures, noticing the movements, noticing the breath, noticing this kind of elemental aspect of experience, helps us to recognize the difference between what the body experiences, what these processes connected to body are, and what the processes connected to mind are. 
Helps us to kind of tease apart the relationships with the different processes so that we can begin to see the relationships between them and also begin to recognize where the struggle lies in relationship to our experience. 
The struggle lies not in the sensation level of experience, but in our relationship to it. 
And so if we can begin to recognize the difference between the sensations and the relationship, we begin to understand how the mind attributes or contributes to our struggles. 
So starting with exploring the body helps us to begin to recognize that the body itself is kind of what we could just say it's kind of the, it's a ground of our experience, it's sensation that happens. 
And then we relate to that experience so we can start to see how those relationships happen. 
And the connection too, it's not just that the relationship goes one way. 
It's not just that we experience things in the body, body sensations, and our mind responds to that. 
The relationship is a two-way street and so when the mind responds, it also influences the body. 
And so we can also begin to notice that part of the experience. 
So for me, this has been a powerful kind of doorway exploring the body, particularly this elemental piece, the piece that I explored in the guided meditation, this elemental piece where we get familiar with the sensation level of experience. 
I'll give you now just those four areas. 
As I said, the Buddha used the language of his day, the understanding of his day about what the elemental aspects of experience are, earth, air, fire, and water. 
But even in the commentaries that happened not that long following the Buddhist time, they kind of broke that down into sensation level. 
So what's the experience connected with earth element? What's the experience there? Solidity, hardness, weight, density? What's the experience connected with air element? Maybe one of the more obvious ones conceptually is the air coming in and out of our body as we breathe. 
And yet, how is that experienced? We experienced it as kind of pressure perhaps in our throat, maybe vibration or tingling as the air kind of moves into our body. 
The movement of the chest as it breathes, the expansion, the contraction of the chest. 
And then the kind of broader sense of the body as we touch into the fuller sense of the body, not just the movement connected with the breath, but just kind of tune into the field of the body. 
At times we can touch into what we might call an energetic field. 
I think that's a language that's often used in our day, this energetic field. 
We might feel the whole body as a field of vibration, pulsing, tingling. 
That quality of vibration, pulsing, tingling is the quality of movement. 
It's not static. 
There's not much static in there. 
And so this again, this is a place of the air element. 
This aspect of experience is understood as air element. 
We don't have to try to translate it into air element actually. 
We can simply explore experience from this perspective of these more bare kinds of sensations. 
So we often explore or think about our bodies from the perspective of parts of the body, hand, shoulder, foot. 
And sometimes when I'm talking to students, I'll ask, so what do you feel in your body? And they might say something like, well, I feel my shoulder or I feel my knee. 
But shoulder and knee are just a concept. 
They're an overlay. 
Shoulder and knee don't actually say what the sensation is, what the actual experience is. 
What may be being experienced in the shoulder is tension, tightness, pressure. 
What might be experienced in the knee is burning, aching. 
So the part of the body is a concept. 
It's an overlay. 
And so this is part of this exploration of touching into the elemental aspect is to begin to recognize that the concept of the part of the body is something in the mind. 
This is one of those key areas of difference between body and mind where they often get kind of confused. 
We think we're experiencing shoulder, but we are actually experiencing sensations in that part of the body, in that area. 
And so earth, air, then temperature, fire is the next aspect, temperature, heat or coolness. 
It's the range, not just the hot side of it, but the range of sensations. 
Sometimes the sense of the heat or coolness, it can be kind of subtle at times because we're kind of attuned or used to the way our body feels unless we go into a cold room or open the refrigerator door. 
There are times when I met some of the retreat centers that I have to walk into the walk-in refrigerator and I really feel the cold there. 
Or in the last few weeks, when it was so hot and I went outside and it was like, you know, in the 90s, I really feel the difference there. 
But you can also tune into that just now. 
In one way, I find often there's a difference in temperature and this can be a place to kind of touch into this. 
If you put your hand on your face, you might notice, for me, I notice some warmth there at that contact point. 
And at this point, it's hard for me to tell whether the hand is cool and the face is warm. 
Sometimes that's very clear to me, which one is the cool part and which one is the warm part. 
But you might be able to get a sense of that temperature differential or, you know, maybe touch another part of your body and see. 
In my hands, as I touch my hands together like this, I feel that the tips of my fingers, the very tips of my fingers are cool. 
But the palm is quite warm. 
So that's an interesting kind of difference there that noticing that kind of temperature differential. 
This is a part of our everyday experience that we often don't recognize unless we're in a more extreme kind of situation. 
And then there's the water element, the element of fluidity of moisture. 
It's often said that this is one of the subtler experiences. 
But I think there are some ways that it can be pretty obvious. 
So if you take your hands and then blow into your hands and then press your hands together. 
So what you've done is added moisture to your hands. 
And now just like let them kind of pull apart a little bit. 
You might notice a little bit of stickiness in the skin as you're kind of pulling them apart. 
That stickiness is water element. 
Anytime you notice that kind of stickiness, that's water element. 
Another thing about the water element, it often is most obvious independence on some of the other elements. 
And so here in doing this, first of all, we blew into our hands. 
So we added some moisture there. 
And then we used the hardness or the earth element of the hands to press them together. 
And then we used the air element to pull them apart, the movement. 
And so independence on the hardness and the movement, we could feel the stickiness. 
We could feel the water element. 
So the water element and actually sometimes the elements are more revealed independence on each other. 
So a really interesting exercise around this I learned from Marcia Rose, a wonderful teacher who lives in Taos, New Mexico. 
And she studied with Pao Auxayadaw who taught her this exploration around the elements. 
The elements practice is a very big piece of what Pao Auxayadaw teaches. 
And she pointed to, he pointed to exploring in the mouth. 
And so I'm going to guide you through a little exploration of the elements in the mouth. 
So taking your tongue and pushing it, kind of like putting it against your teeth and noticing the hardness of the teeth. 
That can be pretty clear, the hardness, it's a pretty hard, it's a bone. 
It's pretty hard, you can feel that bone there. 
You can notice the hardness there. 
You're noticing that hardness, independence on the movement, the pushing. 
So now pay attention more to the pushing part. 
That movement of the pushing, that's air element, that's movement, pushing there. 
You may or may not, I don't have much of a sense of temperature in the mouth at this point, you might. 
But then in terms of water, taking your tongue and letting it run across the surface of your teeth. 
You might notice slipperiness there. 
And that again, that is the movement across the hardness. 
So slipperiness is a quality of moisture. 
If your mouth gets dry, you know that because there's less slipperiness in the mouth. 
So this again, this is independence on the other elements, you can notice the water element. 
So experiencing this more elemental aspect of experience. 
We begin to learn essentially this level of experiences closer to what we could call the language of the body. 
How the body expresses itself. 
How the body speaks to our minds. 
How does it communicate with us? It communicates through this level of sensation. 
And as we begin to get more familiar with this language of the body, we begin to understand the distinction between body and mind. 
So some ways that we might notice the difference or notice what happens independence in relationship to the body. 
We might notice in connection to particular sensations that we like some sensations and we don't like other sensations. 
This liking or not liking is a mental experience. 
That seems pretty clear. 
It may go as far as anger or aversion or it may go to like leaning towards to want to get or pick up or have. 
Those also the movement towards the wanting movement away from aversion mental experiences in relationship to the physical experience. 
And then there's the another kind of mediating experience which actually the emotional experience, the relationship of liking or not liking the relationship of wanting or not or aversion or even a strong stronger emotions like anger, hatred or frustration, those kinds of emotions. 
They are also mediated in a way by whether experiences pleasant or unpleasant. 
And so that's another aspect of the experience. 
There's the physical sensation of vibration, pulsing, tingling pressure, hardness, heat, coolness. 
And then there's our, we could say interpretation of it as pleasant or unpleasant. 
The pleasant unpleasant aspect of experience in the Buddhist understanding is understood to be a mental part of the experience. 
In connection with our physical sensations that may be, that may be hard to understand in a way. 
But we might get a taste of that by, by a reflection. 
So if you are, if you are standing on a street corner, waiting for a friend to, to come and meet you and it's a busy street corner. 
There's a lot of people around, unlikely now in this day and age with social distancing. 
But, but if you were standing there waiting for, for the friend, and then you felt a touch on your shoulder, that might be experienced. 
You know, if you, you know, you're expecting your friend feeling that touch, you might think, oh, that's my friend. 
And that may be experienced as pleasant. 
And just that, that touch there might be experienced as pleasant. 
But now imagine you're standing on that same street corner. 
Let's bring it into COVID time now. 
You know, you're standing on that same street corner, not expecting a friend. 
And you feel somebody touch you. 
And it's like, whoa, you know, who's touching me and is this, you know, are they close to me or, you know, do they have a mask on. 
So that might be experienced as unpleasant. 
Very similar situation, the interpretation, the relationship, the context of the situation, resulting in whether we experienced that sensation as pleasant or unpleasant. 
So this is, and I would say you don't have to believe me about this. 
Just be curious about the pleasantness or unpleasantness or neutral aspect of experience as a different part of the experience than the pressure, the vibration, the tingling, the coolness, the heat. 
The Buddha talks about these as different processes of body and mind. 
And he puts the process of feeling tone of pleasant unpleasant neutral in the mental realm. 
And I understand that neuro psychology agrees with this, that there's a place in the brain stem where this aspect of pleasant unpleasant neutral is put together. 
And if this place is damaged, we don't feel pleasant unpleasant neutral aspect of experience. 
So even modern neuroscience agrees, at least in some fashion, with this understanding of the feeling tone being a mental process. 
So the sensation level and then the feeling tone is another aspect of experience. 
And you don't have to say or interpret it as a mental thing at this point. 
Just understanding it is something different because the feeling tone is conditioned. 
It is very subject to context, it's subject to views, it's subject to, I think that in fact views are a leading cause of feeling tone. 
When we get to feeling tone in a few weeks, we'll really go into this aspect. 
What we believe, what we think, what our ideas are, what we're interpreting will really shape the feeling tone of experience. 
Much of what we actually experience. 
Now, the commentaries in the Buddhist, I think it's in the Abhidharma, the texts on Buddhist psychology, speak about the feeling tone aspect of the body, that there will be some pleasant or unpleasant sensations connected with bodily experience. 
If we cut ourselves with a knife, there will be some unpleasantness there. 
We have sensation that is pleasant, unpleasant, again understood as being understood or constructed by the mind, but that there's a kind of a way that the body sensors are very attuned to that kind of pain, particularly to damage to the body. 
But a lot of our interpretation or the experience of unpleasantness is a kind of a feedback loop from our mind. 
If we experience that painful sensation, cutting ourselves with a knife, if we have a lot of reactivity in the mind about it, anger, frustration, there's going to be unpleasantness in the mind that then feeds back to our body. 
And so the part of the exploration around the elemental aspect of the body is to begin to be curious, well, what is the actual body sensation? There may be some unpleasantness or pleasantness associated with the body sensation itself, but a lot of what we take to be pleasant or unpleasant has more to do with our views, our ideas, our beliefs, our emotional response. 
And so this, again, is a way of kind of teasing apart the recognition, so what is the actual sensation? When I've explored pain, for instance, when I've explored, like, in the knee, sitting for long stretches of time and experiencing pain in the knee, when I can come down to the physical experience of that and just notice, well, what is the sensation? Well, there's a lot of burning and sparking and pressure and heat, so there's sensations like that, some of which are unpleasant, some of which are more unpleasant than others. 
But then in noticing that level of sensation and noticing the aversion to it, noticing how the aversion kind of exacerbates the pain. 
And we might notice in this exploration of, well, what's the actual sensation? That we've kind of attributed a whole, like, the whole knee concept to it, the solidity of knee of something that's a block of experience, and that the knee is pain. 
And again, it may be more the idea of pain that we're relating to than the actual sensation level. 
And so the idea of pain comes with a lot of concepts and possibly aversion that's connected to that. 
And so that's unpleasantness that gets added to the physical unpleasantness that makes things much stronger, makes the pain, the unpleasantness, much stronger. 
So if we can begin to be curious about, well, what's the actual physical sensation? Another thing that seems to happen with pain is that we feel the painful sensation and we pick it up and project it into the future. 
We think this is going to last forever, this is going to, you know, so we kind of, we hold onto it into the future with the idea that it's going to keep going. 
And that adds a kind of an exacerbation of the reactivity. 
And so if we can actually notice, and sometimes we can actually notice that the pain itself, the physical sensations of pressure, pulsing, tightness, squeezing, heat, that there, you know, there may be a little unpleasant, but that the attribution that it's going to keep going, that it's going to get worse, that's another one. 
We think it's going to get worse, but that's a lot where the unpleasantness lies. 
And so again, kind of the curiosity about what's the actual physical experience begins to help us to tease apart these different processes going on, and helps us to see where the reactivity actually lies, where the suffering lies. 
There is physical unpleasant sensation, and I'm not saying actually that you shouldn't move if there is pain in your body. 
I would say that it can be useful to check out how, whether the pain is more connected to the actual physical sensation, or whether it's more connected to the idea of this is going to get worse, this is going to, so is there, is there a kind of a way that we might be able to touch into the actual experience and notice the reactivity that's kind of in counterpoint to it? And maybe in noticing that reactivity, we might have the sense of reactivity gets stronger, the pain gets stronger, the reactivity gets weaker, it's actually not that bad. 
So that instead of immediately moving, we do a little bit of investigation, a little bit of curiosity. 
One of my teacher, Saito Utejnaya, speaks about inexploring pain. 
He says, you know, give yourself a chance to explore it. 
You tell yourself at the very beginning, it's okay to move. 
That idea that it'll be okay to move if it gets too bad, if it gets too overwhelming, that really helps the mind to take a step back and be able to explore it for a little bit longer. 
We don't feel like we're trapped, like we have to just stay there. 
So Saito Utejnaya says, you know, tell yourself at the beginning, if you're exploring physical pain, it will be okay to move if it gets too hard. 
And then see if you can explore this distinction between the physical experience and the mental reactivity. 
And some of this, you know, in Saito's teaching, he encourages very much a receptivity, not a kind of a diving into and looking for. 
But we can, in exploring experiences, like be kind of curious, okay, though there are the physical parts and the mental parts, what is the physical part? We could have that question in our mind, what is the physical part and what is the mental part? And then maybe start to see the sparking, the vibration, the pulsing as separate from the aversion, the imputing of this is going to last a long time. 
And maybe see how the aversion strengthens and weakens and how that feeds back to the experience being more difficult or less difficult. 
So there's a number of different things that can be learned through kind of being curious about this distinction between these processes and between the process of physical processes and the mental processes. 
And the exploration around the elemental aspect, what is the language of the body? That's kind of how I explored it for myself. 
What is actually the body saying? What is the body? How is the body speaking to the mind, basically? How is the body offering its information? And then what's the mind doing with that information? How does it relate to it? How does it have ideas about it? Create reactivity to it? So this exploration really, for me, helped me to understand that so much of what was going on in the relationship to physical experience was the reactivity. 
And when there was this kind of like more curiosity about, well, what's actually here? That curiosity itself can be a tool that helps the mind have a little bit less reactivity, a little bit less judgment to what's happening. 
Well, let's see. 
What is happening in the body? What is happening in the mind? So we see this kind of these feedback loops, cause and effect, bodily experience, the sensations of the body affect how we relate to it from habit, from conditioning often. 
Habitual kind of tendencies to relate to certain experiences in certain ways. 
And then different kinds of physical, mental experiences, emotional experiences, then create experience in the body. 
So a kind of an aversion to pain can create a sense of tension throughout the whole body, a kind of a bracing feeling to hold the body still so it might not have to feel that pain. 
So that's a feedback from the aversion to the body. 
So there's this, this two way conditioning that we can start to see through exploring this.
