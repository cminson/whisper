Practice Notes : Stillness  and Movement

Sometimes we get to see or understand something 
most  clearly when we have something to contrast it 
with. The contrast can be qu ite strong, almost like 
opposites. One of the interesting contrasts for people 
who meditate is the contrast between stillness and 
movement. In a sense  when you meditate , you’re  sitting 
still with your body. But sometimes if you’re still with 
your body, you  start seeing small movements or the 
urge to move. These can be  quite subtle, but they 
represent our inner psychological movements. You can 
sometimes see it much more carefully than in your busy 
and active life. You might not have even notice d that 
you hav e adjusted your posture slightly when you’re in a 
restaurant hanging out and talking. But when you sit 
and meditate, the urge to change your posture is seen.  
 
Even  if you don’t have any urge to move and you just sit 
really still, you can see that the stil ler and more attentive 
you are , what’s  actually going on in your body is all 
movement. There is nothing that is actually still in the 
body. Even though there is a feeling in the body of 
stillness – at the core, the center or the overall container 
feels sti ll – but the parti cular sensations are all moving, changing and buzzing. It’s  very vibrant. It’s quite 
somet hing to feel an inner stillness, and take that with 
us into our lives , and feel when we’re actually quite busy 
there can be a stillness there with us. To feel that 
contrast or the combination of those two, can make it all 
very rich and meaningful. It’s like being calm in the 
middle of lots of things going on. It feels more satisfying 
to be calm  or still while we’re in motion and moving.  
 
The same thing happens with  the mind. The mind can 
be still, or the mind can be moving. Sometimes  the mind 
moves a lot. For example, say you sit down to meditate 
and the body is still, but the mind is just jumping around 
like crazy  – thoughts, ideas  and feelings  are spinning 
around . Sometimes  we can see the active movement of 
the mind clearly only if we keep the body still and close 
our eyes. If you live a busy life and everyone around 
you is busy , it might even seem that your mind is pretty 
calm and still , compared to what’s  around you. But 
when you  sit down to meditate , you see that the mind is 
quite busy and active. So to  discover how to be still in 
the mind is a beautiful thing.  
 
A wonderful thing that can also happen is when the 
mind can be still while  it is active. Just like in physical 
activity , you can sense stillness and movement 
together , the same is true  with the movements of the  
mind . We don’t have to stay stuck always kee ping the 
mind still and placid. There  is a wonderful way that stillness can be there all the time . It is a reference point, 
a refuge , a way that highlights the movement. So we 
see the movement more clearly and then can take more 
responsibility for it – whether we get involved or not, 
whether we get pushed around by it or not.  
 
One of the most powerful things to become aware of 
when there is stillness , is the urge, impulse or inte ntion 
to do anything at all – to act , to speak , or to get involved 
in some mental activity. And to have enough stillness to 
watch the intentions arise , and have enough sense of 
connection to stillness that you don’t have to act on it 
right away. Sometimes you feel the impulse to act  with a 
sense of urgency . I sometimes see in myself when the 
telephone r ings, that there is first an instinct to rush to 
answer it. But why not  wait for a few rings?  Or when the 
bell rings at the end of the sitting , is there  immediately 
an intention or reaction that says , “Now  I can open my 
eyes and move ”? Boom! What  happens i f we see the 
urge or intention , and then act on it in our own time, 
when we’re  ready , or in harmony with stillness ? 
 
So, stillness and movement – to notice the movements 
and to notice the stillness. I think that people who 
meditate get an increased appreciation for  the stillness 
part that adds richness to the movement part. As you 
practice today, you might see if there is any reference 
point for you of stillness that might be interesting. There 
may be more stillness within you than you realize . But we don’t tune into it, we don’t value it – meaning  other 
things are important.  
 
And if you can’t be still, then be mindful.  
 
I hope you enjoy your morning.
