 Welcome everyone to the beginning of our five-week introductory course in mindfulness. Since people are still coming in a little bit, I thought I would start by telling you two stories. The first story is about a bureaucrat back about 200 years ago, maybe longer in Japan, who went to visit a Zen master. One of the things that traditionally Zen masters are supposed to do, kind of in the job description, is to do calligraphy. Great Zen masters were praised for their great calligraphy. This bureaucrat went to the famous Zen master and he asked them if he would write the kernel, the essence of Buddhism, on a scroll of paper and it was beautiful calligraphy. So the Zen master kind of nodded with great eagerness and said, yeah, I'll be happy to do that. So he took out his brush and he prepared and with great precision and attention to detail, real presence to what he was doing, he wrote out the character, attention. And he handed the paper to the bureaucrat and the bureaucrat said, oh, you misunderstood. What I wanted was kind of the really core essential teachings of Buddhism, something really profound, the profound teachings of Buddhism. And the Zen master said, oh, I see. And so then he took another piece of paper and he wrote, attention, attention. And the bureaucrat said, oh, but you don't seem to understand. What I want is the profundity of Buddhism. Buddhism is this famous world religion and philosophy and way of life and it's gone through India to China, Japan and all over the world and it's one of the great religions of the world. I want something that represents something with profundity, something great teaching. Zen master said again, oh, I see what you want. And so he wrote the third piece of paper, he wrote attention, attention, attention. So attention is important. And then the second story is, I was reminded of it today. When I was practicing in a monastery in Japan, there was an older monk who'd been in the monastery a few years longer. And I asked him why he ended up in the monastery, why he was there. And he told the story that before he was a monk, he had spent seven years as an apprentice to a master farmer, organic farmer in Japan who, you know, in Japan they have these national living treasures, you know, the potters and the painters and people who do great art, great crafts. And he was kind of a master farmer, it was his craft and he was known for that and people would come in and apprentice with him. And it was a beautiful place in rural Japan with mountains and forest all the way around the farm and it was really nice. And he lived there for seven years studying with this great master. And then one day he woke up to his master and he explained to him, I'd been here for seven years and I still don't know that the trees are green. I'm going to his end monastery. And meaning that as I understood it, they had been in this beautiful setting for seven years and his mind hadn't been awake enough, paid attention enough, been present enough for him to notice something that's totally obvious to all of us and that is that the trees are green. And of course he knew the trees were green, but he really felt that he was really missing something about the alive connection we can have with life when we bring our full presence to it. And that's a simple thing to say, but remember the Zen master wrote attention and that's pretty simple too. And there's something very simple about what Buddhism teaches when it teaches meditation. It teaches us something which is in some sense child's play, you know, pay attention. My mother used to tell me all the time, she's not a Zen master in the usual sense of the word, but then she'd pay attention, Gil. Or she would tell me, enjoy your food while you're eating it. You know, simple things, you know, that Zen masters will tell their students. So it's a simple thing we're talking about when we talk about Buddhist meditation practice. And I think if we reflect a little bit, we do pay a little bit of attention to our life. Many of us will find that we spend an inordinate amount of time lost in our preoccupations. And preoccupations means all kinds of things, worrying about the future, remembering the past, regretting the past, reliving the past, concerned, lost in fantasy, lost in ambition, lost in our busyness, one of the great violence of our culture currently, especially in this part of the country. Violence that we submit ourselves to is the violence of being overly busy and then running around kind of constantly kind of doing ten things at once. I've heard that there are people who, while they're driving, have been seen talking on the cell phone and shaving. You know, trying to do too many things at once is dangerous for your health. So when we were lost in our preoccupation, you know, we can take care of some, you can kind of often take care of things in a kind of rudimentary way. But feeling any kind of deep connection with ourselves and deep connection to life isn't really possible when we spend too much of our time preoccupied or too much of our time numbed out or distracted. And our culture is also one of, focuses a lot on distraction. Much of our commercial culture wants us to be consumers. And being consumers is to be distracted often, often enough. And certainly the attempts to get us to be consumers, they're trying to distract our attention from anything else. And so there's kind of constant barrage of efforts that keep us preoccupied in. So that we don't enjoy the childlike kind of possibility we have all of us of being nothing special, just being awake and noticing that the trees are green and asphalt is black some places. So mindfulness practice is what we're going to talk about these five weeks, is a practice of strengthening this natural ability that we all have to pay attention, to be mindful, to be attentive, to be alert. And there's nothing particularly Buddhist about it. There's nothing particularly religious about it. If you care, there's nothing particular spiritual about attention. It's something that the most unspiritual in the world, the most unspiritual person in the world has attention, has the ability to pay attention. And what we're talking about is strengthening that ability, making it more something that's more present in our life so that it becomes a home for us, a place we abide, rather than a place we might visit occasionally when reality forces itself onto us in our preoccupations. And our life goes a lot smoother when we bring more attention to it. Attention or awareness of mindfulness is a tremendous salve, a tremendous lubricant for our life. It's a tremendous source for feeling. A lot of the things in life that we feel are the most beautiful, the most precious things of life. I don't know what each of you think of as the most precious part of life, your experience of being alive within your treasure the most. But I would venture to guess that for most of you, that whatever that you treasure most of of being alive, that you can only really experience that if you're really in the present moment. If it's friendship, to really experience friendship directly, you have to really be there for the friend. Joy, delight, beauty. These are things that happen when we're present in the present moment. If you're thinking about yesterday and yesterday's friendships and yesterday's beauty, I don't think it has the same alive feeling of connectedness to life and to that precious treasure of what's possible as it is to feel those things in the present moment. To the degree to which we can open and learn the tools or learn the strength or learn the ability to really learn how to be present more and more often, our life and the treasures of life will kind of open up to us more and more often. People come to a mindfulness class like this for many reasons. Probably each of you has your own reason to come. Many people come because they're stressed out and there's a lot of stress with this kind of life many of us live. There's a feeling of needing some balance, some way to calm down or distress or relax a little bit. Mindfulness meditation now has a reputation in America as being a form of stress reduction. Some people feel disconnected with themselves and mindfulness is a way of finding a connectedness again with oneself. Enough people are strangers to themselves. Often when we're strangers to ourselves, to open up and to become alive to ourselves again is often to open up to all sorts of pain within ourselves. Feeling connectedness to ourselves is to go through a period of feeling old pains and griefs and sadnesses sometimes. Some people come here because they've had some experience in their life of great peace or great openness or great joy. They feel that something, they feel they want to find some way to touch into that kind of sense of presence again, well-being again. Maybe they think this kind of practice might help them. There's many reasons why a person does this kind of practice. You're all welcome to come here for whatever reason you want. It's not my job to tell you why you should be here exactly. I'll try to tell you a little bit about some generic reasons why mindfulness is a good idea, but it's really up to you. I think this is a very important part of the teachings of Buddhism itself, is that you're really here for yourself and you use whatever I teach you, the practices that I teach you, really to help you live the life that you want to live, that you want to kind of wake up to and the one that you feel will bring you the deepest forms of joy and happiness and compassion for your life and for the life around you. So my name is Gil Franzdal and I've been teaching here in Palo Alto since 1990 and I've been practicing Buddhism for a long time, for about 25 years now. I first did a lot of many years of Zen practice and was ordained as a Zen priest and went to Japan and practiced there. And then I went to Southeast Asia to Thailand and Burma. I was introduced to this practice I'm teaching you here, what's called Vipassana in the Buddhist language and Vipassana is just a foreign language way of saying clear seeing, looking deeply. The usual way to translate it into English is insight meditation because it's kind of literal with the word sight. Pasana means to see, though more generically we often just call it mindfulness practice. So I learned that in Thailand and Burma and then I came back and continued my practice here and then in the late 80s I started training with Jack Cornfield to be a mindfulness Vipassana teacher and started teaching in Palo Alto and I teach here, I teach at Spirit Rock which is a meditation center we're building in Marin County and around different places. And I've just finished up a doctorate in of all things, Buddhist studies at Stanford. And one of the great advantages of having gone through a doctoral program Buddhist studies is I can say now with great authority that you don't need to get a doctorate in Buddhist studies to understand Buddhism. And so all you need to do to learn about Buddhism is to study yourself and whatever you need to know about Buddhism you'll discover on your own through your own ability to observe yourself and life around you. So a lot of what we'll talk about in these five weeks hopefully are kind of tools or angles or perspectives or pointers to how to, for you to bring more attention to all kinds of different parts of your life. Today we'll talk about the basic meditation practice of bringing attention to the breath and the breath is kind of a central part of a life of mindfulness. The breath is this marvelous place of the bridges, the conscious and unconscious mind. Some people would say the mundane world and spiritual world and whatever. It's a great bridge, it's a great place to breath. It's a great kind of focal point or pivot point for much of our life. And the breath is one of the most phenomenal things you can study in your life because it opens up in all directions to everything else in their life. And so practice often starts with a very simple thing, mindfulness of breathing. But then we don't stop there but rather this practice is learning to expand the attention beyond the breath to other aspects of our life. So next week I'll talk about how to include our physical life, our body, being embodied in the practice of mindfulness. And then the third week I'll talk about our emotional life, how to include our emotions as part of meditation, as part of mindfulness practice. And the fourth week I'll talk about thoughts and how to include the world of our thinking, our mental life. And then the final week will be more about how to include the mindfulness in all aspects of our daily life, our daily activities. And what you'll hear as you listen to me is an ambiguity in how I teach in that I don't make a very clear distinction between mindfulness as something you do in meditation practice and mindfulness as something you do in your daily life, something you do your cooking or driving your car or whatever. Mindfulness can be brought to everything you do. And so I warn you now that I kind of slide back and forth and sometimes you might think I'm talking about meditation and then suddenly I'm talking about something that's more applicable to your daily life. I don't see a sharp line at all between meditation and daily life. They're just continuous with each other. And to feel that there's a sharp divide between the world of meditation and the world of everyday life is a tremendous delusion which in the long term will cause a lot of suffering in your life if you continue with meditation. If you don't continue with meditation you'll have to worry about it. So we have these five weeks. These talks are taped and previous of these five-week introductory courses have been taped. If for some reason you miss a class and would like to get a copy of it on tape or whatever, Alison's here can sell you copies of the tape if you miss a week or whatever. And Alison also sells meditation paraphernalia. These rounds offers that I sit on which are great for sitting in meditation or these crescent moons which some people like to sit on and benches. I'll talk about them in a minute but Alison is a great resource. There's other places to get these things around like in east-west books but Alison I believe is cheaper. So logistic wise, what else to say kind of an introduction. The way that we teach in the tradition that I teach in this tradition of Vipassana is that the teachers are dedicated to offering your teachings as freely as possible. Actually the teachers want to teach freely meaning that just to make available to people for no costs at all, no charge. And partly the part of the reason for that is that we think that the teachings are priceless. And part of why I love doing what I do this kind of teaching is that I'm teaching what I love because I think mindfulness, the simple thing you know that my mother used to tell me to do, I think is actually really precious and lovely and something I'm deeply in love with and have a chance to share something I love so deeply with and maybe even kind of somehow convey that love I have for being alert and attentive and present is a great source of satisfaction for me. So that's one reason. The other reason, so that's you know one reason is priceless and the other reason is we don't want to make money a barrier so people who don't feel like they have the means or whatever won't come. So anybody's welcome to come and participate in any way you want. It's relatively informal this way. We do have two baskets out in the hallway and the way that the teachers then are supported because we don't charge anything, the teachers are supported by donations by those people who are inspired to support the teachers. Some of them like me, 99% of my support comes from people who make donations to allow me to teach. This is how I support myself. It's my livelihood. And so what it means is that isn't that I'm looking for make money but being supported by donations allows me then to continue doing this kind of activity. And I can't continue doing this kind of activity the degree in which I do it unless I get support. So this is the way we teach in this tradition. And so there's two baskets out there. One basket is donation if you want to help us pay for the rent because we have to we pay the Quakers rent for this building. And if everybody paid a dollar for rent that would more than cover it. And the other basket is I think it says teacher donna. Donna means generosity and and that's for whatever you want to donate for me for the teaching. And I'll say this what I often say. There's a funny attitude that we have in America about money. Kind of we have a lot of confusion about money. And one of the odd things is that it seems that people value what they pay for more than what's offered kind of in this kind of donated system. If I had charged you know a phenomenal amount of money for a five-week introductory course maybe fewer of you would have come. But then you would have come every week. There was a friend of mine in Australia who was teaching this way and he wasn't making his life wasn't working. He couldn't make it work. So he said forget this I'm going to charge. So I think he charged something equivalent of sixty dollars for a six-week class. And not only were all his classes filled but he had to do many more classes a week. Phenomenally popular. So just you might think about that when you. So that's what we'll do. So today I'm going to talk about meditation. And meditation is a beautiful thing to do. Meditation creates a lot of can create a lot of calm and a lot of presence in your life. But more importantly in the purpose of mindfulness meditation is not necessarily to create calm and presence in your life but rather to help you be more attentive to what your life actually is. And that's really the definition of mindfulness is attentiveness to what your life really is right now. And they're deeply attentive to what this life is right now. And the more attentive we get the more we realize that our life is a lot different than what we thought it was. And that's part of the great delight of a life of mindfulness and meditation is increasing depths of understanding of ourselves and the world around us open up as we become more and more attentive. It can be a great source of surprise that we discover the world is a different place than what we thought. There are two ways of creating change in our life, maybe many ways, but I just mentioned two. One is by force and the other is by allowing. And the way of force is one that many of us are all too familiar with. We go out and do things kind of actively and forcefully with ambition or with decisiveness or whatever. Meditation doesn't work very well. Mindfulness doesn't work very well if you're trying to create deep change, spiritual change, from force. Meditation works much more throughout allowing. And it's very hard for people who are used to controlling things and being in control because meditation doesn't work by you being in control, thinking you can control everything. It can be very, very frightening meditation for people who are really control addicts because meditation won't succeed if you're trying to control it. But if you give up control, that's scary. So for some people it's very, very challenging. So meditation unfolds most out of a sense of allowing things to unfold. And if you allow things to unfold, part of the reason it can be scary is you have no idea how it's going to unfold. No idea. And I'm not going to know how it's going to unfold for you. I would love to sit here and promise and give a guarantee that you will feel all this wonderful joy and delight and bliss and dissolve in white light and all you meditate. I don't have a clue what's going to happen. Some of you are going to have phenomenally painful knees. And it might be better meditation to sit there with your painful knees than to dissolve in white light. I'm serious. I'm really serious about that. Or you might feel tremendous grief upwelling that you never felt, never allowed yourself to feel. And you say, wait a minute, I thought I was supposed to be feeling calm. Meditation is about allowing ourselves to be as we are and allowing, just appreciating or attending or being attentive to what surfaces as we allow things to be. So let me teach you a little bit about meditation posture because I think it's very important to have a stable posture to do a meditation practice. Part of the function of a stable posture is to take a posture that allows you to sit upright in a self-reliant kind of way for long enough to kind of do a period of meditation. Part of the path of mindfulness is a path of becoming increasingly self-reliant. And there's a wonderful correlation between our inner psychological life and our physical body. And if we use a backrest to meditate, you're not physically being self-reliant. And it's actually harder, a little bit harder to become psychologically self-reliant if you're using a backrest. Now it's possible to do meditation in any posture at all. So, and there's all kinds of bodies. And you don't, you have the body you have and it's everything, every body is a perfectly good body for the purposes of mindfulness and waking up. So if you need to use a backrest, that's fine. But if you don't have to use it, then I encourage you not to use it. So in order to help us kind of sit up straight and let our our spine be self-supporting, I'll first talk about how to sit on the floor. I found it's best to ... the most stable floor posture is a tripod, three points. And you make a nice tripod by sitting cross-legged. It's part of the reason for sitting cross-legged. It's very stable. To have your two knees touching the floor and then your tailbone or your butt on a cushion so you're raised up a little bit. I like to sit in the Burmese fashion with one leg is straight in front of the other. Kind of like this, if you can see my arms at least. So that both kind of lower legs are flat on the floor. It's possible to cross your legs so one is on top of the other, but it's less symmetrical that way. And it tends to kind of, if you sit like in half lotus with one foot up on the other thigh, it tends to lean us a little bit to one side. And I'm exaggerating a little bit now, but, and then if you straighten yourself out, you stretch one part of your body more than the other. And in the long term, that's something that yoga teachers don't like about meditators. Because they're stretching one side more than the other. And a good yoga teacher, a good meditation teacher will say, if you sit that kind of way with one leg up, then you should alternate legs. So you stretch both sides of your body. But the Burmese fashion is more or less symmetrical and it's a very stable, nice way. It's easier to sit than cross legged. That's one way of sitting. And then you want to sit up on a cushion. And again, these round cushions are called zafus, are very useful to sit on. And the idea with these is not to sit flat down on the top, but rather to sit on the front third of them. Because you're kind of sitting on the slant, the slope, and that sitting higher and sitting on the slope, lets your pelvis tilt forward slightly. If your pelvis tilted forward slightly, it's easier to get your knees down. And also it then creates a little bit of a strength in the curve in your lower back. You want to make a little bit of curve in your lower back, a little bit more maybe than what you normally have. It's just ever so slightly more. And that little curve in your lower back will make it a lot easier to have the rest of your spine straightened upright. If you collapse in your lower back, then you put a lot of strain in your muscles and you get tired really quickly. And depending on how open you are on your hips, to get your knees down, you need to sit higher. So the more open you are, the lower you sit, the less open you are on your hips, the higher you sit. So you have to kind of experiment with your cushions. Everybody can get their knees down if they sit high enough. But then there's a trade-off between getting your knees down and having your meditation cushion be a slide. And you slide right off. So you have to kind of, you know, if you can't get both knees down, one possibility is to get some other cushions and prop up your knees so that your knees are a little bit supported so they're not stretching too much and hurting. Another way of sitting is to sit on your knees, which is easier for some people, and you can take their rounds off and put it upright between your ankles and then sit straight down on top of it like this. Or you can sit in the bench, which is also nice. And these benches you put over your ankles and then sit down on it like this. Both are nice. It's not as stable as a tripod, but it's pretty good this way. And some of you might not be used to sitting cross-legged, might want to alternate rather than always being in one posture. Now, if you're sitting on a chair, you want to have, you know, basically you want to be stable on the chair. And so if you can avoid using the backrest, you just kind of sit a little bit further out from on the chair and you want to have both feet, not crossed now, but actually, usually it's said to have both feet parallel to each other. But some people like to have the mouth slightly, but parallel to each other with both feet flat on the ground and with the knees lower than your hips. If your knees are higher than your hips, then there's a tendency where the lower back caves out and it becomes bad for your posture in the long-term, you'll have back problems. But if your hips are higher than your knees, that creates a little bit of a curve in your lower back easier and it's much healthier for your spine. And all this is to help you sit in the strong upright spine. And one way to help you sit help also is to take both hands on either side of your hips, on the chair, on the floor, and lift yourself almost off your cushion or your chair, letting your chest come up. And then as you release your arms, if you can, let your shoulders kind of roll back, your back, down the back. And that kind of gives you a sense of being upright and straight. Then it's nice to create a little bit of space in the back of your neck where the glass vertebrae meets your skull to create a little bit of space. And that tends to bring your head down, tilt your head down slightly. And when we sit and meditate, we sit with the eyes gently closed and the tongue up against the roof, resting against the roof of the mouth. The mouth is closed and the hands can be in any posture that's more or less symmetrical. The classic Buddhist posture for the hands is to have the hands together in front of you. If you have them in front of you, and if you have them resting on your, and you're sitting on the floor and you have them resting on the heel or the ankle, depending on the proportions of your body, you might find that you're pulling your shoulders down and putting a strain in your upper shoulders. And then if that's the case, you might get a little pillow or cushion or something and put it on top of your heel so you can rest your hands higher. Some people like to have them on their hands, on their thighs, on their knees, facing up or facing down. So it's up to you, whatever feels comfortable. And that's kind of the rudimentary about posture. Do you have any questions about that? Do you have any questions about that? About posture, about the posture you're sitting in? Okay. Does it matter which leg is in front of the other? No. I mean, again, if I was really doing a good job, I would say that you should alternate to really make sure you have the right, you know, not getting lopsided, but it doesn't matter. As far as I know, it doesn't matter. Different people have different leggedness. Well, should we try it then? So why don't you take the posture? And to simplify the posture instruction, you want to sit in the way where you're sitting alert but relaxed. It's a comfortable but alert way with your body. So your spine is alert. And around that alert spine, energized spine, you let your shoulders, your body, your stomach relax. I find that it's often useful at the beginning of a session of meditation to take two or three deep breaths. And then as you breathe out, maybe breathing out a little bit longer than usual, relaxing your body, letting go into your seat, into your body. So you might take a couple of three deep breaths. And then let your breath become normal, letting your breath breathe itself. In mindfulness meditation, there is no right or wrong way of breathing. You can breathe whatever way you have to be breathing at this moment, or any moment. Sometimes in New Age California, there's an idea that to be spiritual or cool or hip or whatever, you need to have a long deep breath. In this mindfulness meditation circle, we are free from having that kind of idea. You can just breathe whatever way you're breathing. As you're breathing, feel your body, sense where in your body, the body's experience of breathing is most predominant, clearest. And as you're breathing, feel your body, sense where in your body, the experience of breathing is most predominant, clearest. Do you experience your breathing most in your abdomen rising and falling, or your chest rising and falling, or the sensation of the air passing through your nostrils? Where is it the clearest for you? And wherever you found is the more or less the clearest or the easiest place to notice it, become aware of what the body's experience is of breathing. The expansion and contraction, the movement, the tingling, the spirit of the body is the most important. Letting go of your thoughts and concerns. Allow yourself to sense, to feel, to experience how it is the body feels your breathing. Feeling the full cycle of inhalation and the exhalation. Feeling how each of them is different from each other. And what will inevitably happen is your mind will wander off into thoughts and lose the connection with the breath. And when you notice that this has happened, then very softly re-establish that connection with the conscious breathing. Feeling your breath consciously. Allowing yourself to be as simple as you can. To experience simply this particular in-breath. This very out-breath. Feeling the full cycle of inhalation and the exhalation. Feeling the full cycle of inhalation. It doesn't matter how many times your mind wanders away. It only matters that whenever you notice it's done so, that you bring yourself back to the breathing. And for every moment that you're connected to your breathing, consciously breathing. You're softening the force of your preoccupation with thoughts and concerns past and the future. Each moment of being with a breath is a step towards increased freedom of presence. And the spirit of meditation is that of allowing. It's okay to be whatever way you are right now. Just in the midst of that, to be devoted to your breath, to breathing. In and out. In and out. In and out. In and out. In and out. In and out. Letting go of your thoughts. Breathing consciously. Breathing awarely. Breathing. The exhalation is a kind of letting go, especially near the end of it. Be attentive to the very end of the letting go, the end of the exhalation. And then allow the inhalation to come, to come into awareness by itself. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. If anything happens while you're sitting with your physical body or your emotional being, then it makes it difficult to pay attention to the breath. Continue with the breath. And we'll continue for one more minute. And with great tenderness and gentleness, try to stay as alert as you can with the breath for one minute. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. So there's an infinite range of possibilities of what might happen to you as you attempt to be mindful of your breathing. But I want to mention two general, fairly common possibilities. One is that doing something so simple as just being with your breathing, the rhythmic oscillations of contracting and expanding as you breathe or whatever, the movement, the sensations, is that it can create some calmness. We can get calmer. Breathing consciously tends to make many people a little bit calmer than they usually are, partly because we're not so preoccupied then with all our concerns and running around in our mind and whatever. And becoming calm, a little bit calm, is a great way of developing clear ability to see. And part of the function of developing calmness in Buddhism is so not so we can just be calm, not for its own sake, but rather so we can be more attentive and see more clearly what's going on in the present moment. The other possibility that could be happening as you follow the breath is you become very clearly aware how difficult it is, how often your mind wanders off into thought or preoccupations or whatever. One thing that might happen when you notice this is you might feel discouraged or upset or critical or, here I'm doing one more thing that I can't do. There's many reactions you could have and that cause a lot of suffering if you get caught up in them. Part of the point of mindfulness of the breathing is not to be successful with the mindfulness of the breath, to always kind of stay perfectly on top of the breath, but rather to notice the momentum of your mind, the momentum of your life that's happening that makes it difficult for you to be present for the breath. Often when we're caught up in the momentum of our life, we don't notice it, we don't realize it. If you spend the whole day running around crazy in Palo Alto doing all the 10,000 things and you sit to meditate the end of the day or just sit down to kind of relax the end of the day, you'll feel your body, the tension in your body, the momentum, the energy, the energized state or whatever, the tiredness that represents the momentum of all the ways in which we've been preoccupied for the whole day. We carry this with us, certain non-momentum, to do something simple as trying to be with our breath. And we notice the momentum keeps taking us away. And as we notice that, we can notice that momentum much more clearly than if we just continue what we're doing or if we just watch television and fell asleep. So part of the function paradoxically of mindfulness of the breathing is to be unsuccessful doing it. Isn't that great? Now the more successful you are with it, the tendency is calmer you get. But the point is not necessarily to be successful. The point is to start paying more attention to wake up to the momentum of your life as it really is. Oh, I'm constantly worrying. Oh, I'm really anxious about this. Oh, I'm still rehearsing the conversations from earlier today because I'm angry. Oh, I didn't know that. So just to notice, this is what's happening for me right now. And remember, it's always as spared as allowing. So mindfulness meditation is tremendously forgiving because you're allowed to be exactly who you are at that particular moment. You don't have to be anybody different. Isn't that great? You might have thoughts that you're supposed to be different than who you are. And those kinds of thoughts more often than not create suffering. And that's why we encourage you not to do it. But it's one thing to encourage you and another thing to do it. But it's very nice, I think, to discover it at practice where you're allowed to be just any old way you happen to be at any one moment via the headache. It's fine to have a headache. You don't have to try to change it. You don't have to try to change anything, but we want to become mindful of what that is and wake up to it. So we try our best to be with a breath and then we notice what about our present life that takes us away from it. And then once you notice, you come back to the breath and rest there again. Is that clear? Maybe. So what was your experience sitting for 15 minutes? Yes. I started falling asleep. And started falling for sure. So falling asleep can be quite common. There's many reasons for falling asleep in meditation. One is we're tired. And if we don't continuously be involved in activity, either physical activity or mental activity, that tiredness has a chance to surface and people start falling asleep. We're a caffeinated culture and the source of the caffeine isn't necessarily coffee, but sometimes it's our mental addictions, our desires and wants and aversions and criticisms and judgments and all these things that keep us kind of alert and going. And those start relaxing. If we're deeply tired, the tiredness reveals itself and you might just go take a nap. But there are other reasons for falling asleep, especially at the end of the day, especially if people are often tired. And so the wonderful thing in my meditation is that it's often considered, you're not supposed to fall asleep in a sense, but if you fall asleep, that's fine. Good for you. We want you to rest. But the other reasons for falling asleep, and one of the other interesting reasons can be sleep is often a protective mechanism that protects us from dealing with something that's difficult or painful. And when we sit in our quiet and let our usual preoccupations kind of settle away, things that kind of distract ourselves from our distractions, distract ourselves from ourselves, then some of the difficult things that we've been distracting ourselves from begin to surface. And and sometimes we don't really want to look at them. And so there's an inner kind of wisdom or inner kind of movement in the body that has us just fall asleep. And I see I have a newborn baby at home, and I see that babies have this ability. Maybe that's why we have it. It's left over when we're babies. The baby gets overstimulated, too much going on around it. He falls asleep. And it's probably a wonderful ability, wonderful adaptive ability for babies and probably continues into our adulthood around, you know, sometimes when we have very strong stuff arising. So there's other reasons also for falling asleep, but mostly it's because we're tired. Yes. My mind just did not shut up. And one of the things later is just that if I got it, you know, was going to pay attention to my breath, then my mind is going in, out, and it's starting to label everything. Oh, good. Actually, that's one of the things I could have, I should have said, is it's very helpful to label the breath. As you're following the breath, with a very soft, soft whisper in the mind, just name in, out, or rising, falling, it's kind of using a thought to nudge you to stay present rather than let your idle thoughts take you away. And it can be very helpful. Some people find it very, very helpful to very softly. The trick is to do as softly as you can with this inner voice, in, out. So you discover it on your own. Now sometimes when people discover it on their own, there has sometimes a compulsive feeling to it. And then you need to relax that compulsiveness and just let it be kind of soft and gentle. Now one of the first great insights that happens when people meditate is that their mind is out of control. So congratulations. Rather than being discouraged, you should take it as encouragement. You've reached the first stage. And it's better to know that your mind is out of control than it is not to know it and let it keep doing whatever it wants. And with time, your mind will settle down. As you continue coming back to your breath and coming back to your breath, and you won't be able to stay very long, just coming back, with time you'll start both letting go and relaxing. And with time also you start seeing the underlying forces that keep you kind of propelled in your preoccupation. And those are also soft as you see them deeply. Don't get discouraged. Yes. When you're sleepy, one of the tricks with sleepiness is to open your eyes. And so if you find yourself really sleepy and falling over, you might just open your eyes. And usually the way is to have your eyes down 45 degrees down to the floor just to open, and that can create some alertness. Dreaminess often happens also because as we get more relaxed or sometimes we get more sleepy, we kind of enter into this dreamlike state of it often happens just before falling asleep. And you can take it as a good sign if you'd like. Don't worry about it. But your job is to try to strengthen your ability to stay attentive rather than being pulled into the dreams. Yes. I feel a lot of eye movement. Yes. I feel some pressure here trying to maintain my eyes closed. Well, you're welcome to open your eyes. Just keep them open softly. But again, there's a lot of momentum of our normal ways of living in the world that reveal themselves when we sit. And one of the places where people have a lot of tension is around their eyes and their forehead. And sometimes when we close our eyes, that tension will begin working itself out. And there can be a lot of fluttering. And it'll pass with time. Just allow it to be there. Don't worry about it. Yes. Yes. And you're sitting flat on the floor? Yeah, probably. I can look at your posture later. I don't know. You have back problems normally? No. So I can look at your posture and maybe there's a simple way of kind of straightening out that might help. Some people, there's many reasons for back pain when you do meditation. A pretty common one for beginners is that most people don't have good postural habits. And if you sit up more or less, some people don't sit up very straight normally in their life, but they're kind of hunched over a computer or whatever. And so to sit up straight requires using different muscles than you're used to. And those muscles get tired and they hurt. So there's many, many reasons. And we could talk about it more later if I see how you're sitting. Yes. I do have back problems. I usually meditate with my back pain and back pain. I tried to take your suggestion of sitting forward and I couldn't sustain it very long. And when I moved back to the side of the back, getting with the support from the back of the chair, it took a while when my back calmed down and I was okay again. But I'm a little uncertain whether the pain has to do with the problems in my back or just the posture. Maybe at the end of the class or some end of some other class, I can look at your posture and see. And using a back crest, if you need to use one, if it's possible, it's best then to have the support as low in your back as possible. So one way is like these are pretty good chairs. If you get like a towel or a small cushion and put it in your lower back and then wedge yourself back into it really firmly. So you have this really strong support, hard support, really low down that can actually help propel the upper part of your back is kind of self-supporting or kind of not using a back rest. So that can be helpful and maybe for you. Though some people need to use the whole back rest and it's fine. Some people will do their meditation actually lying down because that's the only thing that their body will allow them to do. Other questions? Concerns? Anything else that you'd like to ask so far? I talked for a long time. Yes. You mentioned the tongue touching the roof of the mouth. Any particular part of the tongue, I've read it in some meditations. The front of the tongue, tip of the tongue. So the way that meditation practice unfolds the best is if you do it every day. And the way this kind of five week introductory course works the best is if you sit every day and take the instructions from each week and do them for that week and then we'll build on those instructions as we go along. And I recommend that if you're new to meditation that you start by sitting 15 minutes a day and then each week of the five week course add five minutes to that. So the second week is 20 minutes, the next week is 25. And when you get to 30 minutes then you can maybe just keep it at 30 if that seems like all you can manage in your busy life or keep adding five minutes until you get to what would it be, 40 minutes. Most people find it's best to kind of classically meditate early in the morning after you wake up. Some people will do it immediately on waking up, some people will do it after taking a shower or kind of getting all freshened up before eating breakfast. The nice thing about early in the morning is usually it's somewhat quiet around and you're less likely to have people call you and interrupt you. There's a wonderful bizarre thing that happens sometimes especially to beginners in meditation. They're sitting in meditation and then you get this overwhelming insight, epiphany that the refrigerator needs to be defrosted. Now, it has to be now. So watch for those kinds of thoughts. So just sit there, sit a lot of time, 15, 20 minutes. But some people like to sit at the end of the day and come back from work. Some people like to sit twice a day. It's very nice to sit twice a day, kind of to bracket or punctuate either side of the day with some meditation. It's really, really nice. It's a different kind of meditation in two different sessions. It's best to do it and kind of arrange things so you're less likely to be disturbed, maybe unplug the phone if you do it in the afternoon. It's nice, it's very nice to find a place in your house that can be designated a meditation spot. A lot of people it's in the bedroom because a lot of other things, activities go on there. And so that corner of your house, little corner of your bedroom, whatever, has association. You have your cushion there and your little place and you associate that place with meditation. So when you get to that place, it's easier because there's association. It's best to wear loose-fitting clothing when you meditate, especially if you meditate on the floor, cross-legged. If your pants are tight, it can constrict your circulation and your feet can go numb. For beginners, often the feet do go numb anyway. And then usually within a few weeks or months, seemingly the blood will find new routes and the legs will usually stop falling asleep. But sometimes they continue for a long time, forever. If your legs fall asleep, maybe it's obvious, but it's very important not to stand up right away. And you kind of massage your foot and get it ready. If your circulation or your sensation doesn't come back within four or five minutes, it takes like 10 minutes for your sensation to come back, then you're not pinching the blood, but you're pinching a nerve. And you never want to do that again. You don't want to avoid that kind of numbness again because you don't never want to pinch a nerve or cause that kind of nerve damage. So if it takes more than five minutes for your sensation to come back, it's certainly a nerve. Timer. I think it's a good idea to use a timer, especially when people are relatively new and there's different ways of using it. I mean, if you use a kitchen timer, it's a little bit jarring. When I was first meditated, I went to a drug store and got these old fashioned wind up clocks that you set the time, I said about 40 minutes, but I wouldn't turn the alarm on. I just set the alarm arrow to that time. And then when I came around to that time, the clock would click. It wouldn't ring. And then it was a gentle way of, there are other ways, creative ways of timing. One way is, say you're going to sit for 20 minutes, you tape record on your cassette tape, 20 minutes of silence. And in the 20 minutes of silence, you ring the bell. And then when you're going to meditate, you stick your meditation tape in your machine, turn it on, and you listen to your silence. And then you hear your bell and you know it's time to. And there's also, I guess, there are silent timers that make nice sounds you can find. Probably East West Books has meditation timers with wonderful, you know, end of your 20 minutes, you get wonderful C sounds and crashing sounds and birds twittering. What else? Yes. I mentioned this idea of distraction. What do you think we're distracting ourselves from? That's for you to tell me. The reason I say that is that I'm not the expert in anybody's life, in anybody's meditation. And it's really, the practice is really for me to give you tools for you to find out for yourself. And it's fascinating to study your life and find out for yourself. And I don't want to take that opportunity away from you. And that question is a very important one. So I encourage you to report back. Yes. So what is the best posture or is it just because of the allergy or is it because of the posture that was feeling more strained? Could be. I mean, I suggest you're going to be tilting the head slightly to make more space back here. But I can imagine that would constrict things a little bit more, in which case maybe you shouldn't do it. And just find a place away for your head to be that is the most relaxed, easy way for you to breathe and just take that. There's no right way of sitting here. All my suggestions were not because of the right way. They're just pragmatically, generically kind of the most useful ways to be able to sit for some time. And each of you have to find your own way. Yes. My experience, I just felt like I wanted to bolt out of here really fast. I guess you just sit there and feel that? That's right. That's right. Well, as we go along, next week I'll talk about the physical experience and how to include it. And the following week I'll talk about emotions. And it'll be a lot easier to know what to do when these things happen, when you've got the instructions for the body and for emotions. But yeah, what you said is right on, just to be there and feel it. And it can be very challenging sometimes to sit still. But what we're learning to do is two things. We're learning to live a life which is not reactive. It's not a slave to all our ways which we feel automatically. And that creates this kind of freedom, a kind of strength to just not react from our impulses, but rather to act out of choice and responsibility. That's one thing. And the other is we learn about ourselves. And if you bolted in this kind of context, you would have distracted yourself from what was going on. But you don't get that restless and that's a good cause within you. And to really hang out there until you find out what's going on is another good reason to hang in there and learn that ability. And I've had that experience, and a lot of people do it at various times. So it's not unusual and it's quite worthwhile not to bolt. But if you just can't stand it, you're welcome to get up. I wouldn't recommend running over people. But you're welcome to kind of get up and you can go out and go for a walk and then fresh air and come back. Part of what we're developing in mindfulness is this sense of allowing anything that's there to be there, which sometimes is called equanimity in Buddhism. And the challenge is to do that equally for when things are wonderful and for when things are difficult. And many people are quite motivated to discover that wonderful spiritual allowing and equanimity when things are difficult. But as soon as things are wonderful, they don't want to develop equanimity. They love holding on to it. This is great. But we want to have this balance where we allow kind of allow whatever is to be there to be there as it is. Not to hold on to the joys, not to cling to it, not to expect it, not to manipulate to make it happen, and not to avoid and push away or resist the difficulties that arise. But rather to have this open-handedness or open-heartedness, open-mindedness to whatever might come through you. That's part of what we're learning in mindfulness. And as we learn to have that open-handedness to all experience, our life will be a lot easier. Yes? So then what do you do when you get thoughts? And if you're very mindful of them and then you get attention to those thoughts, you can go back to breathing? For now, the instructions are very simple. They just go back to your breathing. Right now, the instructions are really simple. Just hang out with your breath. You can notice whatever is happening, kind of note it, be aware of it for a moment, then gently come back to your breathing. But in the course of the five weeks, I'll expand the instructions until you get the full instruction. And you'll know how, it's very simple, the practice is just like you said, to pay attention to what's happening, pay attention to your thinking. But I don't want to give you the full instruction until you build a foundation to really know how to do that mindfully, clearly. Because if I told you to pay attention, most of you, if I told you, most of you know, pay attention to your thoughts, you just start thinking more about them. And we're not trying to think about our thoughts, but rather bring the non-discursive attentiveness to them, so we don't get involved with them. So the best thing to do is, until we talk about thoughts in the fourth week, don't think in your meditation. Don't jump, don't jump ahead. So let's end with a short sitting. And what I recommend you do is just take 30 seconds to stand and stretch. So take an alert with comfortable posture. Gently close your eyes. And then take a couple of deep breaths, letting go as you breathe out. And then letting your breath to breathe itself. Letting the tactile organ of your body sense and feel the body's experience of breathing from the inside. And ever so softly, you might label breathing in as in, breathing out as out. Letting yourself rest with the inhalations. Rest on the exhalations. And it's completely okay for you to be as you are. Just whenever you remember, come back and try to rest as carefully as you can on the rhythm, the cycle of breathing. Letting all else fall away. Let your breathing be the center of your universe, as if it was the most important, wonderful thing in the world, that you're going to devote yourself totally to just this without leaving it. Letting yourself rest. Letting yourself rest. So I encourage you to sit every day. And also you might, during this week before the next class, be curious a little bit about the difference attentiveness makes in your everyday life. Just driving to work or doing your shopping or washing the dishes or cooking. Notice if you can see a difference between doing those things with attentiveness, with presence, and the difference that makes as opposed to doing it preoccupied by other things. Start studying what mindfulness does to your life. So thank you very much and I hope to see you all next week. And if you want to talk with Alison about some of this paraphernalia, she's available up here. And I'm available for questions if you want to come and talk to me now. Thank you.
