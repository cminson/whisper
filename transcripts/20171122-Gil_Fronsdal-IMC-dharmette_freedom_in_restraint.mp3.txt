Dharmette: Freedom  in Restraint  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil Fronsdal on

I would like to try to talk about a topic  that is  perhaps not talked 
about much in American Buddhism , but that is central to  the 
Buddhism of Thailand and Burma – the traditional Therav āda 
Buddhism that we can come out of. It's a topic that I think people 
can easily misunderstand. And in some ways , it goes against the 
grain of what many people in modern American society want , 
expe ct, appreciate , or think is important. And many people , when 
they hear this topic , are ready to protest as soon as they hear even 
the label for the topic.  
 
So, are you ready ? The wonderful practice of restraint.  
 
Restrain t is to not to act  on something that you want to say , or that 
you want to do  – not to act based on certain feelings that are 
coursing through us . On the surface , this  seem s to go against the 
grain of what Buddhism should be about : to be free  – if to be free  is 
to be allowed to let whatever we want to do , whatever we want to 
say, whatever we feel have free reign. The freedom  to express , the 
freedom to do – but I think that what's more profound than the 
freedom to do, which in America sometimes gets overdone , is 
freedom from. Sometimes people want to feel like they should be 
free to do whatever they want at the expense of other people's pain.  
 
But in Buddhism , the freedom one is looking for is a freedom from. 
It's freedom from compulsion , freedom from addictive behavior , 
addictive thoughts , addictive speaking. Freedom from  blurting out  
unreflectively whatever you are thinking about. Freedom from being 
obsessive ; freedom from  the impulses that might cause conflict and 
tension  – or at least hurt – in the world around us. And so , to find 
freedom from these things is still genuine freedom , but it means that 
we're in charge , rather than  our compulsions being  in charge.  
 So, in Theravā dan Buddhism , there's a tremendous emphasis on 
restraint. And one of the places where  this is  most emphasized is 
around the five precepts . The f ive ethical guidelines that people live 
by are understood to be guidelines of restraint : to restrain from 
killing people. So if you're inclined to kill people , it's pretty wise to 
restrain yourself from that. If you're inclined to take what's not given , 
then it's pretty wise to restrain from that. If you're inclined to ward  
sexual mi sconduct , it's best to refrain from engaging in that . If 
you're inclined to lying , it's best to refrain from lying . If you're 
inclined to intoxicate yourself , it's best to refrain from that.  
 
And some of you may notice , that for some people it's really ha rd to 
refrain  from some of those topics . There are such powerful drives , 
which have so much authority and command , and which can get the 
upper hand , that a lot of damage gets done in the world because of 
them . And I suspect that half the news we read  in the newspaper  is 
about  people who didn't practice restraint around something to do 
with the five precepts. So , it's a good thing to have some restraint 
around those at least.  
 
But the ability to restrain , the ability to not  have to say or speak  
gives a pe rson a lot of power. And so , rather than something that 
diminishes us and makes us somehow worse , the idea of restraint 
or refraining in Buddhist practice is meant to actually enhance our 
personal power , our personal ability , in a way that we can be much 
more effective in the world  – much  more effective in the things we 
want to do , and to fix the things we want to change  in the world.  
 
And so , to refrain . One of the common guidelines in Buddhism 
around restraint is to learn to have the ability to refrain f rom saying 
and doing things that will cause harm. Or cause more problems 
than not. Some people are going to gatherings during  the holidays. I 
heard yesterday on the radio  about how difficult some family 
gathering s are going to be around politics. But is it  necessary to talk 
about politics at family gatherings ? What is the compulsion to do 
so? Is there a place for restraint ? Are you going to solve the political 
problems of the country by being in arguments and insisting you're 
right? Or is this actually going to caus e more harm ? Or is there 
more benefit to find a way to restrain from being compulsive ?   
One of the things we're doing in meditation practice is  – and we 
don't say this to o publicly  – it might  sound like publicity for 
mindfulness med itation  – but one of the things we're learning to do 
is in fact restraint. And  sometimes you see, and restrain yourself. 
No one would come , right? But in fact , that's partly what we're 
doing. We come here to sit still and meditate , to sit down and be 
quiet . And we don't act on every impulse we have to move , to 
change , to adjust our posture. When you meditate, e very time you 
have an itch , you don't scratch. Every  time that you want to change 
your posture , you don't change our posture . You might change your 
posture , you might itch a scratch , but not every time. If it occurs to 
you to say something , you don't say it.  
 
If your mind wants to wander off and think abou t plans for  the year 
2025 , you get really clear about what you want to do that day on 
November 22nd, 2025. It's probably not the best use of your time in 
meditation. So we learn to restrain ourselves from going off into 
those kinds of thoughts : “Not now,” and we come back. And so this 
constant refraining is going on : come back ; I'm not going to go into 
that; I'm not going to get involved in that ; I'm not going to do that. 
Restraint. Refrain . And the advantage of that is that then in 
meditation we can begin  settling on ourselves. We can begin  
check ing and see what's really going on here . What's driving me ? 
What's motivating me ? What's real ly happening is some deeper 
way?  Can I settle down , relax , and sit back in a sense , observe 
myself , know myself better , know the situation better ?  
 
And then because we restrained ourselves , at certain point , we see 
the situation better , we know ourselves better , and then  we're in a 
much better position to act or to speak. But if we make a  habit of 
speaking and acting on  every impulse we have , our society would 
be a mess. Luckily , most people restrain the impulse s they have.  
 
But can we do it in such a way that we don't feel limited . We don't 
end up living a life that's inhibited . We're not restraining ourselves 
because of being afraid. We're not restraining ourselves because 
we've been told , “You can't do that. ” But rather , we restrain 
ourselves to feel like we become more  ourselves , to be enhanced , to become freer , to be more a kind of presence for life in a ful ler 
way, so that we're more grounded in who we are. And in doing so , 
then wisely and clearly speaking up. Or acting if we need to act.  
 
But if the restraint is only about making ourselves smaller , like we 
don't count , I don't think that's healthy for anyo ne. But if restraint is 
about how I count – how important this is  – there  are more 
important things here than surface reactions , than my reactivity to 
what's happening in the moment. Let me restrain here , so I can 
touch in with myself and be with myself in some deeper way. And 
you feel the benefits of that. This is great. And  then maybe the 
practice of restraint is something you want to do.  
 
So we learn  about it in meditation. We learn  about it in the eth ical 
life that we live. And then having that as a string , then hopefully , we 
develop the wisdom to know when in our lives it's appropriate , 
healthy , and beneficial  to practice restraint. And when practicing 
restraint  is in fact  an expression of freedom.  
 
You're using your choice to not give in to impulses that you don't 
want to give into , that you don't feel good about. So , I would argue 
that if , for example , if a person  has a habit of swearing , and it just 
come s so natural to swear all kinds of terrible w ords, are they free ? 
If that so , swearing just comes out compulsively , and every other 
sentence has a swear word. Or do they become more  free when 
they choose not to say those words ? I would argue they're actually 
freer when they've learned to restrain those words. So , in restraint 
there is an act of freedom – asserting freedom as opposed to losing 
freedom.  
 
So, the practice of restraint. This is  certainly worth thinking about. 
And perhaps it's something that  we can borrow a little bit more  from 
the Asian Buddhist tradition. Maybe there's a good reason why it's a 
big part of that tradition.  
 
And if you hate d it this talk , you can tell me . You don’t have to 
restrain yourself  [laughs] .  
So, thank you.
