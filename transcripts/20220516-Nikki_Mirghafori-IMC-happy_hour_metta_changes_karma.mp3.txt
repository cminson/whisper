The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
There. Okay, all right. So hello, hello and welcome everyone. Lovely to be with
you to be in community warms my heart, warms my heart to be with the happy
our Sangha. So so for tonight or this moment, whatever the time zone might be
you're in, I'd like to invite us in a practice and the reflections and then the
guided meditation to consider karma and metta. So the theme of karma is
something that by the way, I've been I've been subbing for Gil, those of you who
show up to the 7am. Yes, some of you are here. I see you. And this morning I
talked about karma. And I wanted to bring that in to in the spirit of happy hour,
the way we practice with with metta and the whole all the hard practices. So I
want to say something first briefly about karma that it's not really it's not a
teaching about what we've inherited from the past magical life or or somehow
explain why, you know, we're having poor fortune here, I best have done
something terrible in my past life, where this other person must have done
something bad in their past life. Ouch, Ouch, not a helpful way to use this
profound, profound teaching. So it's unfortunately co opted in the West and
misused really misused in these very painful ways. That's not really helpful.
It's not appropriate. It's not serving. It's not really a practice. It's just a
baton for for for self-flagellation. It's a rod for self-flagellation, not a
top. But anyway, so so instead, one way to understand the teaching of karma or
the way really to understand is, is that there are three aspects to karma, and
they're all intertwined. One aspect is the intention, the wanting to do an
action. The second part is the doing of the action. But the action could be
action of the mind, action of speech, action of the body. So a thought is
considered an action of the mind door. Okay, that's number two. Number three,
the third aspect is what is done is the result is the result of what has been
done is the is the is the karmic disposition that we are left with, that
we are left with. So all of those aspects, both the leading aspect, which is
the intention, the doing and what is done. That is karma. That is what we are
left with. That's what shapes us. And we are product of our quote unquote karma
because of the actions of the intentions we have taken all these moments of the
doings we have done and the the results of those actions. And it's also
concordant with neuroscience. So not going to too much detail, speak more
about in the mornings if you guys want to show up. But how I want to relate it
to the practice of metta for us in this in this community is if you want to be
kinder to yourself and to others, then intend to be kinder, right, lead with
the intention, have the intention to be kinder, do an act of kindness part two,
and act of kindness again could be thoughts of kindness, could be words of
kindness, could be physical acts of kindness towards yourself, towards others,
right, that's part two. Part three, part three is that you are left, you will be
left with, you'll be shaped, you'll be shaped little by little to have a kinder
disposition. Wow. Pretty cool, hey? Karma is powerful. We can produce our own karma.
It's not this magical thing. We produce our karma moment by moment by the way we
think, the way we intend, the way we act, and what and the result that it's we are
left with. And then we tend to do those more and more. So if you find yourself
not being kind, okay, just pause, change, just shift a little bit, shift, shift.
And probabilistically speaking, the accumulation over time, you will be
changing your karma, you'll be, you'll be acting, you'll be going down a different
path, that'll become your habitual way of being in the world. So karma is profound,
especially when it comes to practicing loving kindness. So let's produce some
good karma for ourselves really. And in that way, I'm not, again, with the
definition I've given, it's not something magical, but let's intend towards
kindness with our intention. Let's engage in thoughts, words, and actions of
kindness. Oh, and see what kind of a result we are left with. And we are, we will
be left with a different karma, with wholesome karma, wholesome karma instead
of unwholesome karma. So such an empowering teaching, such an empowering
teaching is karma. It's not a matter of fate or destiny. Oh poor me. It's like,
no, I can change my karma. I can. So, all right, well, let's produce some wholesome
karma together. So, so with that, I'd like to invite us all to land, to land in our
seat, to land in our chair or cushion. If you need to shift and move to be
comfortable, it's okay. This is the perfect time to do it. And arriving, arriving
in this body, in this moment in time.
Landing, landing, landing. Oh dear body, I intend to be kind. I intend to be kind to
you. Oh dear heart, dear mind, dear me. I intend to be kind in this moment. In this
moment of creating, producing wholesome karma, because I can. I'm alive, I'm awake,
I'm here. I intend to be kind. And thinking thoughts of kindness, care towards
ourselves. Let's start with the body. Oh sweet, dear body, you have worked hard
today. You have worked hard today. You have digested. You have kept me safe from
viruses as much as you've been able to. You have been working as hard, as possible
in ways I can't even imagine. Thank you.
Thoughts of kindness, appreciation towards this body. An act of kindness, releasing, letting
go of any unkind thoughts, any judgment. Thank you, judgmental thoughts. Thank you,
you're not needed right now. I'm intending to be kind.
It's a powerful practice, intending to be kind. Engaging in thoughts for its actions of kindness.
Letting the breath be received. Letting the breath be received in the abdomen.
Gently, kindly with appreciation.
Maybe with a smile. As if your belly, your abdomen, your cells, the cells of your body
were smiling with kindness. We're bowing to the breath. Thank you, breath, giving oxygen to us.
Such a wholesome, beautiful exchange.
And if you notice thoughts arising, challenges in the mind and heart, connect with the intention
to be kind towards whatever rises. The intention to be kind to whatever rises, whatever, whatever rises.
Radical, radical kindness. Intention for radical kindness. Experiment.
See what happens if you're radically kind.
See your mind, see your heart. When you notice it's been distracted thinking.
If you're kind, do thoughts become less sticky?
Do they release more easily in the heart that's spacious with ease, with kindness? Experiment.
And can it be to engage?
And can it be to engage with thoughts of kindness for ourselves?
Perhaps with a metaphrase, AI may this person knows me.
Be safe. May AI be happy. May AI be healthy.
May my life unfold with ease.
Offering these words of kindness to yourself, to ourselves as a gift without any expectation.
Not clingy karma. We don't want to produce.
Clingy, expecting, wanting karma. But one of generosity.
May AI, may this person knows me. May they be safe. Happy, healthy, happy ease.
As if you're offering blessings to a good friend.
Words of kindness wishing them well on their travels.
Not clingy or tight. Spacious and generous.
Let yourself enjoy. Enjoy the phrases of kindness.
To yourself. Resulting, producing, wholesome, kind karma. Intention, action, result.
In this moment, right here.
Offering yourself the words of kindness, either in the phrases of metaphrase
or however is appropriate for you right now.
May be holding yourself as if you're a baby with kindness in your mind's eye.
A physical action, physical movement of metta, of care.
A physical action, physical movement of kindness.
A physical action, physical movement of kindness.
And now if you wish, extending
the intention to be kind to another being in your mind's eye.
Someone who's dear to you, you have an uncomplicated relationship with them.
Greeting them, your mind's eye with kindness.
I intend to be kind.
Loving, generous in your mind's eye with this being could be a person, an animal, a pet, a child.
Maybe see yourself doing acts of kindness.
Be act of speech, maybe you're telling them kind, encouraging words.
Or maybe you're sharing the words of metta, the phrases of metta in your mind's eye.
Or seeing yourself caring for them, maybe patiently listening to them.
Sharing acts of generosity, kindness.
Without attachment to reciprocation, without attachment to outcome, without attachment.
Not producing clingy karma, just generous karma. Kind, spacious,
spacious in the heart in this moment and in the next moment.
May you be safe from the inner and outer heart, dear one.
May you be happy and have joy in your heart, dear one.
May you be healthy and strong as much as possible, dear one.
May your life flow with ease, dear one.
It's okay to use your imagination.
To see yourself in acts of kindness and care, or maybe simply holding presence,
patience, patient presence, and expression of kindness.
You can stay with this dear being or extend, extending attention to be kind to more beings,
many more beings. May all of us, may all of us be well, including yourself.
Letting your body be soft, be relaxed.
And if thoughts, challenging, difficult thoughts, emotions are arising,
can there be kindness
as a response, not believing, not falling into the judgments, the grief in this moment,
but just holding it with kindness.
Even if a thought is annoying, or if someone comes up, the landscape of your mind isn't,
and you're annoyed or displeased, can you still be kind to yourself, to this being who doesn't
know any better, who's acting out of confusion, delusion,
having dust in their eyes, lack of wisdom.
Planting, planting seeds of kindness, planting seeds of kindness,
planting seeds of wholesome karma.
And for the last moments of this practice period,
can we be kind to ourselves, kindness in this moment, for whatever arose or did not arise,
we've done our best to be kind to this being, who's me, here and now, we've done our best
and to cultivate goodwill for others.
Whatever came up or did not come up,
it's an unfolding, it's an unfolding of causes and conditions, past thoughts, actions, karma,
it's okay, can forgive it, let go, forgive and intend this moment to be kind.
One moment of kindness, infinitely more powerful than zero moments of kindness.
May all beings be well, may all beings be free.
Hmm, thanks everyone, thanks for your practice, and planting all these moments,
all these seeds of kindness together, wholesome karma, what a beautiful field.
So, if you wish, you're welcome, you're invited to share reflections, questions,
comments, Richard, I see your hand.
Am I unmuted?
You are?
Well, I wonder if you could help me briefly.
For a long time, to this moment, I sort of think of the Brahma vahars as warm and squishy and
bare awareness as neutral and chilly and dry, and I think that's causing a split down my personality.
Yeah, yeah, well said, you're not alone, Richard, so well said, yes, meta, warm, comforting, nourishing,
vipassana or awareness or open awareness as neutral, cool, yeah, and then feeling is split
in your personality, so well said, so well said, I think you already know the answer yourself.
I think you do, but okay, all right, so yeah, so, you know, the sense of kindness,
gentleness, it has to be imbued, it has to be part of our awareness when we do vipassana,
when we do insight practice, when we do open awareness, if that kindness isn't there,
it becomes so dry, it can become a grim duty, it lacks, it's just gentleness.
I often quote Joseph Goldstein, I love what he says, he says,
wisdom, wisdom practices and open awareness is a wisdom practice, wisdom without meta,
wisdom practices or vipassana, you know, fill in the blank, without meta is like riding
a bicycle without air in the tires, so Richard, please put air in your tires,
please bring kindness, gentleness in every mind moment, it can be imbued and in Abhidha,
in higher teachings, you know, the sense of kindness, gentleness, there's this goodness imbued in every
moment of awareness, of mindful, of sati, so they are not separate and so many, here's my personal
opinion, my humble opinion, that many practitioners practice for many years, I'm not talking about
you, but many practitioners practice for many years without fruition, without getting, well,
I don't want to say getting somewhere, but you know, without just, with a lot of challenge,
let me put it that way, I'm feeling a lot of challenge because there isn't enough meta and care
and ease and gentleness imbued in vipassana, so I'm so grateful you brought this question up,
it is so important and it's not so difficult and you know how to practice meta, it's not just,
you know, here's a problem that I'm going longer, this is not a short question because it's such,
it's such a short answer because it's such an important question, see, the problem arises from
westerners often thinking of meta practice, just as the phrase is, may I be well, may you be well,
that's just one expression of meta practice, as you know, because you've been coming to this
practice, to the happy hour for so long, the way I offer and teach you, sometimes, a lot of times,
it's without words, it's like resting the feeling, resting in the care, in the gentleness, in, you
know, when the thoughts, for example, come, just smile at them, be kind to them, all of that is meta,
all of that is bringing meta into awareness practice, so there is the infusion, I hope that
helps Richard. Thank you. You're welcome, thank you for that very important question,
invite me to reflect for the benefit of many beings. Catherine says, I was one of those
practitioners, the Dharma only started actually landing for me when I opened my heart to meta
practice, it has changed everything, yay, yay, thank you Catherine, thank you so much for sharing,
oh it's beautiful, that makes me so happy, that makes me so happy, rarely others do I see heart,
so any other questions, reflections about today's practice as we engage together?
Yeah, I really appreciated this because I had never looked at it from that angle that
the way you explained it, it is empowering, it's not like I'm a victim to my own ignorance and not
knowing what karma was, it can change today like right now, like this practice, and I never looked
at meta and coming to happy hours planting seeds of that karma to change my whatever causes and
conditions of, yeah my constitution of how I am or whatever, so this was a really helpful way of
looking at the practice, very soft, very tender, kind, yeah thank you. Thank you Mima, so well said,
yay, I'm rejoicing in your insight and in the beauty of your expression of your insight,
thank you, thank you for that gift, that's so lovely, yeah indeed, yes we are changing our karma
every moment through every action, every intention, thought, action, it's powerful,
it's so powerful, empowering, empowering, and yes happy hour, way to shift to plant seeds,
any other reflections you like to share, you can also type them in chat,
you type them to me, privately I'll only read the reflections, they're typed to everyone,
I will read your name also, I'll be public,
hmm, silence is always welcome too,
complaints too, questions, if something didn't work, it's all welcome, warmly welcome,
hmm, tell you what, let's shift and turn and engage with each other in small groups
and the invitation today, the invitation for the small groups is, you know you can share it by
your practice if you wish, you can say a word about any insights, aha moments, challenges,
or maybe about karma and metta, this relationship of exploring karma in this new empowering way,
so again as always you're asked to just share from your own experience, not serving as a,
what's it called, facilitator for the group, just speak from your own experience,
just ask your own experience, that's it, and let other people speak from their own experience
or say pass, people can say pass and hold presence, it's all okay, they can be silent,
perfectly fine, no one is forced to say anything, you can hold that with kindness,
hold that with kindness, so each person will share one nugget, let's go reverse alphabetical order
just for the fun of it, according to your first name, say one nugget, the next person,
the next person, and back to you, next person, next person, etc, and be kind to yourself,
be kind to each other, you're planting seeds in the small group, remember you're planting seeds
of karma in the small groups, so I'm going to create the rooms, be kind to yourself,
be kind to each other, and here we go.
Any insights, anything that came up from the group, I'd love to hear, especially if you
haven't spoken, Jamie says it was wonderful, you want to say more Jamie, please raise your hand
because I don't see, or anybody else, I don't want to put you on the spot, anybody wants to say
just one word, what are rows, any insights, going once, going twice,
can also type in chat,
Oh, I do see a hand, I guess I missed a hand, sorry, I see lots of hands now, oh my goodness,
all right, we're going to let Catherine, I wasn't seeing the hands before, Catherine, please.
Oh, just that I'm recognizing it's not just seeds of loving kindness that I water here, but also
flowers and saplings and big trees. Sweet, thank you Catherine, that was beautiful, and poetic,
and given that you're outside, and I see all the saplings and the big trees behind you,
that is so sweet, thank you Fred, please. Well, two of us in our group had identical thoughts
during the meditation, we were both thinking that, well, this is what we want to do with the rest of
our life, you know, however long it might be, we want to be kind, we want to find the means to do
this in a persistent way as though this was now our post-career career. It was kind of wonderful
to think that the same words went through both of our heads, it was a nice communion together.
Sweet, thank you for sharing that and now I'm lighting up, hearing that from you and both,
yeah, Vicky, quickly, oh, you're still muted, still muted, third try, there.
We were saying that you are a wonderful model and that it's humanly possible,
maybe, because we see this shown to us with you. Thank you. Thank you, you're very kind,
and I think what comes up is, I want to say, it's not me, not mine, it's the practice,
yes, so it is possible, it's the practice, it is the practice, I have definitely changed
over the years and the decades, so yes, and continue to change, this is what I love to do,
to keep cultivating for the benefit of all beings, including myself, so thank you,
you're very kind. Thank you. And Mary says gratitude, one word, gratitude,
and there's a longer thing, Dave says, let's see,
our karma is always subject to revision, yes, yes, can always choose a wiser perspective,
thank you, Dave, indeed, yeah, so and that was, that was from Peter Herschalk,
East-West Centre in Honolulu, yes, beautiful, so thank you all, we have gone way over time,
my apologies, but these were such rich and beautiful reflections tonight, it was just
lovely to hear all of that and share and revel in the planting of seeds and seedlings and big trees,
so, so take good care, thank you all for your practice, thank you, thank you, thank you
for the benefit of yourselves and all beings everywhere, may all beings be well, may all beings be free.
Thank you all. And now I stop the recording.
