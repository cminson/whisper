 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So good morning and good day. As we continue with the mindfulness of the body exercises, and the exercise we're doing now is usually called the four elements. And I prefer the four properties, but what's nice about calling it the elements is the way that it connects us to the natural world. And so the elements are properties associated with the earth, with water, with fire, and with air. And these are all properties that are essential for life. And we take them in and they animate us. We animate them. But one of the nice things about seeing this connection with the earth, with the natural world around us, is for some people it begins to be an antidote to excessive self-preoccupation. Excessive living in our head with ideas of me, myself, and mine, antidote to conceit, antidote to the constructive aspect of the mind that constructs somewhat an edifice or palaces of ideas and concepts and selves and histories and all these things that are second nature for many people. And there's certainly a place for that in life, an important part of life, to see the whole. But here, in order to free ourselves from some of the deleterious effects of this constructive activity of the mind, we begin to deconstruct it and deconstruct the concepts and take us back to the elemental level, to the building blocks of our experience, to the core sensations, core sense data that we take in through our body with which we construct much of the world that we live in. And so learning to tune in and get concentrated on these properties, these sensations in the body can do a phenomenal job in teaching us how not to get caught in the constructs and the ideas. It's a way of freeing ourselves from them temporarily to have a radically different experience of ourselves that gives a different reference point for living a free life. So these are sensations that we have, the elements, these properties are known and experienced through feeling the different sensations in our body. And to experience it just as sensations, independent on the ideas that are then built on those sensations. So we'll start with a simple exercise that I kind of like to do. I hope that you're content to do it with me again. And now we'll build on that. So just gently closing your eyes. And maybe a few moments of settling in whatever way you have. Maybe a few moments of breathing deeply and relaxing. And when you settle in and relax into your body, you're relaxing into something which is quite natural, part of the natural world. As natural and perhaps as wondrous as a tree, as a bird flying through the sky, as a gopher in the ground or squirrel scampering up a tree, a butterfly flying in the air, a hummingbird, a river, an ocean, all the wondrous parts of nature, we're equally part of it as all those things. Our body is. So then begin now with sitting quietly and begin sensing and feeling the sensations of one of your hands. And perhaps you can feel pulsing and tingling. Maybe something that feels comparable to the flow of blood through your fingers. Feeling the contact of the hand against some surface, your legs, the other hand. Perhaps there's sensations of some weight, heaviness or lightness. Warmth, coolness. Maybe both on different sides of the hand. Certain sensations in the palm of the hand, sensations in the back of the hand, sensations of the fingers. And if you become attuned to the sensations themselves as natural phenomena, you might even be able to feel them, the sensations of them, independent of any idea of hand. The way the sensations feel themselves. Sensing, whatever is sensitive enough to sense sensations, are not really two separate things. Sensing and sensation occur together. And where in the location where sensing and sensations occur together, they occur before the mind has ideas, before the mind identifies it. Certainly it was something as complicated as hand or my hand. Or judgments, this is a good hand or a bad hand or anything. The sensations and sensing occur together, almost as if for themselves there is no hand. There's just themselves, the sensing, the sensations that come and go, arise and pass. The energetics of them originally derived from the energy of the sun. Solidity, weight, hardness, softness are considered properties of the earth. Warmth and coolness are properties of fire. Seeing if you can notice how different it is to experience sensations of your hand without ideas of me, myself and mine. How if you go into my hand or it should be this way or something, it pulls you away into the control tower. But if you relax into the hand, into the sensations and let them just be there by themselves. Now turning your attention to the area in your body where you normally experience your breathing. And not so much specifically focusing on the experience of breathing, but in that area of your body, have the same sensitivity to sensations as you had in the hand. If there is movement, that's associated with the air element, the wind element. If there's temperature, it's associated with the fire element, fire property. If as your chest or belly expand, you feel that the expansion, the pressure, the contraction is considered part of the water element. How water holds things together, creates pressure. And sensations of hardness and softness, weight are the earth element, the earth property. And the exercise is one of becoming attuned to the fundamental sensation level of experience, which is the building block of more complicated worlds we live in. But it begins with sensations. The sensing and the sensations occur together. The location where they occur, in and of itself those sensations have no concepts, no ideas, no preferences. Let go of ideas and thoughts and preferences so you can rest awareness in the sensations themselves, in that area of the body, content to be with the dancing flow of sensations coming and going, getting closer to them, closer we get, the more they become a dance of sensations, all in the area of your body where you're breathing....... Notice the way thinking pulls you out in the way from this natural phenomenon of the body, the processes of sensations coming and going. Perhaps you can dip back in, like dipping into a pool of water, settle back in to these properties and elements of sensations. For a few minutes, willingly surrendering to just sensations of breathing in the body, gently noticing the different sensations that come and go...................... Essential for our bodies, the air that we breathe in and out. We are in a sense continuing the energies of the sun and our digestion and our temperatures of our body. And we have within us atoms and molecules that have circulated around the world in many ways. Some of them have been in other forms of life before you. Some of them come out of the ground, absorbed by plants that we eat. Just about every part of our physical body is a continuation of the earth and of the natural life of the earth. Our body and all its elements belong as part of this earth. You belong here on this planet, in this world. And to believe you don't is to have lost touch with this elemental level of our life and its connection to the planet. And as we come to the end of the sitting, perhaps you can appreciate that others belong here too. They also are the fruit of the earth, of this universe. And to offer them the right to be here, to offer them, to see them through the eyes. And it appreciates them too as an important part of this natural world. To support others to feel like they belong on this planet. Maybe gaze upon others with respect and care and love. Maybe even a reverence that's freed from our self-centered, self-preoccupied ideas. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. And may all beings be free.
