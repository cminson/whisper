 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Tony Bernhard is a graduate of the Spirit Rock Meditation Center's Community Dharma Leader Program. He sits on the planning committee for the Sati Center, leads sitting group, and teaches Dharma in Davis, California. Welcome. Thank you. Although I am really pleased to be here, although I live in Davis, this feels like my home Sangha. In fact, I'm here tonight. I'll be here tomorrow, and then I'll be here Saturday. The thing that is happening Saturday on Dharma art is striking. I've seen Joan's presentation, if you have any interest in art at all. She taught at Princeton in the second half of the 20th century and hung out with all the New York artists. She says that all those guys were doing Dharma art. Jasper Johns and Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock and all those guys were doing serious, they were doing a serious effort at expressing the Dharma in abstract expressionism and pop art. It's a pretty impressive, but she starts back 2500 years ago. Anyway, just a plug for the event on Saturday, which is pretty nice. Tomorrow, for I don't know whether anyone here is planning on being here tomorrow, Gil is doing a day long on on Karma, and I'm working with him on that class. I did a discussion group last Friday on Karma. My mind has been a swim with Karma and the Buddhist perspective and teachings on Karma. I thought I would address it tonight because it really in some ways is central to the practice that we're doing, just the notion of it. I like to recall Ayah Kemma, who was a Theravadan nun who lived in the last century, used to say that anything beyond the Four Noble Truths was excess Dharma. Really, everything plugs into the Four Noble Truths and Karma does as well. I'm going to talk a little bit about Karma and then about how it functions in the context of our practice and the context of the Four Noble Truths. In the West, the phrase Karma has become so new-agey and we all have all kinds of associations with it. We think there's good Karma and bad Karma. We have that sort of notion. Good Karma really is the experience that we like and bad Karma is the experience we don't like. Karma, from the Buddhist point of view, was almost mechanical. It's like gravity or another law of nature. It's actually like saying good gravity and bad gravity. If you're the roadrunner on a cartoon and you run off the cliff and all of a sudden, that bad gravity. But if it keeps us here on the earth rather than floating off into space, good gravity. So it depends on our perspective. We also have this notion, just see if this resonates with you at all. The Karma is sort of payback for how we behave. It's the reward or punishment for whether we're good or bad. Isn't that sort of out there? We have that sense. So good Karma comes from being good and bad Karma comes from being bad. I'm not quite sure how that works with gravity. But for the Buddha, actually Karma was much more specific. It was a more specific kind of phenomenon. It had to do with intention. Karma really is intention in the Buddha's understanding of things and his perception of things. If you intend, if you did everything you could to help someone, just didn't spare any effort, used every resource available and it failed, you wouldn't feel remorse. You might feel sad, but you wouldn't feel remorse like you'd somehow pulled a punch or something. If you wish someone harm and then something happens to them, you can feel bad even if you didn't have anything to do with the event. For the Buddha, the intention itself was the determining factor in how we set up our future events. For the Buddha, it's pretty simple. Does it matter what we do? Does it make a difference what we do? Of course we all act as if it does. Because if we undertake to learn something, maybe a musical instrument or another language to develop any particular skill, we work at it and we have this notion that if we apply effort over time we will make a difference. It's the same with karma. What we do in terms of our intention, if we wish people well, it's a better feeling than wishing someone ill, just in the immediate experience. Usually if you're wishing someone well, you'll actually act in ways that are pleasant. Of course the response will be in terms of that behavior. So we set up the world with our behavior, but with our intention more specifically. Now the Buddha says in the Four Noble Truths, the first element is that dissatisfaction is a feature of our experience. It's a feature of our life. Sometimes we don't want to hear that. The purpose of all of what we do is to try to get rid of that. But his first observation is that it's built in because, second Noble Truth, we want things different than they are. That wanting itself is painful. It can be really profound and really heavy. In a situation of grief, when you lose someone, when you really want things different than they are, it can reduce you to tears. It can be very painful. Well, most of our experience isn't quite that intense, but not getting what you want can make you a little irritated, missed, angry. And those experiences are unpleasant in and of themselves. And usually if we act out of anger, we don't help ourselves or the people that we're interacting with. The third truth is that is the Buddha's contention that there can be an end to that dissatisfaction, an end to the suffering. Dissatisfaction is often translated. The word that I'm translating is Dukkha, the Pali word. Pali, P-A-L-I is the language that's close to what the Buddha spoke. Dukkha is often translated as suffering, but it's also translated as just dissatisfaction, sometimes disappointment. He says there is an end, an end is possible. He said if it weren't possible to put an end to your suffering, I wouldn't ask you to make the effort. But because it's possible, I ask you to make the effort. And he outlined the program, the Eightfold Path. When I first heard Eightfold Path, I thought that was too many. Because I read the list once, I couldn't remember it. I read it twice, I couldn't remember. I couldn't remember all eight of them for quite a while. But it's the Buddha's program. It's the path to the end of suffering. The elements that we pick up initially here are the elements that have to do with meditation. Mindfulness is one of the elements of the path. Concentration, concentration or stability of mind are two of the elements. A third is effort. It takes effort in case you haven't noticed. Meditating is not like a reverie, not like a daydream. It takes some effort to do. So those are three of the elements of the path, and those are the elements that we usually pick up and pay attention to. The other elements are interesting. The first one is understanding, correct understanding or skillful understanding. The word that's translated often is right understanding and right intention, right speech, etc. The Pali word is samma. It can be translated in a lot of ways, but what it means is understanding that doesn't lead to more suffering, that doesn't lead to more dissatisfaction. It means understanding things just as they are, not about how they should be, how we'd like them to be, how they got botched up in the first place. As the Buddha says, you can't find a beginning to that. No matter how far back you go, you can't find a beginning when things initially got off track. But it has to do with understanding that doesn't make things worse, that doesn't add to the suffering. I'll talk about that a little bit more in a minute. Intention is the second one, right intention, skillful intention, intention that does not enhance our suffering, the dissatisfaction we experience in the world. Karma is built into the eightfold path. The other three elements are usually speech, action and livelihood, right speech or skillful speech, action and livelihood. These are elements that we tend to overlook because we misunderstand them primarily because in Western culture we've got commandments on the brain. We've got a lot of commandments. I still can't remember the ten of them. I've got the eightfold path finally, but I can't get all ten of the commandments. But with commandments, the idea is it's about judgment, right or wrong, good or bad. I always sort of think that in order for that to work you have to have somebody who's making a list and checking it twice. And then somebody else is responsible for enforcing the good or bad. With the eightfold path the issue has to do with action that does not enhance our suffering or the suffering of others, the dissatisfaction that we experience in our lives that we don't make it worse. And the elements of speech, action and livelihood are the base on which the precepts, the Buddhist precepts are founded. The precepts are a set of five practice guides for behavior. It's not about judgment. So for example, the first one has to do with killing. And the idea is not that killing is wrong or right. It's that the practice is to not take life, to not cause harm. And when we make that effort we discover all the impulses in ourselves that lead us to swat at the mosquito and strike back verbally or in what other ways that others. But the elements of moral restraints, the Pali word is CELA. S-I-L-A. And this is the part that we tend to touch only occasionally in meditation circles because it sort of has that taste of commandments going. And a lot of us are uneasy with commandments. This has to do with practice and it's about our own behavior and it doesn't matter. It's about our intention. So what I'd like to do, usually people talk about CELA in terms of the precepts and the vows that are taken as elements of practice. But I'd like to talk about it from a slightly different approach, which is what the Buddha called the ten actions that are not in accord with the Dharma. The ten behaviors that are not in accord with the Dharma. These are the things which will make things worse for you because of the intention that generates the behavior. So there are three clusters, body, speech and mind. In body there are three elements. And the first is killing. And I think what I'll do is the Buddha talks about them. I'll just read his description because these are more or less his words. He says, here someone kills living beings, is murderous, bloody handed, given to blows and violence and merciless to living beings. Merciless, no compassion, no feeling for the other being. The point here is that when you do something like that, and we've all been in that with animals at some level, even if it's just taking an antibiotic and knocking out several hundred thousand bacteria. But you know, people generally encounter issues with ants and bugs and stuff like that. But the quality of our heart that we bring to our interaction with other beings, if we are going to practice not harming, then we're going to bump up against all of the impulses that arise in us to slap the mosquito or, I don't know what kinds of things you might do or have done in the past. But we've all taken a shot at one way or another, at other beings, out of anger or ill will. The second element he says, that's not in accord with the Dharma, taking what is not freely given. And usually that's understood roughly about stealing. But it's really about our own greed, our wanting. It's not about the behavior, it's not about the action of taking, it's about that wanting that will lead us to take something that's not freely given. In the Kite Runner, you read the Kite Runner, I think the boy's father says there's only one crime really, one sin, and that's theft. And then everything else is when you kill someone you're taking their life and when you lie to someone you're taking their right to the truth. Taking what is not freely given is not just about taking home paper from the office or whatever, or picking up tennis balls that happen to be on the ground outside the tennis courts. Because it applies also to time, resources, attention. And it has to do with that wanting. And so to work with that craving, that desire for something, if you resolve, if you do it as a practice and resolve not to take what is not freely given, you bump up against those impulses which arise in all of us. And so in a way, your behavior off the cushion becomes a mindfulness meditation of sorts. Because you notice those impulses because you're restraining them. And so it's not so much a good or a bad, but it's a mindfulness like when you sit and pay attention to your breath and the first thing you notice is that it's hard. The mind goes off into La La Land. So you bump up against the tendency of the mind and the way the mind works. So taking what is not freely given. And the third is misconduct in sensual pleasures. And in this instance, he's specifically talking about sexual misconduct. And for him, at this time, it had to do with having sex with women who are protected by their mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, relative, someone who's still young, or who are garlanded in token of betrovo. But it has to do with why sexual energy is so powerful that it's almost just pure, the desire is so strong that we often take action in ways that harm ourselves or others or both. You know, Ajahn Jumian, who's a Thai forest monk, makes the analogy with desire. He says, it's like a moth and a flame. For the moth, only the flame is bright. Everything else is dark. Can't see anything but the flame. And of course, the moth doesn't see, is not aware of the compulsion within it to fly to that because it's so lost in the, you know, it's enthralled with the flame. And so it is with us, with any object of desire. We become so enthralled with the object that we don't even notice the compulsion for it. So when we resolve to restrain ourselves, to restrain our behavior as a matter of practice, then we bump up against it and it becomes visible. You know, I think of the guy who killed Michael Jackson's father, not Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan's father, for his Lexus. His father was sitting in the car and the guy said, gee, I want that car. All he could see was the car, not even, you know, I mean, it wasn't a high probability of success, that kind of activity. But, you know, not able to see past the object of desire. So the intention here, these three kinds of action, he says, which are not in accordance with the Dharma, which cause more suffering for ourselves and others. Killing, taking what's not freely given, and misconduct and sensual pleasures. And we, you know, we can expand that actually to a lot. Misconduct and sensual pleasures applies in a lot of realms. I have a problem with ice cream. I mean, I just, what can I say? And I, you know, I actually thought I could beat it by buying an ice cream maker. Is that, is that pathetic? Is that what people do when they, I thought, I thought, well, never mind. But essentially, you know, it's, you know, misconduct and sensual pleasures, not so much wrong. It's just that it doesn't lead to the cessation of suffering, to the cessation of dissatisfaction. So those are the elements of, of action. And he has there, when it comes to speech, there are four kinds of speech which are not helpful, which, which lead to suffering and dissatisfaction. The first is, is speaking falsely, which is not just a matter, you know, we're not talking about whether or not it's right or wrong or should you tell, you know, a little white lie and those kinds. This is not a philosophical thing. The issue here is when you are misrepresenting your true understanding of the way things are, what is, there's a, there's a motivation, there's an intention there. We're back to intention again. I have conversations with my granddaughter about, she's six, about whether exaggeration is a form of lying. We've had that conversation twice. Interesting, you know, to even consider that. Why would you want to exaggerate? You know, usually there's, there's, there's a motive going on. There's an intention there. Maybe puff yourself up a little bit or make something bigger and, you know, more important or, or less important or something other than. But usually that kind of, when you're, when you're speaking in ways that are not in accord with your true understanding, when you're misrepresenting things, there's an intention there. There's a reason. And what we want to do is to become aware of that because that greed, that wanting, whatever it is or the not wanting, whatever it is, is unpleasant in itself and doesn't lead to pleasant things. We'll talk about it in a bit. So false speech, malicious speech, speech which is intended to harm, to cause, to cause pain. And again, it's not just the words, it's not just what's spoken, it's the intention behind it. Out of anger or ill will we wish harm upon another. Harsh speech. Speech that's offensive, you know, to intentionally speak in ways that, that create offense. And, and, and create painful experience for others. And the fourth of the kinds of speech that are not in accord with the Dharma, the fourth is pointless speech. Ever do any of that? Just sort of, you know, just engage the mouth. Gossip and idle chatter and, and usually it's, it's for, you know, there's, there's purposes of, you know, underlying intentions of being friendly, creating some particular kind of experience, which when it doesn't happen of course, or if it doesn't happen the way we want it, or if it happens the way we don't want it, now can lead to dissatisfaction and irritation. So the kinds of speech that the Buddha was talking about that are, that are not in accord with the Dharma, that do enhance dissatisfaction, enhance suffering, enhance unpleasant experience, add to it, and don't attenuate the suffering or the dissatisfaction that we experience. Speaking falsely, harshly, maliciously, and pointlessly. I like the pointless one myself. And then there are, there are three behaviors of the mind. And they're interesting because you can't see them really in another person except, except through a behavior that they perform. The first is any kind of covetousness, wanting, because that leads to, you know, usually what we want is pleasant experience, right? We like the good stuff and we don't like the bad stuff. Anybody got it the other way around? You know, we like pleasant experience. We don't like unpleasant experience. And so when pleasant experience arises, we try to make it last. And we try to create pleasant experience. And we spend most of our time doing that, trying to get what we want, which is more pleasant experience. Sometimes it can be silly. I remember when I was, I just have a very vivid recollection of when I was, I don't know, 10 or 11, getting a piece of chocolate, something that was so good. I thought I had to make it last forever. And so I took such small bites, I couldn't taste it. I realized how futile that was. Covetousness craving, it's the cause of dissatisfaction. It is dissatisfaction in itself. And then ill will or anger is the second, which, you know, anger, sometimes anger makes people feel empowered and strong, but usually it's a counter irritant. It's like scratching a mosquito bite. You know, it actually isn't pleasant. If you really pay attention, it's a counter irritant. And eventually you can tear yourself up. So ill will is the same as a mental intention. So these are the intentions. And the last, the last one is the biggest. It's wrong view, delusion. And this really, in a way, is at the heart of our suffering, because you don't see things as they are. We see things as we in terms of how we'd like them to be. Right view is the first element on the eight four path. When we think that we can make ourselves happy by getting what we want, by chasing what we want, it always makes me realize what a slow learner I am. It's not like any of us have just started out trying this experiment of making ourselves happy by trying to get what we want. Anybody? But we keep doing it. We think things, the Buddha said that the nature of all of our experience is that it's impermanent. It's incapable of being satisfied because it's impermanent and changing. The pleasant stuff is not going to last and the unpleasant stuff is going to come. And it's just an undifferentiated stream of experience. And we think of it as permanent, full of things which are in place. And if something is permanent, it suggests that maybe we can be satisfied. Maybe we can get something hold on to it happily ever after. Not seeing things the way they are is at the heart of our suffering. One of the things that we do, in order to not even notice our own suffering, our own dissatisfaction, we think that the world has got a lot of problems. We're okay. The world's got a lot of problems that need to be fixed. Don't we think that? Anybody here not think that? There's a lot wrong out there. We're okay. In an interesting way, that's the same candle from off-in-flame business because we're so enthralled with the idea that there's something wrong out there that our relationship to it, really, we may think something is wrong, someone else may think it's okay. And we're not noticing that experience of dissatisfaction in ourselves. We're projecting it out onto the world as if it's separate from us. Does that make sense? So what are the things that are wrong with the world? The environment? The mass? Politics? Nuclear weapons? Or nuclear weapons? It's a typo. Everybody's priorities are all messed up, right? We're all messed up. It's all problems out there. And yet the world, in a very real way, couldn't be any different than it is. It couldn't be. This incident couldn't be different than it is, given the incident just before it. And given the incident just before that and before that. So it's unfolded according to law, you know? Like the laws of, I won't say motion, but the laws of the universe. It unfolds in accord with its own nature and couldn't be different than it is. And our relationship to it, you know, we may see things that can be done to reduce the suffering and the unsatisfactory experience of others and ourselves. And we certainly can do those things. But the experience that comes to us is a given. And so our delusion is that fixing the world, setting it up according to our preferences, will make us happy and be satisfying and straighten things out. Delusion doesn't just happen. It's not something that's laid on us. It's something we do. By not seeing things just simply as they are, which is where our practice comes in, where the sitting practice comes in. And where the last three elements of the Eightfold Path come in, where our intention comes in. What are we doing in this practice? What are we here for? The potential here, the Buddha says, is for freedom from that suffering by not making it worse ourselves, by not acting in ways that harm ourselves or others, that make our experience unpleasant. Because when we treat people badly, they don't particularly treat us well in return. We may have noticed it and we may just believe it. But you can notice it when you treat people well. In Davis we had the power and the phones and the heat we're at in our house for a couple days. And when the phone people finally showed up, they were just really cranky. They'd been working 16, 18 hour days and they were used to people screaming at them and complaining. If you treat them nice, boy, they'll just make sure everything works fine and they'll be happy about it. You can just see it in a concrete situation. So karma is about the intention we bring to our practice, to our life off the cushion, to the way we behave. And so when we talk about moral restraint, we talk about not just going with whatever impulse arises in us because all kinds of impulses arise. And not because it's bad, not because there's a judgment involved. We'll pat ourselves on the head if we're good, but because the Buddha uses the phrase of the bliss of blamelessness. And the bliss of blamelessness and the freedom that comes from not trying to pretend that things are different than they are, just to recognize how things are, which is what we are doing when we sit in our practice. We learn that our sensations are our sensations. Our thoughts are just our thoughts. And we can see them without getting lost in them, without assuming that they represent the world the way the world is. So the intention that we bring to any action, to any moment, the intention we bring to every moment determines how we feel about that moment, how we experience that moment. And it determines if what you do is reject painful experience and try to make it go away, you might be successful. Next time unpleasant experience comes again. You'll be right back in the same boat. You get some relief, but not freedom. Not freedom from that reactivity. So the idea here with karma and sila, karma and the moral restraint, which comes directly from an understanding of karma, which underlies the teachings, is that true freedom means not being at the mercy of whatever arises in your life. Which means when it's pleasant, you don't have to try to make it last longer. When it's unpleasant, it will go on its own. And you can work, it's not that you don't need to work to make things more pleasant. The Dalai Lama says about Tibet, he'll do everything he can to free Tibet. And if not, did everything he could. The intention is at the heart. So let me just invite some questions or conversations or thoughts or wonderments because karma is not usually understood just as intention. Maybe some questions, particularly from people who are newer in the practice. This makes sense at all? Or is it just me rambling? Please. So I have a question about real world, I guess not theoretical, but actual experience of helping, which I find in real life is actually a lot more complicated. So the intention to be compassionate to someone who is in pain or suffering or to give someone something who is in desperate need for something is usually a very complicated interaction and often wind up in a lot more suffering afterwards if the other party wants more help. Or I don't know, I mean, there are a whole lot of strange things that follow from one person helping the other person in sort of when there's need. Well, compassion in this instance, compassion, if it balances with wisdom, with seeing what's there, if it's being motivated by a desire to be noticed as a compassionate person, there's self in there. It's not just the compassionate motivation. And it's not that there's anything wrong with that. In almost every action you find yourself engaged in, there's more than one intention going. I mean, you can find yourself at a meeting and your intention at the meeting is, you might say, my intention is to do X. But being at that meeting is maybe your intention is to stay employed. And so you wind up, and to provide support for your family. So it could be a variety of intentions and it could be to appear good in front of the boss. There could be a dozen, two dozen different intentions in any action. And those are the ones that we don't notice. Those are the ones that complicate things because we're acting out on them. Sometimes when we see someone who's suffering, there's a compassionate response to the suffering individual. But there can also be anger if we see someone causing the suffering. So there can be anger directed at someone else. So it is more complicated. And the idea is to become mindful of your intention. Because really that's where we get into trouble with unacknowledged intention. Does that make any sense? Can I disagree? Sure, you certainly may. I mean, I agree that you, I just have seen cases and with people who are particularly empathetic, like my mother is very strongly empathetic. Some people almost react reflexively. They feel other people's emotions and they just like respond. So it's not necessarily that they want something or that they have whatever. It's almost, it's almost reflexive. Right. The impulse can be automatic. In fact, the impulse arises automatically when you experience the suffering of another. Often we don't even experience it. Someone can be suffering and we don't notice because we're so beguiled by our own needs and wants. But you know, you can be compassionate for you can you can experience the suffering of someone and then say, well, you know what you need to do. And then you've got a whole program of activity for them to do, which really is your own idea. And so, you know, that's that's and seeing your own idea implemented may not be the same thing as a compassionate resonance with with the suffering. So if you're right, it's very it's complicated. And the idea is to see it as clearly as you can because because then you can keep yourself from getting trapped. No. Please. Please. Well, here we go. Yeah. Well, I was thinking what you were saying about the complicatedness of helping because another factor is sometimes, you know, there might be someone who has some big need of some kind of help. But then you have to measure whether if you jumped in to be the big solution to their problem, whether you're going to overdo it and end up throwing your own situation into some kind of worse jeopardy or something. It's certainly possible to write. That's that's why I say if you balance it with wisdom and wisdom, which means seeing things, seeing clearly just as it is compassion in the context of wisdom is OK and not not as dangerous as if you're just, you know, why you know, this story about the woman who brings takes the snake in and the snake bites her. And yeah, you know, I was a snake. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So I thought I had some woman was she needs some people. She keeps trying to find some people to help do some big major roof repair on her house. So then she keep was asking me, do I know of any volunteer organizations or something that could help her? And then I thought, oh, maybe me and some of my friends could help. But we kind of had to realize that that would just be more than we would be able to do. You know, and then I felt guilty about it at first. Well, if you do everything, you can. Now, if your intention is is is open. Yeah. Well, thanks. Yeah. Anything else, please. I just want to thank you so much for that. I can ponder on this for a couple of days. I don't know how long, but for a while. But the delusion around seeing the problems outside. To me, the logical next step would be to question, OK, so what's messed up or screwed up inside of me instead of out there, what's going on in here? Right. But that's a little harsh. So I guess I'm wondering what are the maybe other top. Other greatest hits in terms of delusions that you've seen in your experience. Let me let me let me just let me just let me just reflect. It's not so much that what's screwed up is out there and we're going to say, OK, now look at what's screwed up in here. The issue isn't what's right and what's wrong. You want to look and see just simply whether whatever is present is pleasant or unpleasant. And what your reaction to that is, is your reaction to the pleasant or the unpleasant to to make things worse or to attenuate the unpleasant experience, the suffering or the resistance to the way things are. So it's not a matter of let's look at how screwed up I am in here. True and false. You know, here's here's almost the top of the top 10 list is to notice how we talk about pleasant and unpleasant and we don't usually think in terms of our thinking or thoughts. So an unpleasant thought can get us just as angry, if not more than an unpleasant physical sensation or an unpleasant physical sensation, sound, odor, color, whatever. But a thought, you know, if you turn on the angry talk show people, they'll like you right up in a minute, you know, because. And what's that about? That's unpleasant. That's just an unpleasant thought. And what is are we? I know people who are unable to listen to our president. So are we where are we free then if we're unable to even do something simple like that because we're so reactive. So I would say that, you know, looking at. Well, thoughts are the heart of our delusions. We make we mistake the thought about the world with the world. We think the map is the territory. In fact, we're unable to distinguish it. So the old Zen trick about what is this? Call it a stick and I'll smack you with it. Say it's not a stick and I'll smack you with it. What is it? Because we think that the label is the thing. This is a stick for crime. Now, what do you mean? We aren't able to. And we don't. We there's there's a sense of permanence to the concept. Think of an equilateral triangle. You guys know what one of those is. OK. So it came up in your mind just then. Was that the same equilateral triangle you thought of last time it came up? But there's a sense somehow that it is. You know, we got this platonic thing going about, you know, there's this. Permanent realm. And it's the same with our thoughts about ourselves. We have ideas about who we are and what we're like and what we've been. These are all thoughts. And we we we think the thoughts are are representative of. Now. Of of the reality. We have a thought of a unicorn. There is no such thing except in Harry Potter. And there's a, you know, some teacher who said once the word mother, M.O.T.H.E.R. is not your mother. The word is not the thing. And yet we act as if it is. That's that's the hugest delusion that I know. And that's, you know, suffering becomes a a a problem of language at that point, because we assume that. I'm cold. Just because the syntax is set up that way, we think that that why not just cold? Now, what about it's raining? What's rain? Because because the way our brain works, the syntax is set up so that we think there's got to be a subject. So that's that that help. Please. How about other people's intention? You talked about different intention at the same time. When something is complicated or gets complicated, then there are a lot of intentions that you you're talking about your own intention. How about if you you're mindful of others intention? And that could be wrong. Couldn't could be, you know, delusion. But sometimes it's proved that. Let's assume it is. And our own, you know, our own delusion makes it impossible to see clearly the delusion of others. But but because it's it's not always possible to read the mind of another. You know what I mean? So we we could very well be wrong about their intention. So it's and generally when when we recognize how complex the constellation of intentions that are brought to bear on any particular action are for us, boy, trying to sort that out for someone whose mind we can't get into. But we like to attribute intentions to others. Well, I know what you're trying to do. You're done. We have no clue. So the best we can do is to be really clearly in touch with our own intention. And if our intention is one of greed, it will feel very different than if our intention is the opposite one of generosity. It will feel different and it will produce different results. I mean, if you think about an experience in your life where you were just spontaneously generous, you can reflect on that and it feels good to recall that. And you can you can reflect on some sometime when you were greedy. Anybody here not have any of that? You know, and you reflect on that and just see how that feels to recall that. And it's just unpleasant. And then, of course, we judge ourselves for that. So knowing our own intention is is the best we can do. I think if we think we know what someone else is trying to do, sometimes we don't even know what we're trying to do. And then the purpose of knowing our intentions are to observe it and it would go away or would change it. Well, if you actually see what you're trying to do, it may change of itself. If you try to change it, there's another intention there. I want a different intention. I don't like that intention. Great, thank you. I think that one of the issues people have been sort of talking around or about is when you approach a situation with your best intentions, let's assume that they're clear in your mind and you're proceeding in good faith. People have an aversion to being manipulated or taken advantage of. Feel a sense of trying to guess motivations of the other people involved. And then if they feel like that's happening, they lose a sense of where their bounds are. They may have entered into something and not know where their bounds are. Boy, there's a lot of wanting in there. Yeah, so it's very difficult in a situation like when you're trying to help somebody or whatever. And sometimes you don't know what your own bounds are and what you're willing to do. Absolutely. There's all sorts of guilt that can come up that you can do on yourself by saying, oh, this isn't enough. Well, why isn't it enough? It's like, do you have the skills to do more? Do you have the resources to do more? This is what the Buddha called the thicket of views. So we get totally lost in that. Yeah, and I think that part of understanding and observing and being aware of what's happening is also being aware of what your own needs and bounds are so that you can not overextend yourself and not, if somebody else comes back and tries to manipulate, you can say, thank you, no. Well, if you can write, people manipulate each other with carrots and sticks, which is just another way of talking about pleasant and unpleasant. Okay. So, you offer pleasant or threaten, hoping for the politics of hope and fear. It's the same thing. So, you know, to not be manipulated means to be a quantumist with whatever arises and not find that you have to react. And the purpose of our practice is to see more deeply because, you know, until we start turning our attention inward rather than just outward, we don't even notice that to begin with. So, yeah, it takes a while to learn. It's the most complex learning we can do. So. I just wanted to say that I think that if we are conscious of the fact that we may be being manipulated by another person, it seems that the most, the wisest position to take in that stance would be to have compassion for that person because we've all been there and we all basically manipulate for power, you know, to some degree. We all have our own ways of doing that because we all have our own needs and we all have our own, you know, issues that we grew up with or wherever we came from. And so if we can just have compassion for ourselves, it would allow us the opportunity to have compassion for the person who is or, you know, in the power struggle with us, trying to manipulate us. And then it basically stops it in this tracks. It just basically diffuses So having compassion for yourself is certainly worthwhile. And to notice, just notice how frequently we do just the reverse, that we jump to judgment about ourselves and how harshly we judge ourselves just internally. Now most, you know, I know that I will, I'm willing to think things about myself and even mutter things to myself at times that I wouldn't let anybody else say. I mean, them fighting words if somebody else says it, but I can, I can get away with it. You know what I mean? And the tendency there is not just to when that arises, notice, notice that it's arising. You can respond to that with aversion and add another layer of stress and suffering or you can just be compassionate for yourself at that moment. And that's the moment. That's a moment of freedom. And sometimes it's a very difficult thing to do it. Compassion for yourself. Absolutely. You know, one, one thing that about this practice, I know Joseph Goldstein likes to say, being mindful isn't hard. Remembering to be mindful is hard from second to second. So being compassionate isn't hard, but but remembering anyone else. Did you? Yeah, please. So on the note of compassion, sometimes I struggle with, sometimes I struggle with how to be compassionate without being judged as being selfish because in my profession, I mean, I give, I mean, that's what I do is patients come to me and I'm expected to give. And so with families, sometimes when I'm like, okay, you know, I want to go away on a retreat or I want to do something on my own and just be by myself to reflect culturally, sometimes it's considered selfish. But so that's where I struggle a lot with what's considered compassionate, compassion for the self versus not having others view it as selfish. And I, and I realize that it's a practice that I just need to come to terms with on my own and not, you know, to take the self out of the picture. And even if someone else looks at me and says, you know, you're selfish, or you're looking at the self, if I take the self out of it, then I, I don't take it personally, and I don't get offended. But sometimes it's hard to do. It's hard. Let me, let me clarify a little bit. The Buddha's definition of compassion is it's the, it's just simply the quivering of the heart and the presence of suffering. It's just that resonance with the suffering. So everything else that you build on the edifice about this is what's compassionate to me. This is what's compassionate to them. This is it's, it's only that simple resonance. And then action flows automatically. If a baby is crying, you just pick it up. Right. It's just, it just happens. Somebody stumbles on the street. You don't even have time to think you just reach out. It just happens. Then we get into the complexity of rationalizations and this thought, you know, the realms of thought and thinking and delusion. And, you know, this is what's good for me. This is what I need. This is their needs, my needs, our needs, human needs, you know, and believing all of that, those thoughts. But, but the, the compassion itself is just, and, and when we don't see it in others, I mean, all of us here, our lives are the same in some important ways. Unless anybody's, anybody here just getting the good stuff? You know, so we're all experiencing that and we don't see it when we look around the room. But when as soon as you see it, the heart just opens and it happens automatically, in my experience. Is that, that helpful? Anyone else? Please. I don't know what time you guys turn, I'll turn into pumpkins. So, so if you, if you feel like you need to flee, please, please go, please. And I'm happy to hang out as long as you guys want. Please go ahead. Is it off? Oh. It's broken. It needs to be fixed. Yeah. of the state of someone you feel like, well I'm not okay, but the world really needs help too. And I wonder if this Buddhism is credited to women, the first time that I heard suffering equated with this satisfaction, and I wonder if there's any advice for someone who wants to compare when suffering to another's satisfaction. Ah, we like to compare because it gives us something to stand on, it gives us some certainty, it gives us a standard, we want a standard so that we can judge, you know, and this is also very fluid. Just notice the sensation, the experience itself, the experience of the world, your knowledge of the world and what's going on. We don't want to feel sad, we don't want to feel the pain of the world, and so we cover it over with anger, we cover it over with judgment. The idea here is just to experience the dissatisfaction, just to notice it. First, that's the first thing, and we don't notice it because we think it's the problem that's out there. If people would just be reasonable, and I know what reasonable is, reasonable, common sense, then we could fix things. In the meantime, we're not paying attention to the experience of dissatisfaction because the world couldn't be different than it is at this moment. It's just simply the way it is, it's just like this, and if we're not at peace with it, we're not at peace. Gertrude Stein was, oh my gosh, okay, I'm totally lost in these, but I think it was Gertrude Stein who was dying and said, you know, I accept the world, and her partner said, well, I accept the universe, and it will do better. No, we just don't, we don't pay attention to our own sadness over the condition of things, and that sadness is just a reflection of how it's not the way we want. It's not the way we want in very deep ways, and that's what the Buddha is pointing at with the first noble truth, and when we look for peace of mind, when we come to practice for, you know, sometimes we come thinking we're going to fix all our problems, you know, or somehow, but when we can see our reactivity, what we add, the suffering that we add to a situation, by the way we make it worse, we can just stop, and then we at least don't make unpleasant experience pleasant. Unpleasant experience comes with the territory. You got a body, your body's going to hurt one way or another, some one time or another, but we can, you know, when we experience that, we can tear our hair, become anxious, get upset, rant and rave, you know, all kinds of reactions, or we can just be with the pain, deal with it, and not make it worse, and the suffering is the making it worse part. I think I understand how you can make things worse by, I understand and I said I can't reiterate it, however, I still don't understand how giving up peace with oneself makes anything, like how you cannot compare that to someone else's suffering in a different realm, that is just objectively, you know, and that's not good stuff. Well, when you see suffering, that response within you, that's the compassionate response, and then you do what you can to relieve suffering, that's what you do. That's what, I mean, we do do that, we just often don't see it, because, you know, there's a great little aphorism that there was a time for a period of about six months, every time I would give a talk I would use this aphorism, because I love it so much, and it's just a thrill to be able to use it again. It's from India and it goes, when a pickpocket meets a saint, he only sees the saint's pockets. So we don't see the saint, we don't see the suffering being, you know, we see someone as pushy, this person is pushy, but maybe what we're looking at is someone who's suffering from not enough recognition, even acknowledgement, but because we experience being pushed at, and we see it in terms of ourselves, we don't see the suffering there, it doesn't mean it's not there. So what we want to do is to just look at the experience itself directly, and notice that experience. Not try to push it away, not try to hold on to it, not make the chocolate brownie last, you know, all night. Oh, there's, but that's judgment. That's judgment. That's not that. Notice what you're doing there is making a judgment about your own experience. So just notice the judging. What is judging? Why? Is that pleasant? Is that judgment itself pleasant? Is it helpful? Does it, does it create more dissatisfaction in and of itself? You just watch it. It doesn't. Well, if you don't know, that's helpful. When you, you know, the one who's diluted and thinks he's not diluted. That's real delusion. So at least if you don't know, or if you, if you know that you're diluted, that's helpful too. Because then you, then, then you don't trust this. You know, the idea is to, is to examine it. You're sitting during your meditation. Sometimes those things will come up and you'll notice them and you'll be able to notice pleasant unpleasant. You'll notice that they arise and they pass and you'll notice anger and you'll notice longing and sadness and all those things will appear. And we'll be, you can develop skill at noticing just what's arising. Now is the more you do it, the better you get. And is that, is that helpful? Yeah. Good. Well. Sure. suffering suffer, period. And the comparison is in service of something else, some other intention, to be righteous somehow or to be justified, but it's in the service of another intention. Is there a need to compare? It's what we do it. And it's one of the last things the Buddha says is one of the last things to go. So it's going to be with us for a while. That comparison, that judgment. And it seems to me also that you can never really understand somebody else's suffering. And what their experience of something is truly. You know, you certainly, well, you can't, you don't experience their neurology, but in order to even perceive their suffering, it's necessary to be able to perceive your own. And so when you think I'm not suffering, but the world is a mess, we're not noticing our own dissatisfaction with the messy world. I guess what I'm trying to speak to is this little valley of emotion. You are your, you can only experience your own experiences. You can't experience something else's experiences. That's correct. And so, you see somebody else who has a misfortune and you feel empathy for them and that's good, but at the same time it seems to me that it's important to understand that that's not you. You can understand what your reaction is, what you feel about what you deserve, their own. But that's your reaction. Well, as opposed to you're not responsible for what they're dealing with. You don't know what they're dealing with. If someone is crying on the street and there's some there's resonance, there can be resonance or there might be no resonance. You might go off, what are they doing on the street in the first place? They ought to be cleaning themselves up and getting a job. And maybe what do they do? They're probably drunk and whatever. And he can go off on that stuff and not even encounter the sadness, the pain. Please. Thank you guys for coming as you as you head out. Thank you for your practice. It seems like a lot of this awareness of kind of the suffering or the problems out there in the world have to do with this whole predominance of mass media that's only occurred in the last 50, 80 years. So it seems like it's almost unnatural for us to be so aware of so much suffering in the world. And so it's almost like if it's localized as it was a hundred, two hundred years ago, then it's more able to be dealt with maybe? This kind of comparison may not be particularly helpful. If you were living, you know, 500 years ago, you probably had immediate family members, a lot of them who died while you were young, you know, and a lot of sickness and a lot of disability and just a lot of intense loss. So it's very different and we can't even imagine. So to make that comparison, I'm not sure how helpful it is. It might make us feel better. It's not our fault, but suffering isn't about fault. I mean, the Buddha was said, he formulated the Four Noble Truths 2500 years ago. So he may not have been able to drive a Jeep and he may not have experienced road rage, but he has just understood suffering. I've come across in my very beginning reading something to the extent all emotion is suffering. And I'm having difficulty understanding that. Understanding that? It's not, it's, let me say this, the Buddha was not trying to lay out a map that he said, here's how it is, learn it. This is not a catechism. What he was doing was describing the terrain that he saw as the result of his practice. And so his invitation to you is, check it out. Check it out yourself and see just what these emotions are about. How pleasant are they? What are they about? What is your experience of them? Do you want them to continue? Do you want them to end? If it's something you want to have last, I want this to keep going. There's desire there because, you know, of course it won't. Could it be framed as all attachment to emotion and suffering? Well, you know, that's an interest. That's a really interesting question. There's a, there's a, a very famous, it's very famous poem. One of his end patriarchs, the line, the couplet is, is really well known. It goes, the great way is not difficult for one who has no preferences. And there are people who want to say, the great way is not difficult for one who's not attached to preferences because preferences arise and pass. And then it may be, may be possible to say, for the one who has no preferences, the great way is not difficult. Who is that who has no preferences? And that sounds like a Zen Cohen, but it's pointing at something. Something. But, but, but the idea here is that the Buddha is asking you to look and see because then when you look and see, you'll, you'll know for yourself. Is any emotion satisfying? Satisfactory? Well, thank you and thank you for your practice.
