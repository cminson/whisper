 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.adiodarma.org. Welcome. Welcome to this community of meditators gathering for what we in California call the 7 a.m. sitting in Dharma talk. At the beginning of the pandemic, the first months or two of the sheltering in place, it was remarkable how quiet this local city became and how you could hear sounds that I normally didn't hear. There were sounds of birds that were kind of like, oh, there are so many birds here. And normally those sounds are drowned out. And maybe you've been in situations where, you know, something became quiet and you could hear things. Maybe it's the quiet that happens when the refrigerator hums, stops, and you can somehow hear the quiet or hear other things. Or there are times when the haze or the smog in the air has cleared out. And here where I live, we can sometimes see across the San Francisco Bay. And it's surprising how close the hills are on the other side. When the air is clear. So in meditation, when the noise of the mind quiet down, when the haze veils that over our eyes, our inner eyes, our perception clears, it's surprising what we can see and hear and feel within ourselves. And so part of meditation is to see the noise, the thinking, the attitudes, the agitation, all these things that make it difficult to see. But from time to time, meditation supports the humming of the refrigerator turns off. The city in within us becomes quiet. And we can feel and hear and sense something we normally can't. And what is it that we sense? What is it we feel that's normally obscured by the busyness, the loudness of our ordinary life? And of course, that's an answer for each of us to answer for ourselves. So to begin our meditation, to place your body in a posture that might allow the agitation, the busyness to settle. Maybe there's a posture you can take that's relaxed, that maybe has some qualities of being peaceful and settled. And in a peaceful way to lower your gaze and not looking at anything in particular, slowly and peacefully, letting your eyes close. And without doing much else, not changing your breathing, notice how it feels to be breathing right now. Letting your attention roam around the torso to feel the movements of breathing, the sensations, the rhythm. And where in your body can you feel the body breathing in a tranquil and peaceful way? Maybe it's not your usual place to notice breathing. Maybe for a few moments it's to be aware of the movements in your back rib cage or the very subtle movements of your spine. Maybe there's a little bit of tranquility or peace for a moment at the beginning of the exhale. Or at the end of the exhale. And as you sit here, as you meditate, is there beginning of a little bit of calming, calm or tranquility simply sitting here. Feeling, perceiving a global experience of your body, noticing where there's agitation and tension. Noticing it with some gentleness. And letting the body relax as you exhale. And with gentle care, be aware of any agitation or noise or busyness in the mind. Gently, caringly, be aware of it. And on the exhale, perhaps letting the mind, thinking mind, relax. And as you would let the mind be, thinking mind, be quiet to listen to a sound, faint sound in the distance. Let a thinking mind be quiet so you can feel and sense the dynamic flow of sensations in your body. Maybe the subtle sensations, subtlest sensations of the body, vibrating, humming. The deepest feeling of aliveness. Where your body both generates sensations of the body just being here. The background, deeper sensations always here. Just being alive and the energies humming vibrations. There rises out of the body and is received by the body, known in the body. And in the middle of all that, there's those sensations of the body breathing. Maybe almost as if breathing arises out of and returns from the subtle sensations of the lived body. Gently, riding the sensations of breathing as if you're being lifted and lowered by swells of water that you're floating in. Riding the exhale all the way to the last sensation associated with exhaling. And from that last sensation, receive the upwelling movement of sensations of inhaling. Breathing. with a deeper hum or vibration or flow of sensations in the body like the current that moves through the river of the body and the breathing as gentle swells waves coming and going in that current. And then as we come to the end of the sitting to let something within you become quiet so that you can remember some experience in your life of care someone caring for you in a peaceful way or you caring for someone or for some animal. And what is care like? What is love like if it arises from the place inside that's quiet and peaceful that maybe is only felt when the mind is quiet nothing flashy maybe love and care that is free of desire a tender appreciation and from the place inside where maybe love or cares most innate or quiet peaceful to let your goodwill flow out of there out into the world as if it radiates and that it carries the words out with it into the world. And may all beings be happy may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful and may all beings be free of love. Thank you.
