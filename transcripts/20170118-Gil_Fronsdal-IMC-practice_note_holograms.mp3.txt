Practice Note : Holograms

Imagine that there’s a hologram that uses lasers and 
lights to create a very realistic image of that which you 
want the most … or that which you want the least…  or 
that which you’re most afraid of. It just hovers there, and 
if you try to approach it and grab it, you’re unable to . 
You try again, but it moves around a little bit, so you 
reach for it , and reach for it. Or you try to get away from 
it, but somehow it has a sensor con nected to your 
smartphone , and it  follows you around wherever you go. 
You can’t get away from it , and it seems so frightening 
and dangerous. It’s the most frightening thing you know 
– right there . Every once in a while  you th row a rock at 
it, but the rock just goes through the hologram. There’s 
no resistance to the rock.  But y ou’re always concerned 
about  the hologram.  
 
We make our own holograms , and we live in them.  We 
create our stories, ideas, and projections about this life 
we live. Especially with stories and ideas – we interpret 
and make things up about things that aren’t happening, 
things we’re afraid of, things we want, and people we 
encounter. I think a fair percentage of the time, we don’t 
really encounter the person whom we’re encountering, but rather we’re encountering stories about them – our 
ideas or projections about them, or our fears and 
desires. When we create these holograms that we try to 
hold onto or react to, they’re not really there. The stories 
are not really there – they’re like holograms.  
 
In order to retain a hologram, we have to keep 
generating stories and ideas.  That brings us up into our 
head, into our fantasies. It has us  leaning forward or 
away from our experience  – as opposed to being 
grounded and c entered in our exper ience here  – 
grounded h ere in this body, with our feet touching the 
ground, our bottom s touching the chairs, feeling 
ourselves upright, breathing, our heart s pulsing.  
 
The physical experience of the leaf blowers buzzing 
outside right now is not a hologram – it’s a physical, 
direct experience. That’s a place where we can come to 
rest. We can settle back , and be here in a more relaxed 
way because it’s not a construction. T here’s no effort to 
create an idea and keep it going.  
 
If you turn off the electricity to the machine that makes 
the hologram, it disappears. If you turn off the machine 
that’s making stories, or if you see the stories as just 
stories, then we’re not caug ht in them , reacting to them, 
fighting  them,  or holding onto them.  
 
As you’re practicing here this morning, you might notice how often you’re relating to a story, an interpretation, or 
an idea of what’s going on. It could be a story that has 
nothing to do with what’s happening here, such as 
something in the past or the future . Or it could be about 
something that’s here  – sometimes that’s the most 
insidious. Because it’s happening here, we think that  
our stories about what  we’re interpreting or see ing are 
accurate, but we’re really in a hologram.  
 
Mindfulness practice – our ability to be centered , 
grounded, relaxed, at ease, and at peace in this world – 
is tremendously supported by learning how to switch 
away  from reacting to , living in , and relating to  the 
holograms made by the mind.  If you can manage to flip 
the switch, that’s even better.  
 
You might notice this today as you go about. Whenever 
there’s a story, an idea, an interpretation, or a 
judgement, think of it as a hologram. See how that 
supports  your practice today.   
 
Thank you.
