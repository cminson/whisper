 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So today we'll continue the reflections on Sila, virtualized behavior. And today I'll speak about the second precept, undertaking the training rules of not taking what is not given to us. Or maybe a simpler kind of translation for that is undertaking the training rules of abstaining from stealing. And so again, I wanted to explore this from the perspective of the inside out kind of orientation. I invited you to sense into that inner integrity and inner dignity in our meditation. And so we will explore that from that place and see how we relate to them through maybe the expressions of those. And again, I'll use this triple A framework that we talked about, aware, abstain and align. Aware of the inner dynamics, inner forces within us. And learn to discern the wholesome, skillful versus that is not. And we abstain from the unwholesome, unskillful and we cultivate, align with the wholesome qualities instead. And so in the last few minutes of our meditation, I invited you to check in to this quality of contentment and ease as we were cultivating mindful awareness. The kind of contentment that's not pulled or pushed away by the forces of a wanting and greed aversion solutions. And so we know, as we meditate, that the act of grasping or being aversive to something easily take us out of that kind of a contentment and a well being. And so in this way, the second precept that we're going to explore today, abstaining from not taking what is not offered to us, is coming from a place of non grasping, non cleaning, non aversion, free of a fear. We all know sometimes a fear will drive us to take what is not given to us. We've all probably seen this in the pandemic. When we're fearful of running out of certain kinds of resources. We can grasp grasp more than what we might need. So of course, this particular precept is about to a one degree, not stealing that and not engaging or participating in kind of full blown criminal criminal acts like robbing banks and, you know, stealing expensive jewelry or personal information online. Now, of course, you know, I think all of us don't do that. Right. And yet, as a training, as a training in support of liberation and freedom. And this precepts is also inviting us to look into the subtle, the small impulses, and maybe sometimes a big impulses of grasping, cleaning aversion in our inner being. And so it invites us to maybe become aware of the areas that sometimes we may overlook. And this is where the cultivation of awareness come in. And we began to pay attention to our activities during the day, our movements in our mind. And, you know, I just use a few examples that many of you might relate to. And so, for example, what about taking a piece of the paper from work. What about taking a pen or pencil from work. What about taking an extra plate of food out of a buffet table, even though they're offered to us. So some of this maybe we act out of wanting to be convenient. Isn't it convenient to kind of sometimes just take a piece of paper, you know, what, you know, not not a such a big deal right. And I remember for myself. Many years ago I was printing out a personal thing at work. I thought it was convenient, right and faster printer and on the way back driving downhill from work. I remember this action and then all of a sudden I thought my whole body was on easy. It was a felt sense of something off in my body. And when it was a powerful moment for me I realized that, oh, this kind of actions have an impact on me. And there's a due cut in this. And so I vowed not to do this ever again. But I think it's important to recognize that there are some modern day societies that we all live in today. And there, you know, we're all driven by the convenience and comfort. And maybe we take a moment to kind of reflect a little bit convenience and comfort are quite related to each other. And so we're all driven by the obsession of convenience and comfort. And the tricky thing about living in our modern day societies, things are interdependent in so many ways. Leaning into convenience and comfort for generations to come. Maybe it's the next generation that feels the impact. And for example, you know, this days I know there is a Black Friday for those who live here in the United States, Cyber Monday. And I don't know what today is. Hopefully it's something good. And all of this, we can just push a few buttons on our computers and things will show up at the doorstep. And they're even cheaper, right? Why not get two or three of something, anything, shoes and clothes and games and whatever. When it's cost of a win, right? Why not? And so this is why it's important to become aware of our inner dynamics. To begin to become aware of this kind of impulses. Someone is typing in, giving Tuesday. I love that. I hope this is a good one. We'll talk about the giving in just a few moments. I wanted to point out that as we cultivate awareness for this specific precept, we can begin to tune in and recognize the difference between needs versus wanting or wants. A need for me, at least in here today, in the way that I'm going to share, needs are related to some form of care and care for our body, our mind. Knowing what's appropriate in our body needs food, needs shelter and medicine. It comes out of a sense of care and wisdom. And so we want to take care of this body and others. Wanting, wanting is a form of agreed. It comes out of a sense of discontentment with what's here happening right now. And so something else must happen. So many forms of violations and breach of the second precept are based on wanting. Strong desire operating underneath. So this precept invites us to abstain, abstain from acting out of the impulse impulses and abstain from taking what is not given and begin to align more and more with our sense of inner contentment and ease. So this speaks to the other side of not taking what is, the other side of taking what is not offered to us is to align with wholesome qualities and cultivating DANA. So today is Giving Tuesday. Wonderful. So the perfect timing for this. Cultivating generosity, giving, cultivating contentment and ease, simplicity of our being. In the meditation, some of you might have felt some sense of this. When we're content, not driven by some of the underlying impulses of jumping out of where we sit, our heart is open and soft. So this is a sense of meditating like wind doesn't have to be just sitting here meditating. But as we go about our lives, can we be meditative like the wind? Anything comes through the wind is not horrified, repelled, disgusted. So why open free air here? Sense of freedom here. And so the pleasant unpleasant context and sensations were not kind of get us caught. So again, I've been talking about cultivating the sense of a sealer as a form of a blessing. So today I'll end with a few words from this Mankla Suta again. And I talk about what the highest blessings are. So here it says, giving and righteous conduct, contentment and gratitude. This is the highest blessing. So may you all faith in inner integrity, the inner dignity. May the expression of your virtuous conduct benefit all beings. So thank you for being here, everyone. I'm just delighted to share this space and this time with you all and we'll continue tomorrow. So have a wonderful rest of the Giving Tuesday for those of you who are still in Tuesday. Take care, everybody.
