Practice Note: Can You Relax Your 
Thinking Muscle?

One of the things that many people take as a challenge 
for their meditation and mindfulness practice  is their 
thinking . The reason for this is that it’s , more often than 
not, our absorption in our thinking that pull us away from 
being present. Sometimes, p eople have an adversarial 
relationship with their thoughts because they want to be 
present . They want to be present with the breath, or to 
just be present, and their thinking takes them away.  
 
What we try to do in this practice is to not have an 
adversari al relationship with anything. Rather, we try to 
learn how to do aikido or judo with whatever’s going on. 
My understanding of the principle of judo or aikido is 
that you work with what’s going on rather than against it. 
Someone comes and is going to hit you, and rather than 
resisting the force of their hit, you go along with it . You 
take it , and pull it along, and use their momentum to 
maybe throw them off balance. Being mindful of  our 
thinking is not meant to be a fight. The idea  is that  we 
turn towards what’s going on, and somehow engage, or 
are present for what’s happening, so that the energy, the force of it, is not something that we’re opposed to, 
but actually becomes something  that can be 
transformed into something that’s more useful for us.   
 
When thinking is repetitive  and we’re really caught up in 
it, it’s useful  to clearly turn towards it , and be very 
present for it  – to look at it directly and see it for what it 
is. You c an use t he mental note, “Thinking , thinking ” – 
but n ot casually. Sometimes meditators do this casually , 
as if th ey are  trying to brush it off and get back to where 
the real thing is. But to consciously  and clearly 
acknowledge, “Thinking.  Thinking is happening now, ” or 
“This is what thinking is like. ” Really see it, and 
acknowledge it, in a full clear way.  
 
When  we are fu lly there  and present for it, one of the 
most useful things to do, if you can, is to feel what 
thinking is like . What does this  phenomen on, the activity 
of thinking , feel like  for you:  physically, energetically, 
and emotionally ? 
 
One of the things I’ve fou nd very useful is to turn 
towards the bodily location where the thinking seems to 
occur. If people are thinking in words, then there’s often 
a loud speaker somewhere in the body, which is 
projecting or speaking those words. Some people have 
a sense that there’s no location at all . But there’s 
usually someplace where the loud speaker is, or where 
the antenna that picks up the sounds is. Or there  are images ; some people think more in images. Th en 
there’s a place where the re’s the  screen where those 
images are projected , because you  are looking and 
you’re seeing the images someplace.  
 
Sometimes by locating the activity of thinking , and then, 
once you’ve located it, you feel that phenomen on, as if 
there’s a muscle that’s doing the thinking. Feel what it’s 
like. Feel yourself into it. Is there any pressure, or 
tension, that seems to come together with the thinking 
you’re doing? Is there any agitation that seems to come 
with it?  
 
Really feel. Take your time to really feel the pressur e; 
feel the tension ; feel the agitation . And then, as you go 
back to your breathing, check in with your breath and 
relax. See if you can soften that thinking muscle, 
because with almost all thinking, especially if it’s 
repetitive or strong enough to get yo u caught up in it, 
there’s going to be some physical pressure, tension, or 
strain that comes along with it. Sometimes it’s in the 
place where you do your thinking . Sometimes it’s 
someplace else in your body . It might be in the belly . If 
you can then soften  and relax the thinking muscle, then 
you’re much less likely to start thinking again, because if 
the pressure is still  there , it is ready to produce more 
thoughts. If you let go of your thoughts  without relaxing 
the pressure, th at pressure is going to spin  out more 
thoughts.   
Look around and see what can you relax in your 
thinking muscle, if that vocabulary works for you. For 
some people, i t could be in the brain, the forehead, 
inside the skull, or around  the eyes. Sometimes it can 
be in the shoulders or t he belly. Is there some tension or 
pressure in the body that ’s associated with this 
thinking? And then soften it ; relax.  
 
Look at thinking directly. Recognize it’s there ; 
acknowledge it’s there. Find out where it might be in the 
body  – some place physical that you can soften and 
relax. Then go back to your breathing. Or go back to 
your steps as you do the walking meditation.
