So then, I would like to introduce Ajahn Amaro and Joseph Bobro Roshi.
Ajahn Amaro trained in Thailand with Ajahn Chah and with Ajahn Sumedo at Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in England.
He's the co-abid of Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery, a branch monastery of the forest meditation tradition,
and that's in Mendocino County, and he resides there in a small monastic community.
Ajahn Amaro has led retreats with teachers from both the Mahayana and the Vajrayana traditions
and has written a book, Small Boat, Great Mountain, in which he reflects on the interfaces of Buddhist traditions today.
Among many other things, he tells his usual and illimitable anecdotes in that book too.
That's a lot of fun to read.
Joseph Bobro Roshi is a Zen master and the founder of Deep Streams Institute.
He's a Dharma successor of Robert Aitken Roshi in the Diamond Sangha lineage of Zen.
Joseph also studied with Yamada Koun Roshi of Sanbou Kiodan with headquarters in Kamakura, Japan.
In the early 1980s, he lived and studied with Thich Nhat Hanh in Plum Village, where he co-translated Thay's guide to walking meditation.
Joseph is also a clinical psychologist and he writes on Zen and the interplay of Buddhism and Western psychology.
The institute he founded, Deep Streams Institute's mission is practice, study, and service.
It offers Zen Buddhist practice, including Koan study, provides interdisciplinary study of Buddhism, Western psychology, the creative arts, and contemporary science.
And it also serves the community in San Francisco and the Bay Area through the Coming Home Project, a healing community program for Iraq veterans and their families.
So, let Ajahn Amaro and Joseph Bobro Roshi continue with the day for us. Thank you.
Thank you very much for helping make this day possible to the Sati Center and to Insight Meditation Center and to all of you for coming.
We thought this morning that we'd each speak for approximately an hour and then have some questions and then break for lunch at around noon.
I want to invite you not to be shy when you ask questions. There's a long tradition in all the schools of Buddhism of lively dialogue.
And although we're Buddhists, we can also enjoy some of our differences, some of our diversity.
And so please feel free to join in the dialogue after we both spoken.
Non-duality.
We say in Zen, not two, not even one.
We can even say not three, not two, not even one. What would the three be?
Well, you can really take your pick, but I think of it as the observer, the observed, and the observation.
In Buddhism, we cultivate the capacity to observe very closely in a very nuanced and powerful way.
And yet there may be more to Buddhism, more to life, more to the Dharma than simply the process of observation,
which by its very nature has an element of subject and object.
So why not one?
By one here, the title of our day refers to unity.
Unity is a marvelous thing, equality, oneness.
But it doesn't quite capture at least the way that I think about non-duality, although it's certainly a critical element.
So we say not two, not even one.
So today we'll be exploring non-duality and the ideas we have and how those ideas can open terrain for us to explore.
And they can also narrow the terrain.
Even ideas about non-duality, depending on how they're used, can be an obstacle to experiencing non-duality.
I've taught before with Ajahn Amro, and I know that most of you know him.
I very much look forward to a free-wheeling, personal, lively day of stories, teachings, and dialogue.
Without further ado, Ajahn Amro.
Lovely to see many familiar faces and to be here at IMC again.
Also obviously a few unfamiliar faces meeting for the first time.
And hopefully through the course of the day, many of the things that are spoken of or referred to will help to catalyze a quality of peace,
a quality of understanding, a quality of liberation.
It's important in a way to bear in mind.
The motivation for the whole thing, all of this Buddhism business, is to realize these fundamental possibilities,
these qualities that are here before us via the human condition.
And so that hopefully the things that Roshi, Joseph, and I say during the course of the day will not give rise to more confusion,
more kind of burdenness, or more doubt, or complication.
Obviously when there's a lot of words around, things can get a little bit clogged.
And I tend to, myself, I have a tendency towards prolificity, abundance, overabundance of verbiage.
So I don't intend to make the day a kind of blizzard of syllables that people feel snowed under.
But it can happen.
So that's what the intention, the intention is to help dispel doubt and misunderstanding,
or lack of understanding, and to arrive at a quality of clarity and peacefulness.
So when Joe suggested the title, or theme for the day, and immediately evoked a couple of different things,
particularly the verses of the third Zen patriarch, Sen Tsang, where he says,
when doubts arise, simply remember, or simply think, not to. And so that phrase, I realize,
oh yeah, that's a familiar phrase in the Zen world, they use that a lot.
And then the second part, not even one.
I thought, yeah, that's a very good way of pointing to it, because even when the mind is thinking in terms of letting go of dualities,
it's either division between separate objects, or division between subject and object, the solution of that.
Then just as Joe was saying, you're left with this feeling of one.
That can be what remains.
But in the last few months, I've been doing a little bit of exploring of the world of mathematics,
which is one of my illnesses, and I came across a reference to the fact that this great work of mathematical philosophy,
the Principia Mathematica that was written by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell back in the early part of the 20th century,
they took 315 pages to explain the number one.
I thought, well, that's a story in itself, just to explain what one means.
So I thought, right, so it's really important that we let go of one.
Because if we start to hold it as a real thing, we end up with 315 pages at least of complicated intricate logic.
And it's in a way the whole principle of Buddha Dharma and the methodologies of the path.
Over and over again throughout the Buddhist teachings, both in the southern and the northern traditions,
you have the Buddha pointing out the fact that the path is conditioned, it's formed, it's a created thing.
But that which it's leading to is the unconditioned, the unformed, the uncreated.
And this is a mysterious thing, that if the way to the goal is a conditioned thing, how can the goal be unconditioned?
And so that we use forms and descriptions, we use words, concepts, ideas.
But the point of them is not to come up with the perfect concept, the perfect idea,
or you end up like Russell in Whitehead with a 315 page book just on the number one.
But it's a springboard or a stepping off point.
It's a mode of practice, a way of working towards realizing that which is beyond form,
that which is beyond language, which never has been bound by structures or the born and the dying.
And these are maybe mysterious or strange ways, unusual ways for us to speak.
But this is really the essence of the Buddhist path.
It's a very clearly designated structures and forms and ideas, but it's point, it's usefulness, like a key.
The point of a key is not to be the perfect key, the point of a key is to open the door.
So you can either get in or get out depending on what you need to do.
You need the key, but without the key you can't get through the door.
The freedom is not possible, but the point is not the key, or even the door.
The point is the freedom that comes when the door is open.
So reflecting on the theme and the exploration of non-duality,
I thought that first of all I'd talk about the, offer a few teachings about the realm of the subject
and the feeling of I, because as most of us experience, if anything in the world seems real, I do.
Not me, Ajahn Amaro, but whoever you happen to call yourselves.
All other sort of perceptions and experiences and memories and ideas might seem a bit dubious or fluid,
but there seems to be this person at the middle of it who's the experience of the doer than no other member of the actor.
Right? It's not unreasonable and not presuming too much.
So it seems as though there's an I here who is the center of everything.
And so I thought to start off with the teachings that point to that domain and how the Buddha handled that.
There's a very significant encounter that is often quoted in a way.
It's where the Buddha derived his title from or the epithet of Buddha himself as an encounter with a Brahmin called Donut.
By the way, this is the manuscript of a hopefully forthcoming, to get very dualistic for a moment.
Hopefully forthcoming book, this is an anthology of teachings mostly from the Pali canon, also from some of the forest masters
and also some northern Buddhist texts, the Vajrasutra and the Shurangama Sutra and others,
that Ajahn Papsna and I have been putting together.
So it's more like a sort of scriptural partner for the small boat Great Mountains.
It's been forthcoming for nearly 10 years, so it's a slow birth.
But anyway, there's an encounter between this Brahmin who was wandering along the highway
and he saw in the dust these footprints, large footprints with these strange and impressive marks there in the footprint
from the lines and marks on the soles of the feet.
He thought, wow, these are really strange feet.
He's extraordinary with these wheel symbols and different images that were pressed into the dust.
He thought, wow, who do these feet belong to? What kind of a person is this?
And so then he followed the footsteps through the edge of the road and off to the forest
where he found this figure sitting under a tree and as he got close, he thought, wow, who is this?
He saw the Buddha sitting there, very upright and very bright, with a very bright countenance
and radiant and incredibly peaceful.
He thought, wow, what is that?
He was standing in front of this being and then he kneeled down to look closer
and then the Buddha opened his eyes and so then Dona asked him, sir, are you a god?
No Brahmin.
Sir, are you a heavenly angel?
No Brahmin.
Sir, are you a spirit?
No Brahmin.
Sir, are you a human being?
No Brahmin.
Then, sir, what indeed are you?
Then the Buddha, in characteristically and slightly plummy Theravada language said,
Brahmin, the defilements by means of which, through my not having abandoned them,
I might be a god or a heavenly angel, a deva or a spirit, a yaka or a human being,
they have been abandoned by me, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump,
done away with and no more subject to future arising.
Just as a blue or red or white lotus is born in water, grows in water and stands up above the water, untouched by it,
so too I, who was born in the world, grew up in the world, have transcended the world,
and I live untouched by the world.
Remember me as one who is awakened, Buddha.
So, from that encounter, that's in the Angutra Nikaya from the book of the fours, number 36.
So that is one of the places where we derive the word Buddha as the epithet.
So that he characterised himself as rather than an entity or a being, as awakened.
So he uses like an attic title, or a gerund type word, you know,
that there is awakenedness, there is awakening, there is that, there is awakened quality,
but no separate being, no individual entity, no I, that is the person, the entity who is awakened.
So that's a mysterious thing, but right there in that encounter it's pointing us to the key insight
that we use much of the meditation practice, concentration practice, insight practice.
That's the key insight that is being aimed at, is that shift from I am the meditator,
I am the experiencer to, well there is awakenness, there is awakenness, there is knowing,
but there's a realisation, there's a presumption to say that there is a no I,
an entity who is the, a separate individual who is the experiencer.
So many of the teachings about subjectivity relate to that, the feeling of I am,
and what the Buddha also said, that being free of the perception, or free of the conceit,
I am, asmimana is the Pali term.
Being free of asmimana is the greatest happiness of all, and that is nibbana here and now.
So if you're interested, this whole book is about nibbana, by the way.
So if any of you are realising nibbana, and that's the aim of your life,
then all it takes is to let go of the I am conceit.
That's all it takes.
She's a cake.
But that's, in a simple phrase the Buddha sums it up, being free of asmimana, the conceit of I am,
that is the greatest happiness of all, and that is nibbana here and now.
So in that moment of a true and wise relinquishing of that, the I am conceit,
not that suddenly we evaporate, or there's a vacant cushion,
but it's a change of perception, a change of attitude.
So, and then another passage that I just thought to focus the day a bit around scriptural readings,
rather than just sort of prompt to anecdotes for a change.
But that can be different this afternoon.
I thought I'd do this this morning.
So the Buddha said,
I am is a conceiving, I am this is a conceiving, I shall be is a conceiving, I shall not be is a conceiving,
I shall be possessed of form is a conceiving, I shall be formless is a conceiving.
Conceiving is a disease, a tumor, a barb, by overcoming all conceivings,
because one is called a sage at peace, and the sage at peace is not born, does not age, does not die.
They are not shaken and are not agitated.
For there is nothing present in them by which they might be born.
Not being born, how could they age?
Not aging, how could they die?
Not dying, how could they be shaken?
Not being shaken, how could they be agitated?
So that's from a discourse in the middle length sayings.
The very wonderful Dhatu Vibhanga Sutra in the Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta No. 140.
But that is a part of the key insights that we use to the meditation to develop,
is that recognition that the I am is a created feeling, it's a perception,
it's an extremely strong habit, right?
It has a very, very profound momentum behind it.
I am this, I am becoming, I'm not becoming, I want, I am a person, I'm a human, I'm a woman, I'm a man, I'm old, I'm young,
I'm qualified, I'm unqualified, I know what I'm talking about, I don't know what I'm talking about,
that the I passes by without a flicker.
And so then what the Buddha is pointing to is like, let's just look at the root of this subjective feeling
and pointing to that this is a conceiving, it's brought into being, it's not inherently there,
it's conceived, it's created, it's conditioned.
And even any kind of I am is under the same category.
And so even in his extremely thorough way, even if you conceive yourself as being everything,
and again this sort of points to the sort of being one with everything
and the whole, the fragility of oneness as a concept
or how in Buddhadharma points beyond that feeling of universality or oneness
or being one with everything, language.
And this is in another discourse, in the middle length discourses,
this is from the first one which is enormously long,
but it's also about the quality of self-conception.
So I'll just read a little passage from it here.
They perceive all as all, that's capital A, all, like everything in the universe.
They perceive all as all, having perceived all as all, they conceive themselves as all,
they conceive themselves in all, they conceive themselves apart from all,
they conceive all to be mine, they delight in the all.
Why is that? Because they've not fully understood it, I say.
And then to follow that, they perceive nibbana as nibbana,
having perceived nibbana as nibbana, they conceived themselves as nibbana,
they conceive themselves in nibbana, they conceive themselves apart from nibbana,
they conceive nibbana to be mine, they delight in nibbana.
Why is that? Because they've not fully understood it, I say.
So that is pointing to any kind of eye creation, even around the most wholesome and noble and transcendent of qualities.
It's like pointing to that, any kind of an experience, a doer, with it, apart from it, in it, outside of it, it's always going to be erroneous.
Another of the key passages that the Buddha talked about, or the ways of creating a sense of the dualities that we live with,
and talking about the world, and that's shifting the subject a little bit more to the realm of the object,
then there's a teaching that he gave to Mahakachana, which is talking about how maybe we take a view that we say everything exists,
or that everything is real, or we take a view that everything is empty. So again, looking at the objective world in different ways.
And he said Mahakachana approaches the Buddha and says,
The venerable sir said right view, right view. In what way venerable sir is their right view? And the Buddha replies,
This world kacayana for the most part depends on the dualism of the notions of existence and non-existence.
But for one who sees the origin of the world as it really is with right understanding, there is no notion of non-existence with regard to the world.
And for one who sees the cessation of the world as it really is with right understanding, there is no notion of existence with regard to the world.
This world kacayana is for the most part shackled by bias, clinging and insistence, but one such as this with right view,
instead of becoming engaged, instead of clinging, instead of taking a stand about myself through such a bias, clinging, mental standpoint, adherence and underlying tendency,
such a one has no perplexity or doubt that what arises is only dukkha, unsatisfactoriness arising, and what ceases is only dukkha ceasing.
In this, their knowledge is independent of others. In this way, kacayana, there is right view.
All exists kacayana. This is one extreme. All does not exist. This is the other extreme.
Without veering towards either of these extremes, the sratargata teaches the dhamma by the middle way.
And then he describes dependent origination with ignorance, his condition formations come to be with formations as condition consciousness comes to be,
and so on, such as the origin of this whole mass of suffering.
With the remainderless fading away, cessation and non-arising of ignorance, there comes the cessation of volitional formations,
the cessation of volitional formations, there comes the cessation of consciousness, etc.
This is the cessation of the whole mass of suffering.
And a slightly simpler version of that comes in the iti uttaka, where the Buddha says,
bhikkhus held by two kinds of views, some devas and human beings hold back, some overreach, only those with vision see.
And how bhikkhus do some hold back?
Some devas and human beings enjoy being, delight in being, are satisfied and rejoice in being.
When the dhamma is taught to them for the cessation of being, their minds do not enter into it or acquire confidence in it or settle upon it or become resolved upon it.
That's bhikkhus do some hold back.
How bhikkhus do some overreach?
Now, some are troubled, ashamed and disgusted by this very same quality of being,
and they rejoice in the idea of non-being, asserting,
good sirs when the body perishes at death, this self is annihilated and destroyed and does not exist anymore.
This is true peace, this is excellent, this is reality.
Thus bhikkhus do some overreach.
How bhikkhus do those with vision see?
Herein one sees what has come to be as having come to be,
having seen it thus one practices the course of turning away for dispassion for the cessation of what has come to be.
Thus bhikkhus do those with vision see.
So these are different scriptural ways and I apologize for the sort of slightly stilted language.
You kind of get used to it.
It develops a charm of its own over a decade or two.
But what these are pointing to is like the different ways that we can relate to the world and the realm of perceptions.
So just as the Buddha is pointing to letting go of the sense of I as a subject,
and then this is different ways of talking about how we relate to the perceptual world,
the world of experience, the world of the object.
And so these are talking about the views of well things are really there,
or the view that things are really not there.
It's all empty, doesn't exist, or yes, it's all real.
And then the Buddha rather points out, well, if you take either of those positions,
if either of those are clung to you, you're still wide of the reality.
And the point is that there is the experience of this moment.
We see, we hear, we feel there is a rising perception.
We can know that and then things cease, things come to an end.
And the points in these different teachings about how we can cling to the feeling of being and solidity and that,
or we can cling to the fading away and cessation and get carried away with that.
But if we really want to understand the nature of experience,
and as Joe was saying in his introduction, the kind of peace in the middle, if you like,
the experiencing, just to see that that is a fluid process of conditionality,
that thought and feeling, sight, sound, smell, taste, touch,
wells into being, crystallizes in particular forms, in regulated natural patterns and dissolves.
And that, but even that, seeing that this, and it's in this second teaching,
one sees what has come to be as having come to be.
Yes, there's sight, there's sound, there's smell, there's taste, there's touch,
there's these qualities that are known, there is a knowing of those.
But even that to sort of being absorbed into the kind of that quality itself is still a mistake.
But there's pointing towards the seeing of that, the knowing of that,
that quality of genuine insight, vipassana, that there's a genuine awareness or aware,
the quality of knowing in this moment, that flow, that current of form taking shape and dissolving.
It's that very open, unbiased, totally unobstructed, unlocated quality of knowing
that is, and that being embodied in this moment, that's the aim of these teachings.
They're trying to point to the correct way to hold the perceptual realm.
Does that make sense?
So I'm aware that there are a lot of words being produced,
but we will have time for some questions in due course.
Now one of the ways that the Buddha talked about this subject-object realm
and how that gets created and sustained is that it uses the image of a,
and this is how perception was understood somewhat in Indian philosophy at the time,
and I'll read a little passage from a paper by a fellow called Richard Gombridge,
who is a professor of Pali and Sanskrit at Oxford and a former president of the Pali Tech Society.
He says, in a Vedanta, to be wholly and exclusively aware of Brahman was at the same time to be Brahman.
The origins of this idea seem to lie in a theory of sense perception
in which the grasping hand supplies a dominant analogy.
It takes the shape of what it apprehends, so like I pick up the cup,
so the hand takes the shape of the cup because it's picking it up.
The grasping hand supplies a dominant analogy. It takes the shape of what it apprehends.
Vision was similarly explained.
The eye sends out some kind of ray which takes the shape of what we see and comes back with it.
Similarly thought, thought conforms to its object.
This idea is encapsulated in the term tanmayatara, consisting of that,
that the thought of the gnostic or meditator becomes consubstantial with the thing realized.
So it's this feeling of the eye sends out this sort of mysterious ray,
goes out and takes hold of the object, this person or the carpet or the cup, this thing,
and then returns with it.
So then the Buddha used in a very few places in the Pali Canon this word atanmayatara,
which means not consisting of that.
So in a way it's that not going out into the sense world and grabbing hold of a sight,
a sound, a smell, a taste, or a thought or an emotion.
So that we solidify things, we create the world of things by that going-outness.
I'm aware this is maybe a little bit of an obstruous concept.
But in ordinary English language you use a term like getting lost in something,
getting lost in a good book or getting lost in your shopping trip or getting lost in the internet,
getting caught up, we go out into things.
So that's tanmayatara, the mind goes out and becomes absorbed in an object.
Atamayatara is that non-creation of the subject-object duality,
that the mind is not going out and getting absorbed.
And there's a very beautiful expression of this by one of the great elders of Thai forest tradition,
an elderly monk who passed away in his 90s recently called Lumpur Dun.
And he describes the Four Noble Truths in the same kind of model.
He rearranges them a little bit.
He says, the mind that goes out in order to satisfy its moods is the cause of suffering.
The result that comes from the mind going out in order to satisfy its moods is suffering, dukkha.
The mind seeing the mind clearly is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.
And the result of the mind seeing the mind clearly is the cessation of suffering.
So that it's that very action of going out, the apparent subject going out and absorbing into the object,
that is the engine of dissociation.
It's the engine of duality, me here and the world out there chasing after it, running away from it,
being oppressed by it or just bewildered by it.
The engine of that is this ignorant construction of subject-object
and that characterizes the cause of dukkha, that very quality of alienation or dissatisfaction, dissociation.
And when the mind doesn't go out, the mind knowing the mind, the true awareness of how things are,
that not going outness, the koina word, is in what helps us to sustain a quality of not suffering,
a non-alienation of dissatisfaction, a quality of freedom.
One of my favorite passages in the scriptures also talks about this whole subject-object realm
that was a famous encounter between the Buddha and a wanderer called Bahia.
And Bahia was a famous yogi, a famous guru in his own right in the time of the Buddha.
And he lived somewhere on the coast of India and he was under the impression that he was an enlightened master
and had a whole large following of people.
And then one night this devatah who had been a relative of Bahia in a previous life came to Bahia
and says, well, oh Guruji, you seem to think that you are an enlightened being
and you might have that feeling, but actually you are not only, you're not enlightened,
you're not even on the path to enlightenment.
And so that you're getting more and more lost as the days go by.
So Bahia, which was pretty impressive, rather than thinking, how dare you?
Who do you think you are?
He said, oh, well, are there any enlightened beings in the world?
And then the devatah said, well, actually there are.
And so if you want to see a genuine enlightened being, there's this monk called Gautama,
the Samana Gautama, who is truly and genuinely awakened.
And he lives in a monastery called the Jaitavana outside of the great city of Sabati.
And so to his credit, Bahia just started walking then and there.
And just, okay, let's go.
And made his way, walking non-stop, to Sabati to meet the Buddha
because he was ready to lay aside his own impressions of enlightenment
and his status as a Guru, and to go find the Buddha and say,
okay, well, this guy is genuinely enlightened, let's go and learn from him.
So then he made his way to the streets of Sabati.
And then the Buddha was out on the almsround with a number of the monks following on behind him.
So Bahia sees the Buddha and then immediately bows down before him in the street.
And the Buddha with a characteristic applause says,
Bahia, please get up.
We're on our almsround.
This isn't the time to be paying your respects like this.
And Bahia says, please, you understand the Dhamma and you are totally awakened.
And please teach me what you understand.
And the Buddha said, Bahia, this isn't the time or the place to be giving teachings.
We're on our almsround, we're walking through the streets.
And of course, being a Theravada scripture, they do this three times over.
And Bahia makes his request three times and the Buddha says,
this is not the time or the place.
Twice.
And then on the third time, the Buddha says, well, Bahia,
when a Tathagata is pressed up to the third time, then he has to answer.
So then he gives Bahia this very brief teaching.
And so Bahia, in the Buddhist scriptures, different ones are the nuns and monks.
They get titles for like, well, actually lay people as well.
So like Visakha was the lay woman who was foremost in generosity.
Uplawana was the nun who was foremost in psychic powers.
Sariputra was the monk who was foremost in wisdom and so on.
So Bahia got the title of being the one foremost in quickness of wisdom.
He got, he had the record for the fastest enlightenment.
He got the Arahantship in the, in the, so not to sixty and two and a half seconds.
So the Buddha, this is, and this is the Buddha, the teaching that the Buddha gave him.
In the scene, there is only the scene.
In the herd, there is only the herd.
In the sense, there is only the sensed.
In the cognized, there is only the cognized.
This Bahia is how you should train yourself.
When Bahia, there is for you in the scene, only the scene, in the herd, only the herd.
In the sensed, only the sensed.
In the cognized, only the cognized.
Then Bahia, there is no you in connection with that.
When Bahia, there is no you in connection with that.
So that's like no subject and emptying out the subject side of it.
There is no you there.
When Bahia, there is no you there.
Then Bahia, you are neither here, nor there, nor in between the two.
Just this is the end of suffering.
So when you can't locate yourself in the world of this, here on the subject side,
or in the world of that, on the object side,
and you can't find yourself in between the two either.
This Bahia is the end of suffering.
So, incidentally, when Ajahn Smeta used to quote this teaching very often,
and there was one of the novices at our monastery in England years ago, in Chittar's monastery,
who when he heard the words, in the scene there is only the scene, he heard S-C-E-N-E.
In the scene there is only the scene.
This is a Buddhist scene.
In the herd, you are like the herd of people.
The vulgar herd.
That's right, yeah.
And the scene is only the scene, and the herd is just the herd.
We are in the scene, and they are the herd.
Right, yeah, yeah, right, that's right.
We've really got it, because they are totally misunderstanding the teaching.
So C-S-W-E-N, herd, H-E-A-R-D.
So the Buddha brings it right back to that, the quality of experiencing.
Just leaving it, there is the experiencing of seeing, hearing, sensing, smelling, tasting, touching,
and cognizing of the world of thought.
And then when Bahia, you can't locate yourself in the world of this, or in the world of that,
in the subject or the object, or some mysterious place halfway between the two.
This not creating yourself anywhere, not creating a solidity either in the realm of the object
or in the realm of the subject.
Letting go of it all, that is the end of suffering.
And Bahia was enlightened on the spot.
He became an Arahant then and there.
And it's also interesting that when he was trying to persuade the Buddha,
this was a good time to give teachings, he said to him,
Oh sir, life is uncertain, it is unknown whether you or I might die, please therefore give me the dharma teaching here and now.
And just after he'd realized Arahant's ship, he was run down by a runaway cow.
He was one of a number of people in the Pali scriptures who got hit by a runaway cow
in the narrow streets of Savati and died, expired there on the street.
And so by the time the Buddha didn't see this, it happened just after this encounter when he got back to the monastery then,
where it reached him.
Then it was the wonder of Bahia that you gave the teaching to this morning and who became an Arahant,
he got hit by a cow and died in the streets of Savati.
Well, he's okay. He ended his doubts and realized the dharma so that Bahia's ending was not an unfortunate one.
He completed the task before he breathed his last.
Even though it was unfortunate in some respects, Bahia had done the necessary.
He was actually right. Life is uncertain, you never know when you or I might die.
So this is the time to give me the teaching. If he waited, they will catch the dharma talk that evening or on the next Saturday
at the Savati version of I am Sea that he would have missed it.
Bahia would have missed the teaching.
There's also, even though that's a very brief teaching, that comes in the Udana, the Buddha's inspired utterances in the first chapter of the Udana.
There is a similar encounter or exchange between the Buddha and Ananda in a very wonderful and extensive teaching
out of the Chinese tradition called the Shurangama Sutra, which is one of the key meditation texts of the Chan tradition.
The Shurangama Sutra is quite extensive and it begins with Ananda going on arms-round and getting entranced as he wanders through the Red Light District early in the morning.
He gets entranced by a particular song coming from one of the houses and sees this young woman and is drawn into this almost extremely unfortunate encounter.
Just when Ananda is really about to lose it in a very, very serious way, the Buddha intervenes and resties him.
The teaching then unfolds as this investigation of the whole realm of perception because Ananda has been caught up by this entrancing song coming from one of the houses
and this enchantment that he's drawn by.
So the Buddha then sits Ananda down and says, OK, now how did this happen? And then he starts to talk about the realm of perception.
And then he asks Ananda, he says to Ananda, it's the fault of your mind and eyes that you undergo transmigration.
I ask you specifically about your mind and eyes. Where are they now? So basically where is your mind, Ananda?
And then for pages and pages and pages, Ananda goes through every detail trying to say where his mind is.
It's in the sense organs or behind the sense organs or in the body or outside the body.
And being a Mahayana text, it goes through extraordinarily involved detail about the meticulous philosophical detail of Ananda trying to pin down exactly where his mind is.
And each time he comes up with a possibility, the Buddha says, not so, Ananda.
Because if your mind was truly in your body or outside your body or if it was in the eye or if it was observing the eye, then.
And so after 30 or 40, 50 pages of this, Ananda says, I give up, Lord, please tell me where is my mind?
And the Buddha says, Ananda, you're asking the question in the wrong way because your mind cannot be located in the world of space.
The mind exists, but it does not exist confined in the world of space.
It's not definable in terms of here or there.
So the last area of teachings I thought to cover this morning in terms of establishing this quality of non-duality and letting go of two-ness and one-ness and the quality of really clarifying the quality of awareness itself.
Because probably all of us who've done some meditation and the development of Vipassana Insight Meditation in particular, probably most people here, not assuming too much.
So when you're practicing Insight Meditation or even sitting in Zazen, the Shikantasa, just the quality of resting in an awareness.
The mind, there can be an awareness of just the arising and passing of perceptions that there's no sense of self or even other being ascribed to hearing, feeling, smelling, tasting, touching.
There can be a profound clarity of not a sense of selflessness in what we think, the sounds that we hear, the feelings in the body.
It can be a clear knowing that, yeah, this is just feeling, arising and passing. This is just thinking, arising and passing.
Even memory, the memories that no one else knows about, just arising and passing, no sense of an owner, the whole eye feeling emptied right out.
Probably most people here have had at least a few moments of that.
So, and even intentions, even the motivation, sometimes the most subtle and tricky area of establishing a feeling of selflessness is decision making.
Because even if a feeling in the body or a memory is not self, there certainly seems to be a person who's deciding to move the leg or who's deciding to go to the shops or deciding to put the kettle on to make a cup of tea.
But even if there's qualities of intentionality emptied out and there's no feeling of eye or solidity of an object there,
what can still remain is the fact that this is all happening here, right?
There's a locativeness, sorry to be coming up with all these neologisms, created words, but it kind of, English runs out.
It's like, if you look in an English Sanskrit or Pali dictionary, you go for like one word of Sanskrit and then a paragraph of English to explain it, because the Indian languages have, you know, all these things have got words for them, but English doesn't really have words for it.
That as a quality of here-ness is all a feeling that even if there's no self, and no other, there can be a here-ness that's all happening in this particular place, but there's still an obstruction there, there's still a quality of subtle cling that's going on there.
And so one of the most useful and profound areas of insight practice is that of letting go of locality, of location. Does that make sense?
Because it's still an obstruction, because, you know, as the Buddha is pointing out in the Bahia and to Ananda, the mind is not anywhere.
The here-ness, three-dimensional space only relates to the rupa khanda, the form khanda, the form aggregate. The other four of the five khandas, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness, place does not actually apply.
It is not anywhere, right? Place does not apply. And yet it can be such a sort of solid assumption that this is all happening here, and my mind is, well, it's kind of here.
I mean, I know it's not really any place, but it's here, so that then we don't realize that that solidity is being ascribed, and that is too kind of clean.
And so that one of the most helpful areas of letting go of the dualisms and subtle in course is looking at that feeling of here-ness.
There's also an anecdote that I'm fond of telling, which is that this apparently took place in this, reputedly, took place in the streets of Oxford.
And Oxford University, I should explain, is not like, it's not a campus university, so some universities in Britain have a campus.
And so most American universities like Stanford say that there's a perimeter, that the university has its colleges, and they're all in one particular place together, and there's communal buildings.
Oxford University is separate colleges that are spread all over the town of Oxford. So London University, where I went, similarly, there's 44 different colleges spread all over London.
So there isn't a campus, there isn't one place where the university is. So the story goes that there was an American tourist, stopped his professorial type on the street in Oxford,
with a tweed jacket with the leather elbows, and the pipe still smoldering in the pocket, sort of bushy moustache, and dishevelled hair.
And this American tourist clutching her map and trying to figure things out, saying, excuse me, sir, can you tell me exactly where is the university?
And then this person says, Madam, the university only has metaphysical rather than actual existence. It is not anywhere.
The grandest does not apply, Madam, because the university is a concept. There are different colleges which have actual existence.
But the university is just, there is actually no physical Oxford University. It's not a place. It's just an idea.
So the colleges, and the members of the colleges gather together, and they offer degrees, and they run courses, and they organize curricula and so on.
But the university has no actual existence. It doesn't exist anywhere.
Because it is also something like we use every day, like I say, the term cyberspace, where you can visit a website.
Do you have a map reference for where the Avayagiri website is? Avayagiri Monastery is in Redwood Valley, and we can give you a street address and a map reference.
But the website is not located anywhere. Awareness does not apply.
So this is not an alien concept to us, but our conditioning as a breathing, living, apparently separate entity.
Conditions are so strongly to think of, I am in this place. This is where I am. This is where IMC is at this address.
It exists here, and so hereness is heavily conditioned. But developing ways to let go of that and to see the conditioned quality of that and open up to that is tremendously important.
And one of the great living masters of Thailand at present, Ajahn Mahabua, he describes the insight of his own enlightenment experience.
In a Dhamma talk in a book called, called Straight from the Heart, he was doing walking meditation.
It was after his teacher had passed away and he was living in seclusion in a monastery up in the Chiang Mai area, I believe.
What Chi Luang. And he was doing walking meditation and suddenly he had this, he said it was more like hearing a voice than having a thought.
But what way the insight took shape, as he was walking along the path, was if there is a point or a center of the Noah anywhere, that is the essence of a level of being.
So that is like the seed of birth, the seed of dukkha, of separation, the seed of dualism. If the knowing has a center, if we say in a way creating hereness, that is like the nexus, the seed of dualism.
And that was his, that was the moment of his enlightenment, kind of formed itself in terms of that thought.
And then as he realized, oh that's the truth, then he was able to release the heart from that center, centeredness, although we think of being centered as a good thing.
Being scattered, obviously, is even worse. From being scattered, get centered and then let go of the center.
And so this leads on to another couple of key teachings, which are some of the last, I like to cover this morning, which are often quoted.
These also come from the Udana, the collection of the Buddha's teachings on the inspired utterances.
And these are some of the rare metaphysical teachings that the Buddha gives, rather than just talking about the path to realizing the goal.
He speaks of the ultimate reality directly. He says, there is the unborn, uncreated, unconditioned and unformed.
If there were not, there would be no escape discerned from that which is born, created, conditioned and formed.
But since there is this unborn, uncreated, unconditioned and unformed, escape is therefore discerned from that which is born, created, conditioned and formed.
Which is a slightly plummy way of saying, if there was no ultimate reality, then liberation would be impossible.
But because there is an ultimate reality, there is a transcendent dimension of reality.
Therefore, true liberation, true freedom, true peace is possible, true transcendence is possible.
Then the other from the same group of teachings, there is that sphere, that sphere of being.
Also this word written up on the wall there in pale, but amata dhatu.
That's not what you might have noticed. It just means the deathless element.
Mata is death, amata is deathless, dhatu is element.
The deathless element is another epithet for the same quality that the Buddha is referring to.
There is that sphere where there is no earth, no water, no fire, no wind.
No sphere of infinity of space, infinity of consciousness, of nothingness or even of neither perception or non-perception.
Those are all the formless realms.
There there is neither this world nor the other world, neither moon nor sun.
This sphere I call neither a coming nor a going nor a staying still, neither a dying nor a reappearance.
It has no basis, no evolution and no support.
This, just this, is the end of dukkha.
It is neither a coming nor a going nor a staying still, neither a dying nor a reappearance.
No basis, no evolution, no support.
So that's a lot of no.
And again, if we hark back to that passage from the iti butika where the Buddha says, those who delight in being, who relish being,
when they hear about the dharma teachings for the cessation of being, they go, ah, oh no.
And because it's threatening, they hold back.
But I would encourage not being put off by all the sort of having our life-affirming habits and being threatened by all the no sun, no moon,
no coming, no going, no standing still.
Because if you consider, if you bring to mind the memory of your clearest moments in meditation,
when the mind is at its peak of clarity and peacefulness,
then at that moment there is a quality of complete integrity.
And you can see in a way that there's the coming and going, standing still don't apply.
Inside-outside don't apply, past and future, present don't apply.
There's no time, no self, no place.
But there is a quality of awareness of knowing.
But even to say, isness doesn't quite apply.
Even if one of those Buddhist epithets is, isness is our business.
Even though it's kind of neat, a neat little sort of aphorism, but actually it's not quite right either.
Neither isness nor not isness.
But if you consider, if you bring to mind those moments of clarity,
and then you can see, yeah, in a way there's no thing there.
It's absolutely, it's absolutely no thing.
But yet it's everything.
And then there's, to quote the third Zen patriarchs, Gata again,
he says, in this world of suchness there is neither self nor other than self.
So perhaps the word suchness or tatata in Pali is a good way to ascribe that.
You can talk about emptiness, sunyata or tatata.
And so emptiness is a way of leaning towards the knownness of things.
Suchness is a way of leaning towards yesness.
But it's a, this quality of awareness that in a way its essence is that,
is a balancing of emptiness and suchness of sunyata and tatata.
But that is as a complete, no-thingness.
There's a sense of great spaciousness.
But yet it's more real than anything you've ever known in your life, right?
So to use these kind of teachings that we're approaching today,
and I'm really looking forward to what Roshi Joseph has to say on this,
is what structures and forms and paths we can use to,
and meditation methods we can use to arrive at the genuine quality,
to awaken that genuine quality of knowing,
which brings the heart to that balance of emptiness and suchness,
holding the yes and the no.
And both are true.
And yet neither are true also.
There's a mysterious quality.
There's an ambiguity in there, a mysterious quality,
that frustrates the hell out of the thinking mind.
And even in the Buddhist times, these shaven-headed sakhins,
they're just, you can't get a straight answer out of them, however hard you try.
They always answer in these mysterious and tricky ways.
But that's the fact of it.
The dualistic thinking and language is always going to be frustrated.
But these words and forms and ideas are pointing towards
that genuine realization of that quality that is beyond words, beyond language.
And as, again, to steal the words of the saint's arm,
the way is beyond language.
And in it there is no yesterday, no tomorrow, no today.
So I will leave my presentation there for the morning,
and we can have a little bit of a leg stretch and a break.
Do we have any questions before that?
I'm thinking maybe just a couple minutes of questions.
Okay.
I think it would be just too frustrating to go on without at least the opportunity
for just a question or two, if you don't mind.
And then after both of our presentations, there'll be more time for questions.
But does anyone have a question or comment?
Again, just one or two, please.
Can we make sure we use the mic?
Yeah.
Would you like to come up and use the mic?
The mic is moving.
Does the mic move?
Thank you.
I believe I heard when the mind can look at itself, there's freedom.
And relative to the hand taking the shape of the object it holds
and the mind also doing that, if the mind is holding or looking at some object
of the world that it desires and it looks at itself in that moment,
does that looking change the action?
Absolutely.
If the difference between, say, liking and wanting, so that if the mind is lost in that object,
then that, say, the pleasant feeling in association with that then goes towards,
I want that, I'm lacking that, and if I had that, then I would be complete.
If the mind is knowing itself, then there's a spaciousness there.
That liking is considered within the context of, well, I like that,
I like the idea of that, I like the sight of that, I like the sound of that.
Is it appropriate for me to pursue it?
Do I really need that?
Yes, there's a liking, is there something that is worthy of following or not?
So there's the whole element of mindfulness and wisdom is brought in.
And so then there can be, we can't live without desire.
Wanting is, I mean, you had to want to come here today, right?
So sometimes people misinterpret all wantings or all desires as being intrinsically problematic
or causing a suffering, but wanting to go to the bathroom is not an unwholesome desire.
It's probably very good that we follow that desire, wanting to eat or to breathe the next breath.
So it's a distinguishing between what's appropriate, what fits in with time and place and situation.
If you're hungry and you've brought some food with you, then it's appropriate to eat the food out of kindness to the body.
If it's somebody else's sandwich and you forgot to bring your own, then helping yourself,
well, we're all one, well, we're not even one, so their sandwich, my sandwich, no sandwich, there is no sandwich.
I just ate it, you know.
I'm hungry.
And so then it's like, no, this is sophistry driven by greed and selfishness and delusion.
And so then wisdom will tell you, you don't believe that.
It's their sandwich, you forgot to bring something.
So now you feel hungry, so it's not appropriate to follow that.
So the more mindfulness and wisdom there is, the more we're able to see what is a wholesome liking or wanting and what is suitable to follow
and what is unsuitable to follow.
And there can be an intense longing.
You could really, you're underwater and you really want to breathe or you really need to go to the bathroom.
Or you're really in a rush because the gate's about to close and you need to get there before the plane takes off.
But that can be held in an atmosphere of complete peacefulness, even though the feeling is very intense.
That the intensity of a feeling of wanting or attraction or aversion, like an extremely uncomfortable pain,
it can still be agonizingly painful, but if there's that, if the mind is knowing the mind in that way,
that's like in Lumpur Dun's expression, then it's absolutely not a problem.
It's like, wow, this one really hurts.
That's a doozy.
It's not a problem. The pain is still there. You're not just dissolving the pain, but it's absolutely not a problem.
And that's the key. It's a recognition that everything belongs.
Do you have one more question?
Did you have your hand up? Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you for your talk. I think this is related to the previous question.
You're talking about in the scene is only the scene and in the herd is only the herd.
So I just want to deconstruct that a little.
So there's obviously no becoming if you're doing that.
And there's no clinging, no craving.
Is there Vedana? Is there feeling tone? It sounds like yes.
It's a feeling in terms of the cycle of the stages of dependent origination.
Then if the mindfulness and wisdom is really acute, then that can be really established right at sense contact.
And obviously that's too hard to distinguish between that and then the feeling of pleasant painful or neutral that comes from that.
So generally just focusing the attention on the feeling tone.
Then that's where there can still be the quality of spaciousness and clarity,
even with intensely pleasant or intensely painful feeling or remarkably neutral,
utterly uncompelling, neutral feeling, which is in a way that's the hardest of all to keep focused on.
But it's where that slips over between feeling and then tanha craving.
That's the bridge.
In a way, most insight meditation is aimed at recognizing that bridge and training the heart not to cross that.
Like, yes, I like and I want.
Like one of the stories that Karan was referring to in Small Boat, maybe I'll just recount that before we break,
where I get that phraseology from was when Ajahn Samedha was a young monk and living at Ajahn Chahar's monastery,
an extremely austere and so pressurized living environment.
And life is very, very plain.
One day this large group of young student nurses came to the monastery.
And so as a junior monk, you have very, very little contact with members of the opposite sex,
similarly with the nuns, you never see them being in contact with men.
So Ajahn Samedha was a young monk and he's the only foreigner in the monastery.
So every so often Ajahn Chahar would sort of wheel him out and have him there.
Because he was so, people were so sort of inspired by the idea of a foreigner would become a monk
in this most austere and demanding of monasteries.
So anyway, he sat there for a couple of hours while Ajahn Chahar was giving teachings to this group of student nurses
and their teachers from the nursing college.
And so he's in close proximity to 50 or 60 attractive young women.
And in northeast Thailand they're very, very straightforward about things like sexual desire
and eating and defogating and birth and death.
They live pretty close to the earth, the very sort of earthy sensibilities they have.
So it's subjects of those subjects which we don't talk about in the West in polite society very much.
They kind of talk about it very easily.
Anyway, so after this group of the students had left, then Ajahn Chahar turned to Ajahn Samedha
and said, so Samedha, what did that do to your mind?
And then the reply that he gave was, chop down my owl in Thai, which means I like, but I don't want.
And Ajahn Chahar was so impressed with that.
And he was only like, you've only been a monk for like two or three years of that time.
Ajahn Chahar was so impressed with that that for the next two or three weeks every dhamma talk he gave was on that theme.
Because that's the key insight, because if you react against it and say, no, I'm not interested,
it's disgusting, I hate sexes bad and women I hate and I was turning them into skeletons
and seeing their piles of guts and blood and parts and just pools of urine and feces.
Then Ajahn Chahar was like, whoa, we've got a problem here.
But if, on the other extreme, it's like, yes, all I could do is come.
Hold myself down on the map.
Okay, well, we've got a problem here.
But he said, that's it.
You can say, yeah, there's a magnetism there.
Yeah, I'm a guy and I'm attracted to women and there's 50 attractive young women
and I haven't been within 50 feet of a woman in the last two years.
So yeah, there's an effect.
But yeah, there's an effect, but I have no interest in following it.
So it's recognizing, yeah, there's an attraction or an aversion that I like or I don't like,
but then it's entirely up to us whether we pick that up and follow it or not.
There's no compulsion that we follow that because it's a recognition that I'm not lacking anything
or nothing is actually burdening me, that everything is fine.
In a way, it's like seeing the suchness of a moment, even of a suchness of a desire or suchness of a fear or an aversion.
It's just, yeah, it's just a texture, no big thing.
So Vedana is in itself feeling, the world of feeling is completely innocent.
So when it gets into craving, clinging, becoming, then it starts to compact into the self-contraction.
Anyway, time to take a break.
Thank you.
