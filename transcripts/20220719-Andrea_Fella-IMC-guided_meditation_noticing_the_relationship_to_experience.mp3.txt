 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. This is a video of me going to how you are in this moment through the feeling of it. Just in a simple way. Opening to how your body is. Sometimes I begin a meditation by kind of not trying to look at anything detailed, but more the general sense. So how is the body generally? Is there tension or ease in the body? Is there any uncomfortable or uncomfortable sensations happening in the body? And how is the mind? How is your emotional mental experience right now too? And in a very simple, broad way. Agitation or ease? Lots of thinking about past or future? Or is there a little bit of quiet in the mind right now? How is the mind busy or quiet? Beginning by checking in. How are you right now? Through this, checking in. Not trying to change anything, but just acknowledging this is how you are in this moment. It's a kind of an honoring or respecting just how the system is in this moment. Everything is allowed in our mindfulness practice. And this attitude of allowing, of opening to just how it is, can have an effect on our experience. We simply open and honestly acknowledge, oh, it's like this right now. There is tension in the body or there is ease in the body. When we acknowledge how we are with this simple, allowing, curious awareness. It tends to support a release of tension, of stress, and it tends to support an encouragement of ease or relaxation or quiet. We don't have to think about this. It's just a natural way that this capacity to be curiously aware works. And so this is a great way to begin a sitting just by acknowledging how are you and noticing what happens. As you simply meet your experience. And having explored, opened to how we are in this moment. There are some supports for encouraging that relaxed, attentive, curious awareness. And one of the main ones is to encourage or support relaxation. Relaxation of the body, relaxation of the mind. And so sometimes as we notice areas of tension in our body, it may relax naturally with the noticing of it. And it also might support you to see if there can be a conscious relaxation of the body, inviting relaxation. Maybe through scanning the body, sometimes that can be useful. But seeing if there can be a softening. Maybe particularly helpful to relax the face. See if there can be a relaxation of the torso and inside the torso, the area of the heart. Maybe the heart can relax. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. Relaxing these areas, the face and the inner visceral landscape of the body, really supports there to be a little bit of softening of the mind. A little bit of relaxation of worries or concerns, tension in the mind. And in this too, perhaps there can be an inclining towards an invitation to set aside worries or concerns, mental tension. Not to repress them, but just to kind of acknowledge them, say, I see you and you can be here with me, but right now you can just sit here in this space and we'll just rest together. Okay. An exploration of being aware while inviting relaxation. This is practicing and cultivating mindfulness. And simultaneously it's inviting and supporting conditions that support mindfulness. So this simple practice of opening to inviting relaxation is very supportive to move the mind in the direction of the very natural capacity we have to be mindful, to be aware. Sometimes we can take a lot of time with relaxation if there's a lot of tension in the mind and body. And that itself is very useful. And if the mind feels fairly relaxed, if the body feels fairly at ease, then inviting curiosity. What is happening right now? Maybe letting go of the directing towards exploring relaxation and just open. What is most obvious in this moment? And that includes bodily experience, physical sensations. Our physical experience is pretty obvious. One of the more obvious things that our mind connects with. So noticing what is obvious in your experience. And that obviousness for a moment or two or sometimes longer or something, the attention lands with something or rests with something for a little while. And then something else happens, a sound happens or another body sensation or a thought or an emotion happens and the attention shifts. That curiosity of just what is obvious right now, where is the attention? That is an exploration of how we are in this moment. Cultivating mindfulness, the natural mindfulness that has this capacity to just meet, recognize what's happening in our experience. And then with recognizing whatever is obvious in our experience, it's useful to expand the container a little bit, expand what we're noticing that with this whatever is obvious, there is some relationship that we have to that experience. We might like the experience or not like it. We might want it to change. We might have opinions or views about it, thoughts going about it. Or we might be okay. It might be no problem. This relationship to what is obvious is a really useful area to recognize. What is happening? What is obvious? And how am I in relationship to what is happening? So often that relationship is a little behind the scenes. It's not quite acknowledged or even seen as something that we can simply recognize also. So maybe you notice there's something unpleasant happening and an attitude of resistance to it. When we can notice or open to, oh, resistance is happening, that shifts our relationship to the resistance. It's also just something that can be held in this container of honestly acknowledging how I am right now, honoring what's here. And perhaps connecting to or appreciating that capacity of being curious, of honoring the capacity that our mind has to simply recognize, oh, this is what's happening. And as I mentioned earlier, when we recognize with mindfulness something that's happening in our present moment experience, a curiosity about that, and opening to it, even if it's something like resistance, creates the conditions for that, for resistance to weaken, to have a different relationship with it, to maybe feel a little more ease around it. And if we happen to have a relationship of allowing acceptance, okayness with what's here, a sense of care or kindness or compassion with what's here, aware of that, supports that quality, nourishes that quality. Now the practice described in quite a few words here, but ultimately it's really simple. Relax. Notice what's obvious. Notice how what's obvious may change from moment to moment. And every now and then, not too frequently, but every now and then, some curiosity about how am I in relationship to what's happening. And then exploring the possibility of allowing that relationship just to be something else that is held within this container or field of awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
