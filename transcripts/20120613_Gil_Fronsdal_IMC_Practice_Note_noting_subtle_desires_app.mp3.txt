Practice Note: Noting Subtle Desires

Mindfulness practice has a lot to do with noticing what’s 
happening . There are  many things we can notice . A 
very useful  one is our desires , what we want . For the 
most part, des ires are operating all the time; they can 
often be subconscious . We migh t recognize some of our 
desires,  but for many of us, they operate so quickly  that 
we might not notice. For example, it might not have 
occurred to you to notice your desire to open your eyes 
when  the bel l rings  at the end of the sitting . There had 
to have been some desire to open your eyes  in order  for 
the eyes to open . Or maybe you shifted your posture as 
soon as the bell rang. There’s some desire  around that.  
 
My saying that desires are everywhere might perplex 
some of you . There may be  the desi re to better  
understand this, or a desire to debate it, “Oh that’s  not 
true.” Desires are operating in many ways . When you  
do walking me ditation  outside,  there may be shade in 
one place  and sun in another . When you get to the edge 
of the shady space, you can have  a simple desire to 
turn around in order to stay in the shade , rather than go 
into the sun. With these kinds of examples , I’m trying to 
say that desires are ope rating very subtly all the time. It’s not necessarily the big desires , the big three. You 
can make up your big three, your top desir es. When in 
the grips of o ne of those desires, you know  you have 
desire, you know what you want . A whole range  of 
powerful desires  from subtle to gross  operates  in human 
beings.  
 
One thing  to be sensitive to  as you do mindfulness 
practice is to notice what you want . Notice what you  are 
desiring . There can be desires c onnected to 
mindfulness itself. We can  want something from the 
practice . We’re trying to do something, or accomplish 
something . There can b e desires operating while 
practicing which have nothing to do with the practice 
itself, but rather  with making yourself more comfortable , 
or practicing in such a way that other people see how 
great you are as a practitioner , or practicing in a way 
that no one notices you.  
 
When you are distracted, going away f rom the present 
moment and becoming  lost in thought, you might  spend 
a few moments looking at that distracted thinking , and 
try to understand  the desire behind it. Chances are 
there’s a desire  operating:  something you want , or 
something you don’t want.  
 
Learning to become  more sensitive to h ow desires 
operate  is a very useful aspect of this practice. One of 
the hopes or one of the trainings  – which is true with all  we do  – is to try to  be very generous to ward  ourselves 
with whatever we notice . Be relaxed and open about it . 
In other words , don’t become self -conscious or angry. 
Don’t feel  you’re a bad Buddhist because now Gil’s 
pointed out that in a single  minute , it turns out you have 
thirty -two desires .  
 
Part of  mindfulness training is that, with whatever you 
notice, try to hold it with equanimity and without 
judgment.  
 
For those of you who have no desires th is morning, just 
enjoy it. Thank you.
