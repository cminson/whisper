 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Yeah, so you can take a moment to settle in to a meditation posture. Maybe move your body a little bit if needed so that your body is relaxed, also somewhat alert. And when you're ready, you can close your eyes if you haven't already. We'll start contacting the body, becoming aware that we're sitting here, aware of the sitting position, sitting posture. And to relax, you can do a short body scan. Start with the head, double the head, just some gentle and kind attention to that area of the body, down to the forehead, eyes, cheeks, jaw, and throat, shoulders, and just being with the body part. Often that already gives some relaxation, just your kind and gentle attention. Arms and hands, just the upper back, belly, lower back, buttocks and the whole hip area, gentle and kind attention. Just a simple being, being with the upper legs, knees, lower legs, and feet. Maybe you can feel the contact of the feet, the surface for me. Whatever surface you're on, below that somewhere is the earth. Maybe below the foundation of the building you're in, maybe several stories down if you're in an apartment, a condo. Somewhere down there, you can feel that we are connected with the earth. I feel supported right here. Always carrying us around wherever we are. And turn into the body as a whole. Is there any difference with before the body scan? It doesn't have to be, but maybe there is some difference. You can also have the intention that the mind may relax. Maybe lots of thoughts come up about the day of yesterday, tomorrow, maybe there are feelings or moods present. I can tune in what is most obvious in this moment. Maybe there is a mood, an emotion, thought, maybe something in the body, hardness or coolness, warmth, pain, discomfort, maybe it's a sound, whatever it is. Maybe you can just simply recognize whatever is most obvious for us right now. That changes all the time as well. One moment, it's a sound, not a moment, maybe a thought or a mood. Mindfulness or awareness, just simply recognizing what is happening now. And now, and now. Just a simple knowing what is happening when it is happening. You can stay with the simplest sensations, you don't have to make it difficult, you don't have to search for anything. You can just allow it to come to us, for waiting for a sensation or something in the mind to come to us. Then when it is there, you recognize it, even if it's something unpleasant, something we don't really want, maybe a difficult emotion, maybe a sound that is unpleasant, maybe a thought stream or pain. If it's unpleasant, you can try to receive and allow this unpleasantness too. If we absolutely don't want to receive or allow it, we can try to receive and allow that we don't want the other thing to happen. We can try to receive our aversion towards it. Thank you. You can sometimes help to generate some curiosity, some interest in this present moment. What is it like right now? We will be curious about the experience of body and mind in this moment. Even if it's boring, maybe we can be interested in boredom. What is it like in the body and in the mind to be bored? What is it like in the mind to be bored? What is it like in the mind to be bored? What is it like in the mind to be bored? I know that whatever is happening in this present moment is part of our human experience, part of being a human to experience thoughts, emotions, moods, physical sensations. It is just nature. It's our nature to experience this. What is happening inside of us, you can see, this is just like a wetter system coming through, like maybe there's sunshine, maybe there are clouds, maybe there's a storm. It's just passing through you. Just like outside weather comes and goes, or inside weather also comes and goes. We will continue in silence. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the last few minutes of meditation. Oh wow, the weather that is arising for you right now. It would be there to stay for as long as it wants to. Until pass. It will also pass again. This water, weather will come up. Just let it arise. Stay in path. Stay in path. Stay in path. Stay in path. Stay in path. At the end of meditation like this, we can take a moment to cultivate some gratefulness. For the time that we have taken for ourselves to meditate. Taking the time to be interested in our own body and mind. Maybe you can be grateful for that. That's available for you. You can also be grateful for other people that are practicing here right now. Together. It gives an extra dimension to our meditation. It can help us stay a bit more focused. And present. We can be grateful for each other. Appreciate each other's presence and each other's meditation. Through meditating, we generate wholesome and beneficial energies. Often called merits in Buddhist circles. This merit is beneficial energies. We can share that with all beings. It kind of multiplies itself. If we share it, we still experience the benefits of the meditation. And then we can share it with all beings everywhere. You can form the intention. May all beings everywhere share in our beneficial energy. May it help them. May they be free from suffering. May they be at peace. Thank you. Thank you.
