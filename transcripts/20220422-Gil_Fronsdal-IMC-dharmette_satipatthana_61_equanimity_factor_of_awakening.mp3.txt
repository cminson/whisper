Hello everyone.
We come to the end of the five-part series on the Seven Factors of Awakening.
The second to last exercise in the discourse for establishing awareness.
The seven factors of awakening are the foundation for the last exercise, which is to have penetrating insight, to see in a liberating way, in a way that awakens.
So that's one of the reasons Seven Factors of Awakening are called factors of awakening, is they set the stage for awakening, for freedom.
And they also are qualities of that awakening itself.
So it's a beautiful thing where we're growing in the qualities that will be mature with our awakening.
So I still want to say, what I've been saying all week, that these factors of awakening are not ordinary mindfulness, investigation, effort, joy, tranquility, concentration, equanimity, whatever ordinary might mean.
They are really the product or the result or the consequence of having really settled in to doing this practice of mindfulness, of awareness.
Where the mindfulness has brought us to a place of stability, of lots of clarity, and where our whole being, our body, our mind, have become somewhat unified and collected for the purposes of meditating, of being here.
We're no longer thinking about the events of the day yesterday or what's going to happen. We're not cut up in our fantasies or our resentments or distracted thought.
It's not easy to come to this point, but at some point we come to this point. We really feel like, oh, there's a vitality in awareness, a vitality in being present in a full way.
And so then these states, the seven factors of awakening, there's no instructions to cause them to arise, to make them happen, but when recognizes when they are present and when recognizes when they're not.
And we also recognize when they arise, they're appearing. And our role is to maintain them, to let them keep develop.
And a lot of that has to do at this stage of practice, getting out of the way.
If a ball is rolling down a hill, if you stand in front of it and block it, it won't roll. But if you get out of the way, it continues to roll down the hill.
So these seven factors of awakening will keep growing and moving if we have learned how to stay out of the way.
And a lot of that has to do with not getting involved in thoughts, not getting caught up in our thoughts, distracted by thoughts, not getting involved in wanting and not wanting, not tinkering with our experience, making it more and more refined and kind of working it.
But beginning to just let go of the doer, let go of the activity of being the meditator and just getting out of the way and allowing something else to emerge, to unfold these seven factors of awakening.
And for that, there has to be some momentum in the practice also.
So this is why really having done the practice for a while, maybe a long time, so that it becomes like second nature to do it.
It's like there's a kind of momentum. The body knows. The body is connected to this practice. Sit down to meditate.
And the body gathers itself together because it's familiar with this. It knows that it's a familiar territory and it's like coming home.
So as these develop and following samadhi concentration, stability, real stability, unified mind, the tendency of the mind to get fragmented again, to get caught up in any kind of mental or interstate that's arising or any external thing,
is diminished because the sense of awareness feels so strong, so precious, so rich in that clarity of being that it seems like it's much better than any alternative.
The alternative of being thoughts and distracted and caught up in things.
And so we come back to it and stay there. And in that mind, there's this wonderful precious sweetness or beauty or wonderfulness to this clarity of mind which is non-reactive.
This clarity of mind that's not working the practice anymore, not reacting, not fixing or tinkering, where there's no doer operating, where there's just a clarity of being aware.
And that stability, that equanimity is what allows for there to be deep insight.
Then our seeing, we don't see through the filter of our projections, our agitation, all the concepts and ideas and commentary we have about things.
But we start seeing or perceiving, feeling what's happening in a much more direct way.
And in doing so, we start having insights into what's happening that is freeing.
And that's for next week.
So this remarkable thing that these beautiful qualities of being are the byproduct of mindfulness practices.
And so to some point, we want to recognize that even the hints of these are beginning to arise because it's the recognition of their presence that allows them, one of the factors that allows them to grow.
So to recognize it becomes more and more clarity of awareness that is mindfulness.
Recognizing in that clarity, there is a capacity to choose between what's healthy and not healthy, skillful and not skillful, to know how to stay present in a mindful, relaxed, freeing way.
Then there's the enthusiasm, the energy to do that, which allows the practice to grow.
And then there's the joy of doing it.
And then with that joy, perhaps a contentment, a satisfaction, it lets so many of our anxieties settle and quiet down.
And then we have concentration, a unification of mind, and we have equanimity.
So there's seven factors of awakening.
Mindful of the present, mindful of their absence, mindful of when they arise so that we can get out of the way and maintain them and keep them going.
These are what happens at some of the mature level stages of mindfulness.
Don't worry about being in these mature stages.
The only thing that's important moment by moment is this moment, this moment of practice.
As if you're putting drops into a bucket.
Each drop is as valuable as any other drop.
And so each drop is it's complete in itself.
And so each drop of mindfulness, each second, each moment of mindfulness is complete in itself.
And don't be so concerned or caught up with attainments or getting somewhere.
But when the seven factors of awakening start showing themselves, recognize they're there.
Know their presence and maybe even know as they're arising.
And then learn the art of maintaining them, getting out of their way and letting them grow.
So thank you very much.
So a few announcements.
So in a few minutes we'll start with a Zoom meeting for those of you who would like.
And the Zoom link is in a few places.
It's at the very top of the chat.
And it's also on the IMC homepage website.
Under what's new there's a notice about it. Also on the IMC calendar there's a notice for 845.
And there's a password you need to use.
And the password is the poly word, the Buddhist word for loving kindness, which is metta.
M-E-T-T-A.
And there's a prompt there that reminds you it says Buddhist word for loving kindness.
But it starts with M and it's all lowercase.
So another couple of other announcements that it is EarthCare Day.
And a day of both distress and celebration.
And a few things are related to this at the IMC.
IMC is starting an EarthCare group that will meet monthly to discuss EarthCare projects
and activities and study.
And there's information about that under what's new on the IMC website.
And that first meeting is going to be next Saturday, the 30th of April.
And there's also a notice there on the homepage under what's new
that I teach a Buddhist eco chaplaincy training program.
Training people to be chaplains, to offer spiritual care and relationship to the environment, the natural world.
And there's a little bit of information there and discussion about how to find out more
under what's new at the homepage of IMC website.
So it seems nice to mention these things here on EarthCare Day.
So it'll take me a couple of minutes to set up for the Zoom myself.
I think you can enter the room on your own.
And those of you who don't want to be on Zoom but want to participate,
or not so much participate maybe, but listen, I'll keep the YouTube channel open.
And hopefully you can make it a little bit interesting to attend.
And maybe you'll see me so easily because I'm going to lift up the laptop so that the camera is more in my eyesight.
So I'll see you in a few minutes in that Zoom room.
I'll post it again once more time, the link right here in the chat in a moment.
This is what I'm posting. It doesn't require the password.
So if you cut and paste that perhaps, there you click on that.
You don't need the password and you can just go directly in.
I'll see you in a couple of minutes.
