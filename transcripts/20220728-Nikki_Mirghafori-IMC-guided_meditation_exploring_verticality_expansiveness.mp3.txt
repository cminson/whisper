 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Thank you. Thank you. Greetings, friends. Greetings and good morning from Mountain View, California, where it's cool and cloudy. I'm in Mountain View, California, on Seated Olo Niland. Greetings to all of you, whatever time zone you're in. Lovely to be joining you, each other in this moment in time to practice meditation and share the Dharma. So always lovely to hear the greetings on chat as they're going, as they're being added one by one. So this week we're exploring, today we're exploring the mind's body. And we continue the exploration today, noticing how the perception of our body can be different. There's a different sense of the energy body, not just the perception of the body is different, but some shifts can happen energetically too, as we pay attention differently. So different ways of paying attention in the body, not just places to pay attention to the breath, as we discussed on Tuesday, that was, but also the way, the way we pay attention or what quality we choose to attend to with our mind can have impacts about on how we perceive and also what arises. Maybe also what's called energy channels in the body shifting and changing and the perceptions. So without further ado, let's practice together, inviting you to arrive, to arrive in your body in this moment in time. However the body is right now, whether the body is feeling good, tired, agitated, peaceful, greeting, breathing the body with your mind just as it is. With openness, with kindness. And as we learned and arrive, turning, turning the attention, inviting the attention, to receive the sensations of the body contacting the cushion, the cushion in the floor, the lower part of the body, the sense of groundedness, contact with the earth. Thank you. Releasing attention or tightness in the upper body. Forehead, jaw, face, neck, shoulders, arms and hands. Let them be heavy and rest. Chest, upper back, lower back, abdomen. With the next out breath, releasing any tension, holding. Let awareness be curled up in the breath, in the abdomen. Comfortable, soothed, nowhere to go, nothing to do right now. Then just sit and be breathed. Receiving the breath, awareness receiving the breath in the abdomen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now I swear paying attention to the breath in the abdomen in this moment, feeling grounded in the body, feet, sit bones connected to the earth. Let yourself see the sense of uprightness that you're sitting with. It's not that you have to create it, it's already there, just bringing attention to it. As if there was a vertical axis or rather bringing the tension to the vertical axis, connecting your head to the middle of your chest, to your heart center, your abdomen, your spine, your spine, your body, your body. All the way down, down and up, from the inside. The sense of verticality, uplift, both uplift energetically. Connecting with mother's voice, reminds you summers, dashboard's my mind, your soul. into the earth through this verticality and connected to the heavens or the sky, proverbial heavens or the sky. So that you can relax into the verticality. It holds you, it grounds you. There is a structure. So thoughts aren't fleeting here and there and everywhere like getting whiplash. There is a sense of a brightness connection to the earth and up to the sky through your heart, through your heart center. So, thank you. 1 You you you you your body. Not just that the breath is moving up and down, As filling your whole body. As if your feet are breathing, your legs, your abdomen, your hands. Your back, your chest, your cheeks, the back of your head. disparaging your touch firm, worsen your desire. Flexing your wife. Okay, the focus is on body Receiving the breath. The whole body bellowing with the breath. In and out like a sphere, a round sphere. Expanding, contracting, bellowing. And what if the boundary of your body wasn't at your skin, didn't end there? But a few inches beyond your skin, it's porous, more space, more space. And you're imagining this breath being breathed, received by the body, bellowing. Further out into the space, sense of expansiveness. You don't have to push it out. Make sure you're not pushing it out, effortfully, just perceiving, oh yeah. There's more expansiveness than I realized. Look at that. Expansiveness all around. And then a few more inches. Further out. The breath in the mind's body, expansive. Received, pervading into space. Let yourself relax into the spaciousness. Relax into it. Spacious, easeful, all around. The breath. Bellowing, and maybe at some point even the edges completely disappear. The edges of this orb, orb of the body. The breath. Pervading expansively into space. Space all around. And along with the breath being breathed in, breathed out expansively. The edges of the orb disappearing, of the sphere disappearing. Your kindness, your good will accompanying this expansive breath. The breath shining naturally through yourself and all around. Relaxing into an expansive sphere of the breath intertwined with metta. Relaxing into an expansive sphere of the breath intertwined with metta. Relaxing into an expansive sphere of the breath intertwined with metta. Relaxing into an expansive sphere of the breath intertwined with metta.
