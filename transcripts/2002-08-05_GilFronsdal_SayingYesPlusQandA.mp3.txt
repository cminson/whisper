 I'd like to talk for a little while. It's kind of the same format I used yesterday morning. And then, spend hopefully half the time, we can have some discussion or you can ask questions. And the questions have two functions. One is that you can ask your questions and make your comments, what's important, and maybe I can reply the best I can. But also it gives me a chance to hear what's on your minds, what's on your hearts, your concerns you might have. Since I haven't been here much for at least four or five weeks now, I think, it's nice for me to get a little bit in touch with you. Also since you've had a lot of teachings all summer, all July from Taraniah, she told me there was not a lot of discussion. Maybe there was, but she told me there wasn't. So maybe it's nice to hear if you have any comments or questions around anything that's come up. So what I want to talk about is a little practice or a little attitude that has periodically is very important for me as I do my meditation practice. Many of you know that in our Vipassana practice, one way of doing it is to make mental notes, to help you stay in the present moment with your experience. We make little notes or mental notations, labels in the mind of what we're doing, what we're experiencing. Since I'm paying attention to the fact that I'm talking right now, I might note to myself, talking, talking, or seeing, seeing, hearing, hearing as a truck goes by. That's a great help because as we know, the mind wants to slip off the present moment endlessly. It doesn't want to stay there often. The present moment is like this sharp rater's edge, it's often said. Mostly the mind wants to roll off the edge to the past or to the future. The label is like an anchor to the present moment. At certain points in my practice, I found that the label that I liked using the most was, I labeled everything the same. My label was yes. Yes, yes. So the attitude or the practice of yesing, I want to suggest to you that maybe there are times when you want to try that out and it can be helpful. Today I went to pick up my son at his preschool, my four-year-old son. And preschool is an amazing place. And preschool teachers are my heroes, probably one of the most important professions going, underappreciated. And the first thing I heard walking in through the door of the preschool was, nothing's permanent. One of the teachers was telling the group of kids very rapidly sitting around the table listening and engaged in their snack. But it also had a humbling for me to go to the preschool because I realized how little I know about human nature. And it's such a challenge. So I show up there, but before I walked into the classroom and heard that little expression, there was all the kids and everybody was inside except there was one little girl outside with her father. And they had a kind of distance between them. I couldn't quite understand the distance, but then I got closer. I saw that she was in tears. It was dramatic. I mean, it was like, it was serious. I mean, it was like, if it was any normal person, like an adult, her fiance would have broken up or she would have been rejected from Stanford or someone had died. It would have been something really serious. And this poor girl was going through this tears and her father was keeping his distance and she was there. What's this about? And how do I relate? This human being who's obviously in terrible distress, the father is there, but you just walk right by. Do you just go over there and give her a hug and say something and find out what's going on? It's preschool. Preschool has this whole context. The teacher is kind of tracking things and they're very skilled. So what do you do? So I tried, I said something, I forgot what I said, but I said something very casual as it went by. It was hopefully compassionate or something. And I came through and went in and then I heard nothing is permanent. And then I learned a little bit later that it was a power play between her father and the girl. And the kind of policy at the school is that if you play with something, you put it away at the end of your play, before you play with something else at the end of the day. And it was the end of the day, your father was bringing her home. And the girl wanted her father to clean up for her. And the father, for his reasons, did not want to. And this was why she was crying. Preschool. So there's a man, another father to one of the kids in the school that teaches improvisational dance at Stanford. And the kids love him. And for part of his vacation, when he wasn't working, he volunteered the school. And he does improvisational play, I guess. I guess all play is improvisational for four-year-olds, but he just is right at home there. So I showed up and there, and he was already there, and the kids were climbing all over him, and there were like three kids climbing on his back. And sometimes kids like to hit him a little bit, and they have these plastic noodles, you know, that you don't hurt them. They go around, they play sword. And they were doing everything you can imagine on top of Tony. And Tony was on the floor, and they were jumping on top of him. And they were all having a good time. And then at some point the kids got distracted by something else, and Tony was laying there. And he's a friend of mine, so I went over to say hello. But he was still laying on the floor, and I said, can I jump on you too? And he said, yes. And he had his hands up like this. So I grabbed his hands and held them, and I wasn't going to jump on him, but then I just helped him up. I pulled him up, and he twisted himself up. And I said to him, you say yes a lot, don't you? And he said, yeah. He said that some time ago he heard an interview or something on maybe Saturday Night Live with, Michael Myers, that's a guy, right, that's a comedian? And he was talking about his work as a comedian. And he said that what he learned in doing improvisational comedy is you always say yes to whatever comes your way. You never say no or block what's happening, but you say yes and go along with it. And go with it. So then next thing I was talking to, that really was interesting for me, this attitude of yes to what comes your way. And the last little preschool story just from today, a little snippet with 20 minutes. And there's a lot more to tell you. I can probably spend the whole day, two hours talking about 20 minutes in preschool. But there was one of the most beloved teachers there had been gone for quite a number of months and actually left, and was just coming back and substituting a little bit. And she was back for, there was her second day there. She hadn't been around preschool for some time. And she explained how on Friday when she was there, she was telling the kids a story. But she was out of the preschool mode. And she was just telling a linear story that was all about being very real, all these real things that happened, real time, real space, real everything. And she had a hard time keeping the kids' attention. But today she found out that what was interesting for the kids is the imaginary world. And what she did with the kids, and she spent a whole hour with the kids, which was a long time, doing what's called the board story. Where you draw on the board, the chalkboard, the story as the kids relate it. And the kids all take turns, or try to take turns, because they're so enthusiastic, filling in the details of the story they're inventing as they go along. And it was all about a magic bus that goes flying, and teachers are in it and all the kids in it, and Tony's in it. And they go flying around into the past and into the future. So this idea of taking what comes your way and going along with it, playing with it, building on it, not saying no to it, not blocking it. And that is something I think we recognize from doing mindfulness practice that's very important, is learning how to get out of the way of our experience. Learning how not to block it, how to resist it, how in a sense not to say no to our experience. And one of the best places I know, safest places in life to not say no to your experience is in meditation. Where you don't have to do anything, you don't have to say anything, you sit there with the experience. And it's quite phenomenal to have a place in life where you can go and you can just let your thoughts, your feelings, your body sensations, whatever, course through you freely. And not feel like you have to judge them as being wrong or bad, or judge them in some way that, you know, or you have to inhibit them or stop them. That it's all allowed in the context of this big container, this sacred container, this beautiful spacious container of awareness where everything bubbles up and flows and goes. And one of the things we learn is that when we don't interfere with our experience, when we do this, allow it to be there and flow and move through us. And not interfering with it, we stop feeling it, feeding it. Because all too often we feed our experience. And it's the feeding of our thoughts, the feeding of our feelings, which often keeps them in place. So for example, something very simple like resentment is anger which is frozen. And what fuels or feeds the anger, what keeps us frozen, is the continual reassertion of that holding on to that idea or thought or hurt that we have. If it isn't frozen or even holding on to it, the anger would move through us and we wouldn't be so trapped by it. The idea of... So I'll give you another story, I've told a lot, I apologize, but it's kind of another yes story in a sense. The story of the ugly little runt of a troll, of a yaksa. Yaksa is kind of a minor spirit or god, an ancient Indian pantheon of gods. And he's a little ugly little runt. And he ends up going to visit Brahma's throne. Brahma is the great god of the Indian pantheon, kind of like the Zeus of the Greeks. And he goes to his throne and he sits on it when Brahma is away from his throne. And all the other gods around say, you can't do that. That's only the highest guy can sit on that throne and this is terrible and they start getting angry with him and say, get off that throne. And the more that the gods were angry with Brahma, with the yaksa, the troll, the bigger he got and more beautiful he got, till he was radiant and huge and strong. And so the gods were kind of confused. And so they went and found Brahma. And Brahma said, I know what to do. So he went back to his throne and stood in front of this yaksa and he bowed to him as he did in India and Buddhism. And he paid his respect and he said, oh, it's so good to see you. I'm so happy that you're here and it's helped you're comfortable in that throne. And what can I do for you? And as he offered his respect and his kindness, the yaksa shrunk and shrunk and got ugly and uglier, shrunk and shrunk and disappeared. And then Brahma went and sat in his throne and explained, that was an anger eating yaksa. It only food it eats is anger and the more anger you give it, the bigger it gets, the stronger it gets. So the idea of interfering with things involves how we feed and fuel our experience. And really one of the remarkable things to discover in meditation is this great thing about how if you get out of the way of your experience and really learn how to leave it alone, it self liberates. It kind of, the fuel for it is not getting refed constantly and it kind of dissipates. It kind of unwinds or resolves itself. So you don't have to be engaged in fixing your experience always. You don't have to be adjusting it and judging it and making it bad or whatever. If it's not meant to be there, it'll dissolve. If it's meant to be there, like the wholesome mind states like joy and delight and love, it'll tend to grow in the light of awareness. Because awareness by itself tends to dissipate or dissolve the unwholesome states of mind because it doesn't feed them. And there's a kind of somehow way in which awareness itself feeds the wholesome states, the beautiful parts of us. It's almost as if that beauty within us wants to thrive just when we don't interfere. And it's interfering which lets the unwholesome things thrive. So meditation is one of those places where we learn not to block what's happening, to interfere with what's happening, but in order for that to be safely done, you have to very clearly and honestly, and honestly is kind of the main word here, admit to yourself what is actually happening in the present moment. And that can sometimes be the hardest thing. To admit that you're angry or sad or happy or ambitious or all kinds of things. Admit that you're sitting here filled with sexual lust. I mean, you certainly don't want to admit it to the public, so sometimes you don't want to admit it to yourself. We have to admit what's going on. And in admitting it what's going on, that combination of allowing things to be, leaving things alone, and admitting that they're being really honest about it, that's where the safe container of meditation allows our spiritual life, our liberated life to unfold most beautifully. Does that make sense? So saying yes to the experience doesn't mean of course saying, foolishly saying yes to someone who wants something terrible from you, or doesn't mean you're a pushover for things. But there's a wonderful art, both in meditation and daily life, of learning how to take what comes your way and not putting up a block or resistance to it, not saying no to it. At the same time, wisely knowing how to take care of yourself, and then kind of going with it, kind of like a keto, where you kind of go with the energy of it. I've learned a lot of this with a little kid that I have, you know. It's just a drag to kind of say no all the time. You can't do that, you know, you can't have that. I mean, how many times in an hour can that kid say, I want that, I want that, I want that, I want that. Yesterday we were, you know, I don't blame him partly, I took him to Home Depot. And I noticed that I want that escalated the longer we were there. And so I think he was getting pretty frustrated and tired. It wasn't like he wanted these expensive items there. He wanted like that, you know, the flyers that are falling on the floor and, you know, just no stuff. And this is constant barrage, I want this, I want this. I try to tell him, you know, there's more important things in life than having. You know, there's like love and your friends. And I said all that, and then I wondered, you know, uh-oh, maybe I shouldn't tell him this this way because that's going to give him a bad taste in his mouth for those kinds of lessons in life, you know. But anyway, so, but you don't always say no to these kids, you know, but you don't want to always give in to them either. You have to choose your battles carefully. And so, but you know, there's a wonderful art of learning how to take what comes and say, in a certain way, say yes in a way that channels that in a way that seems appropriate for the parent or appropriate for the situation. And say yes, you know, and go with it. Not to be in a position to what's happening. What's happening with your friends when your friends come and talk to you? Is there some way you can say yes or not resist it and go with it? Improvisational friendship, improvisational everything. In fact, probably everything is improvisational, whatever we do. And one of the rules of improv is you don't say no. So those are my thoughts. I hope they're useful. Let you all decide whether they're useful if you experiment, investigate this topic somewhere on your own. So now it's your turn. You have any questions you'd like to raise or comments? I thought it was amusing and maybe very helpful that you said to say yes instead of labeling. I've found it very difficult to label things by feeling and hearing. I would, or itching or anything like that. I think feet and truck. And so I sort of thought that was wrong. But I guess it isn't. If you can say yes. Sometimes my mental note is I grunt at things. Anything that helps you keep you in the present and going with the experience. But usually I do it kind of like it becomes yes or kind of a grunt. For me, when I'm really flowing with the experience, I'm really right there. It's kind of hard for me to actually fall off. I'm kind of in this groove flowing with the present moment. And that's when, for me, the yes and the kind of little grunt seems to work the best to kind of keep me on track. For me, when my mind is not so concentrated and easily slips away, it seems to be more useful to name the experience as it actually is. In some simple way. But with mental noting, there's no right or wrong. There's no wrong and there's only right. There's only what works for you. And don't burden yourself with some idea of how they're supposed to. It just seems to take a little bit more brain power to figure out which senses in use. Just easier to think. See? Great. Yes? I find that sometimes I find it challenging when you're with someone else and you realize that there's a resistance to the flow of being with someone else. So I take that technique of labeling or saying something to note that while you're with that other person. But sometimes that, I guess ultimately once this technique evolves or it became good at it enough, the labeling, the amount of labeling that you do becomes shorter so that you can open to that other person. But I still sometimes feel like it takes me a while to get to that sense of flow with someone else because I'm so busy labeling as a way to diminish certain feelings of resistance or certain feelings of self-loathing or something that keeps the distance between me and the experience. And I guess I don't know if I'm asking, does the amount of time that you label get shorter? Because generally I guess there's no right way or wrong way that something happens. But I don't know. I guess I'm just sharing too. So the comment or the question was that she noticed that sometimes when she's with people in conversations or in relationship with people and she has resistance to people that she uses the mental labeling as a way of helping her work with that resistance. But she finds at the same time labeling keeps her a little bit distant from the person, kind of a little bit more removed then. And so then the question is, kind of the question is, if you keep developing this as a technique, the labeling technique, does it get better over time? Does it get quicker? Does it work quicker? So that the resistance gets dropped quicker and so there's less barrier between you and the person, you can drop the labeling, I suppose. And I think that mental labeling is, some people don't like doing it, never do it as part of their mindfulness practice. Some people do it a lot and some people do some thing in between that. It can be phenomenally useful but it's kind of like learning to ride a bicycle that at first is really awkward and people think that meditation is about having a silent mind and here you're making your mind noisy by labeling your experience. But it's kind of like riding a bicycle and once you ride it you can ride the bicycle without your hands, once you've learned to do it. So with the mental labeling it becomes almost second nature after a while and very easy. And it doesn't seem to make much ruffles in the mind and it keeps you on track, it's easier and easier. But there are ways in which the mental noting can be used, there's times for it and times not for it. Sometimes mental noting, people use it as a, not as a way of more clearly recognizing what's happening in the present moment, but they use labeling as a protection from the present moment. Like a mantra or something, if I keep labeling and naming this then I won't have to really open up to what's happening. And so with something like resistance which you don't like, are you really honestly admitting it or are you trying to somehow balance with it by labeling and keep it at bay or something and hopefully it goes away. But it isn't a kind of, I think labeling is an art form and you have to kind of try to figure out when the art form should be applied and if your goal in a given situation is to overcome your resistance and it's helpful then go for it. If your goal in a situation is to be intimate or close with your friend and it gets in the way then drop it if you can have a clear flow with the person. So you have to kind of decide yourself what you need, what you most need, what's the greatest benefit, what's the cost benefit analysis, how to make it work. But there's a shortcut to this in relationship. That's really great if you're brave. And that is you label out loud. And I really recommend it. Especially with people you really trust and say, you know, I'm sitting here and I feel all this resistance to you right now. I feel irritation right now. I feel fear right now. And they say, oh, what about? Well, in this conversation, you can be careful how you say it, right? So you don't feel like you're pouncing on them. But you should make eye statements, for example. But you label out loud. And a label is never an interpretation. It's never a judgment about the experience. So you label out loud and say, well, I'm feeling resistance right now. And, you know, I want to explore it. Part of my mindfulness practice is explore it and I'd like you to know about it. And I've done that with people. I don't know if I've ever told them I have resistance. But sometimes I've said, you know, I feel angry right now or I feel afraid right now. And I'd like you to know that's part of what's happening for me as I'm trying to sort out how to have this conversation with you. Mindfulness out loud. Honesty. I call honesty is mindfulness out loud. When that's happening to you, are you relatively calm at that time or is it just this kind of street consciousness? Are you relatively calm at that point when you have these random thoughts? So the question was, she was asking what to do with random crazy thoughts that you seem to come in on their own. And nothing to do with the past and the present, but just seem to arise. How do you practice with that? I think that's very calm. Because it's very common when people meditate to get somewhat calm sometimes. And when they get calm, the mind, the dream-like quality of the mind gets released. And also the mind sometimes get a little bit sleepy at that time. And then a lot of random thoughts or images can just surface and arise. And sometimes if the mind is calm, it also is a little bit complacent. The effort there to practice mindfulness is led up a little bit. And so the effort is not there to keep you on track, and so there's more space for these random thoughts to bubble up. There's two things you can do. A lot of things you can do, but one of them is to redouble your effort at getting concentrated. To develop concentration, go back and count your breath or be with your breath, or use labeling in a very concentrated way. But do something to bring more energy of concentration into the practice, to bring you to a deeper level of calm or concentration than that layer where that kind of random, bubbly thoughts might happen. Sometimes it's helpful to get up and do walking meditation, if that happens. Sometimes changing the context of the way you meditate can break the trance of that kind of thinking. And if the reason it's happening is that you're really sleepy. Sometimes it happens to me if I'm meditating late in the evening. And I'll redouble my effort, I'll do all these efforts to try to kind of deal with it. And sometimes nothing works. And my mind gets actually kind of quite really elaborate. I think I'm following my breath, I'm convinced I'm following my breath, but somehow in the middle of falling breath there's this huge play going on of characters and people flowing in and out. And it's somehow so camouflaged in the breath that I think I'm with my breath, but there's this amazing thing going on. And so then I go to sleep. So maybe some people need sleep more than they need meditation. Yes? I was thinking, and in some sitting I had the feeling, for a couple of seconds my mind was clear and detached and it was wonderful. But then I realized that that was happening. Of course it slipped away. And not only it slipped away, but it has now affected me in a worse way that whenever I sit, like, is it going to happen? Am I going to be there? Until then I was just happily labeling it and sitting and labeling it, going for the flow now that that has happened once. And it happened not as strong as that time, but it happened one more time. And now it's a big disturbance for me. Yes? So those of you who didn't hear it, she's been practicing this for some time and being present and labeling and going along her merry way. And then out of the blue came this experience of calm and clarity and stillness. And it lasted until she noticed it. And then I guess she got self-conscious or something happened. When you often notice these things you get kind of excited or something. And it went away. And now she's worse off than she was before. And she thinks, you know, this was a, you know, she's heard that these things might be good for me to think to happen in practice. But she thinks she's worse off than before because now she expects it to happen or wants it to happen or measures her experiences by, you know, that something happened. And, you know, like, you know, she tasted the forbidden fruit and now she's been kicked out of Eden and she can't, you know, she knows what she lost. Is that approximately what you said? Close enough. This is but this is classic. This is how many people in this room have had something similar to that? You feel better or worse. So the the you have to realize it's really common for this attitude to arise. The tendency to think that way relate to that experience with judgment or clinging or wanting or expectation or disappointment when it doesn't happen again is a common human tendency. It probably happens in other areas of your life and it's not happening here. And if spiritual life or meditative life is very important for you, it's sometimes more poignant when it happens here. But but take it as a good sign and take it as a sign that now you're becoming more conscious of how your mind works and you have a chance to try to resolve and deal with this deal with the issues of expectation or judgment of measuring yourself of all these things. And that's really a big part of where the work really is, is dealing with these things. And the experience of calm that you had is giving you the opportunity to deal with your reactions to it. And then once you've dealt with those reactions and responses, then next time it happens, it's less likely to be triggered and maybe it'll last a little longer. So I think it is a good sign. Just give yourself a pat on the back and go ahead and you're right on track. Yes. It's been a while ago, but the there's a story about I guess someone someone dies and it wakes up wherever you do after you die. And in this place where there's this amazingly beautiful feast, like deck table decked out with beautiful feast of food and every possible lovely fantastic food and all these beautiful people for company and music and beautiful views. And it just seems like paradise. And the person says, you know, where am I? Is this that I wake up in heaven and the dinner partner says, no, no, this is hell. And how can this be hell? He looks down at the place setting and there's these really, really, really, really long forks. That's kind of like a preschool thing to say, really, really, really. We're affected by who we hang out with. And so the person looks around and sees that people are really trying really hard to somehow get that food, delicious food into their mouth and they can't get it in because these forks are so big. And how do you get it in? And this person is horrified about how I'm going to start or how am I going to eat? You know, it's really tempting food. I can't get it in. And so it's just, you know, and the person next to him said, no, this is not heaven. This is hell. And heaven is exactly the same. But there everyone knows to feed the person across the table with the forks. So we're all in it together and it helps if we cooperate. Rather than just think for ourselves about ourselves. Was there ever a time when it's appropriate to say no instead of yes? Yes. I mean, in the context of meditation. Oh, sure. It can be. Sometimes it's given it's like one of the last strategies and all the other strategies have failed. You say no. Like, for example, when the mind is just keeps repeating, thinking about the same thing over and over again, you can't let go of it or keeps being in distracted thoughts over and over and over and over again. And you tried everything else to, you know, to be with it. And sometimes it's useful to just say no. Just absolutely firmly. No. And because sometimes the mind is like a toddler, you know, a kid. And sometimes you have to say no. You put limits and say that's not the way it's going to be. No. And, you know, so. Yes, sometimes it knows appropriate. So it's nice to be back. And it's nice to see all of you that I've seen before so many times. And I see a number of new faces here. And I want to be very happy to see people I haven't seen before and welcome you to our community. And I hope you all feel welcome here to come as you wish. And for those of you who are new, I realize that meditators sometimes, you know, kind of quiet people. We're basically nice people. It just takes a while to get to know us because we sometimes are quiet. So thank you all. And I'll see you in two weeks.
