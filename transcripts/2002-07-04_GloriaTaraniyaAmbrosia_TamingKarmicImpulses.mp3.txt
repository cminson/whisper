 Good evening everybody. Well, my name is Tar-Neha and well I wanted to do, take this opportunity to kind of focus on a particular topic for a series of Thursday nights and I thought what might be useful to you and I hope it is, you know, please tell me if it's not, I can always switch midstream and do something else but I thought that it might be useful to reflect some on karma, the experience of karma, like karmic tendencies and habits and patterns that arise in the mind and the heart, things that you see as a meditator and look at how it is that one can work with these kinds of tendencies so that tonight I'd like to look at just kind of the raw beginning to tame the patterns of mind that aren't particularly helpful to us, that kind of actually backfire and create a lot of suffering for us. They masquerade as something that's going to help and make us happy and bring us to more comfortable places but then in the actual experience of it, it's not the way it gets played out and then next week I thought I'd look at really working very specifically with difficult states of mind, like how do we do that as meditators, you know, it's not, you know from sitting on the cushion that it's not a case of just sitting down closing your eyes and going into blissful samadhi, you know, there's a lot going on in the mind and most of it is quite difficult, quite unpleasant and you know the whole idea with the meditation practice is to begin to discern how all of that is happening and how to get some control over it and how to get some understanding in relationship to it. So I thought I'd do that then the next week and then to look at, you know, not all of it is awful, you know, there's a lot of karmic tendencies and habits and patterns of mind that we have, they're actually quite lovely and we tend to focus a lot on the difficult things and don't notice our own goodness, you know, the kindness in our hearts and so I think it's very important as meditators to also to tune in to these kinds of states. So I don't want to talk only about the difficulties but it's about awareness, awareness of both extremes so we'll look at that in the subsequent weeks as well and then I think on Monday nights I'll be doing something with the foundations of mindfulness and then Sunday doing some more general talks about the Buddhist teachings and about practice, okay. So I wanted to look tonight at this topic of taming karmic patterns and habits. The Buddhist teachings tell us that in the unawakened state which is where we are, most of what the impulses that arise in the mind are sort of just very raw and fundamental, almost instinctive, not really that far removed from animal like impulses. Adhan Amara says that really in the unawakened state we're behaving much like primitive beings, where the basic impulses are to eat it, to kill it, or to mate with it, you know, sort of the energy that's always coming out of us with the things that we come into contact with and you know the Buddhist teachings are basically saying that we act foolishly because we don't have much control or understanding about these kinds of patterns and habits and we follow impulses, the primary impulses of gratification, trying to get things that we find attractive and repulsion and aversion, trying to get away from things that we find unattractive. So in this state we say we aren't much more evolved than the animals, you know, just really moving about from very, very raw and fundamental states of mind and the difficulty is that we can't seem to see the danger, we're that asleep. It's like we're like children in a way who you know maybe keep running out in the street after a ball and don't realize the harm and don't realize the danger that waits for them out there or putting dangerous objects in their mouth all the time, you know, in a way as we begin to wake up to it, I don't know about you but I have this feeling with my own meditation practice of it almost being a little embarrassing to see how strong some of these raw impulses were and how little control I had over them. So the Buddhist teachings appoint us to the fact that we're really blind to a lot of these drives that are actually predicting and creating our actions and that most of it in this unawakened state is actually creating very difficult and unhappy states of mind for us. It wouldn't be a problem if we were always acting at our very kind and loving states of mind but we aren't and so the net result of it is that we aren't very happy. Following impulses like the ideas that if I just get this thing or do this thing or have this thing, I'll be happy or if I could just get away from this condition, this person, this situation, I'll be happy. And never really delving deeper into that experience and seeing if in fact that's true. So this is why we have the meditation practice to begin to give us some tools to work with to see our own states of mind and see for ourselves if following these impulses that seem very organic and very natural at one level but to see for ourselves if they're actually delivering, if we actually get the things we want if we're actually happy, if we get away from the things that we don't want if we're actually happy. Now there's a lot of really fabulous sutas that the Buddha taught to help us to understand what's going on with the mind and one of them which I love is called the six animals. I don't know if you've heard this one before but he talks about these animals that live in the jungle and in the forest and he says now what if a person came along and took these six animals and tied them up and basically they're a snake, a crocodile, a dog, a monkey, a bird and I always forget one. Let's see, oh the jackal, that's why I always forget him. He's the one that lives in the charnel ground and each of these animals has a domain. They're very comfortable in different domains and so they're always trying to get to their own domains. So what would happen if someone came along and sort of harnessed each of them tying a rope around the neck or the body of each of these animals and then just tying each of those ropes together so that what you have is this knot in the center with these six animals. What would happen? And so he describes this and he says well they would just dart here and there in all different places, each one trying to get to their own domain. The bird would try to get into the air, the jackal would try to get to the charnel ground, the snake would try to get to the anthill. And what would happen is that for a time one of those would be the strongest and that's where the whole gang of them would have to go and then that one would weaken and another one would get strong and they would all have to go with that one. And he said this is just like someone who hasn't developed mindfulness, who hasn't developed concentration and the six animals are compared to the six senses, the seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching and then thinking as well. In Buddhism we have the six senses so that what happens is in this unawakened state we're captivated and mesmerized by what's going on at each of these sensory levels, at each of these sense doors so that for a while it might be a sight and then we're totally caught up in it, we go with that and then something else gets strong, a sound, a thought, a feeling. And this is our experience, it's just a constant parade of sights, sounds, smells, sensations, thoughts, feelings and that's what we're doing. We're just kind of following each as it arises, being captivated by it for a little while and then putting it down. I've experienced it like channel surfing, where you've got the remote and you're clicking the channels and it's got, whatever channel is on has got like two and a half seconds to captivate you and if it doesn't do it then you go to the next one. And this is what it's like, we just kind of mesmerized by all of the things that appear to us at each of the sense doors. Have you felt this? It's amazing to begin to see it, you know. A number of years ago a friend of mine and I used to like to go shopping a lot and we would go into the stores and there was this feeling like we didn't even particularly want anything. You know, like you didn't go in looking for I need this or I need that. It was just this sense of wanting something, you know, and just go into the store and almost with this attitude of I don't know what it is but when I see it I'll know it, you know. And that would be the thing that won. That would be the thing that got my attention, the biggest and that I stayed with and to the extent that I consumed it. Now it's like this. This is actually how it is every moment, if we're honest. And the effort in meditation is to begin to still that a little bit, begin to get a sense of that as what's going on. There's another sutta that I love called, I think it's called the all that is or something like that but it's a similar one where the Buddha is telling us or pointing to the fact that there are these things going on at each of the sense stores and there is seeing, there's hearing, smelling, tasting, sensing and thinking and feeling and there is the knowing of that. That in reality, in the purest sense, that's actually all that's going on. There is a sight, there is a sound, there is a smell and there is the experience of seeing, hearing, smelling and there is a sense of knowing that, of being aware of that. And with mindfulness, we can be aware of sensory experience and not make more of it than that. Just kind of settle down and begin to rest more peacefully in a sense of having seen something, having heard something, even having thought something, which is to me fascinating. I mean, it can take a while in the meditation practice to get enough objectivity on our thoughts and feelings to be able to see them objectively and just see them as that much. You know, to know that you're thinking and not get so completely caught up in the content of the thought, just to be able to rest with it in a way that knows that that's what's happening. You know what I mean? It's a very subtle experience, but wonderful when you can begin to do that because if you can feel that, then one literally isn't consumed by one's thoughts or driven by one's thoughts. You can actually just simply know that that's what's going on. So, you know, the awakened state is one that rests in that place of knowing what's happening, simply knowing what's happening. Now, it would be wrong really to say that the goal of practice is to walk around in that state. You know, for most people that wouldn't be a very attractive idea to just walk around knowing, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, sensing. You know, I don't know if that's even possible. It might be possible in the case of an Arahant or someone, but I'm actually not sure. But at any rate, it's not what we're trying to do. I think what he's saying in the sutta is to begin to get a sense that that's really all that there is. That's really all that's going on. And that you can sort of demystify the whole experience and demesmerize, disenchant ourselves from the whole sensory world a little bit if you get a sense of it as just being simply that much. So our purpose is just to slow it down and see it for what it is. That's not to say that you don't go after things that you need or get away from things that are difficult. Can you see what I'm saying? It's not a case of abandoning that altogether, but just to begin to see that that is the process that's happening. Just to give you a few examples, some kind of nice, good, juicy ones that people can relate to, I hope. Just consider the idea of, you might notice a wish to go and eat a pizza or go and have some of your favorite foods to eat. So the idea is to begin to get a sense, not just on the cushion but throughout the day, how did that arise? How did that happen? You find yourself going to Pizza Hut. And just to reflect a little bit, see now, how did that happen? Was it a commercial that you saw and maybe a billboard or maybe you pass a Pizza Hut one day? I know if this has happened to me, well, it might be three days of thinking about pizzas and not really aware of how that even got started. And all of a sudden you're in there and you're following that urge but not really noticing that it was a sight. It was something that I saw or maybe something that I smelled or something, an idea that somebody put in my head and that's how that happened. Just begin to get a sense of how these apparent decisions are being made, how we are following our impulses. Another one that actually is a true story where a number of friends and I were out one night after, it was actually after a meditation sitting and we went and got a piece of cake at this great place in Winston-Salem, North Carolina where you saw that and they have these fabulous desserts. So we would go in there sometime and have a nice dessert after the evening program. And one night we were eating this Italian cream cake and it was so delicious that somebody said, this is great, you know, we really need to do this more often. Let's do this every Tuesday night. And so then within a few seconds everybody had their calendars out and we were looking to see whether we were free, whether we could all get together on Tuesday nights to do this until somebody caught it and said, do you see what we just did? It was like a pleasant flavor and out of that pops this longing to have more of it. And then before you know it, within a few seconds, we had a plan to do this every Tuesday night. It was like crazy, you know, just out of this experience of something delicious. And the irony is that in the midst of that we were still eating our cake, but nobody was even tasting it, you know, because when you follow these kinds of impulses, then that becomes the experience, the attachment to the idea. And it actually is, it's born out of a pleasant taste and by going with the idea you've actually moved away from the taste. You know, the pleasure is happening right now. It's not happening next Tuesday, but we're missing it because we've just created this whole urge and are following it. You can get a sense of this, it's fascinating to watch how the urge is actually taking us away from now, which is the only place where one could actually experience pleasure. You know, it's not going to happen tomorrow. Tomorrow never happens, you know. It's just fascinating to watch ourselves do this. I was talking to a friend recently who had bought a car, bought a new car, and there she was just driving it off the showroom floor and with the keys in her hand and she stood there by this car and she had this, suddenly had this mindful moment and she said, now how did this happen? How did I get here? You know, and then she remembered that a few weeks ago, a few weeks prior to that, she was taking a long trip and the car was not comfortable and the seat, the back, her back was very sore on this trip and now, 30,000 dollars later, it's like it hit her that really, that's how it happened. It was an uncomfortable moment that came out of a long trip in the car and possibly something that could have been remedied with a pillow, you know, a 399 pillow. And yet here she was, you know. So it's just to think about these things. I mean, don't get me wrong, the teachings aren't saying don't eat pizza and don't enjoy cake and don't get new cars, you know. It's more saying just notice how these things happen because then you're freer. You're not at the mercy of these impulses. This is how our lives are driven. This is how the decisions in our lives get made. This is how the course of our lives is determined just by moments exactly like these and here we are. So the idea with the meditation practice is to begin to shine some light on moments like this so we have options. It's not necessarily the case that one has to follow these things. It's okay if you do but the idea is to do it with some semblance of awareness, some semblance of knowing and discerning whether or not this is the thing that you actually want to do, not because it's convenient or easy or gratifying or going to get us away from something unpleasant. So the Buddha asks, going back to the six animals, he asks in the same sutra, he presents a whole other scenario. He says now what if you took those same six animals and you tied them on a rope and but then you took all six ropes and tied them to a stake and then hammered the stake into the ground. You know what would happen then and what you would have is each animal going off in the direction trying to get away from this stake and over the course of time finding one just getting weary with the effort because then you really can't go very far. You know tying it to the yoke of mindfulness is what it's compared to and really getting the experience of what it's like not to necessarily follow all of those impulses and what would happen if you can restrain yourself enough to reach that point where the fascination with sense objects begins to diminish and then he creates this beautiful image of the animals just laying down by the stake, just resting, relaxed. It's not an irritated state. It's a state of ease. It's a state of relaxation. There's not a case of constantly running off to everything trying to gratify itself in its domain. Can you feel that? I love that. I love that image. So you begin to settle into seeing that really it's just that much. It's just this movement of the mind over and over again. There are sights and sounds and smells, sensations, thoughts, even our own thoughts and feelings that just kind of mesmerize us and we incline towards them. But you can through the meditation practice just relax. You can just relax and notice this whole experience and this in itself is a certain freedom, isn't it? You really don't have to do anything more than that. You can just settle down a little bit. This is the settling aspect of meditation, the relaxing, the tranquilizing, the not being so caught up in everything. That right there is enough. If your meditation practice is nothing more than that, it's great. You get a lot more happy with that kind of ease. But the Buddhist meditation practice takes us to another level, which is understanding and discernment and insight so that by observing this whole thing over the months and years of practice, you begin to see how it's operating. And so your detachment, your restraint in going off to everything that arises is actually being governed by something else. It's being governed by an understanding because you begin to see that this whole process can be understood. It can be managed. You can see that for ourselves, and this is really where the Buddhist teachings are so rich, you know, begin to see whether or not the going off is actually gratifying and whether or not they're getting away is actually getting us to a happy state. And through that kind of observation, once you begin to see in that way, then the settling becomes even stronger and stronger and stronger. You know, you just get this peace and this happiness, this wonderful contentment. It's like with things as they are, you know, the way it is right now is fine. You know, one doesn't have to always be setting something up as something to attain, something to move towards, or something to get away from. You know, otherwise it's just, it's all so compulsive. You know, one of my teachers said this one time and it just struck me the way he said it. You know, in the unawakened state, it is all compulsion. It's just feeding itself. It's just drives and impulses that get followed and get reinforced and therefore become a new drive and a new impulse. And there's no freedom in that. There's no contentment. There's no sense of ease in any of that. If we follow everything like that, it's like, did you ever know anybody who sort of just picks up every fad or every new idea, everything that comes along and has to go with it, you know, has to follow it. You know, I knew somebody like this once and it was painful to watch. There's somebody that we, you know, my friends and I all love very dearly, but she was just, she would get so captivated by the latest things and then have to, like she'd actually go so far as to get trained in it and learn all about it and then start a business and, you know, get stationary and set up an office and, you know, do this and then follow something like that for a while and then within a few months that was all over, drop that, disassemble everything and pick up the next thing. You know, and she would drive herself crazy and it was hard as the people in her life who loved her to watch this pattern, this habit, because there was never a sense of ease, you know, never a sense of contentment, never a sense of just being okay with things as they are. And then there's also this, you know, you never actually build a sense of confidence in your sense of things, you know, the way you see it, the way you want it. It's always kind of being driven by external forces. What the world says is the best way to be, the best outfit, the best hairdo, the, you know, the best thing to own, all of that. So this, I think that this sutra really points to a very important aspect in the teaching of, particularly the meditation practice, but the teachings in general and that is the value of, the importance of restraint, a certain restraint that comes with mindfulness, just being aware of what arises and not necessarily having to follow it all the time. This is a very considered methodology in the Buddhist teachings, you know, to endeavor, to practice restraint with regard to these impulses. You know, when you think, maybe you don't always think about it this way, that meditation is really largely exercises in restraint. I think if we put that out at the first meditation retreat, people might not come again, you know, the idea, I mean, if you thought that's what you were doing, sitting here hour after hour, certainly on retreats, where it goes on for days, you know, what are you doing? You're sitting there restraining the impulse to act on what arises, restraining the impulse to get caught up in the thoughts that arise and the feelings that arise, restraining the impulse to build stories around the things that you hear and the things that you see, and just endeavoring to settle back enough to see those impulses arise, to break your experience down enough such that you notice that there's a sound, you notice in the next moment the thoughts that are created around that sound, you notice the moods of the mind and relationship to that, right? And just, that's what we're doing. We're actually restraining the normal or habitual impulse and just trying to see if we can get a sense of it instead, to observe it, to know it, to understand how it's happening. And the reason for this is very important. If we don't do that, if you're always following everything, then you never get any understanding. You can't see the process as long as you're completely caught up in the content, as long as we're completely consumed by what's going on. And it's seeing the process of the mind and the body that is where the wisdom comes, where our understanding. This is the understanding that is the liberation. This is how it is facilitated. So, but it's very important to understand this quality of restraint, because it's, you know, normally I think we think of restraint as like a leash or a whip or something like that, you know, these kinds of harsh methods of containing something. And maybe perhaps sometimes when states are very difficult, you may have to be quite firm. But generally the quality of this restraint has to be very, very loving. It has to be very soft. You know, Ajahn Sumedhar talks about the tyrannical patriarch, you know, this activity in the mind that's always kind of cracking the whip and knocking ourselves around. And it's to be avoided whenever possible, that this quality of beating ourselves up for what we see or for our impulses. So really the quality of restraint has to be much more like the restraint of a loving mother who's trying to, say, keep a child from going out in the street after the ball, you know, keeping it from putting harmful objects in its mouth. It's done with utmost care and love and concern, not out of a sense of thrashing or trying to force a behavior. And then it just gets righteousness, you know, it just gets to be like this quality of a should. You know, meditation practice can have a lot of should in it. And it really is important for us to notice that and try to avoid it. It's not the right quality that you want in the heart. You have to really cultivate this sense of relaxation and ease so that what one is aware of can be done with the utmost gentleness and kindness of heart. So the, just looking at this quality of restraint like we do with the sutta and the six animals, just to get a sense of the rewards of just doing that much, even if we don't know why we're doing it initially, you know, over time what happens through this kind of practice is that, you know, you settle into a state of being with things and being okay with whatever. It's like, I don't know about you, but I've seen it all in my mind. I've seen it all. And it doesn't matter anymore because you're not so caught up in and identified with what arises. But from this place of relaxation and ease, it's like, it's okay. It's not personal. You know, what arises is fine. Well, the conditions of my life are fine. The conditions of today are fine. You know, cultivating a sense of being okay with whatever arises. So you end up with this kind of strange contentment, you know, with things as they are. Just when the heart isn't always grabbing, then you have a much more, a much greater capacity for appreciation of what is, if you can feel it. It's like the craving heart, the heart that's filled with longing for other, can't appreciate anything. You know, can't appreciate this moment for what today has to bring. So settling into this sense of just being at peace with things as they are. And eventually, we get to see that the problem is not as the mind would have us believe that if we could just get things or get away from things, everything would be all right. The problem is that that craving or that longing arises in the first place. That's the difficulty. Because if the moment before that arose, everything was fine. You know, and I guess meditation practice is kind of like getting us back to there, getting us back to the state or the condition without the longing for something else. That's the issue. And it's very subtle. I mean, I find over the years of meditation practice, what has been accomplished or what has been realized is a wonderful okayness with oneself. You know, like whatever your karma is, whatever are the conditions of your birth, the situations in your family, how you look, how you feel at any given moment, the people that we have in our lives, it's all okay. Can you imagine really being able to realize a state where it's okay? It's good enough. It doesn't have to be more. Then we're really starting to enjoy the fruits of the the Buddhist teachings and practices. I don't know about you, but certainly when there's moments like that, one feels a tremendous gratitude, you know, great happiness for hearing these teachings and having the good sense to listen, you know, having the good sense to try to apply it, you know, but that's that right there is very good karma. It's fabulous. And you know, something that we can feel good about that each of us comes to a place like this and has ears to hear and a sense to listen. So this kind of restraint has a certain quality in it that it's in itself, it's its own reward, you know, just the experience of settling into things as they are is its own reward. And we in a funny kind of way, you tap into states that are a lot more pleasant than the thing that the mind is setting up as if I could just have that it would really be pleasant. But then, you know, we know after doing that over and over and over again, that that's not the way it is. And one begins to experience that resting, relaxing and now being okay with now is actually a lot more happy, a lot more contented space. So these are some thoughts I thought might be useful for you tonight. I hope they are. And let's see if we have a few minutes if there's some, if you have some thoughts of your own or some questions. Yes. I went to see the daughter, and he made this little tiny comment at one point, which I've been thinking about the whole time, favorite talk, he said, you know, I'm up here on the stage and I have all these teachings I've spent my life, you know, working with and I can now teach you. But he said, you know, I'm still a man. My mother does. I'm going to cry. And I think about that sort of. I don't know if it's a struggle, but it's a kind of like a question I have like, okay, well, if I I guess my life is centered around my practice, so, but when these things happen, it's still a little bit hard. And I guess I guess I have something, well, if I didn't have this practice, it would be a lot worse. At some point there is a basic nature in there. It's a detachment. Attachment is part of the human condition. When we're born, we have a detachment to our character. Yes, but I think the the condition of grieving over a parent who has died is not necessarily one that's filled with attachment. I think that what what he was pointing to is that once we get the reactive patterns out of the way, which would actually disturb the more human response in a moment like that of loss, then you're free to actually feel those things a lot more fully and a lot more deeply. Like the Buddhist teachings aren't a promise of freedom from pain and freedom from those kinds of experiences in life, but their freedom from adding anything to that or living in denial of them. Somebody could have a loss like that of a loved one and go into states of tremendous denial or rejection or go into Great Depression, grief-stricken, or just kind of ignore the whole thing. I think what we're saying here is that what you would actually quote-unquote accomplish through the meditation practice is an open-hearted receiving of what is a normal and appropriate human response to that kind of pain. Personally, I love it. You're much more alive. It's not that it doesn't keep coming back. I lost my mother a few years ago. The thought of the last few months of caring for her and the thought of the experience that she had of dying, which wasn't very pleasant and certainly very difficult to watch. She has some tremendous denial and not wanting to actually admit that it was happening. The pain as a daughter watching her die like that, for a while I wanted her to die another way. That's what was off. That's the thing that I think the Dalai Lama is pointing to in that example where you don't ... I suffered a lot for the first few months because I wanted her to die in a more awake way. She wasn't and she never did. It took a while for me to get it, that she was going to die the way she was going to die. If I would stop overlaying my wishes or my hopes or my desires onto that and just receive the pure and simple experience of what was presenting itself to me, then it would go a lot easier for her and for me. Without the overlay, you actually can't respond with much more compassion. I think that's what's left really when our sort of unawake patterns are not engaged, when you're not resisting or wanting and just being with the experience, then what's left when these aberrated states of mind aren't present is kindness and compassion and open-heartedness. We see it for ourselves. The Buddhist teachings say, look and see, don't take my word for it. Clear your mind of the aberrated states and see what's left. I'll be darned if it isn't like this happy, bright mind, you know, sort of in its natural state. I really like the part that you were talking about this practice being one of restraint. One of the areas that I run into difficulty with is sometimes seeing things that perhaps aren't wholesome and some subtle aversion coming up, rather than really investigating them and coming to some realization of how painful it is. There's just sort of this automatic, well, vipassana romances, don't do that. So I can find some quite often some fairly sometimes not so subtle, but sometimes subtle aversions coming. And I was wondering if you might talk about kind of how to work with that. Right, right. And it's, you know, you're pointing to the subtlety of the reactive patterns of, you know, greed, hatred and delusion. We will respond to what arises out of these states. And that includes our own states of mind. So that here comes a certain pattern of our thinking and we don't like it. You know, we want it to be similar. We want ourselves to be some other way. We want to have a different thought, you know, or we want, you know, we want this one, we don't want that one. That kind of thing will happen all the time. So you, it's actually, I just want to congratulate you first of all, at the capacity to be able to see that there's a tremendous amount of objectivity to be able to notice the aversion to one's own states of mind. So, you know, rather than getting into, just to remember that, because one thing that can often happen is that you really start to get into a cyclical thing of hating the state of mind and trying to get rid of it and then hating that you hate that state of mind and trying to get rid of that. Then hating that you hated that and trying to get rid of that. It's just, you know, you can really spin out on it. So just contemplate that initially and that can, right there, it can soften you a lot around aversion. You know, the fact that you can see aversion can make your heart happy. You know what I mean? So, you know, I would say do that first, you know, contemplate that a little bit and just notice that in that contemplating that this is the way it is in the unawakened state. We have these ideas of ourself, you know, we have an image of ourselves and when what we do does not go along with that image, then we fight it and resist it and hate it. And so I find in moments like that, if you can settle down just a little bit more, it's like experience this kind of sense of like almost being on an elevator and going down under all of that and get even more settled such that you're looking at that state from a much more still place. Can you feel that? Like get down under the aversion to the mind states that are arising in my mind, right? Can you feel that? Like and from that vantage point, you're much more capable of seeing the process of the mind from an even more detached perspective and that's what has to happen because basically there's a subtle aversion to aversion or subtle aversion to greed, right? Then when you get down there, it changes the whole dynamic. It's like, wow, did you see that? This is really interesting. I just did that and then I hated that and then I liked that and then I wanted that and at that level, you're not in it anymore. You know, you've broken it. You start back. Yeah, yeah, you do. You've broken it. It's fascinating. The next moment you may go back in. That's okay. And really be happy for little wins, little moments. They count for a lot. They're much bigger than we think. I just want to set a few more minutes before we go.
