 So Happy New Year. And we have a year ago when we had the opening Dharma talks here at the center, I talked about the Four Noble Truths and the opening celebration we read the Buddha's first discourse which was about the Four Noble Truths. And I thought I would, as I did yesterday morning, I thought I would take the opportunity now to talk a little bit about the Four Noble Truths since they're so central to what we do here in the practice and in Buddhism in general. Over the years I've encountered a good number of people who have come to hear a Dharma talk for the first time and left quite happy. Sometimes they left me perplexed, that's also true, but quite happy. And what they say is that they've always felt that there was something off in the world, there was suffering in the world, and that most of the people around them or all the people around them didn't ever seem to really want to address it directly. They wanted to avoid it, they wanted to brush it off or deny it or all kinds of ways in which people in our society or any society I suppose will try to avoid suffering, talking about recognizing it. And sometimes people will very actively say no it's not that way at all and they'll have to paint a very beautiful, idealistic picture of how reality is. And then they'll spend a lot of times, a lot of effort to try to maintain the picture at the cost of what reality is insisting on us. And so they hear a Dharma talk where they emphasize what Buddhists do is they pay attention to suffering. They recognize the suffering that's in the world. There's an active attempt by Buddhists not to avoid suffering, not to pretty it up, not to live in some ideal, but to actually face it directly and admit how it is, this world of ours. And it makes them very happy. They found some place they kind of feel, finally someone's willing to talk about it. At this last retreat that I taught, there was a woman there who had spent 22 years in an Eastern religious tradition where the kind of philosophy was there's so much suffering in the world so to balance it we're going to focus on joy. And people became great adept, she became very good in meditation going into bliss states and spent a lot of time, she became a teacher in that tradition. And she came to Spirit Rock because she was taking a sabbatical from her tradition to see what else there might be. And rather than always kind of going off into bliss states, to really kind of sit down and face reality as it actually is, not, you know, pritting it over. And it took some doing to help her with that. And what I took with her was, she was in a meditation retreat, right? I prohibited her from meditating. For 24 hours don't meditate. Because any kind of meditation was her crutch. And so don't meditate and stay at the retreat and keep the silence. And she came, she walked around and looked in the rivers and sat in the room and journaled and things and discovered how precious it is to really connect with reality directly without, you know, pritting it over or avoiding it. So the idea of, you know, facing suffering directly. So we've been here now for one year and a little bit tongue-in-cheek but also a little bit seriously. People come here to suffer at our center. Who would want to come, right? This is where you come to suffer. You come to suffer really well. And we specialize in helping you suffer. And, and now of course we don't want you to suffer. And of course we want people not to suffer. That's the whole purpose of Buddhism is to help people not to suffer. But part of the prescription is to be very realistic about your suffering and to really face it and admit it and look at it. And by being very realistic about it, then knowing wisely what to do next about it. And there's very common teaching in many spiritual traditions that if you avoid, if you try to run away from something, it chases you. But if you run towards it, you can somehow resolve it. So running away from suffering, some people find just doesn't work. And, but running towards your suffering in a healthy way, facing it, is a way of resolving it, dealing with it, and coming to terms with it, and hopefully becoming free of it. It's a little bit encapsulated this idea in the life story of the Buddha where he rejected ascetic practice. He spent many, many years doing ascetic practice where, even though you're kind of emphasizing suffering, causing himself great suffering, he was doing it as an attempt to try to escape from this world, to separate the soul in a sense from this world and not have part of it and free himself in that way. And what he found was it was an alternative to asceticism in forced suffering. And that was basically you sit down and you face what's here. And you study the suffering that's actually here. You don't have to add anything more to it. So when I was a young Zen student, I found that sitting with a certain amount of pain was a little bit helpful for my concentration. So I asked my teacher if I should sit in full lotus. And he said, no, we don't go looking for suffering. We don't go creating it. We don't make it happen. But when it comes to us, then we look at it seriously. We take it seriously. We stop for it. Now, why would you want to stop for your suffering? Certainly to learn from it and learn the wise response, wise approach to it. And sometimes it's appropriate to delve further into it, be directly with it. And sometimes it's appropriate to do something different. Sometimes it's appropriate to find joy, to find an antidote for it. If suffering is causing too much distress and kind of quicksand, kind of the psyche is just kind of sinking into depression in an unuseful way, then sometimes it might be helpful to do something different, to focus on peace or calm or joy or something like that. So there's a place for that. But it's done realistically as, oh, this is helpful. This is a helpful antidote. This is just the right medicine. And then once I'm kind of stabilized myself, then I'll turn around and deal with this directly. So it's not an escape. It's a temporary kind of withdrawal in order to come back stronger and to be with it directly. One of the reasons to be with suffering that is emphasized in Buddhism is that in some way or other, suffering is a source of inspiration or faith or spiritual motivation. And if you cut yourself off from your suffering, don't really stop and pay attention to it, then you actually cut yourself off from the potential for that suffering to generate tremendous motivation to try to do something about that suffering, to resolve it, to deal with it. And so it's said in the classic texts that faith, which is a, or confidence or trust or something, which is a very important spiritual quality, is conditioned or arises out of our contact with suffering. So rather than suffering being all bad, suffering can have a very useful quality since faith is indispensable for following the path all the way. Another reason to pay attention to suffering is we can learn what our attitude is towards suffering. And each of us probably has our own characteristic way of relating to suffering, our own common strategies that we have. For some people, it's the refrigerator. And for some people, it is blaming. And for someone else, or blaming ourselves. Or for some people, it's some other desire, going off in the desire realms, wanting things and running away by wanting to compensate in a sense by pursuing desire, some desire. And for some people, then it's aversion or blame or criticism or anger that is a strategy that kind of avoids really dealing with it directly. For some people, it's restlessness or agitation, anxiety, which takes over worrying as a strategy of not really dealing with the suffering directly, but kind of hovering with it. And then for some people, it's resistance or lethargy, kind of giving up. And for some people, it's doubt, not knowing what to do, filled with doubt. There's a lot of different strategies we have, and everybody has a strategy until they become, they become maybe liberated. So it's useful to kind of look and see what is your individual strategy for, in an unwise way, dealing with your suffering. Well, how do you avoid it? How do you avoid really facing it directly and being within a simple way? Are you afraid of it? Do you assign meaning to it? This means that. This means that something about yourself. I suffer, therefore I am a failure, or this is embarrassing, or this means that, you know, it's always going to be this way. And there's all these attitudes and beliefs that we might have around this thing we call suffering that complicates the suffering. And what we're looking for is to have a very uncomplicated relationship to suffering and to not suffer more, not add, not pile suffering on top of suffering. And why? The fundamental reason in Buddhism is to pay a careful enough attention to the suffering so we can see the second noble truth. So the first noble truth is very simply the truth of suffering. It's sometimes said that Buddhists are real pessimists, the party poopers, because they keep talking about suffering. And the Buddhists say that life is suffering. The Buddha didn't say that in the Four Noble Truths. The Buddha emphasized there is suffering in this world. And you don't have to go very far to find that. It's, you know, admitting it, calling it like it is. And then the Buddha went on to say the second noble truth is the cause of suffering. And I'll get back to that in a moment. The third noble truth is the possibility of ending the suffering. And the whole purpose of the Four Noble Truths is not to state the philosophical creed or metaphysical creed that you have to believe, but rather is stating those truths which can help lead you to that possibility of ending suffering, that freedom of heart that is represented by liberation, liberation from suffering. So there's one scholar who translates the Four Noble Truths, the word noble, by the word ennobling. It's the Four Ennobling Truths because they have a function. They're not abstract ideas you're supposed to hold onto. They have a function to help us in a particular way, to help ennoble us. And I remember once Ajahn Jung-Yin, who's a Thai forest master, who will probably come and teach for us in June for a day long. He was talking to the Spirit Rock teachers, teacher Vipassana teachers, and he loves to laugh. And he was laughing and he was talking about suffering, the First Noble Truth, suffering. And he said, suffering is holy. Suffering is really sacred. And it's a little bit juxtaposition. Most of us don't think of suffering as being something sacred and holy. And what he meant was, if we have the right attitude towards our suffering, if we approach it with wisdom and mindfulness and clarity of really looking at it deeply, there's a possibility in the suffering to be ennobled, to be set free. So in that sense, it's sacred if you use it that way. So the ennobling truth of suffering, it sounds a little bit better, right, than just the truth of suffering? How is it that suffering is ennobling has been the theme of the talk so far? How is it helpful? So then in order to really be helpful, you have to understand the cause. And the Buddha defined the cause by this almost poetic word, kind of, I take it as a non-technical word, the very simple kind of biological word of thirst, tanna. We talk in English about the thirst for power. And using a word like that, I think it's our task to fill in the, kind of like a blank, kind of gives us kind of a general idea. And then we have to kind of fill it out in our individual life. What does thirst look like in our life? How is it that, so clinging, greed, craving, hate, aversion, resistance, obsession, being obsessed, compulsion, drivenness, all these could be synonyms for the word thirst. And all these, it said, produce suffering. And suffering is many different words for suffering. That's also kind of a general word that you're supposed to fill in with your words like anxiety and fear and depression and frustration and anger and grief and limitation and sorrow and a lot of good words, right? And so how is it that clinging or craving or thirst or attachment produces suffering? You know, as varieties. And that's what we need to look at in our own lives. What is the connection? The first connection that can be emphasized is that craving or clinging is suffering in and of itself. So you don't have to, it's not that it causes suffering in the future, but to have the mind tight and contracted is painful. So that's one way. And then it does tend to create suffering kind of secondary or down the line, sometimes terrible suffering. If we cling to wanting things to be a certain way and reality doesn't accommodate, that clinging will probably lead to frustration and anger or sad or something. If we don't cling, there isn't that power in the psyche to generate, to fuel the sadness of the frustration. It's the clinging which gives it fuel, makes it fire to burn. So can we understand our clinging? Can we see the connection? One of the most remarkable summaries of the Buddha's teaching is very, very simple. And that is, if you cling, you'll suffer. And if you let go of the clinging, the suffering stops. And that's all you really need to know what the Buddha taught. I'll go home. But what happened is the Buddha spent 40 years teaching, basically expanding on those two things, talking about how clinging causes suffering and talking about how the release of clinging, the ending of clinging, releases us from the suffering. And so in a sense, the highest of these four noble truths, if there is a hierarchy of them, is a third one that says there is a possibility of bringing suffering to an end by the release of clinging. And it's a little bit anticlimactic. It's not very sexy in terms of great world religion. Someone asks, what's your highest thing in your religion? You say, well, the ending of suffering. It doesn't sound so great. It doesn't sound so great. I mean, some people commune with God and we just end suffering. But what is it? What would you say the experience of the ending of clinging, the ending of suffering is like? What are some of the synonyms for it? Peace. Liberation. Openness. Sorry. Communion. Feeling of unity, perhaps. Lightness. Freedom. Sorry. Relief. Relief through release. I like to emphasize that some people are only looking for relief to their suffering and Buddhists are looking for release. There's a difference. But yeah, certainly, release certainly brings relief. Being refreshed. So if you cling, you'll suffer. If you let go of the clinging, you'll stop suffering. And one of the remarkable things is the great to which clinging comes along with its own lawyer or advocate or something that will argue why it's necessary to cling. And you might look at those voices in your minds that say, yes, this is all very good, but don't I need to cling to this? Isn't clinging helpful here? If I don't cling, then how am I going to take care of myself? How am I going to be successful? How am I going to get ahead in the world? How anything? Do you have reservations about giving up clinging? Oh yeah. Anybody want to talk about the reservations? It'd be lovely to hear some of them. Yes. The love of your child. If you give up your clinging, you'd have to give up the love of your child. Is there a parent in the love of a parent or child? I mean, it's capable of clinging. That's a good question. We certainly know that there can be a lot of clinging to our children, which is not healthy. And our children will tell us when they get grown up. And so that we know. But then is there something in that connection, the bonding or something, that represents some kind of holding? And perhaps, and perhaps maybe we shouldn't call it clinging. The movement of empathy, of compassion, which is a kind of feeling, a suffering of others, and feeling the loss and the pain that is not done away with the ending of suffering. In fact, the classic argument is that as clinging is released, you'll actually have greater compassion. And it sounds good in the abstract, but compassion means kind of empathy. We actually feel the suffering of the world. So are you giving up clinging? Are you giving up something unnatural? Is your is would be kind of your question then? If that's if you're answering, responding to my query. I'm thinking about the uniqueness of a parent child. There were, yeah, there's quite something. There was a woman on the retreat who was dying, this last retreat. And her cancer had spread to her liver. And there was a teeny bit of hope, and that her so-called her numbers had gone from very, very bad to very bad after doing certain chemotherapy. But, you know, and she had an eight year old daughter. You know, and that, you know, was very, that was the hardest part for her, was because of this daughter. And, and it, you know, again, here was another person. She came to the retreat somewhat numb. And part of the process of being in the retreat was opening up to her pain, her distress about this. And then at the end of the week, coming to a different resolution. And it was quite beautiful to see the difference between who she was the first day of the retreat and who she was at the end. And I don't know if it was going to stick, but there was much more peace and openness. And she wasn't locked down. She wasn't closed down. And one of the teachers told her, I don't know if it was the wise thing to say, but said that probably one of the most important things that she's going to give her, if she's going to die anyway, one of the most important things you can give your daughter is showing her that you're not afraid of dying. That I was on peace. So hoping that that would motivate her to do the inner work that it would take to let go of the clinging. There's tremendous amount of clinging around her daughter and what this meant for her daughter and all this. And it was compounded by the fact that her father died when she was 10. So, you know, the, the, this work of dealing with suffering, of facing it, we're not talking, you know, we're not talking about, you know, just something lightweight or being casual here. You know, people, all of us, I think, you know, there's very, very deep things in our psyche and our soul that, you know, we're trying to deal with and have to grapple with. And, you know, this enterprise of Buddhism is quite serious. And when you have someone come to retreat like that, and there were a lot of people that had to retreat who had all kinds of things going on. And it was quite, quite interesting to watch, you know, as a teacher there, how useful it is to encourage people to feel where they're contracted, where the clinging is and where the tightness is and how easy it is for people to want to avoid it. There was one man who, who was there, who had written a lot of books. And I don't know if that's a good preface for anything, but he, he complained about being in his head too much and being very intellectual and not really being in his body and not being in his heart very much. And he'd been working with one Vipassana teacher for some time who was helping him get into his body, into his heart. And he came and he said, I'm going to do it. All these practices I'm given are really great, but they only work for about two meditation sessions. And then what happens is my mind clicks in and it becomes a doing that I'm doing, something I have to do and should do, and I lock down on it. And it's not helpful. And so give me another, give me a practice. So when I heard that, I said, well, I can't give him another practice to do. That's not going to work. So I said, okay. I said, stop fighting yourself. Stop assuming that you're supposed to be in your heart and your body and there's something wrong with being in your head, being disembodied in a sense. Well, why don't you, if that's what's going on with you, turn around. And if there's suffering there or contraction there, whatever is there, turn around and actually face that directly and be with it directly as it actually is. And by the end of the retreat, he said, it was really great because I went into it and I was really there for it. I got a really concentrated on it and it began shifting and changing and it spread out and became quite expensive. And there was no suffering in that big strong mind of mine. And lo and behold, I discovered my body inside of it. So turning and facing the suffering, you know, the contraction, the tightness. So then the four noble truths, the first three, suffering, the cause of suffering and thirst, the possibility of ending suffering by releasing the thirsting sounds very simple, but it's not occasionally simple. You know, we have some simple thing we cling to and we say, Oh, I can let go of that. But sometimes it's quite deep seated in our psyche, what we cling to and the real, real suffering we have, which is, you know, and so we don't want to be misled by the simplicity of these statements to think that it's easy. And the Buddha didn't do that. And it's obvious because the fourth noble truth, the fourth and noble link truth is the eightfold path and is the eightfold path then, which is how we channel all of our intelligence for the purpose of becoming liberated from this clinging. And I emphasize this that I like to think of it as all of our intelligence. Sometimes people enter spiritual life. Think they have to kind of check parts of their intelligence at the door as if, you know, they're not supposed to use their thinking mind. You're not supposed to, you know, I don't know, use our logic or something. We want to be able to use every resource we have available for this momentous and very profound task of liberating the psyche and the heart. So we don't have to be at war or check out, avoid any part of our minds or hearts or anything, but channel use all of it for it. So we use all our intelligences. And as I've read some place, I don't know now, but I read once there's someone had come up with like nine different forms of intelligences. Does anybody know about this kind of thinking? What? Yeah. So what are they seven different kinds of intelligences. Other. So, I mean, there's kinesthetic intelligence, there's emotional intelligence, there's logical intelligence, there's, I don't know what there is spatial intelligence, I suppose. And so use all of it. So in the eighth full path, the first two steps have to do with thinking. So it's not Buddhism is not about avoiding thinking, but rather first two have to do with thinking. The first one is right view, having the right understanding, the right frame of thought, having the right thoughts for understanding our experience. And in particular, what this means is if what you'd want to do is to become free of suffering and clinging, then you want to look at that. You want to have your thinking, your concerns, your thoughts, your view of your problem focused on that directly. That's all it says, the right view. What it says is that the four noble truths is the right view to carry along. The right view to have, if you want to become free, is the four noble truths. So that's a way of thinking about your experience. Our experience is so broad and complex, the ecology of human life, that it's helpful to narrow it down a little bit and have it more focused at what actually gets to the point. And so the suggestion is, if you want to get to the point, start thinking about your experience through the lens of these four noble truths. And the second of the eighth whole path is sometimes called right intention, sometimes called right thought. Lately, my favorite translation is to call it right directed thinking. Because have your thoughts directed in a certain direction. Your thoughts can go in all kinds of bizarre directions, as some of us occasionally notice, right? So you can just let your mind and your thoughts go in any direction you want. Or from time to time, you can channel it in particular directions and have them flow and be helpful. And there's three particular channels for thinking, ways of thinking, approaches to thinking, things to think about that the Buddha recommended in this category. One is loving kindness, love, being kind. Isn't that great? The second is renunciation. Americans usually don't like that. Simplicity, relinquishment, to train ourselves to begin simplifying the life enough so we can really get to the point. For people, Ajahn Chas said, if you let go a little, you'll have a little happiness. If you let go a lot, you'll have a lot of happiness. And if what you want to do is have a lot of happiness, to find the ultimate peace, you might really want to concentrate your life on doing that, which requires in some sense simplifying the life, relinquishing, letting go, so you can really do that work well. And the third directed thinking is to think about non-harming, to become a person who doesn't harm. Then think about that, reflect on those things. So those two things, the four noble truths and these three directions for your thoughts, then create a strong foundation upon which it becomes easier to do the deep work of getting into the psyche, the very roots of the psyche, to help see where the clinging is so it can be released. And the same is true for the third, fourth, and fifth of the eighth full path, which all have to do about living a life that doesn't harm, kind of an extension of non-harming. Do not harm through our actions by living by the precepts, basically, the basic cardinal rules of non-harming, not killing, not stealing, not lying, not harming other people through our sexuality, and not harming ourselves and others by intoxicating the mind. Being careful with our speech, not harming through our speech, gossip, which is very harmful, not gossiping, not lying, not using harsh speech. And then the fifth is, write livelihood. To have the livelihood that we live by be one that doesn't cause harm. The Buddha gave particular advice around this. He said, you should not be engaged in any kind of commerce or activity that involves the production and sale of weapons. So it's a little bit hard nowadays when everything's so interconnected for us. But he was very clear. And then after that, in order to really get into the mind deeply, so one is kind of setting your thinking straight, setting it right. And that can take a lot of time, reflecting and thinking, reading, talking with friends, talking with teachers, massaging these basic understandings of Buddhism to really make it your own, see how it's really true for yourself, so you're not simply adopting something because of the great authority of Buddhism or a teacher or whatever, but really kind of learning, using your mind, and then beginning to change your behavior. So your behavior corresponds or harmonizes and supports the deeper work that can happen. And then the last three of the eight full steps have to do about doing the deeper work of really getting into the psyche, really getting down in it to really see what's going on at the deepest, deepest places. And so one of them is the right effort, which is defined by being very careful about what you do with your mind. If your mind is doing things which are unhelpful, to find out how to let go of those unhelpful tendencies of the mind. Or if you think that there's some way that unhelpful tendencies of the mind might arise, avoid what it takes, so avoid getting into those situations. If you know, for example, that going and watching horror movies or action-packed movies or whatever full of violence makes you more a violent person as you leave, you're much more inclined to yell at people or beat people up. Then if you know that, that's not very unhelpful, so you avoid those movies because, you know, and then conversely the right effort is promoting helpful states of mind. Kindness, peace, joy, honesty, you know, promoting those things which are helpful in the mind. Being very careful that it isn't kind of Pollyannish and kind of positive thinking that overlays what's really going on. But there can be a way of promoting the helpful states of mind and kind of doing away with the unhelpful ones. As the state of your mind improves, not an easy thing to do of course, but as your state of your mind improves, then the next thing is developing your mindfulness, which is a kind of state of mind or quality of mind. Developing your mindfulness so your mindfulness becomes a very skilled, powerful light, flashlight or spotlight that you can really use to look deep into your body, your mind, your heart to see what's going on. And it becomes a powerful spotlight that is in itself a non-violent approach to looking at your life. We emphasize a lot in our tradition acceptance of what mindfulness is aware of. How very important it is to be accepting. For me it's a more useful thing to talk about being non-violent to what you see. And then the last one is concentration. So to join your mindfulness with cultivating the stability of mind, so that spotlight is you know it's held kind of unflickering. So you can really see well, you know if you have a spotlight and it's shaky, you know it's kind of hard to see what's there. If the spotlight is held really still, then you can see very well. And with concentration also comes can come at certain points experiences of joy, of well-being, of unity. And these states can be very helpful, certainly for re-educating and reconditioning the psyche, one that's been very kind of torn apart for various reasons. But also the deepest deepest work of vipassana is best done after you have this encouragement or support of a joyful state of mind, happy states of mind. And one of the ways to do that is to get deeply concentrated. Concentration brings happiness and happiness then brings further concentration. So once you get talking about the eighth full path, they can start seeming kind of complicated, all these things you could do. It's really simple. If you cling, you'll suffer. If you let go of your clinging, you'll stop suffering. And you're encouraged to use whatever intelligence you have, whatever intelligences you have, to really look and see how this is true for yourself. If you want a little bit of help along the way to make your thinking and your investigation more effective, the Buddha suggests that you take seriously the eighth full path. If you follow the eighth full path, the whole process will go along much smoother. And it's said that those people who have discovered the freedom from clinging are the give the world the gift of fearlessness. And that means two things. It means no one needs to be afraid of them. And it means they're reassuring enough that no one, they're not afraid by anything. Nothing frightens them. It's a gift to the world to do this practice. And one of the things I hope that all of you think about as you do the mindfulness practice, the Buddhist practice, do the practice of liberation, is that you're not just doing it for yourself, but that you're doing it for the well-being of all people. That what you're doing is intimately connected to the well-being of others. I think that it's very hard to be deeply motivated to follow the path all the way to its culmination without feeling that somehow or other you're also motivated to help others in the process. That it's going to make a difference for others. So I'd like to end with a very traditional way of ending. We should have done this at the end of last year, but we can do it for this year and for today. And that is with a little expression, a little ritual done in Buddhism called dedication of merit. And it's a whole topic in itself, merit, but give us the benefit of the doubt for the time being if you don't know. For whatever benefits and merit that has come from our practice together, may it be for the well-being of all beings everywhere so that all beings may be happy, so that all beings may be safe, so that all beings may be healthy, so that all beings may be at ease, so that all beings may find their potential of liberation. May you take this simple expression. If you cling, you'll suffer. If you let go of the clinging, you'll stop suffering. May you take those expressions and help all beings. So thank you.
