The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Greetings everyone. Greetings. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening to all of you
from all the places in the world that you're joining from this beautiful sangha.
My name is Nikki Margafori. I'm joining you from Mountain View, California on
Seated Oloni Land and delighted to be with you this week supporting Gil as
he's away this week. Traveling. So for the theme for this week, I'd like to
continue with the theme of compassion. I know that Gil spoke about the seven
factors of compassion last weekend. There was so much to explore. We're not done
in one week or one month or even one year exploring this practice of
compassion. I continue to learn and explore it. It's a lifetime or maybe
multiple lifetimes practice. So we'll explore it this week in different ways
from different dimensions or different ways to look at it and perhaps
slice the pie or cut the cake from different layers looking at that
compassion for ourselves, for others, what supports it, what blocks it in a
practical way, in a very practical, useful way, news you can use. And of
course, all of Dharma is applicable to our daily lives anyway. Without
further ado, let's sit together, let's practice together. So I'd like to
invite you to come to your seat, come to your body and if it's comfortable for
you, maybe take a couple of deep diaphragmatic breaths into the belly or
rather let the belly breathe in the air. Hold for a few seconds and release with
a sound if you like. The way to arrive becomes center, maybe a couple more in
your own time.
Holding for a few seconds, letting go. When now letting the breath be natural,
however it is shallow or deep. A few deep breaths can help us physiologically to
reorient as a bridge from activity and perhaps a sense of hyperdrive, a more
sense of calm, retuning, reorienting. The mind is particularly busy right now.
Connecting with the entirety of the breath. The pause and the outbreath.
And let us turn to the breath, to the sensations of the breath within the body,
within the framework of the body. Not breath as a concept, but a felt sense.
Within this body that senses, feels, aches. Burning our awareness, our knowing.
Intertwined with kindness towards this body.
Not so much in the way of whipping it to shape, to sit and concentrate on this
practice, but making kindness, compassion, the object of our practice towards this body,
the parts of this body. Softening, relaxing.
If there is any discomfort or a challenge in the body, areas of tightness, achiness,
turning to these areas, holding this area of the body with our awareness, with our
spacious knowing intertwined with kindness. The same way that a loving mother holds a
newborn tenderly, especially if the newborn is crying in some discomfort.
Patiently, patiently, holding, loving, rocking this tender, precious life.
The same attitude. Can we hold this body, especially if there are areas of challenge,
discomfort, unease?
Can we tune into compassion for this body?
In this moment in time, in general, this body that aches sometimes gets sick, aches.
If there is any challenge right now, tuning into the patience in compassion and the delight,
there is delight, a quiet joy in being patiently loving.
There is a source of strength and uprightness, courage, and turning towards what hurts.
With love.
Practicing to patiently hold, lovingly hold physical discomfort.
Is training for being able to hold and be kind with mental, emotional challenges.
It's the same process, with the same relaxed, spacious body.
If there is any emotional challenge, disappointment, judgment, pain, in this moment in time, can
we too breathe with it, patiently be with it, with the same stance of loving, mother-holding
a tender newborn, same gesture of the heart, not trying to rush through it, but patient.
Loving, stable, it's okay sweetheart, it's okay.
It's okay sweetheart, it's okay.
It's okay sweetheart, it's okay.
It's okay sweetheart, it's okay.
Taking time to hold disappointments, challenges, not to ruminate.
Let go of the story, let go of the story, not helpful at all.
But simply holding with kindness, with patience, the tenderness, whether physical or emotional,
and notice the wholesomeness, the goodness of turning towards instead of pushing away.
Let go of the story, let go of the story.
Let go of the situation, let go of the situation, let go of the situation.
you
it's okay sweetheart, it's okay
following yourself kindly
you
you
you
may I have the ease
with this disappointment, sorrow, pain
may I have ease and peace and freedom
of heart
with this challenge
may I meet this difficulty with kindness
as much as possible
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
as we begin to close this meditation
can we note
the sense of a brightness and goodness, wholesomeness
there is in meeting
what's difficult with kindness
turning towards with patience, kindness
instead of pushing it away or judging it
or berating ourselves or ruminating
there is wholesomeness
in just meeting what's difficult with kindness
and that brightness
a quiet strength
as we bring this meditation to a close
appreciating that we showed up
if there are any judgments arising for how it was or wasn't
can we meet that dagger of self-judgment with kindness
appreciating ourselves
and our beautiful sangha for
showing up and planting seeds of kindness, compassion
towards ourselves
and the world
our passion starts with ourselves
may we be of service
may we serve compassionately
may we be kind to this being who is us
may all those lies we touch
directly and indirectly
may all beings everywhere
be free, have ease
with their challenges with their suffering
may all beings be well, may all beings be free
including ourselves
Thank you friends. Thank you for your practice.
And if you like, if you feel moved
you are welcome to put a word
about what is coming up for you in this moment
so you take a moment to transition the recordings.
