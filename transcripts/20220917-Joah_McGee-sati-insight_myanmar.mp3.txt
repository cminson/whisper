 Welcome everybody to this Sati Center event. Today we're joined by Joe McGee. Joe has worked in Myanmar for nearly 20 years. He started at the US Embassy, later he taught at a private school, and then finally he started his own business. He has spent several years leading various Buddhist-oriented multimedia projects, including writing a Meditator's Guidebook, which examined the country's diverse meditation traditions and lineages. He has also led pilgrimages from Meditators from around the world to some of the sacred sites within that guidebook. In 2019 he founded the Insight Myanmar podcast, which is a website and podcast platform from which to share stories about the spiritual journey, and he interviews teachers, monastics, and lay yogis. Following the military coup in February 2021, the podcast expanded its mission to respond to the crisis. In the coup's aftermath, Joe also established BetterBirm, a nonprofit to deliver urgent humanitarian care to Myanmar. And with that, I'd like to welcome Joe McGee. Thank you very much. Okay, great. Well, thank you so much for welcoming me here, and I really appreciate this group for taking time on your Saturday, depending on what your time zone is, to join us. This is really wonderful to talk to people who care about the issue and to take questions. There's so much to say about Myanmar. There's so much to say about the Buddhist traditions, the Dhamma, the meditative traditions, the lineages, how they've come over here, and then where they find themselves in Myanmar society with the intersection of worldly affairs and obviously the modern issues that are being faced with the coup having been launched a year and a half ago, and where Buddhism fits into that on many different sides. So my intention was to talk for, to address you just for a short period of bit of my background and perhaps some thoughts with the country, given my background, and then just to take questions and expand on the questions because there's so many different areas where this kind of conversation can go. I think I want to make sure that my comments and my insights or reflections or anything else are mostly geared towards what people want to know, and I'll do my best to respond with my knowledge and experience. If something is outside, I'll let you know, but as much as possible, I'd really like to be able to share based on where the interest is from the group. So my thought is to start with a bit of a 10, 15, 20 minute introduction about myself and my intersection of Myanmar and thoughts about what's happening today and then open it to questions and really questions about whether one is looking more at some strictly Buddhist question, the monasteries or meditative tradition, or whether one is asking a question about some of the modern, some of the more contemporary crises that are going on and what's happening with that or the intersection between the two, I'll do my best from my background. So that being said, I first visited Myanmar in 2003 as a meditation student. I had just gotten into meditation a couple years before that. I was living in Japan and the meditation that brought me there was a blank of a passion and I had done living in Japan. I had started taking courses there and then I had gone on to have left my job because the experience of the meditation was so powerful for me. I just wanted to devote myself fully to it. So I lived in the Japan Galenka Center for about a year sitting in serving. Then I went on Thailand and then I went to Burma in 2003 and it was unlike anything I'd ever experienced before and I knew I wanted to get back but it was extremely difficult at that time for foreigners to find a way to be there whether you were there for business or for work or for meditation. It was possible but it was quite difficult and so I spent the next four years trying to figure out how to get back and I was looking even at looking at attending a Buddhist university in Yangon. I actually flew to DC at one point and took an entrance exam to go to that university and I was looking at teaching English in monasteries and in the meantime I ended up going to grad school in the US and I was incredibly fortunate to find that within my field which was education and training that there was a partnership with my graduate university and USAID who was on the ground at that time in Osep and so I was able to go to the place that I so desperately wanted to go to be able to pull back the window of what my very short experience had been in the Dhamma life there and I was able to do so with a job that was in my field and just doing incredible work. We were for the next three or four years I was working through the embassy and this was before the democratic transition period which occurred in the 2010s really in earnest and maybe 12-13 is when it picked up so I finished my work at the embassy just as the transition was really going into full gear and I was training at that time I was training young Burmese and well I first started to train English teachers how to teach English and that was the initial remit of my position but as time went on we saw that that given the need that was there and given how neglected so many sectors were especially education I developed a training of trainers courses where we trained we trained people from all background not just English teaching how to how to bring participatory experiential reflective style education into wherever they were so we're working with all different ethnicities and religions so when they go back in their own community through their monasteries their churches whatever their community centers we taught them how to train them how to how to be a trainer how to not just just get the information but actually be able to be empowered and to lead training sessions in the same way that we were so it was incredibly fulfilling work I could say a lot more about that but when that ended I ended up spending extended time in monasteries in rural countryside that was really what had driven me to want to be there in Myanmar in the first place but while I was at the embassy I spent my free time visiting different monastic sites and learning learning Burmese language and meditating obviously going to the different places but I was the the work became so so urgent given the condition of the other country and what was happening at that time with the military regime that I ended up becoming quite a bit more involved than I than I intended as many people who who went there during that time going to test soon I after I finished that work for the next five years or so I was just kind of I started out kind of bumming around monasteries learning Burmese as I say going to monasteries where I was the only foreigner there just to try to immerse myself up to this time I had been doing a lot of silent retreats and intensive practice myself but started to be really curious about practice with eyes open I guess you can say wanting to learn not just insight on the cushion but wanting to learn about the experiences so Burmese Buddhist culture of the interactions of the monk's life and everything else and so I was I was spending time with monasters doing this that the next what what happened next was kind of a confluence of interesting and unpredictable events that I guess you'd say propelled me where I am I am now it started with I was in Injendin which is a very very remote monastery most Burmese don't even know the town name it's very important because it's where a monk called Webuseyada was born and died and and as it's believed attained full enlightenment started his meditation center he's one of the great 20th century monks of Burma and when I was there in must have been about 12 or 13 the monastery had been randomly given a scanner and and so I had this idea with a friend of mine who's a Dutch monk from Netherlands that we would scan the archives of the photos from Webuseyada this monastery had stored for posterity to be able to to preserve these great photos that of this great monk and to scan them since this machine had somehow materialized once we scanned the photos we realized that we thought well let's put them together in some kind of slideshow so they're interesting that slideshow ended up turning into what you can call a six-week project and it produced an amateur documentary you can say where we were as quite a quite a story we ended up relocating to Skine we're literally living in a cave without any internet or or connectivity at all with simply the files that we had on our computer whatever audio video picture files as well as some interviews that we ended up doing we ended up putting together this kind of one-hour story of what we say it is like that was you can call it accidental that it turned that it came out that came out to to be somewhat of a documentary it's a very amateur documentary I at that time living in Myanmar the whole tech revolution had happened from 2007 I was completely in the dark I'd never seen a smartphone I didn't really understand how some parts of the internet worked because we were so isolated there so I didn't really understand how to use YouTube or or or or just these common sites so I had it on my desktop for a while I finally figured out YouTube six months later and uploaded it and it a lot of meditators around the world ended up seeing it and then appreciating it and that led me to contact with Pariyati which is a some of you may be familiar Buddhist bookstore connected to the Gwenk organization and through them through through conversations with them we decided that I would write a guide this had been a project that had been brewing for several years I had done some rough versions in my spare time just trying to at that time there were a lot of meditators like myself that were coming and trying to to just better understand where can I go to practice and how do I behave in monasteries and what are the differences between these lineages and what about some of the there's active lineages of full-on meditation courses that are being taught at monasteries and such and then there's historic places like you know the great monks of Mahasi or or Sun Lun or Mogok or Lady Seyedah and on and on there's these great monks and there's sites associated with where they lived where they died where they taught where they may have attained where they started meditation and so I started to through what started as just my own interest and then became something more I started to to spend more time cataloging and researching some of these places that were were still existing but I don't think anyone had really gone in and tried to dig up this information I think for foreigners it was just too inaccessible and for Burmese I don't think there's that that same sense of of history with some of their more recent monastic figures what I find is most of their interest in tradition goes back 2500 years ago so that's there's a lot of interest and scholarship about the the life of the Buddha and and stories of of the Buddhist life but of their own recent history of great monastics it's not as much and so it was really these treasure troves of places that we were finding that that would have artifacts from these people's lives talk to people who had stories of themselves or depending on the age their their parents or grandparents interacting with them and so started to just go around to a lot of these sites and and try to tell these stories so that we so that some of these great monastic teachers that had lived before that we could know something really really three-dimensional about their life you know where they where they were from where they what they did in those places and to try to trace that back so that so so that that that with the guidebook that foreigner foreign practitioners that were coming in the future would be able to not only find these places but also learn about their significance and also learn and kind of the micro map of places of you know this is the specific area where this thing happened and this is the area where this happened and it is very exciting you know like going to the the you know being shown the actual tree where Mahasi Sayyida gave his first discourse to seven lay disciples i don't remember the year i think it was um the right might have been right before world war two but just being told that story you know just seeing the actual tree of where this whole Mahasi tradition began where the the initial discourse was given and trying to write about that trying to write about the significance and the um and and what that discourse was like and where that was located so meditators today could come and find that tree and meditate there or pay respects if they're in that that lineage so that that part was very fulfilling to be able to go back and and tell those stories uh that led to leading pilgrimages to people that wanted to find those sites so even as much as we'd write about it in the guidebook it's very difficult to get to those places that are very rural and um and uh and sometimes hard to find and you have cultural or linguistic uh connection to be able to do so and so um and so we had uh pilgrimages that would bring people to um uh to these sites to meeting the monks to being able to ask questions and meditate and pay respects or give down at some of these places so that that was the next venture of what i did what i really was passionate about for some time was wanting to start a podcast because as i found that in many of these endeavors i was doing and writing and giving presentations which i was also asked to do back at the time the pilgrimages um in all of these endeavors the information was all coming from me and i was doing my best to listen to a wide frame of voices that were very informed very integrated and trying to give justice to and representation to what i was hearing and really wanting to be authentic that was that was always something very important to me i often found that the way bra has been represented in the west whether it's um whether it's more through a political lens or whether it's more through a Buddhist lens um through Buddhist teachers i find that it's often represented in ways that are very much at odds which with what my lived experience is and i think because it's so closed you have people that are able to go there for just only a short period of time and then call themselves an authority and try to talk about it or speak about it and when you stay there longer you start to realize the the things they're missing and so a lot of my interest in wanting to bring out these voices and this information was wanting to wanting to bring more of a ground view of what my experience was of being there that i felt was missing in the conversation and i was hearing about it from perhaps bigger platforms uh so um where was i so right so i um my my interest was was growing steadily and really wanting to start a podcast where these really amazing dynamic wonderful figures i was meeting lay and monastic Burmese and foreign that that gave some kind of perspective or piece of the puzzle into uh what is this country what is this culture what is this practice that i would be able to to bring in um this um their their voices to to that i've been so privileged to hear to a wider audience and some of these voices were you know people i had met that had taken years to get to know and build relationships of trust and rapport and and uh and sometimes there's a linguistic or cultural element and so it's very hard to just happen to go find this person and have this conversation but you know i really wanted to get their voice out further and initially i was doing that through um through through these other means you know pilgrimage and book and presentation and such but the podcast was really an exciting opportunity to me to want to um have their voice come direct so these relationships i had made that we had some trust i can provide some context to their story that they would be able to tell their story of of how what their interaction with the culture and practice was and thereby be able to to bring a light and shine some information that perhaps wasn't wasn't being heard so much and so that um i i was able to uh to start the podcast in 2019 we um received a uh a well actually let me go back so we had at that time i was living in yanghan and really thought that i would be there for some time to come we were quite uh integrated there as mentioned in induction we were also starting a business so you know i really really bet on many different sides of me and my experience from buddhism and practice to the human rights and the diplomatic and education and now entrepreneurial role in business and through the tradition period so i've worn a lot of hats and trying to in my life there and we um we were living across the street from a monastery and we had um we had made an arrangement with the monk of the monastery that he would give us four rooms and in those rooms we completely furnished them we had one two male two female we started putting out the word and just the meditator network that was coming through berma i guess you can say that these rooms were free to stay for any uh anyone that was going on a pilgrimage or a retreat that didn't want to stay in a hotel that wanted to stay in a monastery and um kind of be around that environment longer and not be somewhere commercial that these rooms were were free for anyone to use so that was that was quite a nice thing we were doing to um it was connecting us to a lot of people coming out and just felt very good to be able to provide that service of just nice clean comfortable monastery rooms that um that that could uh could help people on their spiritual journey there and we also made a recording studio we had we had uh uh invested one of the guest rooms in our uh where we were living to be a podcast studio where we were going to start recording a number of interesting interviews with all the people that would pass through um through through this connection or through my last number of years there that i knew and try to get their stories just try to archive their stories to understand them um i in march 2020 i'm getting closer to present i took a brief trip home what i thought was a brief trip so to visit my family packed a suitcase and as soon as we landed in the u.s the pandemic broke and so we were stuck here for you know beyond the three weeks we imagined we were stuck here for several we thought maybe weeks or months more uh as we know the pandemic stretched on we in marc closed like many countries in marc closes borders almost immediately and it's very difficult for any kind of travel so we started to uh to to look to settle here just a little bit longer than we thought and the coup happened so you know basically my story is that from pandemic to coup we packed we had our life in yongong we had our business our community our friends our network our you know the podcast work starting up and so many other things and we packed a suitcase for a food trip here and we've now been here about two and a half years with no end in sight so um so that's the story of how i got here when the coup hit in february 1st uh last year 2021 like many people we were just i was just um beside myself you know i uh i think a lot of foreigners who came to me and marc after this transition didn't really understand what it was like when the military regime was there because things changed so fast and even the younger generation didn't quite get it and and so when the coup hit you know i immediately knew what those dark days were the second i heard about it i knew that we were going back there it just devastated me you know just even getting a little talking about it just devastated me that these these people that had suffered so so many years and had had just one brief and had a messy moment where they were trying to to get out of it were now um going to be plunged back into an unspeakable horror and darkness that that i anyone who knew anything about this military this this fascism uh this brutality you know this evil knew that this would be this would be coming and um and it would be terrible and and it has been um a young generation that was for the first time looking out towards the world and um and having opportunities they never had before of education technology of job opportunities uh people that were in emerging fields and and having their lives ahead of them people who were engaged in different kinds of progressive politics and and and trying to open the mr up that way uh they've been crushed and you know the the hopes and the lives of young people who've just been um as you know um uh as this plays out we'll see but at the moment they've been completely crushed and destroyed at every level and um and so in those early days uh and it was interesting because for me i was quite involved in that stuff in when i was at the embassy from 07 to 11 or so and once i got more into the dama world i'd i i slipped away from that i stopped really following up and was much more even uh as things were going on in mianmara at the time and in yangon in the mid mid to late 2000 2010s i was uh at that time i was uh i was living in the 19th century living in the 20th early 20th century just going to these great monasteries of lady and muhasi and mughawk and these others and so i was living more in the past than in the present when this happened you know we we knew immediately we had to respond we didn't know how it was it was quite um shocking and painful for all of us involved for obvious reasons um from the work done for the last 10 years i had developed something of a platform among some type of some community of meditators so i don't think there was anyone doing the kinds of things i was so by virtue of that i i was uh i i had some you could say i had some some trust and some um some trust in my platform and in myself and i i had only really it's only before the coup had only really been one way traffic i was just doing things really for my own enjoyment and to want to help foreign meditators that wanted a better understanding like i had wanted back in the three so you know all the the videos and the and the podcasts and the writing the books the you know presentations everything else it was really just wanting to give and share information for you know largely for my own enjoyment wanting to talk about something i cared about to bring more knowledge of it um once the coup happened we and we were looking at how to respond and we had this it felt this tremendous um potential generosity on the part of of meditators who cared about these vulnerable communities we started a non-profit we founded a non-profit six weeks in called better berm a through our at that time the banks were totally closed and shut down and so no one knew how to get money there we happened to find someone who had a trusted network of bringing money in and so we wanted to uh we we didn't know how long the coup would last at that point but we just wanted to make sure we're doing everything legal and proper so we we founded a 501 c3 non-profit and uh and were able to to collect donations from from everyone really but i think meditators gave um the meditator community that that uh that are that the work had been going out to i think they were really the primary givers and in the beginning at least of uh of just giving donations to be able to help vulnerable communities so we were um so the non-profit is still going strong today and since that time we've given money to um to monks and nuns there's there's a lot to say about that because um monks i mean the country is um the country is is going towards ruins the economy has has completely collapsed there's very few job opportunities and there's there's um we're starting to see starvation on greater levels i'm trying to cut myself off here because there's so much i can say about the state of the country now uh but i want to limit it for for this current explanation of what our non-profit has done the monks and nuns uh like many other people in the country just have not been getting that food uh from lack of resources and and what's been going on and so we've done we've put some of that some of those donations into being able to do donation events to give rice and other and cooking and other things to monasteries and menorrhys that um the local people can no longer support because they don't have resources of their own um we've put more recently we've we've allocated a bit to idp camps internally to place in internally displaced person camps these are the military has been on a crazed rampage of going through the countryside in especially uh sagine and magway and chin and some of the other regions and literally burning village after village to the ground there's estimates now of millions of people that have lost their home of tens of thousands of homes that have been burned to ground uh they're because they're not winning they don't they're they're just taking vengeance out so idp numbers have been growing and refugee numbers in thailand and india have been growing tremendously as well uh during the third wave of covid was particularly bad there and was actually being used as kind of was weaponized by the the military um as it started to spread so we put we we supported that as well and the cvm movement which is the civil disobedience movement these are civil servants who have refused to go to the office because they don't recognize the legitimacy of the government of the military i should say not the government because they're they're not the government they're the they're uh they're a military regime that is taken power by force and and they refuse to go to office to serve them and so they've by tens of thousands of civil servants refusing to go to their offices they've basically shut help contribute to shut the country down so that it's inoperable to run and um and uh and so and they've gone into hiding they're subject to arrest and worse for not going to work and so we've also put money into supporting the to those civil servants in their family that are taking a stand along with a range another a wider range of non violent humanitarian um projects that are going on with our contacts on the ground uh in the meantime and this is kind of closing my introductory talk which uh this is has uh gone on about 20 minutes or so so um in the um uh with the podcast itself when when this first happened a lot of these adjustments we thought might be temporary because we didn't know how long this would last i think that was true of every anyone any activist anyone with a platform anyone who cared just trying to figure out what what can i do what can i offer what can i what can i explore what is my role in this because when you're living in a society or when you're connected to society that has the bottom is completely dropped and everything is upside down uh there there's considerable upheaval in trying to determine who you who you are and how you um what rules you take and that that's going through that process and so um as we transform the podcast at first we thought well let's just let's let's start to cover this in an emergency way and all these these interviews we've had that were on the shelf of these great dama teachers and meditators it felt very wrong in the first um few months of the coup to talk about some beautiful spiritual journey when the country was on fire when monasteries were literally on fire and so we we really did a a shift to be able to tell these stories and we're getting out in the media and we we would try to have to look for a buddhist intersection when there was there um to be able to look at where buddhist beliefs intersected with what the audience with what the the guest was saying but when there was none that was okay too we gave ourselves permission to expand beyond that and that temporary shift has become permanent so we're i would say now the podcast is telling a very wide range of stories of the resistance movement in Myanmar but it's but it's still keeping the buddhist undertone that's there and that's a big part of of who we are and what we try to do and there's still elements of that in there and as i think after about a year into the the coup it was starting to feel that these stories were really getting heavy one after the other and wanted to balance that back with the spiritual stories and so we've been bringing back from the archives as well as from new interviews and one people that came here might have been brought over by the interview with gill fronsdale which i was very very fortunate to get to talk to him it was really a an honor for me and uh and so we're integrating stories that are telling about the wider resistance movement and the nature of the coup with stories of the intersection of buddhism with stories where it's really just a spiritual journey like with gill fronsdale or you know 90 of that talk was really just about his own spiritual journey in me and mar and then bringing that back to the u.s um but along with that we've been reaching out to people of all different backgrounds talking to historians and journalists and scholars and activists and even hip-hop stars and artists and graffiti artists and uh and all kinds of people so really wanting to i think one of the things that i realize our podcast mission has become is that i think that that historically there's always been this danger of me and mar being presented in a very reductionist one-dimensional light very black and white you know during the cold war it was black and white it was one of the big players in the cold war stage it was in the not not a lot it was in the non-aligned movement but it was there's a lot of influence from u.s um uh russia and china uh and then the drug wars with the cold triangle it was it was seen one dimensionally again with that with ong song suchi and with the democracy movement the monks versus the general or the the lady versus the soldiers and so it's always had these really sharp edges of this or that and the more you go into me and mar you see that if there's any country that's not this or that it's it's me and mar it's a explosion of diversity and color and uh and uh and different ways of thinking and ways of living and people doing all kinds of dynamic things and so i think what our podcast platform has tried to do you know first with that foundation of buddhist life even even among buddhist life if you're just restricting your study or your interest to um bermi's buddhism the diversity within buddhism is is stunning it's it's i think that because the forms look so um similar you know they wear the same robes they follow the same rules they have the same protocols they have the same schedule there can be this kind and not just today it's been like that but for many decades and many centuries there could be this feeling that it's this kind of monolithic unchanging rather boring um conservative uh clergy that is um that um there's not much more to look at but there's you know that's couldn't be further from the truth there's incredible creativity and critical thinking and inventiveness and pushing at the edges that bermis buddhism there's also as many people know nationalism racism and and um selfish ends and other things combined with that so you know it's it's really a um cacophony of uh of different emerging um potentialities and it's been that way uh since is whatever i've read about it historically and the country itself is like that and so i think my interest in both telling the story of bermis buddhism not through my own words but through which i'm doing now i haven't given a presentation like this i guess you can call this a presentation and sometime i really like to to to bring out those pieces of the people i'm connecting with and get them on center stage um but uh but through those interviews and through those discussions to be able to um to to bring those voices and to break down what i think is a really uh inaccurate reductionist view of of a blandness or a this or that black and white kind of thing that um that these voices really break that down and really show the amount of divergence and diversity and and everything else both in the country um and uh as well as within bermis buddhism and monasticism itself so i'm no expert on that i'm i'm an enthusiast i'm um it's something i find endlessly interesting and fascinating and i have more questions than than answers with all of that as i go deeper into it but you know i hope that some of what we've done through a podcast platform has been to give a wider appreciation for the forms and the possibilities of how things have emerged and played out and now with the coup to be able to give voice to those who whose freedom has been so violently taken away and are sacrificing or making sacrifices and showing courage in ways that that few of us could ever begin to imagine to you know to to seek those things we take for granted freedom human rights um the uh to be able to live with dignity and uh and to see people that are risking everything to be able to create that country because um the kind of society they want is uh is something i've i've personally never uh never never been had a direct experience of seeing what that's been like so that's been that's been quite powerful and quite an honor to be involved and supporting that any way we can so i will close there um i haven't given a presentation for some time usually i'm the one asking questions so i hope that was uh somewhat interesting and um and yeah i i think i'll from here i'll just go in the direction of where there may be questions you can feel free to ask a question or also type one if you prefer hi uh i'm in the bay area san francisco um a couple of questions um what where do i go to get information just about what are the roots of this uh the fascist the military fascism i mean i i assume china is sending a lot of money their way what resources can i any websites i can go to to learn more um yeah so if you i mean if you're talking about the um like you're talking about currently kind of the day by day um news that's trickling out you know there's a number of local journalism sites um that that give updates i think they're uh if you're looking more at like um at deeper studies of um uh deeper studies and investigative journalism that's looking at like how is this regime being funded uh i would off the top of my head i i would i would hesitate i'd have to go back and look at some of the articles that have been that impacted me i mean um there's um global witness has done a lot of work and the international is there uh there i'm thinking more of individual names that have have done like really uh superb investigative reports into where the military is is getting funded and getting their resources then the names are coming up for me now more than the publications where they write so i would uh probably it'd be best for me to um to take a moment and prepare that after uh to compile that after after this talk some some resources where it's best to to check and and uh and who have done reports um and to talk to some people who are who are more in that field just speaking anecdotally and i and i guess there's there's two parts of your question that you know there's the roots of how the top of the bermis military came to be what it is and there's a question of what how are they currently being funded now and it sounds like you're asking more the latter question and and for that you know russia has been very active uh no one really knows what china's doing right now they they haven't really shown their cards and my personal feeling is that um russia might invite a sense of chaos there it might be they don't really have many ramifications if the country blows apart um and it might actually serve their interests whereas china desperately wants stability and it wants control but having a a an emerging civil war that's getting more bloody and more and really is definitely not in china's interest and i i think they want to back the winner i think that if um if if the the non-military forces can show a coalition and and even show an not antagonistic towards china then um and that's the winning horse then i think uh i don't think that china is necessarily embedded or or in bed with um with the military but that's just a guess i mean i was just talking about this with someone much more knowledgeable than myself the other day on a podcast interview which hasn't been released yet and he he was uh he was saying you know we point we're kind of wondering what china's doing they're not really showing their cards directly and if they wanted to be more involved they could be sending all kinds of advisors and material and everything else but i don't you know it's certainly not in their interest to prop up a a bloody military regime that doesn't have a chance a chance of full-out success and which is hated by the country um they want to back the winner i think russia's a different story they've been much more involved um in overt ways of support and just last week um minam line who's the minamar dictator who started the crew he met putin uh he met putin and he said that putin was uh a great man not just for his country but the world and had done great efforts to create world peace um you know if there's not more irony than that i don't know what it is but um but yeah that's uh at the moment um it's been a lot of overt support from russia that's been coming since the coup and there have been attempts from some of the wider international bodies to try to close off uh the funding opportunities of where like with the immoral oil and gas moes trying to close off um where the regime is getting its money and um and uh and and it's legitimacy great thank you i i realize i should go over to uc berkeley's south and southeast asian studies department probably has that would know that i don't know if other people are dying to get one thing i'm very interested in climate change and i'm wondering if you have any sense of how i know you don't know the country that well or historically but how climate change is playing out in in berma you know i was just reading a book that was saying that berma is one of the five countries that is is is predicted to be most impacted by climate change in the world and so it's a really big deal um we we have a a guest that we've been trying to connect with for the last few months and haven't done the interview yet he's a uh he he deals with environments and sustainability he's been in me and mar working with some local um local people there for for some years and so that that that interview when it comes out will definitely focus quite exclusively on on the issue of climate change there and on environmental sustainability um i think this is another of the really tragic and sad stories is that leading up to the coup uh there were a lot of with the opening and the transition the side he was going through there were a lot of progressive causes that were now coming to the floor that we've never seen before whether it was lgbtq uh women's rights and gender equality um the ethnic the uh ethnic peoples or in the environment was another one so there were there was a growing awareness that i saw in yangon and in some of the forest regions where the the military had really engaged in in extreme exploitation of the resources and the people there to try to put on the map uh the the need for environmental sustainability and of course cyclone nargis in 2008 which was a pivotal event you know mar's history killed about 150 000 people in the delta and brought havoc to yangon that that was one of the the worst storms we've seen and um you know in our lifetimes anywhere and uh and certainly one could look at climate change affecting that as well but you know now and there have been some articles i can't remember any of these because i just read them and have so much going through my head but there have been some articles maybe a google search would bring this up where people have explored how the coup is impacting the environmental sustainability and climate change and everything else and looking at how because the military is is obviously so um extractive exploitative of the land and the resources that uh that's a huge step back and there have been some articles that have been written lately looking and examining in more detail uh exactly how um devastating the military rule will be towards climate change in general okay thank thank you so much for your work and your compassion and your enthusiasm oh yeah thank you i had a question for you joe um i was wondering you know i i realize things are a little stressed right now and people aren't western tourists aren't coming going but you know maybe with the history of before before covet in the coup and maybe looking forward what is there any advice that you would give people who want to go to minmar to practice uh you know either how to get started or how to look for a center or you know anything along those lines um you know it's funny before the pandemic and the coup that that was one of the most common questions i had was through friends of friends or networks or some of the work that i've done people asking you know i want to i want to have this kind of experience or i want to go to this type of monastery or this kind of teacher and so we um so i i can't i don't know how many people i've come in contact with and and supported them help them in some way to to be able to get integrated find a place or answer questions whether it was in a small or not so small way that was really one of the one a pleasure as well just having been to me and mar and three and a seven when i was i was so interested in eager and yet had so little to go on so really wanting to provide something that i would have wanted at that time for a richer experience uh since the pandemic especially since the coup the country is officially open for tourism now in a limited sense i would strongly advise no one um to ever consider going love military regimes in power uh i i don't think there's any any ethical or safe way that that one can go at this time and this is just an enormous loss for the spiritual endowment community that this has all but been closed off the reason i say this is manifold i mean one the burmese people themselves are saying don't come um i mean that's very clear uh they they and the reason for that is coming as a westerner to niamar is a kind of legitimacy it is it is in some degree in an implicit sense or maybe more than implicit recognizing the military's military regimes legitimacy in controlling and ruling the country and even if one says well i'm i'm not going to support certain kinds of businesses i'm going to be careful where i stay where i go this this is still not the time this is um uh simply by by being in the country and being a tourist is showing uh some degree of privilege and and i think blindness and and um and and legitimacy that that is being conferred upon them another reason is it's not safe there there is um there are attacks everywhere and um there is no place that is safe there have been horrendous stories that i've heard of monasteries and nunneries literally being under assault having there is a uh if one i think it's episode number 117 i would strongly recommend people listen to let's say a monk in the muhasi tradition in rural saguen who um it's called the attack on the meditation center is the name of the podcast for those that look at it it's we haven't ever done an interview like this where the monk is describing uh in while he's leading silent retreats at his monastery uh there are they're getting assaulted in all directions from the military they're getting literally getting bombed by the main mire force there some of their buildings are blown up on campus there are nuns meditating in kutis that have bullets flying through the kutis i don't think any nuns were injured but they're pictures of kutis that have shot up by bullets uh mortar attacks um on the meditations i mean they weren't i should clarify they weren't trying to attack this meditation center they were attacking the villages in the region we have no idea why and there's no sense in asking why at this point because they're literally just burning down village after village as the monastery was supported by two neighboring villages they were being indiscriminate so mortars were coming on there and then the soldiers actually invaded the grounds firing their weapons in the meditation center and going into the nuns damahal and then kutis and disrupting them as well um this is one of unfortunately many stories that i could share that there's no safety and there's no sanctuary anywhere so it's it's just simply not safe um another factor is the limited resources so going there and being bermis are some of the most generous people in the world and are completely are unconditional and wanting to support foreigners that go there for practice um for however long that practice takes i can't tell you how many monasteries i've been to you where the monk has said um you stay here as long as you want you stay for your life that's fine we'll build a special place for you to live in practice and we'll bring you food every day um they're the most generous people i've ever encountered and and yet they don't have enough food for themselves and so so um it's also not the right time in that sense so you know it's very painful to say that um but um but i simply think there's there's there's no ethical way and no safe way that one could possibly hope to just put on practice only blinders and say now i'm just going to engage in the sector of it so you know there there are many ways to support and there are many ways to grow in the damah as well even while not being there through bermis lineages or teachers or teachings um but unfortunately as the military is in power and there's this current state of affairs i i don't see any way that ethically or safety wise that a forward practitioner monastic can build at this point great thank you um also in the chat alan asked a question he was asking so so is this guide of guidebook of mean marb buddha sites available online yeah so the the first part of it came out some years ago and that is available um it's called path and english is the name and it's on parjadi's website i can give links for that as well it's a free download um it's the the entire project was donation based so everyone working on it was was volunteers and it was made freely available and done the second part has been done for some years but it's simply not been laid out uh it's kind of like years and years of work and it got to the 99 99th 99th percentile of of completion and very fortunately we have a medicalist friend of mine who has taken who asked me what's going on with the second part and he's taken on the layout responsibility so this year he has been finalizing the layout and that's the one that's really quite comprehensive in terms of tracking um not the entire country and not every tradition because that would be endless but in being able to tell a number of these stories that i talk about about some of the historical sites of these great monks and that snippets and excerpts of the that part too has has been on the blog over the years and certainly is fodder for podcast conversations and such but the book itself which is now more you know armchair traveling reading is uh well will be available um uh as as he continues to lay this out so you know hopefully hopefully later this year but the first part is has been there for some time uh and that's uh more of an introduction to planning and coming and i can google that now or i can i can give the link after the talk and jenny asks in the chat how important is jana meditation in minamar monasteries do most follow the visuddhimagga the path of purification as guidelines any online jana teachings you can suggest yeah so i've i've never myself practiced on jana of course pao is uh is the place for that and um in terms of if most monasteries practice it uh i would say no you know there's there's and and the answer is not any anything about the value or lack of value of jana it reflects the extraordinary diversity of monasteries and the functions they serve of course there's monasteries that have more social missions or more community places or education or health or things like that there's also meditation monasteries that are primarily focused on meditation even among those monasteries focused on meditation there is such an extraordinary divergence and difference of how one can practice of all the different things that one can do so you know certainly there are many monasteries that would fall many many teachings many lineages that would have some kind of jana element and even a lot of these questions as you break them down more you find that that you many questions i've been asked over the years about berna's buddhism i find i have to spend more time examining and unpacking the nature of the question than trying to get into the answer because it's it's um the question is coming from a different context of practice and in what i found the me and mar is is just it plays out a bit differently and and sometimes you have to just unpack what the question means where it's coming from and with um with this you know as i've gotten just anecdotally i could say is i've gotten into learning about different techniques and lineages um and then there's so much there i mean there are so few meditative traditions which have found their way to the west really through an emissary through a teacher who speaks english through a primary student who speaks english or who's been able to travel and so the the the window into the type of bermis meditation practices that are available to foreigners is a very small microcosm of what's actually available to bermis in the country and major traditions millions of followers with with all kinds of literature have simply no foreign practitioners uh or have not made their way out of the country in any way for for whatever the reason is and so um and um and so with that when i find out about lineages or practices i've never heard of we're often very interested just to learn about well you know what's the teacher and did he study under someone i know that would make sense with him make sense with you know what kind of where he's standing in this framework and what does he teach and start to get into those nitty-gritty technical aspects it is confusing you know it is it is not like a checklist of like is this skin in the body is this watching the abdomen is this um is this metta is this is this jhana sometimes like with paoc it's it's very very simple i mean obviously paoc is the place for jhana but with other techniques it can be there could be elements of that in there and you could be left in these gray areas trying to look at them first is trying to understand what what the heck are they teaching and what is the nature of this practice and this technique and then once you understand that further trying to look at well is this is this just the practice that this student is telling me is this the widespread practice of the teacher um how how flexible is the teacher in terms of giving this wide range of possibilities or is this the main thing he teaches and then once you determine that you know looking at well whatever this practice is whatever i'm learning about how this technique is is it fair to say this is jhana does this have elements of jhana is this using jhana as an ends or as a means and so all these questions come in so it becomes you know then it becomes kind of a scholarly research project to be able to have a technical definition of what jhana is and and determine to what degree different practices are based in jhana and teaching jhana and uh and and that's where the for me where the mystery lies and trying to to bring that out further so i i uh that's probably not so much an answer to the question as much as the examination of the question itself um which i hope is okay the visirimhaga yeah that's um i haven't gotten so into um uh scripture myself and i know there there's some my foreign friends have uh have gotten quite into study and and berme's monasteries it's not so common many foreigners are just more based on practice so i i know that it it is um uh well for many people probably know the abhidhama is the most important thing in Myanmar that that's something that that that centers much of buddhist life and discussion and practice and more than other buddhist countries uh i i know this more probably the visirimhaga and the the um um the abhidhama more on a superficial level because i haven't actually gone into study courses so it's more hearing about those who are studying or or discussing it but i i don't have that strong technical background myself so oh online teachings um yeah i just saw that so i would i would suggest uh i would definitely guide you towards beth upton um the interview that i did with her can can be found it's like 100 104 maybe 105 i'm trying to remember the episode number no i think i'm off but if you just search beth upton on the podcast feed you could hear the interview with her and if you go if you search for her name online you can find your site and then you could look at her her um her uh she has some videos and online some online stuff and also in-person retreats and we have another question from ellen she's wondering how you ensure your own safety and how do you protect yourself well i'm not in me and mar right now so i'm i'm not um i um my my physical safety i'm i'm um i'm not as worried about i mean we do take precautions of a number of ways i mean there have been attempted attacks on berme's democracy forces in the u.s the the uh chamotun who was the um the the berme's ambassador of the u.n who refused to support the military there was an attempted assassination on him in new york and we actually went to new york for an event sometime after that and we were we were uh we were taking precautions there we did have one interaction which what was probably a a military informant that was that was a bit weird but as far as being outside of me and mar you know we there's not um there's probably not a huge risk for personal safety um there's a tremendous risk for anyone that we come in contact with uh any you know we're in contact with all kinds of people in me and mar and i would say that when this whole thing started it was really the first few days and weeks were really a question of to what degree do we want to get involved are we ready to get involved and to really disrupt and sacrifice our life to be able to support this knowing the risks are so huge uh the implications are so big uh i'm doing so and what i started to see was that all of my friends were out on the streets you know and were were were joining non-violent protests people that had never been political before were um were standing up to tanks on the street saying we want a democracy back and it just broke my heart you know just um just seeing such beautiful decent people that i had had experiences in my life that were put in a position where they had to say please respect our human rights and be on the streets and they were so vulnerable it made me realize at that moment that i i would be a complete hypocrite if i did not work as much as i can from a place of safety and freedom for for people that had done so much for me for so many years and so um and so i've really i really say that i follow in their lead i defer to them completely i defer to what they tell me is safe and unsafe i defer to um who is willing to talk and how they're able to talk and um and i defer to um i defer to their energy as well you know i i see myself as as from the privilege and safety of where i'm able to operate that that i'm not living through this i'm not facing the terrible kind of decisions that they are facing now and i can never imagine if i was facing that how i would respond it's unimaginable to me i don't have control of that but what i do have control of is to be a sounding board to to be able to find resources where they can't um to and to be able to follow up in the background of um of what they're trying to do that i can give a little more strength and and support to it and so i really i really try to model everything i do off of deferring to what they tell me they need and um and and how i can provide that support and and that goes with risk as well that realizing that if if people are literally risking their home their family their lives and everything else um then i i i mean i realized early on i can't be trying to hold back to this thing or that thing or you know i just i i um or just have something in the back of my mind well maybe you know if um if if the military does win and and things go back to normal the military i don't want to blacklisted and i want to be able to go there all those thoughts that were there at the beginning once i saw the level of commitment people had this was all or nothing this was the last battle this was their time to win the democracy there was nothing i could hold on to either i had to be willing to to risk whatever my risk was in in that game um while at the same time being as um as as safe as i could knowing that you know anything i do to lift my head above the surface is not safe i mean i lived in a military dictatorship for years before for half a decade before the country opened up i know i was never in danger um because i was a foreigner and and it was very unlikely that physical harm would come to me but i i could uh so i didn't have that element while i was living there but i everyone there had to be extremely careful you know what you threw in the garbage what you said on the phone what you talked about going down the street what where what where your computer devices were who you knew and how you knew them it was constant it was it was this constant radar you had to have of what it was like to live and survive and a society that was not free and where the the penalties were so high for for making a mistake you know for either getting kicked out of the country and having your life there ended or much worse having one of your contacts thrown in jail for no reason but association with you and so all of these things that i had learned and lived out a decade before i had to remember how to bring back because i had gotten so relaxed in me and mara was such in a transition period all the hackles were down there was there it wasn't like everything was uh was free and wonderful but it was it was much different than it had been before and um and so i had to remember and everyone did who had lived through that before had to remember what it was like to be so cautious and careful again while also knowing i mean the biggest thing that i learned from that time which i applied to this current time is that if you lift your head above the water you're not safe and you just have to accept that you just have to know that everything is a everything is a calculated risk and it's just a question you have to have to do it with the full eyes open that your um you know that you can't have you can't have both and if you're going to decide to be involved then you have to do it in the smartest and safest way possible but you can't lie to yourself and say that you're going to do it in a way that doesn't incur risk it is going to incur risk and and you just have to know the system and know the danger is enough to be able to navigate that and to to make the wisest decisions you can and um and and and that's what i do while deferring to those who are risking much more and um and trying to make sure that what i'm doing is in line with their wants and needs i i never i don't want to be telling them how to wage this revolution or or what to you know or or being a backseat driver and and what i think should be happening and i want to be a sounding board a friend an ally a supporter a donor um a conversation partner and uh and and and just kind of fit in where i can with that so um so yeah so i hope hope that kind of kind of jumble of words answers the question this time you know i was wondering if you could speak on what you think the motivation of the military is is it just money and power that they're seeking or do you think that at least that they think that there's forces inside the country that are pulling it apart and they need a strong central hand to control those forces so the country doesn't break apart uh the question of why min online launched the coup is something that many very intelligent analysts are endlessly debating it was there's a number of theories out there for one thing that has to be said it was and i think min online himself would probably agree with this now if he's being honest it was an incredibly stupid move that um that that i think he would very much take back the military was in a very good position before this was launched min online was in a very good position as the country had transitioned they they had not gone the way of reconciliation and other um like kind of uh post oppressive states like south africa or whatnot where they they looked for a way to move on the there was no punishments no one was held to account as many people know the rohinga crisis happened when the democratic government was was not only in charge and so um this uh the military was in a very good place they were assured 25 of the seats of parliament that that was automatic to the military there were certain ministries that security that they controlled uh and they were extremely corrupt and wealthy they had their hands in everything everything me and more economic holdings which was a a kind of a a corrupt profitability for the military that had hands and everything from tourism to teak to gems to oil and everything else and the different generals all were controlling different parts of it so they were they had no risk of uh they had no risk to their safety they had no risk to their wealth they had generational wealth of the kind that we can't imagine down to their you know for hundreds of years their family could could prosper and um and despite having such a good deck of hands they still decided to do this that's what made it so confusing and confounding and uh as one guy i spoke to on one of the podcasts his voice always always quote and when i get asked this question he said that um in this period of transition we had this small ray of sunshine we had never had this sunshine in in half a century and we had seen other southeast asian countries that had opportunities and prosper we we just were so happy to finally have a a semi-free atmosphere we could operate that we never had before that we were just like let you know okay you keep what you have you you you have these privileges that um that none of the rest of us have but you just give us this little slice that we can now try and work for ourselves and uh and and we'll just we'll we'll forget maybe we won't forget but we'll forget and move on because we we just we just want to be able to get on with our lives and then when the military took that last sliver last year the many people were like well you can't do this you just can't do this you know we were willing to let so much else slide and and let you get away with all these other things and still have this kind of control and corruption but you can't take the last thing that's left for us you just can't do that and that's where the protests began that um that this this absolute uh oppression that was being faced in terms of why Minnanlung did it you know one of the theories that's been bouncing around is that he was approaching retirement age he desperately wanted to be president he the military has traditionally and historically underestimated the the depth of hatred and um and mistrust and dislike they have throughout the country they they they constantly think that they're more popular than they are and every time they have a semi-free election they get five percent of the vote and they realize um well the election must be must be fake and must be uh must be fake results because obviously uh people like us more than these these vote tallies tell us and um and so uh and so with that you know Minnanlung probably underestimated the uh lack of support that he had he desperately wanted to be president and he um uh and because he was approaching retirement age there's a theory that he was afraid and in the tradition of of autocratic states once you are out of power then you immediately can be oppressed by the next guy who takes power you could be put in jail have your family's wealth cut off etc and so one of the theories out there is that he decided he launched this coup to um put himself in a position of greater power and to uh ensure that that he would uh if he approached retirement age that it couldn't be taken away by the next dictator but i don't think we we really know i i these are i don't think we well know for many years but these are the theories alan's asking if you're satisfied with the amount of attention the military coup is getting within the western buddhist media and organizations it seems pre-muted to what is happening there yeah i i totally agree i i think that in buddhist publications and and international media i think it's um it's it's incredibly poorly covered it's it's extremely shameful this is a a story that has everything um it has it has uh the depravity and evil of the dictator and the selflessness and the courage of of the protesters and trying to resist it resist it and stand for certain ideals that we seem to hold sacred in this country and you know and it's um it's just simply uh you know as the coup was first breaking and we were dedicating our platform and our non-profit to supporting it it was very um it was a very like cognitive dissonance of trying to get through the days in the world of like you know living in a stable country in the u.s where normal things were happening and then getting urgent calls of of absolute um madness that was happening and from you know the other side of the world trying to help people you know there was a time when there was a i got a call from a mutual friend that a mother and daughter were literally hiding in in a park while the military was searching for them because she was associated with the democratic movement and they needed a safe house and i you know at like 11 p.m at night i'm calling people who run safe houses and trying to get them saved before the military gets them which they did and it's like you know how am i going through how am i like doing that and then going shopping for groceries or you know having any interaction here where i'm just carrying like this trauma of of this intensity of a life you're literally trying to save in real time and or or you know atrocities or or crimes against humanity that you're hearing about as they happen as they're about to happen as they just happened and trying to figure not coming from that background trying to figure out how do i what do we do to to connect the right people or to you know to bring this out and it's just people just don't care and um uh you know i say i hesitate saying that because i understand there's a lot of bad things going on in the world i don't you know it's been incredibly depressing to me that it hasn't been there hasn't been more engagement in buddhist communities and um i think i had some anger to work out in the beginning because i just felt i felt a lot of hypocrisy i felt a lot of i did feel a lot of anger that and hurt that a country that had so selflessly and unconditionally given for the kinds of spiritual experiences that people had individually and then shared with their sanghas back home that the one time that they were in their hour of greatest need that um that they've never that i've never really asked for anything it's just been this one way giving of spiritual teachings that there wasn't more being done to bring awareness and engagement and support and whatever else um over time i realized uh i as i've gone i've gotten more into the role than i'm playing now i've um i guess i've just realized that you don't really know who you are who your friends are until a crisis hits and that's true whether you're an individual or whether you're a country uh or people or community and um and it took you know it just took too much effort to uh to to hold this burden of judgment and of of frustration and sadness and uh and so that redirected me to want to find those allies that were ready to stand up in whatever way they wanted to it doesn't mean like you have to sacrifice your whole life and and disrupt everything you're doing to be involved you could be involved in very very small ways you know giving very small donations or very small amounts of volunteer work or of just simply reaching out to bermi's people and just saying i'm a friend i'm an ally they feel incredibly alone right now they don't understand why why no one's talking about them and no one is is is public and wanting to support them and so simply online um on a public forum or personally to bermis you know or bermis you meet saying i'm sorry you're going through this i'm a friend i'm i'm here to listen i'm here to help i'm just i'm just here to to be there for you there's there's all ways that one can stand up and support and uh and be present and bear witness um that being said you know once i i kind of was able to gain a bit of maturity and insight and and uh and realize how i what my role wasn't how i wanted to interact and not carry this burden of uh of judgment and of of um disappointment that was really no good for me you know that was my own burden i was carrying i realized where to find allies and where to find within the buddhist community and where how to talk to them and where to have connections where they would um uh they could be involved and part of that came in the form of podcast conversations you know there was an incredible two-part conversation we have with bikubodi where he waded into the the most difficult questions as he said after the interview he said uh and you can think about this for someone as as with as much stature and background as bikubodi had he said after this interview this was the most difficult questions he'd ever been asked in his monastic career uh it was incredible for me to hear you know but he answered them and and they took enormous trust because i told him before you know i'm i'm not trying to set you up i i i i i'm asking you i'm being transparent that i'm asking you questions that have no good answers these are terrible terrible questions but they're real and they're what people are confronted with and bikubodi's courage in doing what so few other buddhist teachers in the west have done to stand on a public platform and answer questions where you are not going to look good because the reality is so bad and the decisions are so hopeless that um any way you try to engage with them you're um you're you're you're going to make some someone upset someone from some background upset and how you're how you're taking these in and so i think that's why many buddhist teachers in communities have simply not engaged because they don't know how to they don't they're they're um it's uh it's so problematic and so messy that trying to determine the best way to to wade into this is just it's really really difficult and i understand that and so i think you know at one level one buddhist community teacher can simply not touch upon the more worldly stuff happening that is admittedly messy and just simply try to get donation support i mean if you if you if you want to ignore the rest of the country and you just want a fundraise to feed monks and monasteries power to you that's that's fine you you don't need to engage in the messiness and uh and and there's a way to be involved that's just supporting the sangha and just supporting the buddhist traditions that are under such attack right now that is tremendously needed um for those that like dukuboti that are willing to engage to a deeper extent and kind of get their hands dirty and the reality of trauma that people are dealing with there's there's much more but um i think um but i i think that you know partly it comes from from buddhist organizations and teachers simply not and i i mean just my conversation with gail it it uh became turns and talking to him how how he expressed it for himself they don't know where to go to look for information they don't know how to understand this it's very complicated they don't know where the worldly and the politics fits into buddhism and dhamma and the monkhood um and and they don't really know how to understand or how to engage and uh and you know people are are inherently local in terms of what their interests and their concerns and their community are and even if asanga has gotten its lineage from you know from berma from lady seyada goenka mahasi seyada uttajaniya pao all these great lineages even if your your spiritual life has come from these traditions uh it can it can sometimes be it could feel a world away for understanding how to relate and engage and that's also why i've i i with our platform we've tried so hard to be that bridge and to to show if you have uh to the buddhist community if you have gained in any way from your interaction with bermi's lineages with pilgrimages with meditation courses with any interaction with what bermi spirituality is given here is the here's what you can do now you can here's the range of ways that you can become involved and you can become engaged according to your limitations and your interest and and whatever else and there's there's really nothing too small that can be done to add your voice or or action to the momentum of of uh of support you know there there is a wave of momentum that is is trying to outside of berm that is trying to show that people care about this that's pushing international organizations and local representatives and such to action or just being giving morale giving encouragement giving or donations to the bermis people that is keeping this on the radar and showing that it's in it's in one's heart uh and to whatever extent one wants to give it's similar decision when you're practicing meditation or in a monastery to what degree do you want to renounce what what to what degree does one want to renounce and to what one does one have worldly attachments or or responsibilities or other things and and making it not black and white so that that there's a way to just to just to renounce more renounce less there's a way to engage more and engage less and what our platform has really tried to do with the buddhist community is to worldwide is to show this is why it relates to you this is why it's important this is this is the the degree to which you can become educated or interested or involved and and with the range of interviews we have from you know everything from economists to scholars and historians to all the buddhist background this is the material available to to try to make it contextual and impossible to to learn this and you know through your own background in ways that the message is delivered that that that is conducive and contextual to the people we're talking to you as well as people outside the buddhist community as we've we've expanded our mission to really to want to try to tell the story of what happens when a society completely breaks down and order is has has completely left and and how people have responded to try to look after themselves and protect their human rights and to be able to to tell that story in a way that's relevant that's relevant to anyone from any background and seeing you know and imagining what how people have responded given the stakes of it so sorry i think i'm rambling now i hope that was that was an answer but um but if there's a more specific follow-up i'm happy to take that i was going to ask you joe you mentioned a little bit in the beginning if you want to talk about better berma at all sure um so yeah as mentioned we started this non-profit we we uh i don't think at the beginning many people thought the coup and the resistance movement would last this long um and it's probably going to get much much worse um unfortunately um because the international community standing by and the the the resistance and the the military are somewhat deadlocked and military doesn't they they don't really fight fair so they they look for their bullies they look for vulnerable populations to attack and harass and there have have been extensive documentation about the crimes against humanity already committed um the atrocities and so um and um and so as we've stretched on now we've realized that this thing is is going to continue on for some time unfortunately but when we first started the non-profit we we did not have any we've never lived through a coup before um even living in the regime it's very different from a sudden military coup and had no idea what the playbook was what was next we thought it was just going to be a um a temporary measure to be able to legal to legally collect donations and and get them to humanitarian services that through trusted networks um and uh and to be able to support in that way however uh as it stretched on our mission has also expanded and we've um we've we after now being um in existence for about a year and a half we've become a bit more stable in terms of what we do and the the local team members that are supporting us as well and that we're supporting and um we've we uh a bit of berma collects um donations to be able to give to a wide range of humanitarian missions simply put uh those missions can change given the need of the country when the uh when the coup first happened a lot of the money was going to the cvm movement the civil disobedience because that was government servants that were in hiding and refusing to to operate um offices that would allow the military more control and legitimacy uh when the third wave of covid hit we put a lot of money into that because as mentioned the the military was weaponizing covid to to terrorize and kill a number of its population through um denying um medicine and oxygen to them as as the as the covid pandemic um really wanted to high gear there and more recently idp camps and monks and nuns have been some of the main focus uh there are millions that are in idp camps now that have had their villages burned uh that we're trying to support that way and as mentioned we also have a number of projects giving food to monks and nuns that the local villagers can no longer support themselves and um and so that's uh that's been the thrust of where the funds have gone at the same time we've we've done some events and we plan to do some events we we managed to mention being in new york we happened to get some artwork that was made by by cdm artists um in um uh by artists that were in hiding and we managed to get that out of the country and a new york city gallery gave us space to be able to hang it it was amazing to see this this freedom of expression by these cdm artists in a new york city gallery and we auctioned that off um that that the money we got from that went to the livelihoods of these people in cdm and then also went to wider humanitarian missions and so we've done a few of those events and we're doing um we're doing a few more uh you know following our site we'll have that information and there's one more thing i can mention that we just started i'll i'll give the link after i talk after i say this i'll search for it and just type it in there but we have one of our friends who's been a democratic leader there we've been friends with her for years and uh she trained a number of people in vulnerable communities like hiv infected mothers and uh disabled people how to make she she gave the vocational training so that they they learned to make like man-am-mar textiles and jewelry and stuffed animals and clothing and other types of things and um and this was a way for for their community and livelihood as the country was opening up of course because the country everything has collapsed there they're not able to to make any livelihood so they so she asked if she could send these materials to us so we our home is now filled with boxes of all kinds of man-mar handicraft handicrafts made by these communities that we are we are just launching and trying to get off and we we hope to have connections with like fair trade and handicraft stores around the country that can not just be a way for fundraising but also be a way i mean these are me and these items are are part and partial man-mar you know they're the the textiles the way they look the way they're made and so by being a representative of the people in the country they become a talking piece in and of itself of what the country is going through so in addition to the fundraising they can bring they can also be a a physical item that just puts me in my back on the map it reminds people what's going on there and what the people are going through and you know just as i think like 20 years ago a lot of tibetan stuff started to come and there's now you know hardly any city you can go to in america there's not some kind of tibet they're in a polystore that has these handcrafts they remind you of the people in the culture they bring the existence of that place to us and me and mar's not so represented there so we're hoping through these items to to to bring uh to have a visual representation of tactile things so i'll i'll give the link there now in just a moment but um but that's one thing we're doing and then with better berma in general you know we're just any any donation that's given and you can earmark the donation towards a specific cause or you know just get a general donation and then it goes to a wide range of humanitarian projects and anything anything is appreciated in terms of donation as well as in terms of sharing about what we're doing within your community as well as podcasts i mean just taking time to just simply listen to interviews and become informed um that's all all of that is contributing drop by drop to the momentum and you know not having this happen in the darkness and the website is better berma.org uh yes it is and i'll just i'm just looking up the uh the handicrafts website we just set up and i'll put that in the chat now and that is aloka crafts.com a-l-o-k-a-c-r-a-f-t-s.com right i don't see any more questions in the chat joe uh so i guess we should wrap things up is there anything else that you would like to add before we go? um from my side i just want to say how much i appreciate uh you rob for hosting this and gail for recommending it and for everyone who showed up and stayed i just i really thank you to spend if you're if you're in america saturday morning i really appreciate you spending this time to to learn about this and to as mentioned you know even just taking the time to hear what's happening that that is a success in and of itself um anything beyond that is of course appreciated but just to take the time to bear witness to be concerned to be engaged and that starts with just simply being inquisitive and you know our time is a is a valuable resource and we use it in all kinds of ways and
