 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning, friends. Lovely to have this opportunity to be here with you. I feel delighted to be taking Gil's place this week and to spend a little time with you. Gil, I'm Susie Harrington. If you turned on your screen and expected to see Gil, you now have a new person. And I'll be doing the guided meditation in Dharmet this week. And Gil invited me to come. And he specifically was hoping that I would offer some guidance, some instruction around practice in nature. Since although I'm also a residential retreat teacher, I particularly enjoy and am committed to practicing outdoors and sharing that with people in the natural world. So there's probably like many of you, I spent a lot of time outside when I can. And I spent years as a backcountry ranger and a lot of time hiking. And through those years, I noticed something that I was outside. I was in the natural world. I really loved being there. But there was still some distance, some disconnect. My mind still sort of ran the show and the stories would still go in my mind. And there was a contactfulness with nature that I didn't, I felt like it sort of came in glimpses, but wasn't there a lot of the time. And so as I developed my Dharma practice and as I developed as a teacher, one of the things that became very important to me was this, was a curious, this ongoing inquiry about how does the natural world, how is it collaborator, friend, participant, teacher. And the Buddhist practice is very, very rooted in the natural world. The Buddha was born outside, became enlightened under a tree, taught for many decades outside, died outside, all of those things. So this is nothing new. This isn't something different that I'm suggesting. It's that bringing it into our practice as we do it now. And what are the opportunities there and how can we explore this? And one of the clearest and most direct ways in that the Buddha mentioned a lot is through the practice of working with the elements. And you may be familiar with the fact that that's in the Satipatthana Sutta he mentions the elements practice is one of the foundational practices. And he uses the elements in many other places as well. So this is the way that I'm going to explore it and offer it this week. So before we go into the guided meditation, I want to read one quote that is a lovely quote of the Buddha talking to his son Ruhula and making a suggestion, a suggestion to him about his practice, his meditation practice. And this is what he says. Ruhula, develop meditation that is like the earth, for then agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions will not take charge of your mind. Just as when people throw what is clean and unclean on the earth, excrement, urine, saliva, pus or blood, the earth is not horrified, humiliated or disgusted by it. In the same way, agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions will not take charge of your mind when you develop meditation like the earth. So as we begin to sit, this is the first aspect of doing the elements. And today I'm going to introduce and work with the earth element. And this is the first aspect of it that I'd like to offer and that we can explore in our practice is this sense of stability, the groundedness. We often use that phrase. I wish I feel grounded. I don't feel grounded. I wish I felt more grounded. And I think there's something in that. What we're commenting is how earth contactful do we feel? How stable on the ground with our feet as roots in the ground that we can hold steady when what is difficult comes along. So this first practice this week will be an earth element meditation. So go ahead and find your meditation posture, make yourself comfortable and find a nice upright posture that has a sense of dignity with it. And allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to soften. Relaxation in the shoulders. Relaxation around the eyes. And as you settle into your posture, allow yourself to feel the contact with the ground. Perhaps your feet, perhaps your legs, certainly your buttocks in contact with the cushion or the chair. And whether you're literally on the ground or 10 stories up, you're still in contact with the density of the earth all the way wherever you are. It's reaching up and pulling down to you. Gravity is like the hug of the earth pulling us towards it themselves. Feel the pressure and the contact of that. Giving yourself a few moments here at the start of the practice to really land where you are. Whatever you've already done today setting that aside. And as you land in this spot, allow yourself to sense the environment around you, the space, the room or the outdoors that you're in. And as we settle in, I want to invite you to feel the earthiness of yourself, to feel the hardness, the density that you carry around as part of your body. Your body is made of earth element. So feeling perhaps first the hardness of your teeth, the hardness of your bones, this skeleton that is allowing you to sit upright. We have these very dense core aspects of us that are like a kind of mineralized rock in fact. And where this hardness meets the pull of the earth, you can feel pressure. This is the earth element, earth contacting earth. Your flesh too, not just the bones, has lots of earth element. When we eat food and digest it, we're bringing in earth, moving it around, changing it, incorporating it in our bodies. We take in the earth. When we become, we are part of the earth. We come from the earth and we will return to the earth. Feel the density, the hardness, the pressure of your own body sitting here. And feel the contact it's making with the earth. Feel how you are not so different than a boulder sitting on earth. And as you sit there realizing that you're made of earth, that you're part of the earth, allow your attention to take in more fully the earth below you. Have a sense also of its density, its vastness and abundance. You might feel it flowing down below you, almost as if you had a tap root going down into the earth. Or perhaps your roots are more spreading, spreading out in all directions. Let your attention flow down to the ground. Perhaps even you might notice that you could grow roots down into the ground. You might even imagine that your breath comes up out of the earth through those roots, breathing up, taking in the nourishment of the earth. And as you exhale, letting your breath flow back down through these roots down below you, out into the ground. Feel your own weight. You too are dust, soil, mineral, earth sitting on earth. You are earth breathing. What a miraculous thing. Breathing for the earth. Allowing your attention to flow down and to come back. Breathing for the earth. Breathing for the earth. Breathing for the earth. Earth sitting on earth, sitting like a mountain. Can you be steady? Feel this stability, this contactfulness with the ground. This vast and expansive and supportive ground. The earth is a vast lap of belonging. You belong here simply because you are of this earth. It could never be otherwise. It could never be. It could never be. It could never be. Allow yourself to receive this hug, this pull of the earth. Relaxing the body, trusting the structure of your own skeleton, this uprightness of earth sitting on earth. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Allow yourself to rest, knowing that you belong, that you are part of this earth, an active walking, breathing, sitting, expression of earth. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Feel the density of your body, the contactfulness of the pressure, the contact with ground. Feel the supportive and vast density of the earth, letting your roots grow deep, your breath enlivening and further contacting this earth. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body. Relaxing the body.
