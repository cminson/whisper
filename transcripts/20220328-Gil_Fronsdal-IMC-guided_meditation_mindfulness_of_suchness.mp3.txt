 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning everyone and welcome. We're continuing with our Satipatthana series, the practice of mindfulness. Mindfulness gets pretty... This is a very simple capacity for being aware. It becomes pretty revolutionary after a while. One way to be mentioned to this is to look at the way the Buddha referred to himself. Others, people sometimes called them Gotama. Sometimes they called him... Very common, they called him the Bhagawan, the Blessed One. Sometimes it's translated into the Lord in some translations. But when he talked about himself, he most commonly referred to himself as the Tatagata. T-A-T-H, long A, G-A-T-A. It's an enigmatic title for someone. It seems to have been a title used in India before the Buddha. There are many ways of describing what it means. The most common one is to say it means the one who is thus gone or thus come. It can also mean the one who is thus, the one who is such. Imagine that you go to see someone and you ask someone, who are you? The person says, I am thus, I am such. The person doesn't highlight any particular characteristics of who they are. They don't define themselves in any other usual way you think, you want to define, just say, I'm like this. What you see is what you get. There's suchness, just thus. Often in our lives we are defining ourselves by different characteristics, different ideas, different values that we have, I am this, I am that. When the Buddha said, I am such, I am thus, he was not defining himself by any particular thing. This is one of the revolutionary aspects of mindfulness. It is possible to sit and be present for the details of experience, but in no way define ourselves by them. In no way judge ourselves by them, or no way build up a self around it. To simply be thus, be such. Each thing is allowed to be its own suchness, each thing is allowed to be its own experience, the in breath, the in breath, the out breath, the out breath, itch and itch, sound to sound, an emotion, just the emotion, a thought, just a thought. And the... So we will just sit here today and maybe this idea of sitting in your suchness, just as you are, you are thus, just as you are, without needing to define anything about yourself or judge anything or be anything, except being present for the details of experience that arise. So assuming a meditation posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed and to gently lower your gaze, maybe 45 degrees, with your eyes open, let your eyes gaze at nothing in particular, loose focus, letting your eyes be cool and relaxed. And then if you'd like, you can gently close your eyes. Letting yourself take a few long, slow, deep breaths. Maybe in a gentle rhythm of breathing in three quarters full breaths, as if you're gently swinging on a swing, safely, relaxably, enjoyingly, letting in, breathing out. Letting your breathing return to normal. And as you exhale, relaxing the muscles of your face, softening the face, letting the face be the face without needing to identify with it or make a self out of it. Without defining yourself by the face, softening the shoulders, maybe feeling the tension in your shoulders, relaxing. And if there is tension in the shoulders, let it just be in a relaxed way without yet to saying anything about yourself, the suchness of shoulders being tense. And as you exhale, softening your belly, as you exhale and softening your whole body, relaxing into your body and feeling this body without making it a self, without defining yourself by it, without identifying who you are or judging who you are, just the body from the inside out, the suchness of the body. And then centering yourself on your breathing. Maybe as if there are gentle waves on a wide long ocean. You're gently floating on the rising and falling of breathing or a gentle wind that comes and goes. Letting go of thoughts as you exhale, maybe at the very end of the exhale for a moment, aware of your experience when there is no thinking, even just for a moment, beyond your thoughts, what is the experience? As the inhale begins, allow it the suchness of the inhale, an inhale that exists whatever way it exists, without defining yourself by it or relating it to your idea of self and your idea of the doer, just the inhale, the suchness of the inhale......... As you're breathing, if you become aware of any feelings of pleasant or unpleasant, let it just be in the suchness of pleasantness, the suchness of unpleasantness, without defining yourself by it or relating it to yourself, what it means about you, your preferences. Let the pleasant and unpleasantness just be there in the suchness, in the simplicity of each thing by itself............ Whatever emotions you're feeling, mood or state you're in, can you let that be in the suchness of the feeling without appropriating it to self, relating it to self? Not it having any definition or connection to any idea of self, yourself, just the emotion existing by itself, maybe breathing through it, breathing with it, not doing anything with it, just allowing it to be there. Let it be as you breathe, mindfully.............. And then as we come to the end of the sitting, take a few breaths to breathe in the simplicity of just being alive, just being here. Simplicity of being present. Beyond the ideas, thoughts, judgments, associations the mind makes about being alive, being here. Breathing into the fullness of our simplicity, the suchness of just being here, and not narrowing ourselves down to some particular aspect of our life. Suchness of just being. And that suchness of being to welcome in now thoughts and images, ideas of other people, people you know, people that you'll encounter on the neighbors, communities, places of work, people you don't know around the world, people who struggle and suffer around all kinds of things, including this idea of self and minds racing and minds that don't rest in the suchness of their being. And then let your care, your love extend out into the world of other people. And may your ability to be calmly, simply present be a source of kindness, care for others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. Thank you.
