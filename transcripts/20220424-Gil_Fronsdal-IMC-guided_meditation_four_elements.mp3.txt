 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Welcome to IMC. Good morning everyone and welcome to IMC. Mostly we will sit quietly this morning. One of the central meditation aspects of this Vipassana tradition is to be aware of the four elements. Here we are kind of this is the Sunday to celebrate Earth Day. So the four elements are Earth, Water, Fire and Wind. In this tradition the Vipassana sometimes will focus on the ways that these are found in ourselves as particular qualities of experience. The Earth element is, they often say the Earth element is everything that's hard and solid but it's often experiences that which offers support. The Water element is everything that's fluid, moist but the quality, the way it's experienced is it. It's that which holds things together, cohesion. The Fire element is everything that's animated in us, everything that's energized within us, the energizing forces of life which is basically all our sensations. And then there's the Wind element and that's the movements. Everything that moves as we sit, the movements of the chest, the diaphragm, the belly, anything that moves is the Wind element. So to sit quietly here and to feel those four. So to gently close your eyes and to feel the support of the Earth. The Earth both is what we rest on, our bodies, the Earth element supports us. And to feel the contact of your body against your chair, your cushion, the floor. And it sends what holds you up from the pull of gravity. And in your body there's a support of your lower torso that holds up the upper torso. The neck that supports the head. And then a Water element, cohesion that can be exaggerated in all the feelings of tension that we have. The holding together, the tightening, pulling in and to gently as you exhale, exhaling the wind, the air to release some of the extra tension holding in your body. Relaxing in the shoulders, the belly. In a sense, releasing the tension that pulls the muscles inward and allowing your muscles to fall outward away from the bones where it can be held by the skin. The cohesive holding property of the skin can hold us. The fire element of everything that's animated, energized within us, energized sensations, every sensation you experience is there because of the animated energy of the nerves, the firing. The energy behind thinking is the fire element. Whatever you're feeling, emotions are an expression of that animated life energy that Buddhism likens to fire. And that fire element can come into harmony like a candle frame without any wind. Everything burning, everything alive, animated, held in awareness, allowed to burn, allowed to be without our preferences, our likes and dislikes, our wants and aversions, pushing them around. And then the wind element, gently as you breathe in and out, gently feel the movements of the body as you breathe. Maybe treating the breathing as something delicate, fragile, tender that you want to hold or receive gently in awareness. With no forcefulness, just a soft receiving of breathing, the movements of the body, touching awareness. And so we sit here, aware of the natural elements found within us that are found in the natural world. And we sitting here in a certain way are continuous with the outer world and the inner world here now. Nature, here and now. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. As we come to the end of this sitting, I'd like to use the analogy of a light that goes on in a dark room. And if the light is on a dimmer and it gets turned on at the absolute most lowest setting, the room might just begin to come into view just a little bit. But as a dimmer goes turned up higher and higher, more and more comes into view until the whole room is filled with light. So we come to the end of a sitting and we dedicate our practice for the welfare and happiness of others. It might begin with this, the light of care, the light of compassion, light of our deep connection to others. Maybe it's turned on just a little bit and our wish to benefit others can be a small wish, but it can be the beginning of that light getting brighter and brighter until it fills the world. May it be that our care for others and for this world can grow steadily within us. And may it be that the benefits that come from this morning's practice is dedicated some way, known and unknown ways for the happiness, safety and peace of all beings in this world of war and environmental degradation, poverty and hostility and hate. May we be alight in wishing and working for possibility that all beings may be happy. All beings may be safe. All beings may be peaceful and all beings be free. And may that wish be a light that grows stronger and stronger.
