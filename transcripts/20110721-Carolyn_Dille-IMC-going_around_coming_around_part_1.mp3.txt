The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Welcome everyone.
You know, we can find a lot of spaciousness even when we're close together.
So I encourage you to move in a little bit.
So I don't feel so lonely. There's a lot of distance here.
Thank you.
And I also want to thank Andrea, a fellow who's the regular Thursday night Dharma leader here
for inviting me to be here with you tonight.
I'll also be here next Thursday evening.
Excuse me, my allergies are acting up a bit today.
So I'm kind of running nose and eyes and scratchy throat.
So the title of the talk tonight is Going Around, Coming Around.
And I find sometimes in meditation practice it's helpful to pull back and take a look at a bigger view.
Tonight we began with a simple and totally always useful and wonderful meditation practice
of being with our breathing, being with our bodies and our breathing.
But sometimes it's nice to look at other things.
And Buddhism offers a lot of other things.
So I'd like to explore with you one of the tools that Buddhist philosophy in practice offers.
And what I'm going to do is speak briefly about this subject called dependent origination,
which is kind of a big subject in Buddhism.
And it's so big that over the 2,500, 2,600 years there have been many books written on it
and many talks given on it.
And it's really a very large subject.
So all I'm going to do is offer, as best I can, just a really brief overview.
So that especially maybe if you're not so familiar with it,
you hear a little bit of what it is and what's involved in it.
You may have actually seen depictions of dependent origination
because it's often presented graphically as a wheel.
And it's called the Wheel of Life, or sometimes the Dharma wheel depending on which tradition.
And in preliterate time this wheel is portrayed with 12 spokes
and they each have a name which comes from the Buddhist texts
and that's what the Buddha talked about and we'll be getting into some of what he said.
And in later Buddhism this wheel also has 12 areas
and those we will usually have images that illustrate the conditions of each part of this wheel of life.
So it's an early oral teaching of the Buddha and it's in the Pali Canon Samyutta collection.
And you can look it up on Access to Insight or many places on the web but Access to Insight is a really good one, easy to use.
So in that early teaching the Buddha doesn't call it a wheel
but it describes it logically in language as a set of relationships among the causes and effects of the patterns,
the thoughts and actions of our lives.
So there are a couple of key things about this set of relationships.
They depend on each other.
They have a cause and effect relationship
and most importantly from the point of view of practice these relationships are dynamic.
So that means in this matrix that the Buddha describes of human experience
there are opportunities for choice and for transformation.
And this was an unprecedented view of human life both psychologically and philosophically
and it remains a very distinctive character of Buddhism.
It remains a very distinctive view and way of looking at human life.
So the Buddha said in various places that this insight of his seeing this whole thing came together for him
in this sort of circular dynamic pattern of causes and effects and relationships is related to humans.
He said that this is one of the two central insights he awakened to
and the other is the Four Noble Truths which you've probably heard of
but I'll just review them very briefly.
Suffering, the cause of suffering, the end of suffering and the Eightfold Path to End Suffering
which includes view, purpose, speech, action, livelihood, energy, effort, mindfulness, meditation and concentration.
And the Buddha really seemed to be a gestalt kind of thinker type of person
because these two teachings are very succinct actually.
It's only a short, there are longer versions and shorter versions in the written versions
but supposedly what I know and I'm not a real scholar but I have done a little reading in this area.
One of the earliest forms, it's just a few paragraphs, it's a page of this teaching of dependent origination
and likewise the Four Noble Truths.
Because the Buddha famously said, I teach one thing, one thing only, suffering and the end of suffering
this was his interest and purpose to see how human beings got caught in the net of unsatisfactoriness.
I'm using the word suffering because that's a pretty common translation of the term dukkha in Pali.
Many people think it's kind of an old fashioned term or it has implications that it's heavy and suffering
although I think in an experiential level sometimes we can, at certain times certainly,
we can all relate to the fact that we do feel like we're suffering.
But other people say unsatisfactoriness or angst or anxiety,
sort of more modern philosophers like Sartre looked at this sense that humans have like something's not right.
And the Buddha also looked at that and thought, I just have an intuition maybe,
he didn't really say this but this is what I imagine he said, that maybe something could be right.
So I'm going to look into this.
And in a real sense the whole encyclopedia which the Pali canon is like that big
is a manual of this unsatisfactoriness suffering.
How it comes to be and how to find ways out of it.
And there are many, many, many ways out of it.
So dependent origination is a concise outline of these interrelations of the causes of suffering
and the possibilities of ending our suffering.
It offers a psychological description of our personal worlds of how they're put together moment by moment.
So, and it's not only, tonight I'm going to be sort of giving the larger views, stepping back a bit,
but it's also kind of a close up view.
I mean you can look at it, looking at it, you can focus in on it.
And we'll do that a little more.
I'll touch on a little bit that this week and a little more next week.
We'll do that.
So for me, in modern terms, the gyroscope may be a more apt metaphor for the teaching of dependent origination
than a wheel.
But the gyroscope wasn't invented really until the 1850s by the French physicist Foucault
and then other people of course contributed before him, but basically the form we know now.
So this model wasn't available 2,500 years ago.
The wheel was kind of what they had, but the gyroscope is complex, 3-dimensional, and dynamic.
It's a dynamic piece of equipment.
So in a way for me it fits better because when you have the gimbals, the parts that go around,
and you have what they call the journal, the flat part in the middle, and then you have the centerpiece.
It all can go around and a gyroscope can stay in a very stable position.
Now there are new wrinkles with gyroscopes, and so they're used in space travel and air travel and navigation,
and also they're looking into, I mean, they're in smartphones now, little tiny gyroscopes,
which help connect us to where, so that the towers know where the phones are.
And then they're also doing research into really tiny nano gyroscopes for medical reasons
to go into the human body and fix things up that need fixing up.
So what dependent origination also has these micro and macro applications,
but in our own heart, mind, bodies.
So when we pay attention through mindfulness, we can see what the Buddha was talking about
when he said, and this is another famous formulation, like one sentence thing you can remember,
this arising that arises, this ceasing that ceases.
So this is the basic teaching of dependent origination, which is also called dependent arising.
Causes condition effects, and then those effects condition further,
the possibility of further causes arising.
So we can see and even feel the freedom that we have to choose our mental states and attitudes
when we look closely. We can see, for example, irritation, rise or anger, and we can see it cease.
It ceases on its own often, but we can also see when we can choose to move away from it.
And we likewise, with any emotion or any mental state or any thought, with joy,
but if we're ignorant with this felt sense of joy or irritation or sadness or calmness or whatever it is,
that's when we miss the opportunity for transformation.
So mindfulness is the foundational tool to access this dynamic of dependent origination.
Mindfulness itself is easiest to access, especially when we're new to it, by quieting the body and mind.
So when we do this, for example, through breathing meditation,
breathing meditation is just something you can do your whole life.
It's always with you and you never get in any state beyond it.
So it's always a good thing to do.
And when we do quiet our body and mind through simply sitting and breathing,
we can see clearly and directly how things come about in the spheres where we do have some choice,
which is in our own hearts, our own minds, and even our bodies to a certain extent.
But especially important for mindfulness applications in terms of choice and dependent origination
are our thoughts, our emotions, our six senses, and feeling tones.
So the six senses are the ordinary body ones, sight, sound, smell, touch, taste,
and the sense of consciousness called mental or mind in Buddhism traditionally.
And feeling tones are kind of the charges and the valences we have with each experience.
Each experience that we have is accompanied by a feeling tone of pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
And mindfulness allows us to see through its moment by moment non-judgmental attention
and its quality of knowing what we are doing as we do it
and whether what we're doing is suitable or not.
So actually when I've taught longer courses in these things I've found it,
the students have told me it was helpful to remember that these two parts to mindfulness
and they actually have terms they're talked about quite a bit in certain texts
and they're called bare attention and clear comprehension.
So that bare attention is the moment by moment non-judgmental quality
where we just see our experience flow by and we don't say like with our breathing
we don't get excited about it because we're having a bad thought or a good thought
or we don't kind of latch on to something or push it away or get excited about it.
We just notice in a non-judgmental way that this is coming up,
oh I'm having this thought, I'm having this sensation, I'm feeling irritated,
now that's going away, or I'm still feeling irritated.
And then the clear comprehension is we're actually mentally aware
so the prefrontal cortex, I mean our whole consciousness gets involved,
we're aware of what we're doing too.
It's not just kind of like zombie like sitting back and saying,
you know, watching the flow, we're aware of what we're doing it
and we have some power of agency with clear comprehension.
We don't know what we're doing and whether it's suitable
so therefore we can make choices about what we're doing.
But dependent origination isn't like a grand unified theory of anything.
It's actually very human centered, it doesn't talk about the cosmos
if it arose or evolved or it doesn't do that.
But it is, according to the way the Buddha taught it,
it is a universal human law or dynamic
relating to consciousness, perception and action.
So it can help us see in the moment when we start to look at these links
in the wheel and how they relate to one another,
how our own gyroscope is spinning
and whether we want it to keep on spinning like that or not.
So maybe another way to say this is that in this gyroscope spinning around
of all these conditions and links affecting each other
and affecting each other not just forward and back
but interacting like the gyroscope, the two gimbals also interact.
So one's going this way and one's going that way
but they're all spinning around like that's us, the gyroscope.
But all these factors are going on in us,
mental factors, physical factors, emotional factors,
inner factors and outer factors.
There's the outside world and there's our inner world.
So this is a pretty amazing teaching actually.
So what dependent origination outlines
is the completely contingent nature of things in our lives,
how everything is affected by everything else.
But it doesn't try to tease out what,
particularly how the outside actions that affect us,
where they come from or their causes or their conditions.
And it especially focuses on how our actions relate to our,
I mean the teachings that derive from it
particularly about feeling, tone, about how noticing
what our relationship to our experience is,
how we feel about our experience.
It particularly points to what our perception is
and how we can see how those are related to
heedlessness or unawareness or awareness or mindfulness,
which is where we have the choice when we're aware of them.
And if we're not aware of them,
if we're not paying attention or heedless,
then we don't often have much choice.
So it's not exactly simple
because it takes into account the inner and outer forces
or gimbals of the gyroscope.
But as I said, the Buddha, specifically in very many texts,
consistently refused to direct his attention to
or answer questions about why we're disposed to act
or react in certain ways.
He was a very pragmatic teacher.
He said, we'll just put the why,
I mean once again, I imagine he didn't say this exactly,
but just put the why aside and just focus on the what.
What can be done now? What can we do now?
So he said in many different ways,
in order to stop anguish and suffering,
look to see what's happening in your own
psychophysical being moment by moment.
And when you bring mindfulness to this,
which is the tool you can use to see what's going on,
you can see this bigger view of what's happening
and how your relationship is to yourself
and to the outer world.
It sounds a bit paradoxical
that by close and bare attention to ourselves,
we can see that we don't have to take things personally
and we have choices about them.
So in one, I'm going to kind of condense one
of the famous teaching parables that he used,
which is the story of the loot,
and that's also in the Samyutta Nikaya.
He said, we look at the whole of who we are.
So that's where the whole wheel or gyroscope comes in,
and not just the part.
So then we can begin to understand and know for ourselves
that we are systems of interdependence,
of feelings, perceptions and thoughts and consciousness,
all interconnected within us and with others
and with the outside world, with the material world,
with all of it, with everything we know as humans.
And he said, investigating in this way,
if we look at the whole,
we come to realize that a big corollary insight
that there is no me or mine in any one part of this.
Just a sound does not belong to any one part of the loot.
You can take the loot apart
and you can have the strings and the fret
and the top board and the sides and the base board,
but you won't get sound out of that.
It's the hole that produces the sound.
So it's a very process-oriented way of looking at things.
So it brings some good news that we can stop the gyroscope if we want.
I mean, or stop the spin, alter the spin,
and step out of habits and patterns that we have.
And we can change these patterns
even in relation to some outer conditions.
For example, I have a tendency to like warm weather and sunshine,
but I live in Santa Cruz,
which has a good amount of cool weather and fog.
So after I wake, I open the curtains
and I notice if the fog is out or the sun is out.
And I can choose to obsess about how long it's going to take
for the fog to burn off if the fog's out there.
Or I could notice that maybe I have a little unpleasant feeling
because the sun isn't out yet.
And if I didn't notice that mindfully,
then that small feeling may multiply,
especially if something happens like when I go to make tea,
the stove is a little tricky to light and I have to fuss with that.
And then it's not noticing these moment by moment small things
that creates that condition, that conditions the next condition.
And it's not always that it's a linear, you know, that A equals B
because there are so many factors at play
and that's kind of the beauty of the dependent origination.
There are so many factors at play
that a lot of complex actions are going on.
But by keying in on our own psychophysical system,
we can see how this process works.
So I can just be mindful of that,
whether I have an unpleasant feeling
or I may notice the sun's out and I feel happy.
And then I could project, oh, I feel happy if I'm not being mindful.
This is going to be a great day,
which it's always nice to say that to yourself,
but that may or may not be true.
So I could see if I'm mindful,
there's a little bit of holding on to my mood.
And that can often set up the condition for disappointment
if something happens in the day, it doesn't turn out so well.
But it's fine to be happy, it's wonderful to be happy
in fact there are happiness meditations in Buddhism.
So that's a great thing.
But the dependent origination addresses our tendency
to attach and to cling to happy pleasant states
and to push away unhappy unpleasant states
rather than meeting them with mindful non-judgmental attention
and seeing what possible actions we might take.
Just the fact of holding on, clinging.
And this can be very subtle.
So this whole dependent origination is the Buddha called it.
These are his words.
He said it is a profound teaching
when he was asked by some people who came to visit him
and wanted his teaching.
He said this is profound and subtle.
So, but saying that isn't saying that it's easy.
So some application is required
and some confidence to persevere
when things don't look like they're shifting.
But you think, well, I'm really being mindful and I can see.
But I'm still grumpy
or I still feel like I'm clinging to something.
But we'll get into that more next week.
Bhante Gunaratana, who's a wonderful writer and teacher
is a Sri Lankan monk who's been in the U.S. for about 40 years.
In his book, Mindfulness in Plain English is a classic
and an excellent resource for the basics and refinements of mindfulness.
And he has a verse about our relation to life
that I think it resonates with me and this subject.
He writes,
meditation is participatory observation.
What you are looking at responds to the process of looking.
What you are looking at is you.
And what you see depends on how you look.
So this poem points to a kind of physical and even physics dynamic.
There's a relationship between what we see and us, how we look.
Furthermore, how we see is also a relationship between the conditions we see and us.
If we see something and we're not mindful of our negative or positive reaction to it,
we're more likely to repeat these patterns and habits.
And then that feeling of angst or anxiousness or suffering starts to come up for us.
In short, what goes around comes around.
So the more we repeat things, we're such creatures of habit, human beings,
and that's really a good thing.
It's a wonderful thing.
Buddhism particularly points to habits of wholesomeness, happiness,
mental health, peace, many things like that.
So there's another proverb in English because it goes to come full circle,
which takes us to dependent arising and transformation.
And I'll speak more on that next week also along with the nitty-gritty kind of practice,
so some more details.
But I'd like to end tonight with two short gattas, and gattas are mindfulness verses.
They're usually just four lines.
They're always short.
And these are kind of practice shortcuts that can help condition our waking in the morning
and falling asleep at night.
And I find them very helpful.
So one is a variation of Thich Nhat Hanh's Waking Up Gatta.
And I'll repeat them if people want to write them down,
or anyway it's good to hear them twice.
I'm sure you can look it up if I have it in a book,
but I'm sure you can probably find it easily online.
So it goes,
Waking up this morning, I smile and vow to live mindfully in each moment.
Twenty-four new hours are before me when I can meet each being with ease.
Waking up this morning, I smile and vow to live mindfully in each moment.
Twenty-four new hours are before me when I can meet each being with ease.
So this is an aspiration and a vow,
and to remember that our old friend mindfulness will be there for us
when we don't meet each being with ease,
when we get ticked off because someone cuts somebody off in a free way,
or whatever, we can just be mindful of that.
So if you can do this immediately on opening your eyes,
or when your feet first touch the floor, that's great,
but any time that you can do this in the morning,
one easy way I find is that your first intentional action,
such as going to the bathroom or brushing your teeth,
and just say this and see if that conditions your day in any way.
You'll have to try it for a few days,
so here's where the perseverance and the application come in.
And so Aitken Roshi, who is a very well-known American Buddhist Zen priest in Hawaii,
is also a very socially engaged Buddhism.
He was considered by many people the father of social activist Buddhism in this country.
And he's also a wonderful poet, so I recommend reading any of his poetry if you like poetry.
Aitken Roshi, Robert Aitken.
This sleeping gata is, as I fall asleep,
I vow with all beings to enjoy the dark and the silence,
and to rest in the great unknown.
As I fall asleep, I vow with all beings to enjoy the dark and the silence,
and to rest in the great unknown.
So I thank you very much for your attention,
and please do offer any comments or questions you might have.
This is the valuable part of our exchange, what you bring to it,
and we have a mic to pass around to you
because this goes out on audio dharma.
Thank you.
Oh, that was just really good for me, thank you.
I was happy to be reminded about the gathas with Titnad Han.
I have his book and everything, but I haven't used it for a long time,
and I'm really excited now to go home and start getting it out and using it.
I use things periodically, different things that come up, you know?
And I have two really good friends right now.
Actually, I think one of my notes from the song Go Where's the Other One From,
I can't remember right now, but they're both from Vietnam.
And so I think this is really wonderful.
Thank you so much.
Good talk.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
So as you were describing the wheel or the gyroscope, I'm very visual,
and I kept wanting to, like, see some sort of diagram.
You mentioned that there were earlier diagrams.
I was just wondering if you could recommend a place to see some sort of visual representation
of what you're talking about, does something like that exist?
Tibetans have done a lot.
They're kind of an artistic kind of form of Buddhism.
I mean, they do a lot with imagery in the Tibetan tradition.
And so if you look up Wheel of Life or Dependent Origination,
you'll end up with getting images of Tibetan Tonkas.
So then they have, you know, in brief, the wheels, different people start at different,
they start the articulation of the wheel at different places, either with birth or ignorance.
But so I've forgotten all of them because I don't have much experience in the Tibetan tradition.
But I think, like, birth is a baby.
Birth is a small, you know, child.
And sometimes even I think I've seen a pregnant woman that's not traditional in Tibetan,
but somewhere along the line I saw that, you know, somebody kind of giving birth.
Or a pregnant woman, I think that was what it was.
And then ignorance, I think, is usually a blind person.
And then at the end of the wheel, before birth, there's, on the 11 o'clock side of birth,
there's death, which is a skeleton, you know.
And then there's often greed, hatred, and delusion are in the center.
And those are characterized by sometimes a pig or sometimes different animals sometimes.
So it's things like that. It's actually life scenes.
So it's very human-centric.
And you can find those if you look up Wheel of Life or Dharma Wheel.
Other wheels are called Dharma Wheels.
These terms are a little elastic depending on tradition in Buddhism
because Buddhism is a big tradition, I mean a big package.
But I think you can find that, you'll find those kinds of representations.
And then the early Buddhists, the Theravada, which basically this center is grounded in.
And there are many, all over India, there are the early, and I think, just a wheel with 12 spokes.
And it's usually in gold.
So there are, you know, when everyone knows that's the Buddhist Wheel of Life.
And then does the 12 represent a year, like 12 months?
No, it's not 12 months. It's kind of like, it's pieces of our lives.
Like what, like part of it is the feeling tone I talked about. That's one spoke on the wheel.
So it's not at all the 12.
And I will bring in some, even some, maybe I'll do that next week if you,
I don't know if you'll be here then, but you know, I can do that if there's interest in it.
And also I was planning to, it can be a little overwhelming if you start right off with this,
with this linguistic philosophical articulation of the wheel.
But then a lot of people do talk and ask questions then, I must say.
So I'm hoping next week that will happen.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I guess I'm a little confused now.
Is the wheel, there's a, it's going around the wheel.
I mean, it sort of has each one causes or is a relation to.
It has a relation to, yes. And there are different, that is true.
So that's the way that's a very, well, that's one way to look at it.
And according to different points of view in Buddhism, there are, you know,
some will emphasize the strict causality of one leading to the other.
And then without emphasizing the interrelationships and the moving back and forth.
And others emphasize that more.
But there are, but people do tend to, as far as I understand,
agree that there are certain specific places and we will definitely get into details on that
next week about where, where these habits, patterns can be broken.
And feeling, feel contact, Vedana is one of those places, for example.
When we, when we begin to notice as part of our everyday experience,
particularly how we feel about our experience, then we have some space
and some to make choices about whether we're going to stick with that feeling
or whether we're going to amplify that feeling or, or change that feeling.
But there is a causal relationship. It is about cause and effect.
And there's, yes.
So can you just say a little bit more than about the relationship between mindfulness and the wheel?
I mean, I'm understanding that it's, that in the broad sense mindfulness is what keeps us from being trapped in the wheel.
Would that be right or something?
No, mindfulness is actually not part of the wheel. It's not in the wheel.
It's a tool to access the place, the points in the wheel where you can have some,
you don't have a lot of choice about being born, for example.
The wheel sort of begins with that and then you die. You don't have a lot of choice about that.
So, but there are places that you do have choice.
And mindfulness is, is a tool which, so it's actually kind of a different teaching,
but it definitely relates to this, this wheel.
Otherwise without it, you're just going to be, you know, stuck in your pattern.
Yeah, that's sort of what I meant. So that's the trick to, to figure out where you have some room to move or not.
You're not just kind of caught up.
Yes, but you're not just caught up spinning around.
I'm sure we all know this because, you know, when we're worried about something,
we tend to just chew it over, you know, we tend to just mull it over.
And that's just, that's actually very human. I mean, it's human.
It's not, there's nothing wrong with that. That's, that's part of our nature.
That's the way we are. But sometimes it's not helpful or wise or it doesn't feel right or it's not, we can't,
and in fact, it's not creative. I say that, you know, the creativity comes in just in those places where they're, where we can make the choices.
That's also part of us as humans, the deep embedded part being creative.
But that's about seeing clearly what options are available or what new thing we might come up with, you know,
in any given situation, a relation to ourself or anything, you know, or we're whatever.
So thank you for that.
Thank you. No, that's helpful.
Are you familiar with Daniel Siegel? He works with Jack Hornfield a little bit.
You know, the name rings a bell, but I don't think I've met him or I've done a teaching with him or anything.
It does ring a bell.
He's a psychiatrist. But he, he's, well, I guess what you call a neuropsychologist.
He talks about neuroplasticity.
And he uses a wheel when he's working with patients and he, he teaches meditate.
Well, he uses meditation technique and just as you were saying, mindfulness as the tool.
But he uses the image of the wheel with, with the hub being the awareness of the inner self and the senses and a lot of other things.
I think I don't, I can't remember what they are on the rim.
An awareness of the, and he talks about it as, you know, if you try to be the hub or imagine the hub and then the interaction of your inner self with these different senses.
And I was asking if you were familiar with him because I wondered if you, if you could validate, you know, that he's kind of, he's taken this wheel as a model or it even sounds anywhere near it.
What do you spell his last name? S-I-E-G-E-L-G-A-L-G-E.
Anyway, that's kind of what I thought the name I thought in my mind that I had seen maybe in one of Jack's teachings.
It's, I can't, I can't speak to that because I'm not aware of his teaching, but it certainly sounds from your description as he is using this wheel because the hub is the inner, you know, I mean,
it's funny because in the traditional representational image of the wheel, then greed, hatred, and delusion are the hub.
But, but I mean, but that's, that's part of our nature too. So, so that's, but, but it's not the only part.
But that's where the gyroscope works for me really well because we're just like the whole thing and it's all going on.
It does sound very much because next week we will talk about those other things that are on the outer rim, including the senses.
And I mentioned that tonight. So it does sound like he is using something like that and I'll look him up to see if he's got anything written out there.
You find it in the book called Mindsight. Mindsight. That's his book. Okay. But that's the one. Okay. Thank you very much for that.
The first time I heard the talk on dependent origination was, you know, kind of flabbergasted. I thought it was really awesome.
So I went and I googled Tibetan Wheel of Life and oh my gosh, there are so many beautiful depictions and explanations about what it's all about.
I printed them off. I have them in my office at work. So it's really, there's some really nice stuff and it's the one I like the best was under Tibetan Wheel of Life.
The artistry is really beautiful. So you can just Google that and you'll see all kinds of stuff.
Thank you. Yeah, there are traditional tankas and then there are a lot of modern artists who are doing Buddhist imagery of all kinds.
But the wheel is kind of a classic. So people are doing very interesting things with that, including doing wheels.
I think I've seen wheels and I can't remember where now, maybe online with consumer culture, you know, images around the outer edge or, you know, and not exclusively, but for the senses.
And I don't remember all of them. Thank you.
I'm having a hard time figuring out what is the difference between one point on the wheel or another point or why do those particular points serve as something useful about figuring out what's going on in my life and what should go on.
Like, why couldn't I just invent a wheel and put down as many crisis points as I felt like and do the same thing?
And coming from me, it would be more personal, of course. But what's so unique about the traditional 12 spoke things? Why isn't it 10 or 20 or something, you know?
Where to start? Those are all good questions. I think I'll start with the last one.
And actually, I would have to say, I don't really know why there are not 20 or not 10, but I will say from my understanding of it, the 12 that are do work together, it may have been a memory device reason, but they do work together.
And you could invent something that works for you, but this is a universal application wheel. So when you start with birth and then you have ignorance because you don't know anything in a way.
It's still kind of debatable for some people, I suppose, but you don't know about profound ways of being in the world as a human being, certainly.
And then you have contact, which we can all relate, that's the next one you can all relate to, even from children, how that is, you start touching. Then you get data, you get impressions from the outer world that come in that impact your inner world.
And then you have the sense doors. And then you can go through all the six senses. That's just one spoke on the wheel, but each spoke has multiple parts in a way, multiple.
So they all do make sense. But in short, the wheel, this was the Buddha. He had great insight into what it is to be a human being as far as many people, many, many, many human beings are concerned.
And this was kind of a genius thing to put, to have this one simple, like it looks so simple wheel, but that contains a sort of, I think I put it, a dynamic of the human psychophysical system, you know, and how we relate inner and outer to the world.
So then there's the senses, and there's consciousness, then it goes on to where we have our feeling tone, which I did. I only mentioned a couple of them, and I will mention the whole thing, and then give an overview briefly, because that can be kind of overwhelming.
And then we'll get caught up in just the, well, does this really work with that? I mean, then it gets like logical philosophical questions arise.
But really the most important thing from my point of view is that to use this wheel as, it can just expand your awareness of where you can break unwholesome, unhealthy patterns.
Ones that you yourself feel are like you know that they don't feel right. So this is just another way to look at how we can get into those things.
I hope that addressed some of your questions.
Yeah, thank you. That gives me a...
It's sort of like there obviously could be many ways of expressing all these things about how people live, and they don't have to be a certain number.
But it's clear that they relate to each other. They're not each one in isolation.
No, they definitely relate to each other, and they have a causal relation to each other too.
Thank you.
Well, it's nine, so maybe we could end with a really short period of mindfulness. Come back into our own little gyroscope and be aware of our breathing.
And be aware of our interdependence.
And dedicate our practice this evening together for benefit.
For the benefit of ourselves, and for the benefit of all beings.
