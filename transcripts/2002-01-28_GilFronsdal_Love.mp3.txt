 When Buddhism came to China, it had been developing in India for some 600 years, and then it continued to develop in India for another thousand years or more. And then periodically, as the Indian developments showed themselves, they'd be transported to China. The Chinese would receive all this different Buddhism. In India, because it was being born there, the Indians kind of knew all the different schools and how they related to each other and which sutras were the good ones and which ones were the you know, ones you should not pay so much attention to. And they had all this, you know, understanding of the scene. It's like, you know, if here in America there's Christianity, which is all over. And we have some sense of the different dominations in schools and traditions of Christianity, and we can kind of keep them separately, separate somewhat. But imagine that some, you know, the Amazon Indians, we've never even heard of Christianity, are suddenly importing or we're exporting to them Christianity. And we're not telling them about all the differences. We're just giving them all the Christian teachings from all the different traditions here in America all at once that you guys sorted out. That's how the Chinese were about receiving Indian Buddhism. And it took about 500 years for the Chinese to kind of sort through all these teachings of Indian Buddhism and try to make some sense of them. And they're quite amazing intellectual feats that Chinese try to do in understanding, systemizing this Buddhist tradition, all of it. And around the year 600 or 700 or so, 800, there was one of the greatest philosophers of Chinese Buddhism who took all this work, assistantizing and trying to understand Buddhism. And with the help of all the people who preceded him in his own study, he reduced all the teachings of Buddhism to one phrase. And that phrase was liberation beckons us within everything. Each and everything that exists in a core of that thing in some way or other, it's calling us, hey, you come, be liberated, be awake. So that's nice. So what does that mean? So I don't want to talk about exactly the meaning of that phrase, except that I think it's true in our hearts that in the core of our hearts, in our hearts, there is something that beckons us, calls us, come, come, come, be liberated, come, discover, come, be at home in your own heart, come, discover the possibility of love, compassion, liberation, generosity, come discover the tremendous depth and joy and peace, which is the character, the nature of our hearts. And it's calling us, come. And many of us find ourselves in a centrifugal force away from our hearts. It's almost as if our hearts is a place where we're not naturally tending to go for many of us, but rather, and also society helps us not to go there. And it offers us lots of distractions, lots of goals and ambitions and things to acquire and do and be busy with. And we get involved very much kind of in the surface level of our lives. And it's very easy to lose touch with the internal life, the interior life, the life of the heart, the life of our deep spiritual psyche. And I think, I think, you know, probably most spiritual traditions involve some kind of turning away from constantly being externally focused to discovering our capacity to internal life, the depth and the wealth that's available in our hearts, which beckon us, that call us, come here. Many of us don't listen to that calling or have never even never stopped to to hear it. But there's some turning away and then discovering some internal aspect of our lives. One of the internal aspects of our lives I want to talk about today, one of the important aspects of the inner heart, of the spiritual heart, is love, is loving kindness. In the Buddhist tradition, love is usually divided into four different types. In Greek Christian and Christian philosophy, I think, or Greek philosophy, they have, as I know, three different types of love. There's Eros, Agape and Philia. And as far as I know in English, English is kind of, as far as I can tell, maybe you can have been corrected, it's kind of a vocabulary poor when it comes to love. You know, some cultures have lots of words for love and we have love. I guess we have friendship and things, different things. But in Buddhism, the four main words for love are loving kindness or metta, compassion, karuna, sympathetic joy or mudita, and equanimity, upekka. And today I want to just bring up the topic of loving kindness or metta, which is the core experience of love that is pointed to in the spiritual life of Buddhists. I think it's in the nature of our heart to be loving. It's not something we have to kind of create or do or make happen. Those things can happen sometimes that way, in a sense, but it's kind of the nature of the heart itself, that inner life that calls us and wants to be expressed and to live through us has a quality of love as part of it. And to a great extent, spiritual life involves a shedding of the obstacles to letting that love shine and be part of who we are and be expressed in our lives. To shed and let go of those obstacles, to see those obstacles, understand them and work with them, practice with them, so they're no longer obstacles. So our capacity for kindness, for friendliness, for love, for compassion has a chance to kind of be an intimate and complete part of our life. Generally, when people have translated metta into English, they've chosen translated as loving kindness, kind of a compound word then. They've chosen not to translate it as love, but I saw recently that Thich Nhat Hanh preferred the word love. He said one of the reasons he said is that some words need to be healed. Some words are so worn down and broken and overused, that rather than discarding them, we have to kind of reuse them in a way that brings them back to life. So he wanted to translate metta, simply simple word, English love. But when we add kindness to it, loving kindness, it suggests part of the quality of this metta, this Buddhist idea of love. It's not passionate love, like arrows. It has a kindness to it. It's a kind of softening, a gentleness, a warmth, a caringness for ourselves and for people around us. There's a lovely quote by Adler Suxley. He says, "'Of all the worn, smudged, dog-aired words in our vocabulary, love is surely the grubbiest, smelliest, slimiest. Balled from a million pulpits, lasciviously crooned through hundreds of millions of loudspeakers, it has become an outrage to good taste and decent feelings, an obscenity which one hesitates to pronounce. And yet it has to be pronounced, for, after all, love is the last word.'" And then there's another thing. This is a Mullah Nazardin, who's the wise fool of Sufism. Mullah Nazardin decided to start a flower garden. He prepared the soil and planted the seeds of many beautiful flowers. But when they came up, his garden was filled not just with his chosen flowers, but also overrun by dandelions. He sought out advice from gardeners all over and tried every method known to get rid of them, but to no avail. Finally, he walked all the way to the capital to speak to the royal gardener at the Sheik's Palace. The wise old man had counseled many gardeners before and suggested a variety of remedies to expel the dandelions, but Mullah had tried them all. They sat together in silence for some time, and finally the gardener looked at Nazardin and said, well, then I suggest you learn to love them. How do we love that which is our weeds? I think it's in nature, again, of our heart to love all of life. The Chinese quote, awakening beckons us within everything. There's something in everything that partakes in awakening and love and a spiritual connection, a sacred kind of life. Part of the practice of mindfulness is to begin appreciating the sacredness or the specialness or the liberated quality, the ennobling quality that's found in everything that we find, everything we encounter. In talking about this way, I think it's helpful to think of Buddhist practice as in part involving a shift of perspective to begin looking at our life maybe from a new perspective than the usual one that we carry around with us. Because many of the usual perspectives we can carry around with us sometimes add to our suffering and cause problems. And one of the changes of perspective that Buddhism suggests is the one of loving kindness, to go around and see if you can discover how to live in a kind way or to see the world through kind eyes, to see even your enemies through kind eyes, to meet everyone you encounter. What would it mean to be kind to the people you encounter? There's a famous quote by Adalalama where he says, my religion is kindness. 25, 30 years ago someone told me that the core expression of any religion at all was kindness. I would have just shrugged my shoulders and said, that's nice, but I'm going to go someplace where it's more profound. But to be kind. And then some of us had our mothers tell us, you need to be kind to people. And how many of us had our mothers tell us, you need to be kind to yourself. In the Buddhist tradition, the idea of loving kindness is supposed to be first started with oneself, to discover how to be kind towards oneself, how to have some friendliness towards ourselves, friendliness to all our experience. Now you might say, that's kind of sentimental. And that's what I did say when I first encountered this Buddhist teaching of loving kindness. But what I discovered for myself is that it's not a sentimental issue in the sense of something that gets applied on top of our life, a kind of a sentimental thinking or sweet saccharine kind of thoughts about things. But it's really in the nature of our hearts itself, liberated, that when we're settled on our hearts at home in ourselves, not in conflict with ourselves, not chasing after 10,000 things, not ambitious, not filled with resentment and hate and bitterness, that when all those things kind of have a chance to kind of settle away, it's in the nature of the heart itself to be kind, to be soft, to be friendly, to be gentle, to whatever arises, whatever goes on. And I emphasize this because I encounter many people who don't know this, and many people who have the attitude about themselves that they're not good enough to be at home with themselves, not good enough to love themselves, they're not good enough, they don't deserve to be in a loving state or to rest and relax, they're not good enough as they are. There's always some other thing they have to acquire and do and become and hide from other people in certain ways, they're not good enough as they actually are. And to allow the love, the awakening that's beckoning us from within, to allow for that, to allow us to be pulled to it or discover that internal life, we need to begin to get some sense that we are enough, that we don't, it's not a matter of doing more and acquiring more and attaining stuff and, and or hiding part of who we are, or just in and of itself as we are, we're enough, we can discover, we settle on that, we can discover this love. When the Chinese said that awakening or liberation beckons us within everything, he also meant that even within our obstacles, even within our self-hate and feelings of self-worth and doubt, our depressions and sadness, even in those things, in the core of them, if we have the eyes to see, we can feel this tenderness of awakening beckoning us. Buddhism over and over again focuses on how we can change the perspective on what's happening to us in our lives. So we don't see ourselves a victim of it and see ourselves be burdened by it, but rather see the possibility, the ennobling possibility of liberation within anything. So love, loving kindness, the Buddha emphasized loving kindness a lot. And I read recently that in Christiana, in certain parts of Christianity, I was reading a book by a Quaker and he was using the Latin words, so I take maybe kind of Catholic theology. He talked about two different movements in Christianity. One was called contemptus mundi, which means something like contempt for the world. And the other movement was amor mundi, love of the world. And he said both have to happen in a spiritual life. There has to be appreciation of both. And in Buddhism, it's the same thing. There's an emphasis in Buddhism on the necessity of some kind of turning away. Hopefully not the contempt has a quality of aversion to it, so Buddhists maybe don't want to say that, but some kind of turning away from that which always keeps us separate from the internal life, from that quiet, peaceful, loving, liberated place we can discover in our own hearts. But at the same time, there used to also be the love of the world, the amor mundi. And the experience I've had is that as we discover the inner life and give chance for that to live and be part of who we are and give space for that through meditation, through contemplative time, through all kinds of ways in which we allow that to grow and develop within us, that in a turn brings us with a greater sense of love for the world of kindness for the world too. So it's kind of like two trains which are passing each other in the night. The withdrawal from the world, it's very important part of spiritual life, there's only half of it. And the other train is that which is the entry into the world with love and kindness. And both are happening at the same time, can happen at the same time. Some people emphasize one over the other at different times. So the Buddha also emphasized more or less the same thing. And the goal of Buddha's practice can be understood as a kind of complete turning away from any clinging to the world at all. But an important part of that path of attaining that and getting there is this quality of love, of loving the world, loving others. And this is encapsulated or expressed in one of the beautiful discourses of the Buddha called the metta sutta, the discourse on loving kindness. And I spent part of today translating it because I translated, I kind of translated before, I didn't really translate it before, I made my own version before which is published in various places and now embarrassed that it's published. Even in our new book that we have out there. But I really went back and looked at the Pali today, the original, and we did it. So I'm going to read it for you. And this is the basis for the practice of loving kindness. So in Buddhism, we don't just leave it to chance or for loving kindness to bubble up. There's also a practice of developing this kindness within us. And that practice is said to have its origin in this discourse that the Buddha gave. Later in Buddhism, when Buddhist theologians kind of looked at this discourse, they divided it up into three sections. And they divided according to the three trainings of Silasamadhi, Panya, of virtue, meditation practice, and wisdom. And so it's understood to be kind of a progression as you go through the text. So the first section of this part of virtue describes the kind of virtues, the kind of qualities that are helpful to be or you need to develop as part of spiritual life. That spiritual life is not just only a matter of letting go of obstacles and just relaxing and hoping by relaxing enough that we'll live in a glorious spiritual heaven. But it's also a matter of changing ourselves, changing our behavior, our attitude, qualities. And it's a slow process to develop things like patience and sincerity and different things. But to know about these things and slowly, slowly kind of take the steps we need to develop ourselves. So the sutta begins with this opening. To reach the state of peace, and that's just another way of stating to reach the ultimate aim of Buddhism, of nirvana, of liberation. To reach the state of peace. Those skilled in the good, those skilled in the good, what's good or skilled in the ultimate goal, they should be capable and upright, straightforward, easy to speak to. Are you like that? Gentle and not proud, contented, easily supported, with few duties, living lightly, with senses calmed, wise, not arrogant, without greed for supporters, and they shouldn't do the least thing that the wise would criticize. So if you need to do those things, you know, you think you have made, that's that's enough. And then the next section has to do with the development of meditation, more or less a practice. So these people who want to reach the state of peace, who have these virtues and capacities, they should contemplate or wish in the following way. May all be happy and secure. May all beings be happy at heart. All living beings, whether weak or strong, tall, large, medium or short, tiny or big, seen or unseen, near or distant, born or to be born, may they all be happy. Let no one deceive another or despise anyone anywhere. Let no one through anger or aversion wish for others to suffer. As a mother would risk her own life to protect her child, her only child, so toward all beings should one cultivate a boundless heart. With loving kindness for the whole world should one cultivate a boundless heart, above, below and all around, without obstruction, without hate and without ill will, standing or walking, sitting or lying down, as long as one is alert. May one stay with this recollection. This is called a sublime abiding here and now. Then the last section is the wisdom part or the cultivation of liberation. Whoever is virtuous, endowed with vision, not taken by views, and having overcome greed for sensual pleasure will not be born again. Will not be born again in the cycles of suffering moment by moment, day by day, lifetime by lifetime. As a mother would risk her own life to protect her child, her only child, so towards all beings should one cultivate a boundless heart. With loving kindness for the whole world should one cultivate a boundless heart. And one should have the following reflections or thoughts or wishes. May all be happy and secure. May all beings be happy at heart. All living beings, whether weak or strong, tall, large, medium or short, tiny or big, seen or unseen, near or distant, born or to be born, may they all be happy. This is an expression of the Buddha's love, the emphasis that he put on it, that came out of his own understanding that loving kindness and kindness is an essential part of the spiritual path at least he was talking about. It's not incidental, it's not just a byproduct, it's not extra credit, it's not for the sentimental. If you're really tough and strong and direct in your spiritual life, then you don't need it. There's a beautiful story, a kind of a sad story maybe, of one of the most famous Japanese Zen masters of recent centuries named Hakkowin. And he was known to be a very tough Zen master and his lineage became the most important lineages eventually of modern Japanese Rinzai Zen. And at the end of his life, when anyway he got a mean old man, he stopped teaching and he said that he'd become too kind to teach. And you know, to be a good teacher, I'd be really firm and you know, I guess. So I failed. But so it's a beautiful story because I think that, you know, in his years of development, kindness kind of comes with the practice with time. Some of the kindness comes from being humbled enough and because when you start going into the inner life, it's often quite humbling what we encounter. And some of it comes from just the nature of the heart itself, that this kindness, this love, this gentleness, this warmth, just right there. And part of the Hakkowin story, I think, is sad because maybe it's, you know, maybe he was actually getting more mature in his spiritual life, getting more to teach and offer people as he became kinder rather than being this fierce, you know, Rinzai master. So love. When I was, I feel very lucky that's when I was 20 or so. I discovered something that since that time has been invaluable for me about love. And that is my summer when I was about 20, I fell in love with a couple of people. And and my their availability to me was kind of distant. Actually, they were across at some point, they became across an ocean. So they were far away. So I had the whole summer to think about these two people that I'd fallen in love with. And without them being available. And without any knowledge whether it was going to be reciprocated. And in the course of the summer, I discovered what I call the joys, the joy of unrequited love. And this is one of the great secrets of you know, one of the great, you know, keys of happy living, I think. What I discovered was that there was a difference between my desire, my lust and desires in relationship to these people. In the sense of delight and warmth and happiness that came up in me when I thought about them. And until that time, I kind of maybe entangled those two. I thought, you know, if I love someone, then I had to have them in some way or other. And I saw that desire and love were actually two different things. And I found that I could rest with the love, with the pure love, with the simple love, with a kind of love which doesn't have any desire as part of it. Love doesn't require desire at all. And that has served me so well as I've gone through my life. Because, you know, there are times when I find it's been really easy to fall in love. And I just kind of rest in that joy and delight and pleasure of that. And I don't feel any need sometimes to try to act on it or do anything about it or have desires connected to it. It's really a lovely thing to look at someone and feel just the light and appreciation and warmth and tingling and kind of softening, you know, about someone else. And in fact, there are times and they've grown over the years, but it certainly doesn't stay. It's not constant. It kind of goes up and down depending on how deep I am in my practice and how connected and all that, where I seem to fall in love with everyone. And I just look, you see people, I just feel just the light and happiness and joy. And other times I don't have that and I look at someone and it's kind of, I hope they don't sit next to me. But I know that when I have that kind of attitude, I'm not really connected to my inner life. I'm not settled on myself. I'm not at home with myself. And when I'm really at home or settled or quiet, then I'm much more likely to appreciate people that I meet. So to separate out the desire from love, from what we need to get, you know, or the empty holes, the wounds that we have that we all try to fill, to separate out the psychological needs we have, the desires we have, from the very simple qualities of love, I think makes life a lot easier. One of the also great discoveries that I had through my Buddhist practice is that it's possible to have a state of love, to be in love in a sense or feel love, feel great love. And it doesn't require an object at all. It doesn't require any person, even love for oneself or for, you know, anything. It just seems to be the quality of the nature of a heart which has been opened or liberated or present is that it just loves. It's like a furnace, which is, you know, someone lit the furnace and it's on blasting out all this heat. And you say, you know, but no one's in the building. The furnace doesn't care. Maybe there's not even any building. It's just the furnace is on and it's just blasting out all this heat. It's kind of like the heart just kind of blasts, you know, it's just kind of open. There's a soft softening. Blasting is probably not the right word because the usual, it's a very peaceful feeling, open, gentle, kind, soft. The word for metta is sometimes etymologically connected to the word softening or gentleness. It's connected to the word for friendship, being friendly. And one of the things that I think we need to learn to love, one of the things that's helpful to learn to love is everything within us that makes it difficult to love. And for some of us, perhaps at the beginning of practice, is learning to have some kindness at least or friendliness, some kind of acceptance of all the obstacles to it. So rather than setting up love as a goal, as an ideal, we have to measure ourselves by trying to attain, a lot of what we do is study what gets in the way of it. And that often, that itself is one of the surest ways of discovering it. And I have to keep relearning this, I'm embarrassed to say. So one of the most difficult parts of my practice in the last 15 years is going to meetings. I had no idea when I started Buddhist practice that Buddhists are expected to go to a lot of meetings, at least Buddhist teacher types. And the Buddha allowed for 13, mostly Buddhism is the middle way and he rejected asceticism back in ancient India, all ascetic practices standing on your foot for 32 years on one foot or whatever, all these things they had back in ancient India. But he allowed 13 ascetic practices, and not that dramatic, you know, not that ascetical, but he allowed 13, a monk could voluntarily take on. In America, the 14 ascetic practices is meetings. And I'm not very good at meetings. And it's actually been at times quite painful for me, the way I participated in it and my feelings have come up and all this stuff. So I had to go to a meeting yesterday. And big meeting. And that's okay. I said, what am I going to do is I'm not going to say much. I'm just going to lay back, sit back and be relaxed. I'm going to do loving kindness. And whoever speaks, I'm just going to do loving kindness towards them. And, you know, I don't have to say anything at all because, you know, I don't have to get my opinion across, you know, I can just, I'll just be detached, you know, at peace, not wanting anything. It's a little embarrassing, right? I should know better. And, but you know, kind of, that was my attitude. So I showed up to the meeting, all kind of geared up. And it was a wonderful facilitator for the meeting, very wise man. And one of the first things he said at the meeting was, these are the desired outcomes of the meeting. Before we proceed, we want to go through the room, make sure everyone here agrees to those are desired outcomes. If anybody has any objections, speak now. So suddenly, you know, I had to either agree, it can be quiet, right? But if I didn't agree, then I had to say something. And I said, I want to not say anything at all. So right there at the beginning of the meeting, I had to say, well, actually, I feel differently. And, and what I found by the end of the meeting was that it wasn't a matter of me trying to be kind and loving and whatever. It had to be, it was really as the meeting proceeded, it wasn't so much focusing on those people out there and trying to be loving towards them. It was really staying with myself and staying with what was going on inside of me and being very honest about that over and over and over again, and really seeing what was going on with me and being honest and expressing myself as sincerely as I could, apologizing when I needed to apologize. And then by the end of the meeting, I was feeling all this love for everyone. I was feeling all this kindness and warmth, and it was really delightful. And it wasn't just me, it was also the facilitator that helped make it happen that way. And so it's not a matter of so much a matter of deciding you're going to be loving. I don't think it's that way. As it is when it's available to you to recognize it, to give ourselves the opportunity to let that inner life come forth. If we never give our chance for the inner life to be there, it's not going to come forth. So it gives us the opportunity to feel it if it's there, if it is available, then nurture it and develop it. If it's not there and not available, then you like the idea of discovering love and coming from a kind place, then it's a matter of studying the obstacles to it. What's really going on for you? And seeing can you be kind to that? Can you be kind to your anger and your hate and your bitterness? Because without kindness to those also, I think it doesn't really work, the whole practice. Can you discover what can you be kind to? What can you be friendly to? What can you bring some kind of softening to or love to with yourself? What is your relationship to love? What are your thoughts about love? Do you keep it at arm's distance? Are you afraid of it? Do you hold on to it as a ideal, as a kind of lifesaver? Are you desperate for it? Is it a nice idea for someone else? What have you learned about love in your life? What have you learned that you want to keep? And what have you learned so far that maybe it would be good to unlearn about love? How valuable is it for you, the experience of love? If you've been told that you can love without an object, that love is inherent in the nature of who you are, does that have any real value for you? Is that important for you? Is that something you like to orient your life around a little bit? Or is it more interesting to go to work and make a lot of money and be busy with projects? Who have you met in your life that's been loving? Who have you met that feels sincerely and genuinely kind of kind, a kind people, a kind person? Have you allowed the kindness and love of other people to resonate, to register within your own heart, to influence who you are? The practice that most complements mindfulness practice, the practice we do here, the insight practice, is the practice of loving kindness. The practice of being kind or wanting to be kind, the practice of wanting happiness for ourselves and happiness for others. And now it's time to end, but I'd encourage all of you to, if you haven't had some contact with the Buddhist practice of loving kindness and metta, that you do so. Learn more about it in that book that might be a little bit more interesting. There's a couple of chapters on loving kindness. There are other Buddhist books that talk about it quite extensively. Thich Nhat Hanh has a whole book now called Love. Sharon Salzburg has a book. And as we go along here in this new center, I hope that loving kindness becomes a very rooted practice for what we do here. And at some point we will have classes and retreats here on the practice of loving kindness. So may all of you be happy and safe and healthy. I remember this report, maybe he has a growth in his study. I found myself really moved by that. I found myself in spontaneous prayer all day today. I appreciate the place in my life. I remember the place in the world where he also had a point that he put out in his community to set the prayer. I appreciate it. Yeah, so Adalya Lama is sick with some kind of stomach problem. And he's been... Yes? But the beautiful thing, the two people we've evoked this evening is we've evoked Adalya Lama, which for many of us is one of the great examples of love and kindness and liberation and really inspires many of us. And the other person we've evoked is the person who's going to be executed tonight. And part of the ideal in Buddhism is to have an equal dosage of love and kindness to both people. And not just simply to choose Adalya Lama and exclude those people who we don't like or feel are our enemies or whatever, but to actually find the capacity within us to bring kindness and love to the full range of who human beings are. We have the capacity, I believe, within each of us to love everyone, even our enemies. And perhaps we learn to love our enemies first by loving our friends. So regardless of how well Adalya Lama is doing, I wish him well and lots of happiness. So thank you very much for this evening and I will see you in a month. you
