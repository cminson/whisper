Yeah, so welcome back everyone and while people are still joining in, I'll just invite you
in to maybe kind of in your own mind and heart and bring to your mind this Sutta that we
spoke about two days ago and this is the Sutta of the simile of a hardwood. We're using hardwood
simile to describe how one might keep us going on the path and not stop short, grabbing the
twigs and leaves or barks, softwoods or softwoods, but keep going. So we want to open it up just to
see if there are any questions and or comments, your own reflections that you like to share
based on what you received from the last class as well as maybe some some of you might have read
the Sutta in between. So yeah, we're going to open it up for a little bit to begin our day
together. I mean, maybe if people want they could put some just general comments in the chat
box too, like I reread it and now it makes more sense or I'm still confused or oh wait,
there was a Sutta I was supposed to read it. Great, yes, those who are able to chat it in
our chat box, please do so. And you can also do the voice and raise your hand and I see that
hand up. Okay, whoever had a hand up, please unmute. Yeah, I think I didn't bring this up on
Tuesday because I thought it was inappropriate and now I'm feeling like it's inappropriate. I'm
struck by both Sutta's feeling like there's a real superiority conceit and extractionist vibe.
Yeah, I think I wanted to say something clearer or to try to say something clearer than I said
on Tuesday. You know, the heartwood is not separate from the sapwood and from the bark.
They're relational. You can't have one without the other and as an aside, it's beautiful that
the heartwood is, you know, there's something related to age and maturity. The heartwood
is developed through the life of the tree. But yeah, the extractionist aspect of that one and
the betterness, the way in which isn't there a way to feel good about the Dharma without putting
down everybody else and everything else. And so struck by the examples, the spikenard and
sandalwood are both endangered species now. And what is that? That sort of why do they have
to be the best? You know, they're wonderful. And yes, it's an analogy and yes, I'm literal and I
run into problems because of that. But yeah, I just wanted to put that into the room.
I really, really appreciate, Hando, you naming this in terms of various ways that might evoke in
us with this assemblies. And it is quite can be quite productive in how one might relate to this
kind of assemblies. And I would invite you to kind of explore with this for sure, as a way to maybe
understand and associate kind of how we relate to this assembly that may be supportive and how
we might relate to this assembly that may not. And one of the things in this sutta, in terms of
this pieces that kind of gets shed in terms of going deeper and deeper in the hardwood,
maybe it's less about what to get rid of. But rather, there's a hardwood is, there is a function
of the hardwood that is being expressed, that is bringing a sense of a long lasting well-being.
And the it's not less about hardwood is better than the tricks and other pieces. But rather,
there is a function of what this hardwood is, is bringing out. And in our practice,
then part of this is to see the effect of the practice in ourselves. And over time,
we'll see the beauty of all of this different aspects of the trees and different situations that
we're meeting. And I see Diana had unmuted, if you'd like to say a few words, please.
And David unmuted too. So maybe all of us will weigh in here. So thank you,
Handel, for your comment. I appreciate it very much. And I'll just share kind of like how I was
thinking about it. I was like applying some of these Buddhist teachings, some foundational
teachings on it. And in the beginning, it describes the person as seeking hardwood. So it's and,
and then you used extractive. But in my mind, I was using the word discernment, like, okay,
this is what's helpful, it's going to help end the suffering that earlier in the suit of the
person was talking about. And these other things are not going to help the ending of suffering.
So I was using that type of language, like, just to evaluate, is this what's going to be helpful,
or is it not going to be helpful? And we could use this Buddhist term like kusala, right,
wholesome or skillful, helpful, these healthy, those types of things. And then this idea of
superiority conceit. I would say that this, the Buddhist path that's inside, that's part of the
teravada condition, very much as the superiority conceit, in the terms of exactly how I was saying,
this is helpful, this is not helpful. We see that over and over again, this kind, this delineation,
kind of like really binary. And I would say maybe this was a pedagogical tool the Buddha was using.
And for us as practitioners, we recognize, oh, it's not quite as black and white, but as a way
to help drive home the point, he was trying to make it black and white. So I just offer that as
it's something to consider. And David has something to say. Yeah, you know, I just want to follow on
what you've just said, Diana, and flag something for later, because I'll speak about it later. But
one of the things when I reread this sutra this morning, just a couple of hours ago that struck
me, and that I wanted to mention is that the comparison made to followers of the Buddha and
people who are not followers of the Buddha, and the simile of the sandalwood and the black
oris root, aren't in the Buddha's voice. They're in Ghanaka Mogulana's voice. And I actually think
that's quite significant. The Buddha doesn't ascent or and doesn't disagree. Why are they put in
another voice? I'll kind of return to that when we talk about that later. But I think it's,
I think it's purposeful and doesn't mean elsewhere in the suttas, you don't have some of the same
in the Buddha's voice, but here at any rate, it's in Ghanaka Mogulana's voice. Just that.
Thank you. I see Aaron and Kevin had a hand up, maybe that'd be the last one.
The, all of your comments have been so rich that this is almost a perfluous, but what
came to mind for me is, in rereading is, and speaking of non voices other than the Buddhas,
right above the five daily reflections in my daily practice sheet is a quote from Shri Nishir
Datta Maharaj, have only one desire, the desire for freedom. And for me, that's what I've been so
struck by in both of these suttas is this unrelenting Samvega of the Buddhas, not stopping, not even
stopping with states like the Jhanas that could be so seductive and that his own teachers felt
were final liberation. And for me, that's the positive reframing that I get. For me, that's
what the heart would is evoking. Thank you. Thank you for the beautiful reflection.
And I'm going to pass it on to Kim, who's going to offer some teachings on our next sutta.
Great. Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate the way our initial discussion kind of flowed smoothly from
reviewing of MN 29 to starting to talk about MN 107, which is our second text. And I'll be talking
a bit about that now. I just want to give something of an overview of MN 107 in a way that connects
it to what was discussed last time regarding MN 29. So that sutta was about, as we said, stopping
short or somehow accepting certain attainments as the final goal instead of continuing on with this,
you know, desire for liberation and allowing that to fully come to fruition. So we practice all the
way until the heart would. And then at that point, I think we would know what heart would is. And we
can speculate before that. But when it's, let's say, practicing into the heart would in order to
really understand what it is. So that might be farther than we think. But it does unfold if we
just keep going. So MN 107 takes a different angle on how we might have difficulty, let's say, getting
all the way to the goal. In that case, the image is more about veering off is the term that we use,
not sticking to the path, but going in another direction, such that we don't end up arriving.
It's a straightforward enough image that I think we can understand. You know, if you're in,
you want to get to Seattle from San Francisco, you should not go south. That doesn't work.
I mean, you have to go a really long way all the way around. I guess on a sphere, it all works. But,
you know, so you would want to go north. But even if you do go north, you don't want to veer off to
the east, right? And you might still not get there, even if you started out north. So, you know,
it's meant to be, I think, kind of straightforward like that. So MN 107, as David already pointed
to, is the discourse to Ghanaka Mogulana. And Ghanaka means accountant. So this is the discourse to
the accountant named Mogulana. And that's a different Mogulana than you may have heard of,
sorry, Buddha and Mogulana as the Buddha's chief disciples. This is a different one. I guess Mogulana
was a popular name in ancient India, something like that. So this Mogulana is a Brahmin. And
he approaches the Buddha by pointing out that among Brahmins, there's kind of a gradual training,
gradual practice and gradual progress in the area of study. Because that's what the Brahmins did,
is they received these oral teachings and they were meant to memorize them and to be able to
say them and do certain rituals in a very exact way. And so you can imagine a person trains and
trains in order to get better and better at this. And then he makes an analogy also as an accountant.
He says also in accountancy and archery and other professions of the time, there's the idea that
somebody is gradually practicing, gradually getting better training in their profession. And so then
he asks the Buddha, well, can your training program be understood like this? And so the Buddha
gets the concept, okay, this is the way this guy is thinking. And so he says, yes, actually,
my training could be thought about that way. He's meeting on Mogulana and where he is. And
he's using, as Diana mentioned, this kind of pedagogical tool of a training with different
stages so that he can connect with him. But he doesn't quite describe his training in the same
way. The first thing he does is he gives an analogy, the first image in the Sutta of a horse,
a training horse. So training a thoroughbred horse. And that is not quite the same idea.
If you think about it, there's this concept of a thoroughbred horse, but it's not well trained,
is that you need to train it to certain kinds of restraint in order to be able to be ridden and
to be used and so forth. And so we have a different idea maybe than studying more and more or counting
higher and higher and doing more and more complex math. Kind of a little bit different concept,
not so much about acquiring knowledge or acquiring anything really. We have more of this idea of
letting go, or in this case, actually restraint at the beginning of the path. So what is it that
we're going to talk a little bit about what that means in this case? This idea, I'll just
reiterate it, of going through different stages is a pedagogical tool. We know that the path is
not really linear and step by step. Anyone who's been practiced for a while, I think, has a sense
of this. And yeah, nonetheless, there is a flow to it. There are things that you encounter earlier
on and things that you encounter later on in a broad sense, even if the details are a little bit
different and if things keep feeding back and informing each other. Nonetheless, there is kind
of a sense. So the Buddha picks up on that aspect of it. Yeah, okay, there is a way in which the
path is developmental. So we'll talk about that in this Sutta. So I think we would want to catch
the spirit of the pedagogy and not get too hung up in the literalism of step one, step two.
He repeatedly uses the phrase early on in the Sutta, the tattagata disciplines a person thus,
tattagata means the Buddha. So this word discipline, maybe we don't like that so much, but that's a
good translation of the Pali word, which is vein 18. And that is related to the word vinaya,
which is the monastic training rules. So we are talking about a monk here, but we're, again,
using a non literal, we can make an analogy to us as late people also. And so it means to train,
you know, the training that we do, but also it has a secondary meaning of giving up or letting go
in the positive sense of releasing. So a person in the Buddhist training is successively giving
up things in order to restrain their prior ways of behaving and thinking. And if you've
practiced mindfulness, you might have a sense that the mind is a little bit like a wild horse
when we start and the restraint is kind of a good idea at the beginning. I don't know how many people
have told me, Oh, I tried that they learn I'm a meditation teacher. And you say, Oh, I tried
meditation once I couldn't do it at all. My mind was everywhere. I just gave up immediately.
And so, you know, that can happen. But there are ways to, let's say, restrain that tendency of
the mind. So we also have this image of a thoroughbred horse. It's not just any horse,
not just any wild horse, thoroughbred horses meant to imply something of kind of high quality.
And so, you know, something that can be trained. So people who are interested in meditation
already, that's a sign that the mind is interested in something good. So there's this possibility
of training. And then there are explicit steps, I'm not going to go through them in detail.
This is about the usual gradual training that's described, there's training in ethical conduct.
So restraint with the restraint with the restraint of the patimokha. So for us,
that would be the precepts, you know, stopping the obviously harmful behaviors like killing and
stealing and lying and things like that. And then there's guarding of the sense faculties so that we
don't hear or see or smell something and just run off with it and immediately get entranced.
We know this is an ongoing issue. We have to look at moderation and eating, wakefulness,
mindfulness and full awareness or mindfulness and clear comprehension of being aware during our
daily life activities. All of these are trainings that we've probably undertaken in some way and
know that they're ongoing practices we do. And then the last restraint is to resort to a secluded
place. So being willing to withdraw from the social world in order to practice more deeply.
So all of these are various, it has these doing these actions has the opportunity to restrain
various unskillful behaviors that distract the mind. And so, you know, beyond the first step
of ethical misconduct, we're talking about things that are not really unethical, but more in the
realm of what Diana mentioned, kusala or akusala, things that are helpful or not helpful if you're
wanting to liberate the mind from its bondage, let's say to breed hatred and delusion. So, you know,
chatting late into the evening with your friends and playing a lot of video games, there's nothing
unethical about that, but it's not very conducive to a good night's sleep, for example, or to having
an undistracted mind, you sit down in meditation. So, you know, just being aware of how our activities
affect the mind. Oh, and then just some I've gotten run off on the side trail talking about those,
because I think they're interesting. But in the sutta, the once the monk goes off to a secluded
place, he or she is practicing the jhanas and the insights that can lead to liberation. So,
this way of practice is a pleasant abiding for those who are arahants, and it's onward leading
for those who are still aspiring to awakening. So, like in MN 29, I want to highlight that there's
a process of going farther and farther inward, right? So, we start with obvious external behaviors.
And then we go, you know, more into looking at the mind, more into subtle kinds of ways of living
so that we can support meditation, living more quietly, not sleeping a lot, etc. kind of going
more and more subtle. And then eventually we get to mindfulness, sitting down and practicing
internally and developing concentration. So, again, we have this idea of going towards things that
are inward and more subtle, similar notion of keep going, keep going, don't, you know, don't
stop short. But here in this case, the Buddha is supplying the external impetus to the person,
you know, I restrain a person this way or I tell them to do this or that. It's not quite the same
as the practitioner themselves needing to keep going and not get complacent with progress. So,
we have a slight difference in how the path is unfolded, even if it's going to the same end.
And then there's a bit of a turn in section 12, where Gana Kamogalana decides to ask. He says,
when master Godama's disciples are thus advised and instructed by him, do they all attain nibbana,
the ultimate goal, or do some not attain it? An interesting question. We may have wondered this
ourselves. Is there some kind of guarantee here or what is all this for? Am I going to get there or
what? So, then the Buddha actually gives a very honest answer and he says, some of my disciples
attain nibbana and some do not attain it. Whoa, that might get our attention. So, then we immediately
have the question, okay, what's the difference? How does that happen? So, the Brahmin is also
surprised, actually. And he says, wait a minute, I thought you were a good teacher. I thought you
were there training them. What's up with actually admitting that some of them don't get there,
despite your training? This might have been unusual in the Buddha's time, where spiritual
teachers tend to claim, I've got the method. If you do this, it's going to work. And here the
Buddha's frankly saying, well, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. How about that for,
we had a comment earlier about conceit and arrogance. And the Buddha's, I think, looking
not conceited and arrogant there, but very honest. So, the Buddha gives an analogy,
again, to Gautama Kamogalana. And here's maybe the second main analogy in the Sutta. He analogizes
to giving directions on a road. And he says, if you walk down the road, you need to turn left at
this town and then go right. And then eventually you will get to, in this case, Rajagaha, a big city
of the time. But some people don't get there because they might, what, veer off the road.
We're not talking stopping short. You stop at the bar and have a few drinks and decide to just
live there for a while, which is what we talked about last week. This one would be like you get
to the intersection and the directions say to turn left and you turn right and you're not going to
get to the right city. So, I think we all have some experience with this on the path. I do want to
say immediately, though, that, you know, I know that some people are concerned about doing it right.
That can be a big issue. So, we're not talking about veering off in terms of, you know, you sit
down and you have a lot of hindrances in your sitting. You spend the whole time actually just
working with your thinking mind and you think, ah, I'm not on the path. My mind is going nuts.
I must veered off somewhere. That's not actually quite, you know, that's too much of an assumption
to make. But this is veering off the path in a more serious way, like not following the instructions
at all, following some other instructions essentially. And David's going to talk more about
how it is that we would do this, various mind states that lead us to veer off, distraction,
arrogance, fear, doubt, you know, these kinds of things. And we're almost at the end of my time
here, but I want to point out that there's a footnote. Bikavoti gives a helpful footnote
in MN107 that refers back to MN63, 65. And that has another thoroughbred cult training
analogy. And I want to quote from that, Suta, because it says, sometimes when you're training
a cult, like, let's say you put the bit onto, you know, the thing in the horse's mouth
before you're training it. And this is the first time you've ever put a bit onto the horse. And so
it's like, you know, it doesn't like that. And it says in the Suta, because he is doing something
he has never done before, he displays some contortion, writhing, and vacillation. But eventually,
he becomes peaceful in that action. So does this sound familiar? You know, it's like you sit down
on the meditation cushion, and the teacher says, follow your breath. And, you know, you've never
done that before. And so your mind is like, displays some contortion, writhing, and vacillation about
staying with the breath for 15 minutes, right? It's not easy. So we have this understanding, we
can imagine a horse, you know, they sort of go, what do you put on the bit? But then eventually,
you know, you get to the place where the horse can wear the bit, it's okay. So this is an analogy
for our minds. Does anybody see this? So okay, so I'll wind up various ways that we can veer off
the path. If we're not able to follow the instructions, see them through, go through the
contortions, and eventually become peaceful. That's the direction we're looking to go in. I
think we named this before, you know, does the mind, yeah, go in the direction of gradually
becoming more peaceful. So I guess I'll finish with the Buddha says, okay, this is an analogy that
Ghanaka Mogulana can understand. He says, you know, if you tell someone how to get to Rajagaha,
and they don't get there, what's the problem? And Ghanaka Mogulana says, well,
what can I do about that? Master Gautama, I am the one who shows the way. The Buddha says,
it's the same thing. I give the instructions, not everybody follows them. We see this echoed
in Dhammapada 276. It is up to you to make strong effort to target us, merely tell you how
following the path those absorbed in meditation will be freed from Mara's bonds.
So that it is clear if we follow the path, there is the guarantee that we get there.
The problem is that we don't always do that. So that's why, you know, it's up to us to stay on it
and to not veer off and not stop short. Okay. So thank you all.
Thank you, Kim. I loved this idea of the horse. I'm comfortable. I've never trained a horse,
but I can imagine any creature, myself included, not likeiness. So now we'll like to put you into
some breakout rooms to talk about this, but maybe I'll just add a few words onto what Kim said,
which beautifully said. Thank you, Kim. I just really enjoyed hearing what you were saying.
So this, why do we veer off and what helps us to stay on track? What helps us to stay on track?
And that'll be the question in the breakout room, but maybe I'll just build a little bit on what Kim
said, that, you know, the Buddha is showing us the path. And when we find ourselves having
difficulties, for example, the mind is just not settling down in the way that we were expecting.
The Buddha doesn't say, please beat yourself up. You know, allow your inner critic to get as loud
as possible and follow it. He's not saying that. He's not saying you're a bad person because you
can't do this or anything like this. He's saying, no, just keep on coming back to the teachings
or here's the teachings. And that is the path. The path is just to keep on coming back in whatever
way you can. And the path is not to berate yourself or judge yourself or something like this. If you
find it difficult, of course, it's difficult, right? We don't, otherwise we wouldn't need a Buddha
to point it out. And we would just say, oh, there's Rajagaha Go. And so I just want to highlight that
because sometimes our inner critic can get loud when we hear these things. So, and David will talk
about a little bit more about some of the reasons we may veer off, but I'll just drop in one. Maybe
we don't even like this idea of restraint. You know, like, no, we want to be wild and free, right?
In some way, we have this idea that we don't want anything to be curbed for us. But this is, again,
just staying on the path. So here's the question. You'll be in groups of three or four, and you'll
have 12 minutes. The question is, what helps you stay on track? What helps you stay on track?
Maybe this path is very meaningful for you. Maybe you've seen some of the benefits.
Maybe there's something in you that resonates with the teachings, even if 100% of it isn't exactly
how you think it should be or something like this. And then the last thing I'll say is,
sometimes we get emails from people saying, why do you have to do small breakout groups? I don't
want to go and break out groups because people are giving me advice, or because somebody's trying
to convince me of something else. So just a reminder, we don't need to give advice to anybody.
Everybody gets to have their own thoughts. We don't have to all think exactly the same.
So just a reminder, this is an opportunity to love and appreciate and support each other.
So just throw that in there. So what helps you stay on track? And here we go. Okay,
I think we're all finding our way back. So now we'd love to hear from you all.
How was that to talk about what helps you to stay on track? And to hear maybe some other people had
to say or to even have that question. Maybe there was a question that you haven't asked
yourself before. So we'd love to hear from some of you. How was it to
have this conversation about what helps you stay on track?
Could you raise your zoom hand? I can't see everybody on the same screen. So if you raise
your physical hand, you may or may not be seen. I'll just offer that.
Mary? I really appreciated the comment of a person in our group, which was reiterated a few times
with others that it's kind of like brushing your teeth. What's the alternative? So it just seems
like such a basic part of our lives that it's unthinkable that it not be a priority and that it
be kind of the groundwork from which everything else comes. So I found that comment helpful and
really true. Thank you, Mary. Can you like flush out a little bit when you say it is like brushing
your teeth? What is the it that you're referring to? The commitment to practice, the continuity,
just doing it even when we're too tired. We don't want to bother brushing our teeth. We're just
too tired. I was saying I just said two weeks of back-to-back guess and just the continuity of
even if I was too tired to sit for 45 minutes or an hour as I was lying in bed, I would still be
doing practice. And even if it was just for 10 minutes in the morning, because that's all I had,
you know, it's like I couldn't not do it because the day is so much fuller and progresses so much
more easily even if it's just a small moment because I can't give it anymore. So it's that kind
of commitment. Great, great. Thank you. Thank you. Charles Lee. Hello. Hi. Yeah, we were and I was in a
or I was in a wonderful, wonderful quartet and it was it was an experience like that that keeps me
on the path. So Sangha, the seeing the devotion of, you know, of our facilitators and teachers
and also other practitioners, it's that gives so much energy. And I mean, I find this happens on
retreat for me where, you know, there are those times where it's like, you know, I don't know if
I can, you know, bear another sit but, you know, see somebody else, you know, doing the same or
or, you know, asking a question that maybe I was too embarrassed to ask. And so and our group,
I thought our group really modeled the speaking from, you know, my own experience, which and I
know, you know, language is dicey and, you know, we're all taught, I think we're often taught not to,
you know, maybe speaking, you know, saying, I all of the time sounds a little bit weird, but it,
you know, I find that it really, one, it doesn't, you know, put my experience on anybody else. So
even as simple as, you know, just saying you, even though we all know you mean, I, it's still,
it's still helps, but also for me, it also helps just accept and own my own experience.
So it makes it that much closer when I talk about, you know, I, you know, I was feeling anxious,
like, then I can really own, you know, own that experience, which has really helped my
development and acceptance of myself so much. And so, so yeah, so, you know, loved my group,
loved this group, and it helps me keep on practicing. And then one other thing is that we
also, few of us answered kind of what, what tends to take us off the path. And for me, it's like,
I don't know, it's it recently, it's been sports and sports highlights, because I love sports,
and I'm watching too, you know, a lot of NBA playoffs and, you know, not getting in that
evening sit sometimes. But thanks. Yeah. Thank you, Charles Lee. Thank you for highlighting
what, you know, I think many of us have heard the Buddha says, the spiritual friendship is all of
the spiritual life or, you know, I'm paraphrasing there, but just the importance of the community
that we're with and how without that, it's so hard to walk this path. Thank you. Thank you, Charles.
Eileen. Good morning, everyone. I'm thinking about the previous
sutra that we read. In fact, I was mentioning in my group that I probably wouldn't have even
started reading sutras on my own. So I really appreciate classes where we got sort of broke
that ice for me. And what keeps me on the path a lot is the statement that was repeated in that
sutra about five times, the one we did last time. Surely there must be a way out of this
suffering, because I never used to think that I used to think, you know, I'm miserable,
you know, I'll distract myself. Period. That was always it. And I think a lot of that happens in
our society, you know, you feel bad, you eat something or you, you know, buy something or you
do something. But the idea that there could be a way out of this was what I, the new thing that I
learned from this practice and having people to study with and practice with really helped
me to see the importance of setting the intentions, which I now do in the mornings. And it makes a
huge difference in how my day goes. Nice. That part of the day full path to set intentions.
Beautiful. Thank you. Setting intentions. Thank you. Thank you. And also pointing to
the role of other people practicing together. Yeah. I read the four of us have certainly
discovered that's part of why we keep on practicing together and teaching together is
because we found the same thing. Yeah. I'm looking at my co-teachers and I'm trusting
that you will unmute yourself if you want to say something. Otherwise, I'm just going to keep on
going. So, so this will be the last one. So one question that I brought up in the group and
I'll bring up here as well is this specific soot also. It seems the first question that comes to
my mind is how do I apply this to my life, you know, to get this lay life that clearly are not,
I mean, there is such a gulf between me and monastic that goes anywhere. And kind of
the feeling that this arises or the feeling that arises in me is that, oh, this is so far away.
This is unattainable. This is not for me. I will never get there. To be honest, that's
a reaction that is, it brings out because I'm not a monastic and we're going to be one probably.
And how do you see that kind of as maybe others as well with that question or that
any anything that you can share? I think this is a legitimate question. Like, is this
transferable to those of us that are householders, quote unquote, rather than monastics?
And maybe we could ask ourselves the maybe the look at the question from the opposite direction.
You're saying you're so different from a monastic, but what are the ways in which you are the same?
Maybe there's this way in which, okay, you want to find greater freedom and peace and you want
it to have a role in your life. So maybe what does it mean to follow the, to be ethical, to follow
the ethical rules for us? Why we can do this? What does it mean to have sensory strength for
those of us? Maybe it means that we're like not always shopping on the internet or, you know,
there might be some modern day or householder equivalent of that. What are the ways we can
be like devoted to wakefulness and moderate and eating? Like we can do these things to not indulging
our senses all the time, just doing what feels good simply because it feels good or
these types of things. So I appreciate what you're saying. We're not monastics, none of us here are,
but also we could ask the questionable in what ways are we similar without having to ordain,
right? We're not saying that you have to ordain, but to make this a priority in our lives in a way
that fits our life. And maybe the last thing I'll say here, oh, Kim's unmuted, excellent,
she has something to say. Last thing I'll say is let's watch if there's ever this inner critic
that comes up that says, oh, I should be like a more like a monastic. It's just that I'll just
say that 100 over to Kim. Great, thank you. I really just have something to add to Diana's
excellent comment, which is that I can understand that from the suit as we read, you would, you
might have a response like that because they are addressed to monastics and they go through kind of
the monastic training, at least this one that we're on now, I'm in 107. But there are a number of
other suits as actually quite a lot of them. And we've maybe highlighted them in other classes
where the Buddha that are addressed to lay people are householders and the Buddha gives very similar
instructions. There are many cases where he teaches householders how to meditate or he extols that
householders have achieved certain stages of awakening. So in the teachings as a whole,
there isn't a sense that householders are inevitably irrevocably barred from these other
things. So it's a fair question and luckily the broader suit does have different things to say.
So thank you. And then with that, we'll hand it over to Ying. Okay. Well, that's a nice segue
to a little period of meditation. And this invitation that I have is right off this question
that Akamara posted in terms of how we practice, how do we find the path? And so if you like, maybe
just allow yourself to find a spot where you can sit quietly maybe for 10 minutes or so.
And at the beginning of this meditation, I invite you to be generous to yourselves
arriving here and arriving now.
Maybe you still need to move the body a little bit to settle into here and now.
And maybe a few long deep breaths will allow you to arrive a little more fully.
Being very generous and kind in those initial moments of our meditative practice.
Mind may be wandering in thoughts still. Without the
evocation of the inner critic, we're simply trusting,
arriving at the present moment through the body.
And this path we've been describing, sharing is a revealed here and now.
And becoming present and mindful to our embodied experience.
Maybe we can begin by turning the attention to the pelvic area
where the body makes contact with the floor.
Chairs, finding our seat in the body.
And receiving the sensations of the body making contact.
Allow this earthy body resting on earth.
The earth elements in the body is naturally grounding, settling.
As we rest in the present experience,
aware, mindful, collected.
The Dharma becomes visible right here in the sensations of the body.
In the movements of the breath.
In the contact of the body with the floor.
And staying connected with this felt sense experience.
Path is revealed, a scene right here.
Noticing that how when we're connected with the immediacy of our lived experience,
our heart can be more at ease.
Maybe a heart and mind can be more at ease.
We're sitting like a tall red wood, rooted upright.
We are for doubting questions come along.
Can I do this?
I'm not good enough.
You allow the thoughts to breathe through.
While you stay connected, rooted.
I want to offer this little reading from the monastery within.
A little Zen story about doubts, doubting voice.
A nun came to the abyss complaining that the doubt was her primary challenge along the Buddhist path.
She had doubt about the path itself, about the teachings, about her teachers,
and most importantly about her own ability to succeed in the Buddhist practice.
Your problem, said the abyss, is that you don't doubt enough.
If you are going to the trouble of doubting, then continue your doubting, but do it more thoroughly.
Please also doubt your doubt.
Do we dare to doubt our doubts?
Do we dare to trust this moment, here and now, and this is enough.
This is where the path is found.
There is a monastery within each of us, and we can enter whenever we like.
Thank you, Yang, for guiding us to the monastery within.
It's a very nice balance, I think, to Akbar Al's question earlier about, we're not monastics,
but the monastery within, a book by Gil, suggests that the path is within, the monastery is within.
And as we explore these sutras so rich in similes, as Kim pointed out at the outset,
they're not probably meant to be taken literally, and they're meant to be taken in many different ways.
So the monastery, the path, the thoroughbred horse, the development of a profession, the path to Rajakaha, all our siblings to be held in ways that support our practice.
I begin with a digression, but let me go back to where Kim left us in the sutra.
It's quite a lovely passage, and as we end today, we'll suggest, once again, that kind of rereading these may be something that you'll find useful in your practice and in doing this class with us together.
But the Buddha, after his interlocutor, after Ghanaka Mogulana, has discovered for himself with the Buddha's questions that, oh, right, he's just pointing out the direction from one place to another.
He can't make people go there.
The Buddha then echoes that, and possibly Kim read this earlier, but the Buddha says, so too, Mogulana.
Nibbana exists, and the path leading to Nibbana exists, and I'm present as a guide.
The Buddha is there as a guide.
Yet when my disciples have been thus advised and instructed by me, some of them attain Nibbana, the ultimate goal, and some don't.
What can I do about that?
The Tathagata, the Buddha, is one who shows the way.
And what follows in the next couple passages, it's as if Ghanaka Mogulana sort of hears this.
There is Nibbana, there is a path, the Buddha shows the way, and then he looks around and he looks at who are the people who are on the path with the Buddha.
And here there's a nice division of responsibility.
The Buddha has sort of said his responsibility for practices goes this far, he can show the way.
Walking the way, making the way unfold, creating a path, creating a monastery within, those responsibilities fall to the practitioner.
And maybe to the community of practice like that gathered here today.
And in first a negative and then a positive passage, not the Buddha, but Ghanaka Mogulana sort of realized, oh, okay, if I look around the Buddha, the people I see have the following characteristics.
And here I'm quoting from the Bhikkhu Bodhi translation.
He says, these are people that have gone into homelessness, that is they've created a monastery within and in some cases without a monastery around them, out of faith, not out of faithlessness, out of commitment, out of confidence, they've moved toward this practice.
They have practiced good virtuous conduct, particularly why speech is mentioned.
Now, he says loose spoken, they're devoted to wakefulness, they're concerned with seclusion.
They're greatly respectful of training.
They're not careless, they're keen to avoid backsliding.
They are energetic, resolute, established, well established in mindfulness, fully aware, concentrated, their minds are unified, they possess wisdom.
And he says, Master Master Gautama, dwells together with these.
So this is the company that the Buddha keeps.
And I just want to point out here that what Ghanaka Mogulana has just done for himself is restate the gradual training that Kim described earlier.
He sees in the Buddha's community of practice, the gradual training being practiced.
And again, here it's interesting, it's not linear, it's a group of, it's a collection of characteristics of the people that Ghanaka Mogulana just sees are gathered around the Buddha.
And it's interesting that he points out that these are people, practitioners, but in a way what surrounds the Buddha is practice, is the gradual training, is sitting in meditation, virtuous conduct, a community of Dharma friends.
So moving from that to sort of what veering off the path might look like in our own cases, which is what Kim promised I'd say.
So I should say something about that, instead of just getting lost in the beautiful language of the sutra.
But in a sense, that's our context, in other words, veering off the path means in various ways finding ourselves estranged maybe from some of the practice that is described first in kind of a linear fashion and then as characteristics of the community of practice that surrounds the Buddha.
But to kind of put this in our own terms, veering off the path and Charles Lee mentioned the distraction by, you know, following March Madness.
Distraction is perhaps the first thing that comes to mind and distraction as we all know comes in myriad disguises.
Sometimes it's very obvious sometimes we're aware we're distracting ourselves, right, and other times, you know, we only realize after a period of time that that distraction has happened.
The Buddha also points here to other things that maybe lie under distraction, or that maybe are some in some cases different, for example, complacency.
We all find ourselves, I think at plateaus and practice sometimes where maybe we're not sure what to do next, but maybe we're just comfortable with where we are, and we get a little complacent.
I would say lazy, but the Buddha, at least in the suit that he doesn't cast any aspersions on practice or practitioners. This is the natural course of practice.
We have, we have a good map. We know that an endpoint exists, but you know, for various reasons we find ourselves veering away from, from those instructions.
There could be a lack of discipline or commitment, and that can come up with complacency, where we find, oh, you know, when we look into it carefully, we realize we've lost track of the goal.
Maybe we lost track of why we started the path, which we wanted to kind of seed in our first section on Tuesday with our question for the breakout group.
Let's start always checking in. Somebody mentioned earlier today, the importance of intention, setting intention for each sit for a period of practice for retreat for this month for the next five minutes for the whole path, you know,
Somebody mentioned in the chat just a few minutes ago, being overwhelmed by the teachings. This is a really good point, you know, there's a lot of teachings out there.
There's a lot of different things that get introduced in our scene, even if you stick really kind of to one, you know, lineage or one teacher, there's a lot of different teachings.
They can become overwhelming. Sometimes they, they almost always seem more complex than they really are.
But if they do sometimes overwhelm us with either the volume, the fire hose of the teachings, or, you know, with their intricacy or their, you know, some, some way we don't get them or the fact that a lot of times we don't get them until we experience them and they're clear, but until we
So sometimes related to this can be the habit we sometimes find ourselves in of trying a lot of different teachings. Oh, you know, mindfulness of the breath it's kind of working or if I don't.
So I'm going to, you know, I'm going to do something else that I read about or these are ways again, everybody here I would certainly I can speak I think for myself safely but possibly for my teaching colleagues to that you know this is just something that happens.
You explore different things and it's sometimes you find that some of those operations lead you away and in fact turn out to be distractions either willful or completely unknown to ourselves unconscious.
Another thing I think that happens is wanting to proceed at a quick pace in order to get to this destination.
And I, as a, or I'll ask her question, I look back at the text and the Buddha says, continue from Rajaka, continue on this path for a while, and you will come to a town, continue for a while, and then you'll come to a village.
He doesn't tell us how long, you know, and it's interesting to think that there's something very useful there about the time. Oh, continue for a while.
I get the impression that part of what's being expressed there is, there's no hurry, which is an interesting way to take it, possibly.
The path is more about where we are here now than it is about tracking sort of where we are from where we began and the destination.
In the in the similarly as it's put in the suit, I think something that's really important in addition to the things I've mentioned is mistaking the goal.
You know, very easy to see whether it's another shiny thing or just thinking that it's something that it's not.
I think as you experience some of the insights that can come with practice, they have quite a different flavor sometimes than that which we expected.
And so it's easy to mistake the goal and get move away from where we are practicing to something we think is out there in front of us.
And in the similarly, he has the the practitioner heading off into the West, taking the wrong turn and going to the West.
To me, what comes to mind is that sort of going off into the sunset. Oh, it looks nice over there. I'm going to get a my tie.
Put my feet up, find the sunset, listen to the waves. Very easy to just kind of think that we that that's that that's the that that's the aim.
A couple more minutes, but I'll just say that stopping short also sort of shows up in this similarly, there is a really we chose two different kind of aspects of the practice but I think can mentioned it would be really easy to kind of stop for a while in the
village or the town.
And, you know, get caught up in events there maybe find oneself a fiance to an attractive partner settle down, raise a family develop a proof anyway you get what I'm saying be very easy to sort of, you know, stop along the way so those are implicit in this metaphor that you got to keep going
that's where it's different but that yeah you could stop short in any number of attractive places along the way.
So to sort of summarize here and leave kind of with, you know, sort of apologize, a positive measure method, a positive message of encouragement.
I think this, like all of the practice, you know, it's very easy to focus on the things that are going wrong, but this is this is this suit is full of encouragement, and I would.
I would say there's three principal messages of encouragement. One, the Buddha tells us, there is a path from here to Nibbana.
That he says in his voice. Second, he points the way there is a path, and he knows it and he shares it openheartedly.
And so the message both explicit and implicit is to keep going keep returning to that gradual training and it's various aspects whatever needs attention that's where your practices.
If we follow the Buddha's instructions we're not going to get lost.
We briefly find ourselves, you know, off in a rut.
And yet we, you know, get back onto the path.
I think some of what we hear to in the suit is that we're safe, and we're on the path when we're in the Buddhist company that is in the company of the teachings.
We're in a good way in a good path when we're keeping close to Dharma friends as, for example, right here and right now.
And just to leave it with something that I was inspired to say, as you guided us was, what would it be like if when we discover as inevitably will we will that we veered from the path that we return to the path as we're instructed as we train ourselves to return to the breath.
The mind caught up in something in meditation.
We just return gently, we return with an open heart with compassion.
And pick up again where where we were, and where we are where we find ourselves, we can, we can bring ourselves back into the path of practice with the same gentleness without beating ourselves up as one of us said earlier.
Without feeling like it's such a bad thing to be off the path, just like coming back to the breath.
No hurry, going to be doing it over and over again.
But instead of going round and round in a circle of samsara, we can feel ourselves securely on the path from, from here to Rajaka.
Thank you, David. I hope that maybe gives us a picture of how this applies more explicitly more directly to our own path or life or own practice that we're all engaged in here.
So we just wanted to open it up at this point to see if there are any lingering questions or comments on what we've learned and discussed today about this MN107, the discourse to Ghanaka Mogulana and the idea of staying on the path.
So please can raise your hand in some way. Hopefully electronically as best.
Kevin, was that your hand? No, it wasn't. We're just leaning forward.
What were other thoughts that maybe sparked from the various things that David brought in and also Ying's reading about doubt and doubting our doubt.
Yeah, Mariah.
Thank you guys so much for this. First of all, I wanted to thank you. It was just beautiful. And the guide of meditation was wonderful.
As you were talking, David, I became aware that in terms of veering off what happens with me the most is that underneath whether it's distraction or whatever might look like on the surface the way that I veer off underneath it all.
It just seems like it's I withhold a part of my heart from the experience because I'm afraid. And I'm always reminded of something Gil said to me which was just let your heart unfreeze, let it melt.
And that seems to be a very slow process. So, I just wanted to say that. Thank you.
And I think that's a really important point. And Kim, you may want to say something too. But yeah, you know, and that's something I didn't say but might have said, which is just that it's like that whole thing about primary and secondary emotions that when we notice
distraction or boredom or one of these kind of vague things going on in practice, it can be useful to explore the curious without being judgmental.
Oh, there's some fear here. Fear is really common in practice. It's frightening to let go. And each letting go can arise with some, if not fear, some concerns, some quite comprehensible and reasonable worry about what it might be like to live differently.
So anyway, I think you raise a really good point. And so when distraction comes up, it's good to be curious what what is this, what is being feared or what what, you know, what what isn't what doesn't want to be seen, what is their version around.
What do I want that's different from what's here, etc. Thanks for that.
Thank you.
One of the big takeaway I got from Tuesday and today is that you know, sometimes I focus too much on the techniques and I realize that it has to start with the heart.
Without that intention being very explicit.
All you do is just get stuck in the techniques.
And, and that's when you begin to have doubts, you know, and then you try another technique and you try this.
But you left out the hard part.
So nicely said, you know, we have so many different dimensions of ourselves that we're bringing to practice.
And you've highlighted, I think this idea of using a technique is often based in the cognitive mind that has, you know, figured out what it needs to do it's got the plan, etc. Oh, now I do this when this happens.
And it works for a little while and sometimes it's a good way to start, you know, for a little bit, somebody said overwhelming the teaching so you just you pick a technique you do it.
But over time, if we're really honest with our mindfulness, we will start to see that there's something else operating besides our thinking mind and our technique in mind.
It's maybe associated with the heart side, the heart that has a yearning a longing something that is visceral feeling of this sense of wanting to move toward even wanting to find the freedom.
And if we don't eventually include that we don't have enough juice, like our cars going to run out of gas before we can get all the way there.
So you have to add in that part as you said, and it comes in different orders for different people sometimes.
But I love that you've highlighted that and realize that there are these different dimensions of practice. Diana.
Yeah, I just wanted to maybe build on what Winnie said I appreciate this very much. Winnie and both Kim are saying, but maybe I can play around with language a little bit and say, Winnie said you have to start with the heart.
And I can, and I might say, how you start with the heart is to start where you are, like whatever is happening is where we practice.
And that's one way of kind of bringing in the heart, as opposed to the mind saying, oh, it should be this or shouldn't be that.
But maybe that's just a playful way to kind of look at it. We just start where we are. And that's how we start with the heart.
Yeah, it's a good point. I see Ying is also unmuted.
I just appreciate both Kim and Diana's response.
And also in the Chinese culture, the heart and mind is the same character of the character heart.
So sometimes when I think about mindfulness and I'm kind of simultaneously will say heartfulness, that kind of, you know, they don't have to have very black and white kind of lines drawn to it.
But the sound part of us has this sort of intuitive sense of knowing that Diana spoke about last time, not like a hint of it, you know, the heart's yearning.
Great. Thank you.
So there's short one. Okay, why don't we go ahead, David. I was just going to say so to bring things to a close and we like to with our with raised.
What do I want to say with a wink maybe to suggest that there might be some useful homework done between now and Saturday, but with a smile.
But reviewing these suit this now with what we've said and experienced and talked about in the rooms and practice within meditation, maybe something that you'll find new richness in them.
I looked at the suit this morning and found new things commented to somebody I live with it. Yeah, it's like always new. There's always something new.
And they're, they're, they're meant to be that way they're meant to be alive in our practice. So just reviewing them, which sounds like a homework assignment but do it with the, you know, practice in mind.
And then on Saturday, we're going to get into a little bit more kind of how to we call it here applications to our own practice.
And I think something I just bring us back to yin's meditation today and I guess it was Kim's on on Tuesday, just that it's easy to conceive that this is about these suit as are about the path, getting to nabana, they're also about meditation.
So watching how these things come up just in a 1520 minute, half hour hour long sit between now and Saturday, just watch the stopping short, the veering off.
It's a natural part of our practice that we correct for, we use this wisdom of the practice to kind of recenter, come back to the path, keep going.
And so think about it maybe in daily life, but also in as you meditate just wanted how did these things come alive in your practice that's in the sense how we try to bring this study into our practice or one way we do that.
So see you Saturday. We hope to maybe have some additional and new people who for whom this isn't a good time during to the week to practice and we look forward to a nice Saturday morning with everyone.
Take care. Feel free to unmute and say chow. Goodbye. Thank you. Bye bye.
Thank you. Hope everyone does well.
Thank you.
