Hello, friends. Hello. Greetings from Mountain View, California,
unceded Olonilan, where I am, where it's been a little rainy overnight
and will truly help you well wherever in the world you are joining from.
Lovely to join you this week and explore practices of compassion together.
So, the cultivation of compassion is done in this practice systematically,
in this tradition, systematically in concentric circles.
We start with ourselves, then we go to a category that's called benefactor,
then after that, dear friend.
And today we'll explore the category of benefactor and dear friend.
We'll join them together.
But also, we'll still practice with ourselves as well,
because you can never have enough self-compassion.
You cannot have enough self-compassion ever for yourself,
especially in the West, when we tend to have a lot more judgment
than kindness, compassion, understanding for this person, who is us anyway.
So, let's continue. Let's practice together.
So, arriving, arriving, arriving in this body,
arriving in this moment in time,
and allowing our body to release any tightness in the holding.
And connecting with the breath, allowing the breath to be breathed in,
the entirety of the in-breath and the entirety of the out-breath,
connecting with three deep diaphragmatic breaths in order to arrive and settle.
Let the breath be breathed in, holding for a few seconds and breathing out.
Let's do it together.
One more breathing out.
Third one, in your own time.
Letting the breath be natural, comforting, soothing, connecting to this moment here and now, to this body,
however it is showing up in this moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let your body soften, release if there are thoughts arising, they're not needed right now.
Giving our heart completely to this practice in this moment.
So the ruminating, thinking, planning, connecting to stories, let them go, not needed right now.
All concepts, not needed.
Stay with the simplicity of breathing right now.
And turning, turning your attention to the breath within the body.
Anything that might be arising in the body, that's challenging in this moment in time.
And can we meet it with kindness, can we meet it with compassion? Not wanting or forcing it to be any other way, but softening around it, breathing around it.
Breathing.
Or if something is heavy in our heart.
Similarly, breathing with it, with kindness, with compassion.
Letting go of the stories, but staying with the feeling, the sensations.
And soothing with the breath.
Here, here, here now.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you.
Feeling our own cup with kindness. If there's any challenges in this moment in time, kindness becomes compassion when it meets pain and suffering.
Letting go of stories and thoughts and just staying with the simplicity of breathing in and breathing out kindness.
Now let's invite to our heart space someone who's been a benefactor, who's been really kind to us in our life.
It's helpful if that person is still alive for this part of the practice, if you're not very experienced with cultivating compassion practice.
Someone who's been really kind, maybe a teacher, coach, a parent, a relative, or a friend, or a very good friend, has been there for us.
If it's hard to come up with someone, it could also be a person who's easy for us to have kindness or compassion could be a child.
If they're a teenager now, maybe when they were a child, or even a pet. Pets are often benefactors in some way.
Bringing this pain close to your heart.
One aspect of their life, one thing that might be challenging, or has been challenging, doesn't have to be everything, but just one aspect.
It could simply be that, oh yeah, they too have a body, which ages and aches and needs care.
Some other aspect that has been challenging for them.
Connecting with this being in your heart, in your mind's eye.
Connecting with this difficulty, and meeting it with good will.
Wishing them ease.
Wishing them peace, as they meet this challenge.
As they face this difficulty, this pain.
As if in your heart, you're there for them. You are there for them.
Your heart can feel expensive.
With its care.
Not turning away from difficulty, but meeting difficulty. Pain with gentle kindness.
Wishing them peace, as they meet this challenge.
It helps to really connect with the felt sense or the image of this being, to really bring this practice alive.
If you like, you can say some phrases silently.
May you have ease.
May you have peace.
With this difficulty, with this challenge, pain, sorrow, disappointment, whatever it might be.
You have peace and ease.
As you meet this challenge.
May you be free from sorrow.
May you have all the goodness, all the resources you need to meet this difficulty.
I wish you well.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Keeping this dear being in mind in your heart, their felt sense, really connecting with it, connecting with them.
And connecting with their challenge, and holding the challenge with good will, with kindness, with wishes for its alleviation, for their strength, wishing them well.
And making sure you feel stable, you're not falling into grief or overwhelm.
But in your heart inviting them to a place of stability, with love and care.
Thank you.
I wish you ease and peace.
I wish you well.
I wish you strength as you meet this challenge.
Thank you.
You be free from sorrow.
May you have ease.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And for the last minutes of our practice,
holding both ourselves and this dear being together in our heart space.
May both of us have ease and peace in the midst of our challenges.
May we meet our difficulties with kindness.
May we be free from sorrow.
I wish us well.
I hold us with good will, with kindness, with compassion as we meet our difficulties.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And appreciating ourselves for having showed up.
And cultivated planted seeds of kindness, compassion, ourselves, for another being.
And trusting that these seeds will germinate in their own time, without detachment to outcome in this moment.
And releasing this goodness, offering this goodness of our cultivation together to all beings everywhere.
May my practice, may the turning of my heart towards goodness, kindness, compassion serve, be of service,
not just to myself, in my own life, and those I know, whose lives I touch, but everyone, everywhere.
May I live a life of compassion and wisdom.
May I be of service to all beings everywhere.
May all beings be well.
May all beings be free.
Thank you for your practice, friends.
And as we transition to the Dhar Med, take a moment to transition the recordings, if you feel like putting your word
in the chat about what's arising for you, a word or short phrase bringing into the space, if you like.
