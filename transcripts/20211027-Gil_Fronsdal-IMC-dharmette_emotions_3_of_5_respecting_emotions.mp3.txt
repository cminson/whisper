 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. In discussing mindfulness of emotion, the theme for today is respect. We started with relaxation and recognition and now respect. As we recognize, as we relax, it's easier to recognize. As we recognize, it's easier to recognize how we are relating to our emotional life. Are we relating, do we have an attitude towards it which is making it more difficult than it needs to be? Do we identify with it strongly, defining ourselves by it? Do we have hostility towards it? Do we not like it and push it away? Do we have shame or embarrassment about it? Do we have ideas that should be different? Are we trying to get rid of things? Are we trying to have certain emotions, certain feelings, certain attitudes to the world? Are we forcing maybe even sugarcoating experience by trying too hard? Or are we holding onto things? Maybe we were happy yesterday and so we're holding onto that idea that we should be. As we start recognizing the component parts of emotions, we see the extra reactivity we might have to it. Seeing that reactivity is the beginning of respect. I really like this word respect because from the Latin it means to see again, to spectacle, to look again. To start taking a deeper look at what's here. If we can see our reactivity, maybe we can put it aside enough that we can bring a respectful attention to the emotion itself. As if it's allowed to be there. Because the disrespectful ways are often trying to change something or hold onto something and not allowing it to be itself. The second look, the vipassana look, really taking a deeper look, making space for it, allowing it to be there. I like the idea that we're giving permission for our emotions to be present. It's a little different than allowing. It's a little more active. It's like a choice. It's a decision. I'm going to offer. It's like a generosity. I'm going to offer permission for myself to be the way I am. As I said yesterday, I think sitting in meditation is a wonderful place to do this because you're kind of committed to sitting still and not acting on whatever the feelings might be. There might be some anger that seems very undesirable, very strong, but in meditation we give it permission to be there. Then, or if there's sadness or grief or if there's joy and happiness, we give permission for it to be there. As we give permission for it to be there and just allow it to be there without our reactivity or judgments, so where those put aside enough so we can really respect it, what's there. I find it useful to think of emotions as either a message or a messenger. As a message, emotions are not random. They're not incidental, accidental phenomena just to kind of come through. They have some kind of message in them. Maybe the message is asking for respect. Maybe the message is saying to you, here's an opportunity for you to discover how to be nonattached, how to not cling or resist, make more space. But it might be a deeper message. Then anger might be a message that we feel hurt or we feel threatened. This might be a message that we might feel really impacted. We really care. We love something. That love now feels sad. But the love is underneath it. So it's a message of love. Rather than think of grief and sadness as a problem, it's a manifestation, it's a movement, it's a process that that love needs to go through to be whole again or to find its way again. But sometimes emotions are messengers. Especially I think of this way when the emotions are afflictive, when the emotions are bringing suffering along to us. And then you don't want to kill the messenger. You want to really see what is the message here. So the ability to respect and get permission and make breathing room allow for emotions to be there. That's such a big part of mindfulness. Then we start seeing more deeply through the cracks of it. What else shows itself? So it's not digging, it's not analyzing, but feeling our way deeply into the emotion. What else is there? And so if it's with anger, perhaps, what's there with it is hurt. What's there with it is fear. And that is what needs our attention. That's more primary. And so the messenger is pointing to these deeper underlying kind of feelings that are there. If there is grief, sometimes the messenger is that there is love. And it's like, hey, have you really taken into account how much their love there's been about what you've lost? Sometimes the message of despair is a message of feeling fear or feeling inadequate in some way. Sometimes the message of the messenger is that it's time to take a deep, honest look at the self-identity issues, the way we define ourselves, the way that we insert ourselves, me, myself, and mine into our life. And some emotions have to do with either the self, self-identity, self-definition we have, has been threatened. And so boredom, for example, sometimes is a symptom of whatever is happening around has no bearing on my self-concept, how I like to define myself or assert myself in the world. No one's praising me. I'm not getting any real kind of praise. And no one's criticizing me, both of those which are very riveting for some people. And without either one of those, the situation has no bearing. I don't end up building up myself in it or it's not threatened with it. And so it's a boring situation. So boredom sometimes the whole has to do sometimes with the complex of self-identity. Sometimes hostility, sometimes fear, sometimes all the emotions are closely connected to how threatened or how supported our idea of who we should be is. And so by really respecting emotions, taking your time, making room for it and allowing it, then we can start seeing the underlying kind of processes that are going on that are deeper. So sometimes you can ask, what is the message here in this emotion? In that way also it's very respectful of emotions. It's kind of like they all have something to say. They're not accidental, incidental. They're all represent some deeper thing that's going on. It doesn't require analysis when you do Vipassana practice. But what it involves is this kind of more sensitive looking, this more sensitive being present, breathing with it, making room for it, allowing it to be there so that we can hear the subtler messages that are going on with it. We can see the subtler process that goes on. And part of this permission for emotions to be there, part of this respect for emotions is that the emotions themselves have the wisdom to process themselves, to find their way to peace. If we make room for it, if we really make space for it, if we don't interfere with them or grab a hold of them or repress them, or if we don't act, you know, acting on emotions, especially when you're in meditation, interferes with that deeper process towards healing, towards peace, through resolution, that is kind of inherent in the emotions themselves. So to respect emotions, and if you are challenged with an emotion, and it's really caught you in some powerful way, and you would like to try this respect thing, you might put your hands together in the Anjali and bow to your emotions. Just bow. And if you want to really do something powerful, you bow and say thank you. Thank you for what you're trying to do for me, or the message you're bringing, or how this is the best I can do at the moment to try to work with this difficult world. But kind of bow to the emotions as an alternative to being entangled, reactive, judgmental for there. And you might try it. It's possible that one of the greatest goods you can do for your emotional life is to offer a deep respect to it, and maybe even a kind of reverence for it that gets you out of the way of it. But in meditation, protects you from acting on it in ways that may or may not be healthy. So thank you. And we'll continue tomorrow on this topic. So for today, for the next 24 hours, you might, if this idea of bowing to your emotions is at all interesting for you, you might either do it physically or you might actually do it in your imagination. Try bowing to your emotions and see what happens. But give room for your emotions. That's the most important thing. And if you have enough ability to take a break, if you're in the middle of something, work or family life or something, and you have a strong emotional response, and you don't usually do this, see if you can go take a walk around the block with it. Take the emotions with you. Just like you could take the emotions for a walk and use that maybe as a time to make room for it, to respect it, listen to it more deeply, and see what happens if that's an alternative to how you usually are with emotions. Try this alternative. Try the respect thing and see what happens over the next time. So thank you.
