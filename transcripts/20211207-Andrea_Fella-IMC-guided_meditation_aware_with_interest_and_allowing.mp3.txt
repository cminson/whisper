The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Our practice, our meditation, is supported by some conditions that really allow us to
establish mindfulness in a skillful way.
Mindfulness, that simple kind of awareness of what's happening in the present moment while it's happening.
Established with relaxation and ease and interest, curiosity about what is this experience as experience, as human experience.
And so, beginning, often helpful to begin with a little bit of emphasis on relaxation.
So we can cultivate our awareness of the present moment through this process of relaxing the body, relaxing the mind.
And so, attending, kind of connecting with the sensations of your head and face and seeing what happens as there's a kind of an inclination to soften those muscles of the head, the face.
Being aware, not just doing the relaxation but relaxing and noticing what is it like to relax.
Allowing a relaxation of neck and shoulders, arms and hands.
Aware of the experience of arms and hands, aware of the experience of body as there's this invitation to relax.
I notice some muscles letting go or some softening and aware of that.
Maybe the chest, the upper back can soften and relax all those muscles around the rib cage.
The muscles across the stomach and the abdomen, perhaps they can relax.
Let those muscles hang forward a bit.
That's an area where we often kind of habitually hold tension.
So maybe there can be a softening there.
Allowing a softening of the middle and lower back, the hips, the legs and the feet.
And then sometimes it's also possible to soften or relax a little more deeply inside the body.
Turning the attention to just the sensations inside the throat, maybe the throat can relax.
Maybe the area around the heart can relax.
Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax, that deep visceral area inside the body.
And perhaps to the mind can relax, allowing perhaps a letting go of mental tension, of worries, of concerns, of thoughts about the past or the future or the present.
Just relaxing that perhaps there can be an inclination to relax that mental tension.
Inviting yourself to be with the experience of this body here in this moment.
To be with how you are in this moment more generally.
And climbing towards the perspective of interest in how you are.
Taking in just what's already here, opening to what is here, what has already come to be.
What has come to be is really where we open and allow.
We can't change it, it's already here.
There can be this opening and allowing it to be.
And so this mindful attention, aware of what's here in the present moment, curious about what's here in the present moment, not in terms of what it can do for me or what it reflects about me,
but just what is it, what is the experience of the present moment.
How are you?
Like a dear friend asking that question without any agenda, how are you?
So with this interest, receiving the experience and perhaps initially starting with receiving how you are in the body.
What is, what are the sensations of the body?
Opening and no agenda again, kind of stepping back and letting the sensations show themselves.
This may be, you may be able to explore really just stepping back and having a broad kind of attention to the body as a whole and letting various aspects of the body kind of speak to you.
There may be a sensation in the knees or the hips or maybe the breath, maybe the shoulders.
Sensations may come one after another from different areas of the body.
Or perhaps there's a kind of a broader sense of the body as a whole and just taking in kind of the landscape, the view.
A broader sense of the body as a whole.
Receiving how is the body?
At the sensation level exploring not so much the idea or the parts of the body like elbow or knee but sensations of heat or coolness or vibration, hardness or softness.
Connecting with the actual sensations.
What's actually experienced?
What does the body experience?
Or some of you it may feel simpler and more easeful to allow the attention to just settle with perhaps the breathing and just take in the sensations of breathing.
Or others of you it may feel simpler not to choose an area of experience but just settle back and receive.
So what's supportive for you?
What allows the most ease with being present?
This cultivation of ease.
As much ease as possible to just receive what's here.
Supporting that possibility of ease with meeting what's here.
This means that what's here needs to be pleasant but maybe the mind can be relaxed and okay with what's here.
That sense of allowing what's here and allowing quality can carry some ease.
So we cultivate this attention,
mindful connection with experience, with interest, curiosity.
How are you with some inclination or invitation to allow what's here to be here?
And that's enough.
We don't have to find anything or look for anything in particular receiving the experience of our body
at times perhaps aware of what's happening in our mind, the moods, the feelings, the thoughts.
With this interest and allowing.
