The following talk was given at the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies in
Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at sati.org.
The psychological psychiatric realm is kind of, it's a messy realm of understanding, suffering
in these ways. Psychiatric conditions themselves are, it's kind of messy.
So, with other diseases, the focus is on pathophysiology and, you know, we don't talk about COVID
as the scratchy throat disease, right? We talk about it as, it's a beta coronavirus and
it attaches to these receptors and these inflammatory effects and this, whatever,
dysregulated immune response. And in the psychiatric realm, we are more talking about
signs and symptoms, you know, scratchy throat disease. And it's too much to get into,
but it like, even just the category of something like depression hides an incredible amount
of heterogeneity, you know, what that is, like that is a marker for understanding is not
really sufficient, even though there's a lot of utility in having that, the diagnostic
category. This is a realm characterized of psychiatric distress, characterized by
equifinality, meaning many, many paths leading to the same outcome. Yeah, we can get to the
same place through many different routes. And multifinality, the same risk factor can
lead to very different outcomes, you know. We see that at the genetic level, I think
it's the atropic effects where it's like, yeah, the same genetic risk factors can
manifest in very different ways. And we see a high degree of, of, of polygenicity.
So it's like many, many genetic variations of very small effects, you know,
cumulatively being meaningful in, in psychiatric conditions. And the causal map, as you can
hear, is quite complex. And so let me just, just as a kind of illustration. Yeah, here
is the, the kind of the causal map, the different factors that are in a, in a twin
study. So it was an attempt to kind of disentangle genetic and environmental risk
for depression. Yeah, and I show this not so you can absorb it, but so you can be
intimidated by it. Yeah. And you see all of the different pathways, the childhood, the,
the kind of early adolescence, the late adolescence, the adulthood, the last year,
and then all in, in understanding the depressive, the occurrence of a depressive
episode in the past year. And you see that they're, the lines go from not just for
one thing to another. It's like they go all over the place. They're amplifying or
minimizing the effects of other risk factors, right? And so monocausal theories like
this one risk factor, this trauma cause this, like it's, it's always way more
complicated, right? And so we could call that diagram, patichasamupada, you know,
we could call it like this is dependent origination. This is like the complexity
that we see in these realms is a testament to the complexity of causality itself.
So this has implications for how we think about treatment and healing and these
things. And one of the effects is that it has, it has moved, moved us away from a
kind of purely DSM based treatment approach. So the kind of psychiatric
mythology of whatever 200 odd, you know, clinical conditions. A couple researchers
said the era of protocols for syndromes is over, yeah? The era of like if you have
depression, you get this, this protocol, this treatment. If you have generalized
anxiety disorder, you get this thing. That's still true to some extent. And that's
not a bad thing. But the question is a little bit more, is moving towards the
focus on core psychopathological processes. Yeah, understanding the mechanisms
that promote or maintain psychiatric distress. It's a movement, I would say,
away from just, you know, strictly evidence based treatments to what one of
my teachers called like empirically supported principles of change. Empirically
supported principles of change. So it's less about these kind of trademarked
approaches and, you know, of, well, like I gave the example, DBT earlier or whatever.
It's like, no, no, what is actually shared across, you know, psychosocial
treatments, what are empirically supported principles of change? In, you know,
some drugs are known for being highly selective. So the idea of like SSRI,
like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, like the idea is the drug is
supposed to be selective. It's supposed to hit some receptors and not others.
Yeah. And no drug is perfectly receptive, but some are more receptive. I think
Selexa, for example, is like more highly selective drug. And then there are
drugs that are not that are sometimes called like dirty drugs. Yeah, dirty
drugs. They hit a range of different receptor systems. And I would say the
Dharma is a dirty drug. Yeah, just to use that as a kind of metaphor, the Dharma
is a dirty drug. It, who knows what it, you know, at the level of the brain,
of course, that's being investigated, but I'm using it in a figurative sense,
meaning the Dharma has elements of many different therapeutic approaches, the
range of mechanisms of action, again, to borrow language from more, you know,
pharmacology language, like the mechanism of action is multiple in the Dharma,
right? And what I would say is the Dharma is, it has overlap with at least
these, and we could say more. So it has overlap with attentional training. It
has overlap with cognitive therapy. It has overlap, deep overlap with
exposure therapy. It evokes existential therapy in some really important
ways. So let me unpack this. So disrupted attention, attention is a kind of
unifying construct in psychology. And an attention, attention is disrupted
across a wide range of psychiatric conditions. So, and in different ways.
So in addiction, for example, there is a tensional bias to drug cues in obsessive
compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress, like there is often intrusive
thinking, unbidden thoughts that sort of just are disruptive. They are intrusive
in generalized anxiety disorder. There is, we are entangled in worry and the
failure to manage the worrying process. The attention moves into the realm of,
you know, threat, amorphous sense of threat. In depression, there are a number
of attentional effects. So there is concentration problems, there are memory
effects, there is, you know, overgeneral autobiographical recall, like a number,
there is attentional bias to negative information. There is a number of
attentional kinds of components to depressive phenomenology. Attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, like right there in the diagnostic label is attention.
And even in subclinical distress, okay, we don't meet criteria for a clinical
condition, but just think about moments of real distress for you. The attention,
there is a kind of pinball effect of the attention. It's moving from past to
future to, you know, kind of unpleasantness in the affective systems in the
body and then that sort of springs us into narratives and autobiographical
storytelling and the attention is not stabilized in distress, you know. And so
how to think about this? Is this maybe just epiphenomenal, meaning that the
attention disruption is not so important, that's possible, and maybe that's just
the steam coming off the engine of psychiatric illness. But it may be worth
exploring this attentional training, you know, as we do learn to stabilize
attention, to bring some measure of kind of even small bits of samadhi, of
concentration, of tranquilizing the kind of inner field of experience. Maybe this
is useful, maybe this is useful for the forms of distress. Dharma is a cognitive
therapy, it's a cognitive therapy, you know, a lot of what the Buddha does is tell
us how to think. This is not a popular trope, you know, exactly. We sort of try
to hide the rhetorical gestures of the Dharma behind the claims that it's
self-evident, you know, just see for yourself. But it's not, we're being told
what to think a lot, a lot. Right view is the foundation, right? This is the
foundation with wrong view, what follows, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong
action, wrong mind, wrong everything. Right view, dukkha is like this. We're
being invited into ways of understanding that reduce suffering. And it's
really, it's quite foundational and a lot of what Dharma teaching is, is a kind
of invitation to new ways of seeing, new ways of construing experience. In the
clinical literature, you would call it cognitive reappraisal. So in the contrast
between mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, that's sort of like very highly
derivative from MDSR, along with, you know, that sort of graphs in, you know,
cognitive therapy. And it was originally designed as a treatment to
prevent the relapse into depression. Depression is a chronic relapsing
condition. And, okay, in remitted cases, like how do you sustain that well-being,
right? And so mindfulness-based cognitive therapy was an attempt to become
mindful of early depressogenic thinking. Yeah? So with that kind of kindling
before we're actually in a depressive episode, we are, yeah, where there's
kind of some lead up to that, right? And NBCT was an attempt to, you know, was an
attempt to minimize the threat of that early depressogenic thinking by knowing
thought as thought. That's familiar to all of you, right? It's like not disputing
the contents of that thought, right? Of like, oh, this day is going terribly,
like, you know, like you're really, you're just leaving out so much, Matthew,
like really f-ing this up and like, okay, that's a thought arising in my mind.
Yeah? Not, and it's not challenging the content. It's like, no, no, no, that one
person said it wasn't that bad. And, you know, like, well, you've done this
before. And, you know, like, it's not challenging the content. It's just like,
ah, I am hearing a sound in my own head that's telling me this is going badly.
That's right. It's thought as thought. Yeah? Thought as thought.
That's the classic contrast between NBCT and cognitive therapy, right?
But there's a lot of overlap, right, with between mindfulness-based approaches
and cognitive therapy. We are being invited into a system of beliefs.
Duca can be redeemed. Yeah? Goodness has a kind of force to it.
The potency of awareness. We could go on. There are like many things that were
invited into ways in which we're reframing experience. We're reframing
pleasant and unpleasant. We're thinking about our life in dramatically different
ways. And over the course of a Dharma practice, we come to construe the
entirety of our life in light of the Dharma. Yeah? Like, how we understand our
own suffering and our own longings and our own goodness is like in light of
these teachings. And I think that the benefits early in practice, the
benefits that we see in these short treatment intervention studies, those
benefits are largely cognitive benefits, I feel. I was alluding to this
earlier that the idea that we're really deepening into and getting like
profound attentional Samadhi-ish benefits of practice at week eight is not
tenable. Some people are gifted that way. I certainly was not. Many people are
not. Many people that has to mature over much longer spans of time. And yet
you see kind of like robust demonstration of benefits of these short
interventions. What accounts for that? I think it is a lot of it is like the
de-stigmatization of dukkha, you know, the way in which we start to feel
unashamed of our pain, the normalization of the intensity of the human
condition. These are of profound benefit and many others, you know, many
others ways we're being invited into reappraise our distress, reappraise our
psychiatric symptoms. And so the secular distinction that it's a technique,
you know, mindfulness is a technique, not a religion or something, is that
not really viable. We really cannot separate the view from the technique.
In other words, there's no viewless technique, right? There's always
something being implied. Even if you just say pay attention to your breath,
there's a whole elaborate kind of edifice of ideas underlying that, that
are articulated in even rigorously secular interventions, yeah?
Mindfulness as a cognitive therapy. Mindfulness as exposure therapy. So
exposure therapy is a kind of key mechanism in a range of different
therapeutic approaches. It's not just, you know, the exposure therapy and the
narrowest sense of it, the way, you know, exposure therapy for post-traumatic
stress disorder has been evaluated empirically. It's like most, every
therapeutic approach relies on mechanisms of exposure. Yeah, so what is this?
Some good proportion of our distress is maintained by experiential avoidance.
Experiential avoidance. The unwillingness to be, to encounter, to be
present for private events and efforts to take steps to alter the form or
frequency of those events and the contexts that occasion them. So this is
very prominent in anxiety where it's like our avoidance of the feared object
eventually starts to like narrow our life and we, it starts to feel claustrophobic.
Yeah. And anxiety like thrives on some measure of avoidance. Yeah.
And this is Michelle Crask, sort of major, you know, exposure therapy person,
researcher. She says, we argue for moving away from immediate fear reduction
and towards fear toleration as the primary goal of exposure therapy.
Fear toleration, you know, does that sound familiar as like patients, you know,
anxiety of patients, of equanimity, of allowing, of approaching. Yeah.
Now, in the therapeutic realm, there is usually an attempt at systematic
desensitization, meaning you sort of like, okay, you know, in very simple kind of
case, like somebody gets into a car accident and has, you know, is afraid to
drive, you know, has post traumatic stress disorder. Okay, well, the first
step might be drawing a car, you know, and then, then it might be sitting in a
car or something like this and not moving, then it might be going for a
ride in a parking lot, right? And each time, you know, like becoming
desensitized, you know, draining some of the affective charge from that,
mastering that level of learning, you know, and then graduation is being able
to drive on the highway at rush hour or something like that, that's, that's
success, right? And so we say it's systematic, systematic exposure therapy.
In the Dharma world, in mindfulness practice, it's unsystematic exposure
therapy. Yeah. Everything, anything that can disrupt your peace will.
Yeah. That's the bad news and the good news, actually. Like we don't, yeah, I
joke, like we don't say that on the flyers. Insight retreat, anything that can
disrupt your peace will. Please join us, you know, but that's real. That is
what it is. You sit enough. And in a way, it's our good fortune that our pain
rearises, that our clinging rearises, that our greed and our hate and our
delusion rearises. Anything that can disrupt our peace will. We sit enough,
we practice enough, it will. And sometimes we get too big a dose of pain in
our practice. Not often, but sometimes we do. And the idea in exposure therapy
is to get the right doses of pain, the right level of subjective distress.
Too little, we don't learn too much. We're flooded. We don't learn. So we play
at the edge of our own threshold and own tolerance. And in our Dharma
practice too, we are really becoming habituated. We are desensitizing to
the impelling forces of clinging. This is the purification side of practice.
We call it the path of purification. What is that? In clinical language,
that is exposure therapy for everything. And this is, to my mind, one of the
most powerful dimensions, mechanisms of action of the Dharma. How it actually
functions to reduce distress. And we don't see this necessarily. A lot of the
fruit of Dharma practice, we don't see. We don't see ourself the moment
something lets go. We don't see the habituation in a very explicit way.
We just wake up some day and recognize, like, oh, I don't suffer in that way
anymore. And I don't know where it went or when it went. But I feel different.
And I feel freer. And that's of profound value. So Dharma practice is this
approach orientation and approaching that which might be avoided. And the fact
that we're training our attention, that we're training in love, makes the
approach especially deep. So it's like, how do I get close to my avoidance?
How do I get close to it? How do I approach the loops of pain in me?
Well, if I'm not a practitioner, I can kind of be guided by some therapeutic,
you know, a therapist or something. The Dharma helps us get really close.
We're like pouring the awareness into the circuits of avoidance, into the
patterns of, you know, entanglement. And we're just, like, really getting,
like, close, yeah? This is part of how those loops of pain lose, become
desensitized. We get really close. We move against the tide of avoidance
into approach. And love, care, willingness, surrender, this is the deepest
form of approach. So this is one side of practice. This is the exposure
therapy side. We also have the tranquilizing side, which is meant to
make the exposure side bearable. Yeah? And it begins in clinical situations.
People get anxiety-reducing strategies before they begin some of the
exposure stuff. Okay, I can do diaphragmatic breathing. I can do
progressive muscle relaxation. I can do different things that, like, I can
meditate. This is soothing. This is soothing, yeah? Dharma practice is a kind
of dialectic between the tranquility and the exposure dimensions of our
practice. And there's sometimes a risk. I don't see that often, but there is a
risk that one just gets wedded to the tranquilizing side of practice and uses
that, that is enlisted as a mechanism of avoidance itself. Yeah? Right? Where
it's like, I'm going to, and some people have natural predilections towards
quiet and samadhi and this kind of thing. And that's usually great and
leveraged for growth. But sometimes, sometimes if it's not, the practice is
not understood, that's just a place to hang out in avoidance, basically. And
the encounter with our own dukkha is not made. And people can practice
actually for a long time. And some of their core, there's benefit from just
hanging out in tranquility. But some of the core behavioral patterns,
speech patterns are untransformed, because the practice has been enlisted
as a tool in avoidance. So this is a risk just to flag. If we're sincere,
we wise up sooner or later. The Dharma has elements of an existential
therapy. So existential therapy, I don't know much about it, but associate a
lot with yalom. And it hypothesizes that the failure to meet existential
questions, challenges of any human life, the failure to meet those challenges
adequately leads to symptoms. And so death, responsibility, our solitude,
we're connected in a million ways. And we are alone, you know, alone, born,
die, live alone in a very important way. And the failure to actually meet
those existential questions, challenges is, you know, according to this,
like a source of symptomatology, of psychiatric symptoms. The Dharma,
of course, like began right in the mythology of it all, like the aging
sickness like death, like this was, if that is true, if that is true,
if it is true that everything will be lost, what is to be done? That is the
animating question of Dharma. And indeed, we do find the practice is
relevant for this. The practice is relevant for this in a million different
ways, I feel. But concretely, there is evidence that meditation, Buddhism,
you know, reduces our defensive responses to thoughts of death, for
example, to what you call mortality salience. So if you sort of like make
mortality salient in the mind of a research subject participant, things
happen, things happen, a number of which are not good, they become more
territorial, more in group favoritism, more rigid and ideology. It has
effects, it seems. And you can see, I think it cuts both ways. Sometimes
mortality salience actually can make us love. It's like groundlessness can
make us hate or it can make us love. And we're training such that it makes
us, you know, it leads us into love, but it often does not. And you see the
way fear in our politics is mobilized to manipulate people's behavior is
very profound. It's a profound lever that can be used. And because we're so
unconscious and we're so easily manipulated, it's just used again and
again. So we actually have to know our inner life in order to make those
levers less accessible to the manipulation of profoundly diluted
powers, you know. So we wake up to some of this. We come into, you know, come
into relationship with our own mortality. And, yes, from one study from
some of this is called terror management theory, you know, kind of
research literature, terror, not in terms of terrorism, but fear, deep fear.
And so a couple researchers, according to these study, three studies
conducted in two countries with participants with varying levels of
meditation experience, defensive responses to reminders of death that
were consistently found in the absence of meditation were not found after
meditation. Present findings are consistent with previous research
showing that higher levels of dispositional mindfulness kind of trait
mindfulness, higher levels of trait mindfulness are associated with
lower levels of defensiveness in response to mortality salience. The
present finding suggests that responding defensively to thoughts of
death by initially suppressing such thoughts and then defending one's
worldview when they rebound is not an inevitable response to this existential
problem. Not an inevitable response to this existential problem. The notion
being that we cling to our ideology and our view as a form of symbolic
immortality. Yeah. Yeah, I may die, but I'm an American. I'm a Buddhist. I'm
a Philodin. Yeah. And so I have this lineage. Right. I had this lineage. I
remember Frank Zappa saying something when he was dying, something like
a legacy is just like another ego maniacal trip. Yeah. And so, yeah,
maybe we kind of, we cling to whatever this kind of sense of what
lasts beyond us. And that's not such a bad thing. We want to just be
conscious of how we construe this and not use that as a defense against
the truth of our existential condition. It is possible to be softened
rather than hardened by groundlessness. It is possible for our hearts to be
softened rather than hardened by a niche, by uncertainty. So, mindfulness,
Dharma, dirty drug, many different mechanisms operates in many ways. And
as teachers, we often highlight some mechanisms rather than others. And in
a way, the most kind of probably the most, you know, some of the most popular
teachers, popular approaches, zone in on one mechanism, you know, it kind of
boils it down to something simpler. And there's rhetorical force in that.
You know, this is the, you just march to the beat of this drum. That is
your practice. There's power in that and naivety also to my mind. This is,
this works in so many different ways. And what that means is we're going to
have to talk about it in a range of different ways, which sometimes sound
paradoxical or contradictory. But it's like, no, this is a dirty drug that
acts in a lot of, through a lot of different mechanisms. And so you wind
up, you know, having to articulate the path in more nuanced ways. Sometimes
it's like, yeah, skillful means, skillful means. So let me see. Okay, let me do
another piece. Yeah, are you doing okay? Make a sad face if you're frustrated.
Okay, okay. So, so another, just another piece that will pivot somehow. So my
sense is that the, the interest in mindfulness, the interest in mindfulness
in the therapeutic world is less about the strength of the clinical trials
evidence or the neuroscience stuff and more about how mindfulness describes
a state that is nearly diametrically opposed to psychiatric distress. Yeah.
A moment of mindfulness is like so very, very different from a moment of
distress. So how is this so? Well, suffering comes in so many different
forms and so many different causes. But if we look at the phenomenology of
distress, what, what are some of the characteristics of distress? If I were
to characterize it, I would say a few things. This echoes some of what we've
talked about. So thoughts, thoughts become absorbing and imposing. They feel
really real. As real as a piece of furniture, you know.
Rumination is a trans diagnostic risk factor, you know, so the absorption
in thought, this kind of mode of obsessional kind of very sort of abstract,
you know, it sort of masquerades as existential questions. How do I get
here? How, where am I going? But it's, it's really like, this is a risk factor.
Rumination is not good for our mental health. And in rumination, thoughts have
like a density and a real, you know, like a weightiness that is really prominent.
In distress, the kind of space of experienced narrows, it's like a sense of,
I often talk about it as a kind of claustrophobia, you know, and there is,
you know, experimental evidence like the attentional field narrows in distress.
We, we like start to like literally see like the peripheral vision narrows,
you know, the sense of space, right? We know those moments of like the big sky
meditation or something like that are the expansive flavors of awareness.
That is like utterly missing in moments of distress, right? Have we ever been in
a kind of like the, the, the experience of like the, the vast expansiveness of
awareness and been deeply distressed, you know, not really, not really.
There's some exceptions to that maybe, but not much. Yeah, there's space of
experienced narrows. In distress, the attention becomes fragmented as I was
including to it's pinging all over. In distress, there are alterations in
physiological arousal, you know, sometimes hypo, you know, kind of flat, flattened
out, numbed out, dissociative kind of, but often hyper arousal.
There's experiential avoidance. There are compromises in distress tolerance.
A moment of distress is like we're, we're often in deep contention.
We're fighting with ourself and the pain is, is, is personalized.
It's a commentary on our being. It's a commentary. It is a kind of moral
failing. Duka is my own moral failing. My depression is my own moral failing.
It speaks to the defectiveness of some level of my own being.
In distress, there is a kind of un, un, unhelpful rigidity in our predictive
models, the kind of, we are not as responsive, not optimally responsive to
new information. We fail to learn and to revise our models of self, of world,
of future. Yeah, there's a kind of rigidity in, in, in this and, you know,
in our beliefs, in our schemas, this kind of thing. And a special kind of
rigidity in our model of self. Yeah. The model of ourself is like impervious
to dis confirming information. This is who I am. These are my problems.
You know, and it's like, you know, our, it's very, our reasoning becomes
motivated reasoning. We're, we're erring on the side of confirming our existing
models, rather than opening to not knowing, opening to new data, opening to
new, new, new ways of, of understanding. These are, we could name more.
These are just kind of from my own thinking, like this, these are, these are
characteristics. These are some of the, the key characteristics of moments of
distress. Okay. What is mindfulness? What is mindfulness, right? It moves us
almost directly against each of the things I just enumerated. Yeah.
There is a reduction in experiential fusion. Yeah, cognitive fusion, which is
just the way that, that some researchers talk about establishing mindfulness,
establishing some metacognitive awareness. We're not fused with the content of
thought. We say identified, you know, oh, we get identified with thought, you
know, and identified with thought means that we are not aware of thought as
thought. We are living in the bubble of that thought. And whether that, that
train of thought is taking us to heaven or hell, we are going. Yeah. We are
going. We are nothing but habit energy. Yeah. And that's why it's like the
sense of waking up from the daydream, back to the breathing or something.
It's like, we didn't know we were meditating. We didn't know we were
human. We didn't know where we were. We were living in the content of that
discursive thought. And mindfulness is, breaks this identification, breaks
this identification. It is a process of D, the language they use, D
reification. Yeah, maybe we would say appreciating the, the Anichaduka,
not the quality of thought itself. So thoughts that had been really real,
really imposing, I am a bad, whatever, like all of a sudden that becomes just
another empty phenomena, barely even there. Right? There's the famous, well,
famous in very small circles, but famous story of Joseph Goldstein, you know,
with a yogi, I think on a three month retreat, who, who came in just in like
a kind of spasm of self hatred. And, and as I recall the story, she was just
like, you know, you know, this is wrong with me and that's wrong with me.
And, you know, even the chipmunks hate me, you know, and, and Joseph's
response was, even the chipmunks hate me and the sky is blue. Okay, what does
that mean? Even the chipmunks hate me and the sky is blue. The sky is blue.
Both thoughts made of precisely the same stuff. Yeah. The chipmunks, even the
chipmunks hate me. The sky is blue. And so it's like juxtaposing the most
innocent, obvious, uncharged statement, the sky is blue, with the most charged
spasm of self hatred. Their currency is identical. Empty. De-reification.
Mindfulness is conjoined with equanimity, you know, in many of the
scientific descriptions of mindfulness, equanimity is one of the facets.
It's present moment awareness and equanimity. Mindfulness is both.
And we know that if we're, if we, the energy follows the attention.
If we attend to something, if we start really noticing without equanimity,
the attention will amplify that for better or worse. Right. So we all know those
moments in meditation or in retreat. We're noticing everything and we're
hating everything. Yeah. There's a lot of present moment awareness.
We're noticing phenomena at a good clip, but there's zero equanimity.
And that is a very, very duke a filled state. Equanimity is kind of component
of the blessing of mindfulness and equanimity is many things, but it's
the practice of distress tolerance in distress and moments of pain.
There are compromises in this tolerance in mindfulness. Equanimity is,
is the practice of distress tolerance. We are approaching that which is
avoided. We are exercising all of these exposure based learning mechanisms.
And we are learning as Shenzhen Yang said, like not to fight with ourselves
at any level. What would that be to not fight with ourselves at any level?
To turn no experience into an enemy.
The hallmark of mindfulness is the attentional stability alluded to this.
I won't say much about it, but like there are regulatory benefits of a malleable
attention of an attention that can stay here and not be so fractured.
A moment of mindfulness is almost by definition a non moralistic moment.
Right? It's like we're draining the moralism from our emotional life.
We're draining the moralism from it. Yeah, this means that about me.
This sadness, this loneliness, this isolation, this whatever, you know.
Okay, we make it mean so much and mindfulness like cuts through all of it.
It, you know, doesn't mean we go from everything means everything to
an appreciation of nature, you know.
It's just like, no, causes and conditions, a million causes and conditions.
I am not angry or sad or lonely or this or that because of my fault.
I am sad because of everything ever, you know.
That's patichya samupara. And there is zero room for moralism in it.
So much of what we do in Dharma is de-stigmatizing pain.
And a lot of blessing comes from that.
This is a hypo, hypo in the, you know, hypo-egoic state.
A moment of mindfulness is the, not a reified sense of self.
We are training not to take refuge in ideas of who we are.
We're training not to look for our redemption in landing in some identity.
We can acknowledge all of the forces of conditioning this, that, all of that.
And we sort of give up hope of arriving in a sense of adulthood, you know.
Like arriving in the sense of like, oh yeah, now I'm grown up, now this is who I am.
Taking refuge in, yeah, notions of who, what I am.
The practice is a way of deconstructing the sense of self.
And the practice is a way of accessing different states of awareness where self is much less prominent,
or very thinned out, or very expensive, or very impersonal, or lots of different ways this works.
But what becomes, you know, the kind of fruit, the culmination of all of that stuff is it is no longer tenable to say,
I am a bad person, I am a failure, it's like that language doesn't even make sense in the same way.
And the layer of the way, the kind of underbelly of self is shame.
The underbelly of Sakya-Diti is shame. And to take, to claim the territory of I am-ness, you know,
is to make a very fertile ground for shame.
So we start to, the sense of self becomes more porous, more fluid, flexible, attenuated, open, empty.
And in some ways you could say, the ego is becoming healthier, you know.
And then we just like keep going, we keep going, we keep, you know, saying yes to the arising of self experience.
We keep going, gets more and more spacious, more and less and less charged with clinging, less and less defensive.
So much of this happens not by doing therapy on ourselves, but just practicing.
And we encounter the pain of self-identification.
We encounter the pain of it. There is pleasure in it sometimes, but it's the pleasure of cotton candy, you know.
It's the pleasure of cotton candy. Like, don't eat much of that, you know.
And you taste it and then it's gone. Like, where did that go?
And then maybe we're just craving more.
We just become less enchanted, you know, by that kind of endless shell game of the egoic charade.
And we're never going to become what we think we are.
And we're never going to land in a self that feels like home.
Yeah, we come to know this. We come to know this. And that changes our goals and what we put in time doing.
And it changes who we are in relation to others, who we are in relation to ourselves.
A moment of mindfulness is diametrically opposed to the kind of many of the hallmarks of distress.
And so how could clinicians and mental health professionals not be at least curious?
What has the Buddha articulated here? Moment of mindfulness.
This is mindfulness in its multifaceted presentation, you know.
We can define it as present time awareness and equanimity or something, but this is really what it is.
You know, I think in some kind of visions of Abhidhamma is like, no, mindfulness is almost tantamount to like freedom, you know.
Like it's free of defilements, yeah.
And this to my mind is kind of key of why there's so much interest in the mental health world in this construct.
So we have been sitting for a while, so let's just take a short, let's say come back at 10 past, just stretch or use a bathroom, come back in eight minutes and finish out together.
Okay, thank you for your attention. I'll see you in a few.
Okay.
So I think I've got a bunch of great questions and reflections in the chat.
And I think rather than moving forward with other things, I want to open it up for questions and dialogue and question about getting a transcript of this.
I think that's available. That should be available, yeah.
So, let's, yeah, yeah, if you wish to put your voice in the room for question is, please do. Okay. Yeah, Lori.
Hi, Matthew.
Thank you for that mind expanding morning as usual.
What's coming to mind is the difference between, well, two things between being with the Dharma for therapeutic value or relaxation or learning value and being with other types of therapy.
I've never had cognitive behavioral therapy, but I have had Jungian therapy and certainly have been to doctors and in that case, there's an interaction between myself and the medicine or the doctor or there's a constant of another person.
Whereas Dharma Dharma practice is pretty self regulating, I think, most of the time, I mean, we do have the, the Sangha, if we're lucky and a teacher, if we're lucky and we have the Buddha, but, but we're sitting there for long periods of time just talking to ourselves.
And so that, that interaction, for me at least, has the potential and the danger of becoming delusional and lazy. And, and I can just sit there and like you said, just, you know, feel very relaxed, but I'm not going to learn anything and I'm not going to confront myself about anything.
So that is one part of it. And the other part is that in the East, I think having Buddhism and meditation, maybe just Buddhism as a cultural ubiquitous cultural phenomenon.
Everybody talks about it in, or at least everyone knows about the, has the common cultural understanding of the Dharma has the common cultural understanding of the inner world, the inner life and interacting with the outer life.
We don't have that so much here. We're pretty, I think we're pretty outer. We're don't, you know, and so we don't have that cultural, everyday understanding that other people in our environment have the same practice that we do, are going through the same, you know, studies that we're doing.
So I wonder if you have any comment on that and how to, in the West, not become deluded and too lazy.
Yeah, well, I, I feel like every, every practice, every teaching can be used or misused. Yeah. And so it can be, you know, a lot of what we're talking about, you know,
sort of like the misuse of meditation of mindfulness as a way of actually recapitulating greed, hate and delusion. That is possible. It is possible to do that. It is possible to kind of rationalize our own defilements and act them out, you know, in the name of the Dharma or something.
What stops us from doing that is two things, our own sincerity and other people, the mirror of other people, you know, and, and so we, this path is, is, you know, investigation, investigation.
It is, we have to get like really curious in how our practice is functioning, potentially to reinforce our own greed and delusion, you know, that's like, because it's not like we just, we just practice meditation, and we sort of check our habits at the door.
No, the way we practice is the way we do everything else. And sometimes it's going to practice is going to be sort of recruited as a way of insulating ourselves, you know, and I think, you know, teachers are, you know, and Sangha is good at helping support us, detect that.
And, but we're, but it really is kind of our own sincerity that is vital, you know, and meaning that we are really willing to look at the, are the zones of our own hypocrisy, you know, like the zones of our own, you know, the gap between the our public and our private self.
You know, we're willing to look at like inconsistencies in our own behavior. Yeah, I get to, I get to teach I hear myself, and I have to be like accountable to those words, you know, right, so I'm like very aware of what I'm saying.
And then any zones where it's like, that's kind of like, do what Matthew says, not how he is in his private life or something, it's like, oh, if you I feel any of that, that gap, that is unsettling to me, that is unsettling to me.
And it's like, okay, I want to rise up like bring some of my own courage and you know, like, let me, let me investigate this. And a friend of mine says, if we want to know, we will, and if we don't, we won't, you know.
And so it's like, are we committed to just and some of this is tied into the self too, because if I feel like my discoveries are the deepest commentary on who I am.
Then, as Mark Twain says, not all self knowledge is good news, you know, it's like if we feel that way.
It sort circuits the investigation, right. And so no, it's like, I just want to see, and it's going to be ugly in there. It's going to cause at least some shutters of shame and whatever something and it's like, and I want to see it.
It is of the nature of not self, you know. And so we get bolder with this and, and some forms of pain and all of that it's like, I don't know, it runs deep and we can never be totally sure, you know, it's like it is I have had the thought like maybe I have just like incarnated into this whole world of Buddhism and Dharma and now I teach it
I live that life and maybe this is just like the path of least resistance for my own weird habits and style and my shyness and, you know, all these different things like maybe, you know, so okay, I just welcome that thought.
And let me see. Let me see. Yeah. And we delusion is endless. It's endless. We can never stop asking if we're deluded because delusion, until it feels like delusion, it feels like the truth.
And so we've habituated to our own, our own confusion and that is part of why we need others because we will never have a 360 view of ourselves. But there are some people that have us down, you know, like that they can see something.
And it's like, Matthew, you're, this is neurotic, you know, or this is whatever, you know, and it's like, yeah, yeah.
I want to be able to see that myself, though. I want to be able to see that on the cushion, say, what you're thinking now is just nuts. You got, you know, not that it's nuts, but it's, it's, you know, I got it.
I get it. I get it. I think, I think it, in my experience, it comes more in the, the discontinuities between what, you know, our values and our behavior, you know, that's where we really want to get interested.
And, and I don't think we can see it all. We do count on others.
It was difficult people. Thank you.
Yeah, yeah, thanks. Chris, please.
See, can you hear me?
Yeah, we got you.
Okay, great. Matthew, thanks so much.
I'm going to step up, use what Ram said, I see your name and you're presenting something and it's like, I'm in Greece, it's 300 BC, I'm at the stowa and Matthew's talking today, let's go ahead over there because he's going to get me worked up and thinking about all sorts of stuff.
You've already given me two things to think about right at the beginning, a down payment on my continued existence and something about Buddha speaking to my ear.
I've worked as a nurse for over 30 years now and a big part of that portion of that was working with homeless, the street dwellers you see in the streets of downtown San Francisco speaking to themselves and if there's one thing I've been able to sort of bring as far as a
darn practice just to a quick remedy is getting the old hand.
When they come to triage and they're babbling to themselves or my sister's babbling to herself or I'm babbling to myself to take that old hand and put on the similar chest and just sort of breathe and I'm getting sort of reminded by that.
I spent the whole week when Thich Nhat Hanh died watching the ceremonies surrounding him and being sort of reintroduced to his sort of simple practices really and spending a lot of time on the Plum Village website looking at stuff and he continually talks about those painful moments that we feel those
ruminations, that duke that's hitting you really hard where you can't even think straight and he just talks about bringing center, take to your breath, the refuge which is centered in your body and just breathing and taking that step forward and moving.
So I'm continuing to use that and it works well. It's a quick fix. There's a lot of mindfulness there. There's a lot of parasympathetic stimulation certainly too and I don't know what I'm yapping about right now but thank you again for your presentation this morning you give me a lot to think about.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, thank you. Thanks Chris. Yeah and I mean, yeah on the one hand it's simple or gimmick or something like that but it's actually not because I can hear the way you're talking about it and describing it.
I can feel your practice in it and I can feel that it's not a gimmick actually like it's tied into a whole raft of kind of wisdom and compassion in you and so that's not trivial for you to say that to the homeless person with schizophrenia or something like that.
You know it's like I could just I got the hit of it you know just hearing it you know I could get the hit of it myself and feel it in my own heart yeah and that's animated by your own practice and yeah.
I'm going to answer to you offered out that continued rumination for all of us about am I just taking cherry picking the good parts of Buddhism and you know taking it in and where's my guilt related to that sort of you know Buddhism was happening for four or 500 years and then it's in India Mahayana was starting to be created.
The Chinese came down, Kumara Giva I think was the one that translated into Chinese, the Chinese already had their own philosophical systems with the Taoist systems the Confucian systems that started so they had the words, but it was their own words similar to our own therapeutic history with Maslow and stuff that we could take these beautiful practices and allow them to still, which were just trickles at the beginning that
Jack and Joseph brought in through the Peace Corps actually going there in Peace Corps they kind of brought it in and now there's just huge streams of this wandering around.
Some of it sort of simplistic. Others just extremely beautiful so I'm just going to add that out. So I think that's happening now in the West.
Yeah, thank you. Thanks. Thanks for sharing.
Great.
Dan, please.
Matthew, thank you. I was wondering if you could comment briefly.
You said something about renunciation and
Silla as being two different approaches to
sort of scientific boot and the MBSR I think and then the more monastic and
I find with the Dharma a lot of the translations are lost on me.
And I find an understanding either with people like you or
for example I've never understood what Cheetah was but I the closest I've come is similar to what Dr. Porges does with the Pauli Vagle theory and ventral or
the Lagos regulation. Another example of this is the Brahma Vaharas going on retreats for those sends me straight to hell because I really have trouble with near and far enemies I have no idea what to do with that.
And then one day I heard Orin Jay Sofer describe the Brahma Vaharas as being there to protect me and just that phrase turned me 180 degrees.
So renunciation is something I've not touched because I don't understand it.
And I heard you once give a definition of wisdom that I keep with me always.
What did I say? Do you remember what I said? I'm always afraid when people quote me back.
Oh my God, what did I say? What did I do?
Because I'm maybe embarrassed by it.
It was beautiful. It's like a gift with two beautiful handles on it.
You said, and this is my interpretation or my take on it, you said acts or thoughts or words of wisdom.
You know that they're wise when they set people free, when they create liberation.
And so that's now my guide. Am I right or am I free?
Am I sending out rightness and wrongness or am I creating freedom for everybody?
Got it.
So just briefly and then I'll take the last one and close.
So one principle is just like we got to have like working definitions of things, but don't get too caught up.
Anybody who wants to define mind is like incredibly guilty of grandiose thinking.
Anybody who wants to define chitta or something in some like ending the conversation there, it's like, no, no, no.
This is like, we kind of get a sense of it, but it's like, you know, we work our way into deeper understandings of it and they become more nuanced.
And so yeah, we have to define mindfulness to start a practice kind of, but it is like, no, to understand what mindfulness is, is the fruition of practice, not the beginning point.
What I was alluding to with renunciation and Sela renunciation is, you know, is the sense of renunciation is under emphasized in a lot of the secular articulations of practice.
And it's at the heart of the Buddhist lineage, the Buddha was a monk, as has been noted, you know, and.
So, yeah, we just in differentiating some of the secular approaches from the Buddhist approaches.
What Sela shared, you know, ethics are shared across that line of difference, but a lot of times renunciation is is minimized in the secular realm.
So it's a little like, yeah, we're grafting in mindfulness to my existing life.
And that is not the real gesture of the Dharma heart.
So, okay.
Oh, I gotta, gotta stop.
But last one row.
Yeah, please.
So, I wanted to just pose one, one framework of thinking about this interception with the Dharma and the mental health profession, which is.
Is there a ways by holding them both together that one might be able to help in arenas in which one or the other may be lacking on their own.
And in the mental health profession, I think that's fairly self evident.
There's a lot of black.
And in the Dharma, the particular area that I'm thinking of is trauma that just briefly in my working through trauma, I often would read a line in the Dharma book saying this is contraindicated for people have, you know, strong childhood trauma.
But then I couldn't find very much else that helped me through that.
And I also found problems in the mental health profession in dealing with this.
But somehow, by having the two, I was able to patch something together that I don't think I would have gotten solely either way.
So I just wanted to throw out that idea and see if you have any thoughts about it.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, thank you.
Yeah, I appreciate what you're saying. And I do think the two traditions can kind of help inform inform each other. Certainly we're seeing a kind of more psychotherapy ties Dharma being articulated.
And I think with some benefits and some some pros and cons to that, but but certainly some important benefits.
And then yeah, Dharma can feed into mental health and I didn't get into anything.
There are whole dimensions of the Dharma as being supporting the welfare of of of the mental health clinicians of supporting the general clinical skills of of mental health clinicians of deepening their their kind of the interventions that they might deliver.
And so lots of lots of cross fertilization and and I'm glad to hear that you found your own way and with with, you know, sort of grafting together the different approaches and I do feel like in the realm of trauma.
There's, I'm very enthusiastic about the potential of the the practice Dharma practice around that that's not.
Yeah, I think, I think we don't want to underestimate our pain nor do we want to underestimate our resilience and the capacity of our own heart in especially in the as so far in so far as the discourses around trauma.
Anyway, we're we're over time. Thank you for your, your understanding there. And thank you. Thank you, Rob for having me and it's a Saudi center and for your, your attention, everyone.
And it's nice to mix it up around all of this. And if I trespassed in any way on your heart during this morning, I ask your understanding, you know, hey, we normally do ask forgiveness at the end of a retreat or something like that.
And, and, and in talking about these themes, it's, it's not, it's not unskillfulness is maybe inevitable. Yeah. And so, so to the extent that I have been unskillful in any way, ask your, your understanding.
And, yeah, we'll see you, see you on the, the Dharma trail somewhere. Okay.
Okay.
Thanks, everyone.
