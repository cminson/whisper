00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.

00:12.000 --> 00:25.000
So, invitation is to settle in, settle into your body, your space, your posture.

00:25.000 --> 00:35.000
However things are, however things have come to be in this moment,

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
can be helpful to start out maybe with one or two deep breaths,

00:45.000 --> 00:55.000
just releasing, relaxing, letting go of any extra effort to get here.

00:55.000 --> 01:15.000
And then to invite awareness, mindfulness, to be in the forefront,

01:15.000 --> 01:28.000
the forefront of attention and intention these moments.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
I find it helpful to begin this more open awareness form of meditation

01:36.000 --> 01:51.000
by inviting the body to relax, may this body relax.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Can even help to sweep the attention through.

01:56.000 --> 02:12.000
Starting at the crown of the head, softening the forehead, scalp and temples,

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
relaxing the eyes and their sockets,

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
maybe allowing them to drift downward,

02:24.000 --> 02:43.000
even slightly back as if very gently looking back at our own experience.

02:43.000 --> 03:00.000
Allowing the jaw to relax, the tongue and lips to soften,

03:00.000 --> 03:07.000
bringing awareness to the neck and shoulders,

03:07.000 --> 03:17.000
the upper back and upper chest.

03:17.000 --> 03:37.000
Perhaps noticing and acknowledging the felt sense of this body breathing.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
Noticing the gentle movements of breath

03:43.000 --> 03:53.000
throughout the areas of the throat, nose, mouth, chest,

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
maybe the subtle flex and flux of the ribcage,

04:01.000 --> 04:16.000
softening the interstitial muscles.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
Noticing the motion of the diaphragm and the belly,

04:23.000 --> 04:32.000
allowing your abdomen to be soft.

04:32.000 --> 04:47.000
Inviting the deeper internal viscera to relax as well.

04:47.000 --> 04:57.000
Relaxing the muscles around the bones and the spine,

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
letting your body be rooted,

05:02.000 --> 05:13.000
held by the chair or cushion,

05:13.000 --> 05:28.000
letting your body be rooted around the strength of the earth.

05:28.000 --> 05:37.000
Inviting the hips and buttocks to relax,

05:37.000 --> 05:48.000
the thighs to soften.

05:48.000 --> 05:57.000
Inviting the shins, calves to soften.

05:57.000 --> 06:08.000
Noticing any excess contraction or tension to drain out through the ankles and the feet

06:08.000 --> 06:30.000
as they soften and ground.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
Noticing the whole body,

06:36.000 --> 06:45.000
simply here.

06:45.000 --> 06:55.000
Perhaps noticing details of distant or near sound.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Sensations or temperature of air on skin,

07:00.000 --> 07:16.000
cloth on skin.

07:16.000 --> 07:26.000
Settling.

07:26.000 --> 07:40.000
And inviting now, may this heart and mind relax.

07:56.000 --> 08:14.000
Noticing any mood, mental activity,

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
allowing it to be exactly as it is.

08:21.000 --> 08:32.000
Inviting a sense of kindness, clarity

08:32.000 --> 08:40.000
as whatever is arising flows through.

08:40.000 --> 08:50.000
Acknowledging what is, with no need, no need to hang on.

08:50.000 --> 08:59.000
Not to push away.

09:20.000 --> 09:38.000
And time to time it can be helpful

09:38.000 --> 09:47.000
to bring in just a touch of curiosity.

09:47.000 --> 09:54.000
To be aware.

09:54.000 --> 10:21.000
This moment, right.

10:24.000 --> 10:34.000
To be aware.

10:34.000 --> 10:44.000

12:14.000 --> 12:24.000
To be aware.

12:24.000 --> 12:34.000
To be aware.

12:34.000 --> 12:44.000
To be aware.

12:44.000 --> 12:54.000
To be aware.

12:54.000 --> 13:04.000
To be aware.

13:04.000 --> 13:14.000
To be aware.

13:14.000 --> 13:24.000
To be aware.

13:24.000 --> 13:34.000
To be aware.

13:34.000 --> 13:44.000
To be aware.

13:44.000 --> 13:54.000
To be aware.

13:54.000 --> 14:04.000

14:04.000 --> 14:14.000

14:54.000 --> 15:04.000
To be aware.

15:04.000 --> 15:14.000
To be aware.

15:14.000 --> 15:24.000
This moment.

15:44.000 --> 15:54.000
This moment.

15:54.000 --> 16:18.000
This moment.

16:18.000 --> 16:28.000
This moment.

16:48.000 --> 16:58.000

16:58.000 --> 17:08.000
This moment.

17:08.000 --> 17:18.000

17:38.000 --> 17:48.000

26:12.000 --> 26:22.000
This moment.

26:22.000 --> 26:30.000
This moment.

26:30.000 --> 26:40.000

26:40.000 --> 26:50.000

26:58.000 --> 27:08.000
This moment.

27:08.000 --> 27:18.000
This moment.

27:18.000 --> 27:26.000
This moment.

27:26.000 --> 27:36.000
This moment.

27:56.000 --> 28:06.000
This moment.

28:06.000 --> 28:16.000
This moment.

28:16.000 --> 28:24.000
This moment.

28:24.000 --> 28:34.000

28:34.000 --> 28:44.000
This moment.

28:44.000 --> 28:52.000
This moment.

28:52.000 --> 29:02.000
This moment.

29:02.000 --> 29:12.000
This moment.

29:12.000 --> 29:20.000
This moment.

29:20.000 --> 29:30.000
This moment.

29:30.000 --> 29:40.000
This moment.

29:40.000 --> 29:50.000
This moment.

29:50.000 --> 29:56.000
Does it come to the close of this sitting?

29:56.000 --> 30:02.000
The invitation is to turn the attention

30:02.000 --> 30:12.000
to the quality of awareness, the overall moment, in the heart and mind.

30:12.000 --> 30:26.000
Taking it in exactly as it is, with graciousness, kindness, if possible.

30:26.000 --> 30:46.000
Appreciating how things have come to be in this moment.

30:46.000 --> 30:56.000
Thank you.

30:56.000 --> 31:20.000
Thank you.

31:20.000 --> 31:36.000
Thank you all for the sincerity of your practice.

31:36.000 --> 31:46.000
And as it has become the custom when I teach, I invite you to take a moment

31:46.000 --> 31:56.000
to cast your mind, both cast your mind towards your companions here in this Zoom room.

31:56.000 --> 32:12.000
Send them a little pulse of kindness, metta appreciation, seen or unseen.

32:12.000 --> 32:22.000
So knowing that you're receiving that kindness, that appreciation from everyone else in this Zoom room.

32:22.000 --> 32:28.000
Fellow practitioners.

32:28.000 --> 32:36.000
And also taking a moment to send that sense of appreciation while wishing to other companions

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
that you have in your life or on the path of practice.

32:40.000 --> 32:50.000
Perhaps people listening later or people you know from other gatherings.

32:50.000 --> 33:08.000
Wishing all of them well.

33:08.000 --> 33:18.000
Thank you for that.

33:18.000 --> 33:24.000
Today I'm feeling a little quiet, you might be able to tell.

33:24.000 --> 33:40.000
I want to talk about a fundamental quality, really fundamental quality of the path and fundamental virtue for our development.

33:40.000 --> 33:48.000
This is part of kind of an emergent cluster of talks over the last couple of months on the Parames.

33:48.000 --> 34:00.000
They're called the imperfections, so they're called, but I don't love that word, but the full development of beneficial qualities that help us on the path.

34:00.000 --> 34:10.000
And the topic today is truthfulness in Pali that's such a S-A-C-C-A.

34:10.000 --> 34:16.000
And to start off, I invite you to do an internal exercise.

34:16.000 --> 34:22.000
To remember, sort of cast your gaze inwards.

34:22.000 --> 34:32.000
And remember a moment when something became really clear, a truth about your own experience.

34:32.000 --> 34:42.000
You don't have to even remember what it is, but that it's not necessarily a truth about the world.

34:42.000 --> 34:50.000
It's not propositional truth, but something that was true for you in the moment.

34:50.000 --> 35:02.000
You might remember where you were, how it felt in your body, maybe how it felt in your heart or your mind.

35:02.000 --> 35:14.000
Just sense into that.

35:14.000 --> 35:26.000
When I was contemplating this for myself, some of my earliest memories were of a sense of things feeling or seeming sharper visually,

35:26.000 --> 35:36.000
sometimes almost like a bolt of energy in the body or a gentle landing.

35:36.000 --> 35:55.000
Rightness in the moment could feel different all kinds of ways for different people, but just recognizing whatever that is for you.

35:55.000 --> 36:09.000
So as an overview, I'll just say that it seems like there's different levels or forms of truthfulness, Saka, which is also translated as real.

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
It gives you kind of a sense of the word.

36:14.000 --> 36:21.000
And I'm going to talk about the three levels today. They're kind of interlinked in my mind.

36:21.000 --> 36:29.000
And they are interpersonal honesty, ethical integrity in speech.

36:29.000 --> 36:37.000
And this is the one that's talked about, I think, the most in terms of the power of truthfulness.

36:37.000 --> 36:46.000
And the second is kind of that internal clarity that we were just exploring, internal honesty.

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
Knowing things as they are, as they've come to be.

36:51.000 --> 36:58.000
And then the third level is dharmic truth, or dharmic truths.

36:58.000 --> 37:07.000
And here, perhaps the easiest to mention is the four noble truths or four ennobling truths.

37:07.000 --> 37:14.000
The Arya Satchani, they're called. Satchani being plural for Satcha.

37:14.000 --> 37:22.000
So that's the territory we're going to cover in the next 20 minutes, half hours, something like that.

37:22.000 --> 37:30.000
So level one, very fundamental and important, is that interpersonal honesty.

37:30.000 --> 37:40.000
One famous ancient teacher, Acharya Dhammapala, calls it the foundation of all other virtues.

37:40.000 --> 37:46.000
And the Buddha, I didn't take time to pull the quote out of the middle-length discourses,

37:46.000 --> 37:53.000
but in one conversation with his young son, Rahula, says to him,

37:53.000 --> 38:01.000
basically that to tell a deliberate lie is to pour out, as if you're turning over a cup of water and pouring it out,

38:01.000 --> 38:07.000
the virtues developed through the meditative path through what he called the holy life.

38:07.000 --> 38:13.000
So the Buddha considered it that important, to be honest.

38:13.000 --> 38:22.000
And it's really poignant to me to kind of hear that in this age where there's so much emphasis in many of our cultures on

38:22.000 --> 38:33.000
misinformation, alternative facts, sort of a breakdown of what people agree on as true or even real,

38:33.000 --> 38:40.000
that can take tremendous integrity to show up with honesty right now,

38:40.000 --> 38:47.000
and a culture that seems to be kind of mushing truth about.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
And it can build trust.

38:51.000 --> 39:00.000
I remember many years before I came to practice, I was a designer and was working kind of, I was on loan to this department within my company.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
There were people there I'd never met before, and there's this guy there.

39:04.000 --> 39:10.000
And I don't think I'd ever met anyone that honest before.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
He actually wasn't that nice of a person.

39:13.000 --> 39:18.000
But wow, you knew if it came out of his mouth, it was real.

39:18.000 --> 39:26.000
And there was just something deeply trustable about that that made him kind of nice to be around,

39:26.000 --> 39:34.000
because I didn't have to worry about him blowing smoke, but he said it like he felt it.

39:34.000 --> 39:40.000
But that also points to something that the Buddha makes a distinction about,

39:40.000 --> 39:46.000
which is it can build trust, we relax around people who tell the truth.

39:46.000 --> 39:59.000
And much of what passes for truth is unvarnished bias or judgment or emotion, distorted opinion, right?

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
So there's honesty and then there's truth.

40:03.000 --> 40:12.000
And truth is a little trickier to get to and involves more of an internal process and a relational process.

40:12.000 --> 40:19.000
So in terms of relationship, the Buddha offers teachings, many of you have heard these many times,

40:19.000 --> 40:34.000
in terms of why speech that I feel like really kind of give the bar for when it's helpful versus not helpful to share truthfully.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
And it's kind of a test.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Is it truthful?

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Is it useful?

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
Is it kind?

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
And is it timely?

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
Truthful, useful, kind and timely.

40:49.000 --> 40:56.000
And all of those to add up together to is it wise.

40:56.000 --> 41:07.000
In contemplating those for myself, particularly in my role as a hospital chaplain and also as a friend, as a family member, as a partner, whatever.

41:07.000 --> 41:17.000
I learned the value in silence and restraint, the value in naming the particularities of what are what is there.

41:17.000 --> 41:26.000
Because if what's going to come out of my mouth is unvarnished opinion or bias, it might not be so helpful and it might not even be real.

41:26.000 --> 41:32.000
It might be feel true in the moment, but maybe not so helpful.

41:32.000 --> 41:51.000
So the value in restraint and taking a second look, the etymology of the word respect, respect to look again, to respect that process of truth understanding and truth telling.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
And there's a simplicity to this.

41:53.000 --> 41:58.000
This starts to shade into the next level of truth, the internal level.

41:58.000 --> 42:14.000
I didn't look up the study but brain science has shown that when people lie, different parts of the brain light up and it's a more complex matrix that lights up.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
And this is fascinating, right?

42:17.000 --> 42:25.000
It mirrors the Buddha's teaching on proliferating thought upon cha.

42:25.000 --> 42:33.000
But when there's a lie that's happening, there are other levels of cognition that are having to be engaged.

42:33.000 --> 42:40.000
There are other levels of story making and justification and projection or whatnot.

42:40.000 --> 42:53.000
All of which is kind of a mishigash of the mind, mishigash of the mind, like clutter, extra confusion.

42:53.000 --> 43:03.000
It takes valuable resources and it blocks such a truth that blocks mindfulness and awareness.

43:03.000 --> 43:12.000
From really taking hold, though, of course, the second level, this internal clarity, internal honesty, queer seeing.

43:12.000 --> 43:19.000
So often, especially in more complicated situations for triggered and riled up or whatnot.

43:19.000 --> 43:31.000
That internal seeing can be a bunch of activity, justification, anger, you know, maybe having gotten it a little off.

43:31.000 --> 43:37.000
I know early in my practice, especially on retreat, like everything, it felt like everything, maybe it wasn't everything.

43:37.000 --> 43:47.000
Everything I'd ever said or done that was a little bit off just came back for a second look or third look or a tenth look or a fiftieth look.

43:47.000 --> 43:58.000
And that too, that's not an accident, it's a process of purifying the mind and the heart and we all go through it, all of us,

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
if we stick with the practice long enough to see these things, right?

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
So it's just human.

44:05.000 --> 44:14.000
But even if there's a lot of complexity in this process, there's still the simplicity and honesty to the internal gaze,

44:14.000 --> 44:23.000
that internal awareness, that mindfulness, and that has really become, for me, a barometer.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
Almost like, what do they call those things?

44:27.000 --> 44:34.000
Like a metal detector or a wand that detects water under the earth.

44:34.000 --> 44:43.000
Like when that simplicity happens, it's like bing, there you are, on the right track, warmer, it's closer.

44:43.000 --> 44:56.000
So in this sense, awareness reflects of awareness or awareness of awareness, I'm using those terms synonymously.

44:56.000 --> 45:03.000
It's basically a cognate of a form of truthfulness, a very deep form of it.

45:03.000 --> 45:12.000
And chitta nupasana, contemplation of our hearts, our minds, the third foundation.

45:12.000 --> 45:20.000
It's kind of a truthfulness cultivation process.

45:20.000 --> 45:29.000
It's truing things more and more and more as time goes on.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
So there's internal clarity.

45:31.000 --> 45:40.000
I think a lot of different levels, like some weeks ago, when I was here, we discussed the six senses and Vedana feeling tone.

45:40.000 --> 45:53.000
And that kind of granularity in seeing what is arising and experienced is a really good way of starting to connect with this inner clarity, inner truth.

45:53.000 --> 46:01.000
Seeing, hearing, tasting, sensing, quality of the mind, quality of the heart.

46:01.000 --> 46:16.000
Those are alternatives to my own internal story about something, my own internal projection onto something.

46:16.000 --> 46:30.000
This is especially true often and most accessible with Vedana, this feeling to unpleasant, unpleasant and vast range of neither pleasant nor unpleasant.

46:30.000 --> 46:39.000
I might, I mean, I remember on one retreat, I was taking a shower and I get aches and pains.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
I think a lot of us, right, and showers often relieve that.

46:42.000 --> 46:48.000
So I just think it's generally favorable impression of that kind of process.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
It's like pleasant.

46:50.000 --> 46:57.000
And the mindfulness was so strong, the awareness was so strong that all of the little flits of unpleasant were there too.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
And all the flits just sort of boring, neither were there.

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
It helped the mind to see how to do this with everything.

47:06.000 --> 47:22.000
There's this wash over everything that renders it an overall, oh, that was a lovely dinner with my friends or a beautiful walk or a really unpleasant wait at the doctor's office or whatever it was.

47:22.000 --> 47:31.000
Whereas in reality, it's this constant play of wasn't unpleasant and neither.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
There's a little more honesty and dropping to that.

47:34.000 --> 47:40.000
And in the moment, it allows for a different experience.

47:40.000 --> 47:57.000
In one of my early sort of daily life retreats with Andrea Fella, one of the big, or I suppose it was a little aha, but it had big implications was that tuning into the felt sensations of washing dishes actually made it really pleasant.

47:57.000 --> 48:05.000
As long as I wasn't like grumpy about what I wasn't doing instead, it was actually a perfectly fine experience.

48:05.000 --> 48:13.000
So, I'm sure that each of you has experiences and lives like this, right?

48:13.000 --> 48:32.000
It allows for what psychologists can call a reframe, or simply just more nuance, more enjoyment, more clarity about what's real in that moment.

48:32.000 --> 48:51.000
So that overall tint or wash or mood, instead of becoming or masquerading as truth, can start to also be seen as the attitude of my relationship to reality.

48:51.000 --> 48:57.000
So this is another level of the internal truthfulness, right?

48:57.000 --> 49:10.000
I can see love and appreciation for my friend is what they are, rather than just the general wash of, oh, that was a really lovely conversation, right?

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
Or a version for what it is.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
And that can release it a little bit.

49:18.000 --> 49:36.000
And Ernest can have this magical quality of helping our hearts and minds to savor the good stuff and kind of let the bad stuff wash through a little bit more, especially if there's discernment.

49:36.000 --> 49:50.000
And all of this, excuse me, all of this is chitinupasana, contemplating mind as mind, the quality of the heart and mind as quality.

49:50.000 --> 50:03.000
It also points to very important pointing that the Buddha talks about in this foundation, which is seeing greed, aversion and delusion,

50:03.000 --> 50:20.000
and seeing their absence, generosity or contentment, care, love, kindness, compassion, clarity, wisdom, awareness.

50:20.000 --> 50:35.000
And that is powerful. That's powerful in part because nibbana, awakening, is the permanent absence of greed, hatred and delusion. That's one of the definitions for it in the Buddha's ancient teachings.

50:35.000 --> 50:41.000
So it's really helpful to see them when they pop up and to appreciate when they're not there.

50:41.000 --> 50:51.000
And appreciating the absence helps the wholesome qualities grow.

50:51.000 --> 50:57.000
And also be a shortcut to seeing our own self preoccupations.

50:57.000 --> 51:14.000
So this is the beginning of what in psychology is called being de-centered, which does not mean being not centered as in not present, but rather means not being self-centered,

51:14.000 --> 51:30.000
but having the entire experience of life completely organized around my wishes, my agenda, my assumptions.

51:30.000 --> 51:43.000
It's to see the world and situations without I, me and mine being at the center of it all or projected and imputed into every tiny little thing.

51:43.000 --> 51:53.000
And this, this is a very powerful insight, growth trajectory can happen in little ways and big ways, right?

51:53.000 --> 51:59.000
I still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of the world without me in it.

51:59.000 --> 52:16.000
I totally rocked my world for years, right? And little glimpses of that too add up just like drops of water can fill a bucket.

52:16.000 --> 52:28.000
So what's the alternative? Many of you already know this, but the Buddha talks about in many places seeing reality in terms of conditionality.

52:28.000 --> 52:36.000
Karma action and result as clusters of these conditions and consequences.

52:36.000 --> 52:46.000
I'm flipping to a word document right now because the quote is easier to find there. This comes from the middle length discourses.

52:46.000 --> 53:01.000
Majamanakaya 98 for those of you who track these things. And it's the closing of a discourse. The Buddha is giving a teaching, he's giving to two boys.

53:01.000 --> 53:16.000
He concludes by saying, so that is how the truly wise see action as it really is, as interdependent conditions.

53:16.000 --> 53:22.000
The wise are skilled in actions and results.

53:22.000 --> 53:34.000
He goes on to say living beings are bound by action, like the chariot wheeled to the linchpin.

53:34.000 --> 53:51.000
So these seeing in terms of action and response, action and result, and by action here, it's not just physical actions or actions of speech, actions of mind.

53:51.000 --> 54:06.000
Am I clinging on to that old bit of resentment or wounding or grump, or have I let it go? Do I not take it so seriously?

54:06.000 --> 54:19.000
So this process of truth cultivation also means beginning to see our own blind spots. That's just by definition where to do.

54:19.000 --> 54:28.000
Other people are huge allies in this process, not always pleasant, but huge allies in the process.

54:28.000 --> 54:43.000
One spiritual teacher talks about our companions or the role of a teacher, spiritual friend, is to hold a mirror up to the back of your head.

54:43.000 --> 54:52.000
Right? How else are you going to see this stuff? How else am I going to see this stuff?

54:52.000 --> 55:12.000
So it takes an art to take this kind of process in wisely, because other people too, all of us have our projections, our imputations, our biases, our confusions, our agendas.

55:12.000 --> 55:19.000
But I find it helpful, rather than getting into stories necessarily, all those can be very valuable.

55:19.000 --> 55:31.000
We can have really skillful conversations around stories, rather getting really curious about the truth of my impact on other people.

55:31.000 --> 55:44.000
Because no matter what their story is or my story is, the fact of the impact on them, for good or for ill, that's true. That impact is true.

55:44.000 --> 55:56.000
We can work from there, like the acknowledgement of that, or celebration of it, if it's a good impact.

55:56.000 --> 56:05.000
That kind of curiosity is a really caring act. It's a process of de-centering in itself.

56:05.000 --> 56:20.000
And it also points to how what we lead with, what we put out, really influences and sometimes defines what we receive and experience.

56:20.000 --> 56:26.000
One of the things, too, is conditionality and karma.

56:26.000 --> 56:38.000
Famous anecdote of a gatekeeper in India, these were really city-states at this point, and the gatekeepers had all kinds of functions.

56:38.000 --> 56:44.000
One of them was to orient newcomers to where they were coming.

56:44.000 --> 56:55.000
And in this particular story, the gatekeeper was a friendly person, and groups of people would come through, and one of the most common questions they would get is,

56:55.000 --> 57:02.000
what are the people like here? What's the culture? What are the people like?

57:02.000 --> 57:13.000
And this person was a wise person, and they would ask, asking one particular group, well, what were they like, where you came from?

57:13.000 --> 57:21.000
And one person would say, oh, they were awful, like rude, conniving, mean, cheating.

57:21.000 --> 57:25.000
Just, you couldn't trust them as far as you could look at them.

57:25.000 --> 57:34.000
And the gatekeeper would nod and safely say, I think you'll find people a lot like that here.

57:34.000 --> 57:40.000
Several groups later, someone asked the same question, what are the people like here?

57:40.000 --> 57:48.000
And the gatekeeper nods, they're hip to this, and well, what were they like, where you came from?

57:48.000 --> 57:56.000
Oh, kind, warm, responsive, collaborative, wonderful neighbors.

57:56.000 --> 58:01.000
I got this new job, I had to come here, I didn't want to leave them.

58:01.000 --> 58:09.000
Gatekeeper nods, I think you'll find people a lot like that.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
Of course, that's not always true in every case.

58:13.000 --> 58:22.000
And it is absolutely amazing that even some of the most so-called difficult personalities I've met in my life,

58:22.000 --> 58:31.000
how it transforms the way we relate, if I lead with kindness and curiosity,

58:31.000 --> 58:38.000
brings out the best in each of us, right?

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
So, this too is conditionality.

58:42.000 --> 58:46.000
This too is a form of truth.

58:46.000 --> 58:53.000
How we show up evokes what we receive.

58:53.000 --> 59:00.000
And there's another, this brings me to sort of a brief mention, the third level of truth,

59:00.000 --> 59:07.000
which is the Four Ennobling Truths, Four Noble Truths, Arya Asachani.

59:07.000 --> 59:15.000
Which is arguably the most important, or at least the most practical form of conditionality the Buddha ever taught.

59:15.000 --> 59:22.000
It fits into, if this arises, that arises, if this ceases, that ceases.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
But it's a more particular case, right?

59:25.000 --> 59:33.000
The truth of dukkha, suffering or dis-ease, just the fact of it.

59:33.000 --> 59:42.000
There's some Daya or some Upada, the arising of dukkha, of suffering in the moment,

59:42.000 --> 59:51.000
of dukkha-nirvara, the ceasing of dukkha in the moment, arising, ceasing.

59:51.000 --> 59:59.000
And then, of course, manga, the path to the ceasing, the ending of dukkha.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000
These Four Noble Truths can be kind of a diagnostic tool, right?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:14.000
And a medicine to come to the truth of the way things are in the moment.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I remember many years ago I was traveling and it was kind of a fraught traveling experience with a friend.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
We weren't getting along, it was very stressful.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:30.000
And she and her wisdom just looked at me and named, this is dukkha.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And it just relaxed something, right?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
It wasn't like me or you or your fault, my fault, it's going wrong.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
This is suffering, okay.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
What is going to help release the suffering?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And then we were into a different mode, a different way of being.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:03.000
So it can cut through confusion, the tool, the diagnostic of these Four Noble Truths,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:12.000
remove any extra confusions, layers, justifications,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:21.000
second arrows following that first arrow of suffering.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:31.000
So to recap the power, the practice of truth, internally and externally,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:38.000
it's nourished by and it nourishes the simplicity of awareness itself.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
It's nourished by and nourishes wisdom itself.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And it's a foundational, virtue and powerful ally on the path.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
So thank you for your kind attention.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I wish you many truthful moments in undertaking this path wisely.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Dear friends, I'm going to pause the recording and we'll unpause it again at the very end

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:25.000
so we can speak freely with question and answer for a little while.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:39.000
May the practice that we have done here together be cause and condition for greater truthfulness, awareness, kindness and awakening in ourselves.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And in all of the lives we touch, all of the lives they touch, and so on rippling out, outwards and outwards.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:00.000
May all beings be safe, may all beings be happy,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:07.000
may all beings be healing and as healthy as possible,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:26.000
may all beings everywhere be free.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Thank you friends for your practice and we'll see some of you in two weeks.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Take good care and feel free to unmute yourselves to say goodbye.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Thank you.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Thank you Dan.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Thank you Dan.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Thanks.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Bye.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Bye.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Bye.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Bye.
