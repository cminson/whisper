 Well, good evening everyone. As we start, I'd like to share with you a sort of an interesting story that may have happened for you as well when you decided to come here tonight and hear about feeling because it's somewhat of a western phenomenon. I was asked to give this talk about two months ago, two and a half months ago, and my first reaction, and I told the person who invited me, was to say, oh yes, I'd love to talk about feeling because feelings were big in my family. I mean, there was a lot of that, especially on the female side. And so I found out, it's actually about VEDNA, V-E-D-A-N-A, and it's a different kind of feeling. It is not emotion, it's a sensation that actually precedes emotion. So I have had a really very rich journey over the last two and a half or so months in really knowing what I'm going to be talking about tonight and experiencing it for myself. So I share it with you on a very new, fresh basis, quite honestly, and one that I had heard a lot about, like, where does this, where do you feel this in your body? And this all was very vague and fuzzy to me until, as I said, I was fortunate enough to be asked to give this talk. So if you came here to hear about emotions, what we're really going to be talking about is something that precedes emotions. And it's a very, very wonderful teaching and also one that can be very useful in your everyday life. One of the things that brought me to this practice was actually not the formal practice so much, as the realization that the formal practice on the cushion is only one element. And then the informal practice is everything else. And so really in practice, we're always practicing. And so just that knowledge of that there's really no escape hatch really if you become a more serious student is, was very, very appealing to me from the beginning. And Vedna, the sensation of feeling, is a very fine place to study I found in practice in the last, as I said, brief time. So another thing that I would get kind of excited and scared about was when somebody would pick up one of the suit of books, you know, and it's sort of heavy and ponderous. And I think, oh boy, you know, what's going to happen here? But the sutas are a very interesting place to start looking at what Vedna is. And I'll just read a portion. And I assure you, there will also then be some very personal aspects of it that I have experienced in my practice. And I'm hoping that we'll also have an opportunity this evening for you to experience more elements of Vedna and then give you some Vedna venues to look for, to think about and hopefully learn from. The foundations of mindfulness that we're studying for these four weeks, Vedna is described this way when the Buddha was asked. By the way, the bhikkhus are the students or the monks in the case of the Buddha. And in our case, we could call them the yogis, the meditators if we want to make it a more personal thing to ourselves. And how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu abide contemplating feeling as feelings? Here, when feeling a pleasant feeling, a bhikkhu understands, I feel a pleasant feeling. When feeling a painful feeling, he understands, I feel a painful feeling. When feeling an either painful nor pleasant feeling, he understands, I feel an either painful nor pleasant feeling. And he goes on from there. Very often with the suttas you'll find that there's a lot of repetition because this was in fact an oral tradition that went on actually for many centuries before any of this was written down. So you'll get this repetition but there was a good reason for it originally. So what you'll notice first of all is that there's just bare noting. You feel that there's a sensation. Pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant or unpleasant which is known as neutral. So there's no varnishing of it, there's no additional embroidering of it, it's just a feeling, a sensation. And it can be a physical sensation as I was telling you with that often in past meditation times we would talk about where do you feel this in your body that can often make it a more real thing to you and keep you from going down to the embroidery path and the story train and the narrative and all the things that go from there. So then, and there's more, much more and more repetition there, but notice the first thing, pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, neither pleasant nor unpleasant. So then the Buddha, actually this isn't the Buddha, this was a nun. And she was apparently a very highly evolved practitioner and she was asked, lady, what underlying tendency underlies pleasant feeling? Once again remember it's a physical thing, it's not an emotion because it's an important thing to realize here. What underlying tendency underlines painful feeling? What underlying tendency underlies neither painful nor pleasant feeling? Friend, the underlying tendency to lust underlies pleasant feeling. We could also call this leaning into or craving or clinging, which many of you who have been here for a while, we know what that is, right? We've talked about it. So that's what can happen with something that's pleasant. We get into it, we like it, we want more of it. The underlying tendency to, excuse me, the underlying tendency to aversion underlies painful feeling. So painful, we don't like it, we don't want any more of it, get it away from me. Does the underlying tendency to ignorance underlie all neither painful nor pleasant feeling? So there's a certain numbing or just nothing's really happening. There's no juice when it's neither pleasant or unpleasant sensation. We're just sort of living our lives. So that can often feel sort of bland, sort of blah. And many people at this point, including, I have been guilty of this, I have to admit, especially with my husband occasionally, let's mix it up a little bit, you know, make this a little more interesting, you know, versus just being sort of a bland place. So that's, those are some of the, I think, the most important two of the most important beginning teachings, pleasant, unpleasant, neither pleasant nor unpleasant. And then the concept that out of all three of these, something comes, the clinging, the craving, the aversion for unpleasant and sort of almost a numb or just nothing's happening, no excitement. So then the Buddha was asked, and this is once again a direct sutta. What are the origin of feelings? What is their cessation and the way leading to their cessation? What is the gratification in feelings? What is the danger in feelings? And what is the escape from them? So the escape. There are Ananda three kinds of feelings, pleasant, painful, and neutral. Ananda was a student of the Buddhist. Through the origin of sense impression, there is origin of feelings. Through the cessation of sense impression, there is cessation of feelings. It is the noble eightfold path that is the way leading to the cessation of feelings, namely right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. So the eightfold path can be a key place in having a cessation of these feelings. The thing to realize in all of this is since life is changing all of the time, we can get into a lot of suffering, can we not, when we're either craving, in aversion, or just feeling this blah feeling that we sometimes have, reference to them. That can be sort of made into Buddhism light and a very nice description of this is in the issue at hand, which is a collection of Gil Franzdale, our teachers teachings. And he talked about the recognition of the feeling, the naming of the feeling, the acceptance that you are having a feeling, and then the investigation. And I'd like to give you an example of something that happened to me literally Monday of this week. A lot of feeling involved here because a special friend of ours, whom we've known for 25 years in my husband's case, 15 years of mine, is dying and has also decided to more than likely take his life. And so this would probably be the last visit that we're going to have with him. And he lives in Southern California and I knew it was almost time for me to go to bed, I was going to be leaving the next morning very early, so it would probably be the last visit. So you can imagine the charge of feeling or emotion that was going on here for me. And as women do, all of a sudden just started crying. And he said to me, stop crying. And of course that was really difficult because here's a special friend telling me not to have these feelings. And I tried to stop crying and couldn't stop and so then I brushed them away and he said something very, very interesting. And he said, you know, it's a lung disease that he has. And he said, when people I really care about cry, I have a tendency to get even more physical discomfort in terms of this lung problem that I have. So just the knowledge of that was an amazingly important realization that for me, I was serving myself and hopefully he was feeling that this was something that was appropriate, that was good, that was a connection that he knew that I cared about him, but in fact there was a real problem with this feeling that I was expressing. And so what I was able to do, and it wasn't right away, because the first thing I did was just shut down and got very quiet. And that went on for about an hour until I decided it's time to go to bed now because I need to get up early in the morning and drive back to San Francisco. And so I realized that there was the best thing I could do was just give him a hug and say good night. I'd say goodbye, just say good night. I thought that would be somewhat of something that would be somewhat useful and tell him that I loved him. That's exactly what I did. And it was a nice parting. And then I realized when I went back to the room that I was really kind of angry with him for shutting off this feeling that I was having. But the other thing that came of that as I wound the whole thing in terms of VEDNA was just recognizing, number one, that I had that feeling, the feeling of gee, he's shutting me out of his life, this is terrible, and having this whole storyline connected to it. And the naming that came to it more than anything else was rejection or isolation. And what I realized, because the next and last step, as I mentioned to you earlier, is investigation. When I investigated the feeling, I realized that it was almost a mirror for when I was a little kid, lived in Chicago, and I would go to take my piano lessons downtown to the Loop. And my mother would accompany me. And I always wanted to have these little one-cent chocolate candy bars, Hershey bars. And sometimes she would let me have them, sometimes she wouldn't let me have them. But if I couldn't get her to buy me these things, I would start crying and she'd say, stop crying, people are looking at you, you don't want people. So it was almost a mirroring of that feeling that I had with him in terms of stop crying. And there was just a relief in the whole thing. And I subsequently just, I feel much different and much freed from the kinds of very difficult emotions that were going on at that point. But it came from unwinding them and bringing them back to investigating what was really happening and knowing certainly that the present day was creating something as well and a stimulus for this to happen, but also that it had a background to it that was very powerful. In all of this, one of my favorite aspects of emotions and feeling, more specifically feeling, is the concept of the arrow. And this comes straight from mindfulness of emotions and the issue at hand. The Buddha once asked a student, if a person is struck by an arrow, is it painful? The student replied, it is. The Buddha then asked, if the person is struck by a second arrow, is that even more painful? The student replied again, it is. The Buddha then explained, in life, we cannot always control the first arrow. However, the second arrow is our reaction to the first. The second arrow is optional. So in terms of the story I just told you with this friend, and it's a deeply personal story, but it was so meaningful to me that I thought it was something that would be nice to share. There was definitely the second arrow that I was putting on it that what's wrong with me, what's wrong with him, why aren't we connecting it this probably last time we ever really will, and all these things that were kind of churning around. And I was creating a whole story around that. And in our practice, it's not uncommon for that to happen. On the cushion, for instance, I have a very quick mind. I don't know how many of you do, but we can really get going and manufacturing whole aspects of things and whole stories around a look that somebody might give you or something that might happen. But as the Buddha has said, if we can unwind it and bring it back to the original sensation, unpleasant. David's told me, you know, stop crying. That's unpleasant. And not move on and on and on. There is a possibility for being free and for not either creating aversion, like getting very angry at this person for doing this to me or feeling this clinging of I will cry because that's what I do and that's something that's me. And he's not going to tell me this, but just the knowledge that when you're really in a place with other human beings, there's something else that's happening there that we need to honor and have a sense of appreciation for and compassion for. So this is just one of many things along this line that's happened to me. I seem to be a very Vedna-sipasana for me. And when I'm on the cushion, I have a very quick mind. And in a retreat setting, I've been to probably six or seven retreats, there's really the time to experience some of this really close sensation, pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, going into the kitchen. As Christopher Titmus, one of our teachers once said, ah, the dining room, the mosquito breeding ground of all judgment. Because you know, you go to the dining room. I don't know how many of you have been on retreat or been in any kind of a group setting and, oh, I look at that fat person over there eating all that food, or look at that skinny person, they're not eating enough. Or why do they make this kind of food? They ought to know that it's going to make us all gassy or whatever it happens to be, that we can just start spinning with some kind of thing or another that's really at its heart, why can't we just experience the meal and experience what's happening here in terms of the sensations of taste and sound and smell and all the other sense stores that we have to experience our sensations. And there are six, sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and thoughts. And that's, as I told you earlier, one of the richest ones for me. So these are also termed as our sense stores, the six sense stores. And the Buddha, I understand, said, we have to be very careful about guarding our sense stores. This is not to not perceive or sense life or we wouldn't even be human, but it's to guard them and realize where they could be heading us. Where are we going with this? And I know a lot of people think, gee, it must be great to have a spouse that you meditate with. It just must be wonderful. Because you know, you're not alone and you're both really believe in the practice and I'm sure your home life is just as placid as can be. And this is just, you know, sure every moment is mindful and you know, you're not lonely or this or that, whatever. Anyway, you must have a spouse. But anyway, there's all these things that people think in terms of, you know, might think anyway. I'm just assuming that I have to admit, but I have had people tell me this, gee, you both meditate, you know, Jeff's done it for 25 years and you've done it for eight years or whatever it is. Just must be terrific. But in a retreat, it is incredible what can happen for me of noting, okay, did he, did he appear to the sitting? Did he not appear to the sitting? And one of the first retreats I ever went to, he was sitting behind me and I think directly behind me. And I noticed, pretty obvious, right? You walk into the room, walk out of the room, you do your walking and you're sitting and you're walking and you're sitting. And I noticed he wasn't there. Well, what is this? You know what? He's not there. Why isn't he there? Why isn't he being a good meditator? He's been doing this for 25, just going off on a whole thing with my own self. And that went on. We're talking about 6.30 in the morning until 9.30 at night, approximately 45 minutes of sitting, 45 minutes of walking, 45 minutes of sitting, 45 minutes of walking. Then you may have a job for an hour or so and two hours lunch, that's the longest break, perhaps. This was up at Spirit Rock. And I was just beside myself with what this meant. Oh, we'll probably stop meditating. He'll want to stop this when this is over and this is really a good retreat for me and just all this spinning along. And so when the retreat was over, I didn't, then I did notice he was there. I forget at what point of the day, but much later in that day. And so when we left, I said, you know, where were you during, you know, from so-and-so to so-and-so on Tuesday or whatever day it was? And he said, well, my back was hurting and I was sitting in the back of the room. So the kinds of things that we can put ourselves into and the kinds of foment that we can put ourselves into in terms of just what could be bare noting of, and in this case it might have just been, hmm, sensing might have been like a lowness or disappointment or just some little, little aversion, some little kind of a unpleasantness here. But instead, you know, I went on this entire thought train. And another Spirit Rock retreat more recently, in fact, right after 9-11, about four months after 9-11, went to the New Year's retreat. This is about halfway through the retreat. It was a seven or eight day retreat. And I noticed Jack Kornfield sitting in the back of the room. And he was sitting against the wall. I don't remember if he had a cushion or not, but he was sort of leaning against the wall. And he had a look on his face that for all, I don't know, maybe all of you don't know who he is, but he's one of the key teachers, one of the main teachers up at Spirit Rock and has written a number of books and has a long time of a student and teacher. And he had this very worried, pained look that I had projected onto his face. And I was sure that the reason he was here was because some awful attack had happened. As I said, this is about four months after 9-11 and you know how much the news is kind of embroidering all this at this point. And I was sure he was going to announce to us some awful, awful thing. And the next session was META. And thank God for that because the whole loving kindness and you know, may I be safe, may I be free from suffering, you know, all the kinds of things that we do in our META practice. It was very difficult for me, but I was able to do it. Well, the end of it came, he left the room and I don't even know when he exactly left, but there was nothing. There was absolutely nothing. But my mind had really, it's called papancia, proliferation of thoughts. One thought creates another and another. And then you know that this face is very troubled and very worried. And for all I know, he was, you know, in Nirvana, totally blissed out. I don't really know what he was really thinking or what he was like, but I doubt very much that he was in a very negative or awful place when I, you know, look back at it. So all of these ways in which we can create suffering and pushing things away or clean to them, just numbing out. And I think the Christian is one very good place to get this because there's kind of no place to escape to and no place to really hide or not as easy anyway, shall we say, because it's always there and you're always there. What I'd like to do is to have us all just see if we can have a way of experiencing this together. And so if we could close our eyes, sit in a comfortable posture, but close your eyes and breathe three or four breaths, deep breaths that just blow out as much of the tension or any irritation or feelings of none rest that you may have. And then think of either an incident or right now, if there's something as immediate as a pain that you might have right now, a physical pain in a knee or your back or whatever, or it could be an incident, something that's happened perhaps in the recent past, where you can go back to that time and that place and there was an issue here. Something happened that was very powerful, either in a clinging or an aversion, where you really had this feeling of pleasant or unpleasant. We'll stick with those two. And when you seek deeper or investigate, you notice that either the pleasant was not so pleasant or the unpleasant was really a total fabrication or in some way was so off that you could unwind it at this point. And when you think of it, see if you can find the seed of the investigation that would bring you back to a place of calm, resolution, or understanding that neutralizes it. Might be a long time ago, might be 10 minutes ago. There's usually a story, a story connected to the Vedana, the bear sensation, pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, and we go off and move into a story. And sometimes when you remember what the story is, you can wind it back out and unravel. Perhaps a second arrow, your reaction to a stimulus. Now you may open your eyes. And since I've given you three or four stories, it would be really nice if some of you are willing to, if you are willing to share something that relates to this pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, the Vedana principle. Anybody willing to do that? Thank you. Yes. So kind of a rejection too, is that part of it? Or potential rejection, potential. I think that sounds like anxiousness. And what happened when it all broke? The stories were gone. Was there a relief or anything that, was there suffering in the interim period? Nothing too major, but there's no, yeah, I think there's element. Replaying it. What might they have taken offense to or what, like, I can be right there with what you're talking about. Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. Now, there, the thing that I've noted, as I said, since I've been practicing this over the last couple of months is, I don't catch it right at the beginning of the pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. I catch it at the story time. And that's very helpful because then I'm thinking that what's going to happen is that if I catch it there and just doesn't go into more and more and more stories, that it will kind of wheel itself back so that I will be able to perceive it sooner and sooner and sooner. So that's what, what I think will happen. I really do. And the more you practice with it, the more I think the possibility for that to happen is. And of course, the main thing is the less suffering for self and others. Because sometimes, you know, if you're living in a relationship with someone, there's also suffering that you're creating for them with whatever anxiety of the job problems. You know, I have an extremely stressful and, you know, very, there's a lot of demands in me with for me on me, excuse me, in fundraising, because, you know, it's a time of less money and, you know, the college really needs the money. And so there's a lot of, you know, pressure. And so bringing that into the house, you know, all those kinds of sensations and feelings can really. But is it clear that the sensation is just this, this whole initial sense relationship, and then it moves to emotions later. So the storyline, you already probably have emotions going, but there's still value in that. Don't, I would not, you know, in any way discount that, because just like this thing that happened with David, I know that form, you know, four or five years ago, I would not have caught that. I would have just been very upset and felt for a much longer time. It was helpful for him to say what he said to me because it helped me to understand why crying was going to be so uncomfortable for him, literally physically because of his illness. But I think, you know, the time of recognition comes closer and closer. Thank you very much. Anybody else have one? It's willing to, oh, please. It was very helpful. And I think the practice itself was helpful enough. I probably would have talked more, I probably would have asked him more about it because we know each other so well. You know, like, are you serious? The first thing I said, I actually asked him, are you serious that you don't want me to cry? Because I thought maybe it was, oh, Cheryl, don't cry. I thought maybe it was like that. And he said, no, I'm very serious. And then he told me. So it was very helpful to have that information, very helpful. But it wasn't until I really took it further and saw kind of what was happening inside of myself. And I was really able to parse it out a little more, you know, to be a response to him instead of a reaction. I once heard that there's a real differentiation between to respond to things that happen to you, sensations, whatever they are, experiences, or react. Response takes into account the other person and takes into account the full situation. Whereas reaction often has lots of ego and inus involved in it. Ah, they're rejecting me, you know, ah, you know, our last experience is going to be so unpleasant, you know, and react versus respond to the circumstance. Very often in a in a Vedna situation, there will be a lot of eyeing and mind and me, you know, me in it, you know, this person is making me upset. I'm feeling terrible about this. I'm, you know, my pain, my knee, my whatever it happens to be. So all that identification just really compounds, usually will compound the situation that's going on. So it was helpful, I would say that for sure. But the practice, I think, would make it so that I would be more philosophical about it anyway. Seven or eight years ago, I really wouldn't. I would have just thought, oh, this is just awful and probably kept that for a very, very long time. So I'm very happy with the time it took, you know, was much collapsed because it meant much less suffering for both of us. Thank you. Any other events or things that anybody else willing to talk about or any other questions? Glad to. Yes. Yeah, the proliferation of thought, thought more and more thoughts. You You know, a lot of the time it's happening. I think the more entangled you are in love with the person or in relation to the harder it is to look over, the closer you want to look. Switching now, which is sort of a compassionate threat of this person in pain. Yes. And going into that, you know, it's really down now. And I don't know how sports can be. It's really creative thought to me, my logic, that I'm just really going to relax. So it's kind of like, as I said, that whole difference between response and reaction, that responding really takes into account the whole circumstance, the other person, what they really need. So I didn't get a question from my audience about how you look back at myself and not going to anything else. It's sort of a certain way of saying, yeah, it's really good. Good. Yeah. I don't think I would have either gone back than that, taken aback if it wasn't such a special person in my life and feeling that this was just going to be a very inauthentic last time together. It just, you know, really bothered me because, but I was, you're right, in this case, I think I was doing that. I was not taking into account what was really needed in the circumstance. So that's, you know, and it would have created a lot of suffering if I had kept going down that trail. I just know it. My husband told me he stayed one more day and he told me that, you know, David really mentioned to him that he was glad that, you know, it had gone the way it had gone. Anybody else have something to, yes? I have a question. If I was only talking in my life, is it a concept that I have to use to the most effective way? This is where I used to get stuck and it's something I still haven't practiced with that much. As I told you originally, when I know I was going to be talking about some feeling, you know, I thought, oh boy, this is some place where I can really get into it until I knew that it was a much more refined concept that we were going to be teaching that we were going to be talking about tonight. But I have also experienced times when this guiding suggestion or instruction is done, like mindfulness of the body and a specific sensation of pain, where it will literally, it almost seems just evaporate when I notice it. It's stabbing or very hot or just very, very uncomfortable or maybe prickly sensations of falling asleep, the limb falling asleep or something, and thinking, boy, I wonder, you know, maybe I'll have a blood clot, all this craziness that we get. I mean, this is craziness, but I have a very fast mind. And so I confess to you that when I tell you these things, these are literally things that happen to me, I can really move along with thoughts. And so this practice is very, very dear to me to have the ability to work with these things. But often it'll just, it does just somewhat evaporate or just, you know, go away. One of the very interesting experiences I've had in meditation, I've actually occasionally had thoughts almost be like cartoon thought bubbles and they just kind of pop away and just one by one, they just go away. And that hasn't happened very often, but it has happened a few times where they literally just dissolve into the nothingness from which they came in the first place. So that the pain, you know, as soon as you get up in 15 seconds, you're no longer ordinarily, is there really a problem here? But what you notice is how things change. So clinging to them or having an aversion to them really adds to the suffering that we have. So that's what's so important about these kinds of exercises or practices that we have is to really get into it. And as I said, originally it didn't have as much meaning to me as it has in these last few months of working with it and working with it off the cushion. As I said in the Vedna venues. Any other questions? Yes. Well, actually still to the point, it's a very simple example, but, you know, my leg fell asleep. So that's what I felt this night. Oh, just now? Oh, we're very much in silence. Oh, good. And what I learned on the lesson was two things was how much projection I put into that and perhaps my meaning is an error because I knew it was pain. Well, the sensation that was actually happening wasn't pain. I was projecting into the future that what might happen or what might help. Yeah. Yeah. So it wasn't pain itself. It was more like aversion and like just really were you making more and more out of it? Is that what you're saying? Yeah. Interesting. So you refined the thought, the feeling that was happening. Well, in the process, I realized, well, actually, there's not a need for it. I don't know. I was in a couple of minutes, but I can't help making that new story. Yes. The story train is really, it can be very useful to see that train take off. You know, and pretty soon, you know, you're in Tahiti, you know, with this phantom lover or whatever happens to be. You just really keep going. What if your story wasn't blood clotting? It's nerve-caving. What? I have sort of full calves and, you know, legs that mine would be blood clot. That's where I kind of go with it. But good grief. Yeah. It's amazing. Remember the Woody Allen episode where he was, he had to get on the phone with a doctor or something. And there was some, I don't know, some diagnosed. I forget what it was, but he just, it was a perfect rendition, Hollywood rendition of this diagnosis he got about his health or something. So it's really very, very interesting to watch that and see where the suffering is coming from or the aversion or the clinging. Because there's also good. Don't ever forget that one because that has just as much of an allure, but also just as much potential suffering because when it goes away, the good feeling or whatever, there's suffering in that as well. So as, oh, this was a really interesting teaching. Just a moment here. Ah, pleasant, pleasant feeling is pleasant when it persists and painful when it changes. So as I said, you know, oh, it's pleasant. This is wonderful. But when it changes, it changes into obviously painful. Painful feeling is painful when it persists. Doesn't change. Right. And pleasant when it changes. So it's like the converse, you know, it's no matter which way you go. This ever changing this of sensations and of feelings. If we get married to them, not only are we whipsawed back and forth versus, you know, in a calm centered place, but also there's plenty of suffering there. And then last, what is pleasant and what is painful in regard excuse me. What is pleasant? What is painful in regard to neither. Pleasant nor unpleasant feelings, pleasant feeling is pleasant when you persist and painful and it changes painful as painful in a persistent pleasant when it changes. What is painful nor unpleasant, nor pleasant. No, a pleasant feeling is pleasant when there is knowledge of it and painful when there is no knowledge of it. So if we're like oblivious and we're just getting all carried away by something and it didn't have one way or the other, either pleasant or unpleasant, the ignorance or the obliviousness of it is also very, it can end up being painful going forward. So in either case, not being aware of it. And it's not to say we don't sense things fully. It's very important to sense things fully and to really know what is happening for us and not to reject it or deny it. But we have a tendency to become ruled by it if we're not aware of where it's going, where it is right now and how it is changing and get too attached or too clinging about the pleasant ones or aversive about the unpleasant ones. Any other, thank you very much for talking about that because I think you really got down into yet another level of it, which is great. Anybody else have something you'd like to say about the exercise? Yes. I wanted to tell you about the pleasantness of it. Oh good, please. I'm going to have to eat my space. I'm going to find a way to, you know, possibly eat it kind of first. But I was really trying to find where there was the pleasantness of it. So I'm going to hand over my body. I was really trying to find where there was the pleasantness. And I was just kind of, hand over my body. And I was like, where is the pleasantness? And I was really going to investigate because I had a feeling that there was going to be a pleasantness that was not going to happen. But there were things that I was, I had the expectation that I was going to notice that there was a certain part of it that was pleasantness and that I was going to that part over and over again. But what I actually noticed when I looked at it, I was kind of thinking about where there was the pleasantness of it. And I was just kind of thinking about where there was the pleasantness of it. And I was just kind of thinking about where there was the pleasantness of it. And I was just kind of thinking about where there was the pleasantness of it. And I was just kind of thinking about where there was the pleasantness of it. And I was just kind of thinking about where there was the pleasantness of it.

And I was kind of thinking about where there was the pleasantness of it. And I was kind of thinking about where there was the pleasantness of it. And I was kind of thinking about where there was the pleasantness of it. And I asked her, I would use a fashion counter. And she would get rid of it. And I would find a sort of precision idea that I would run away. And I was like, wow. And I was like, well, yeah, you'll be curious. And I was like, where is the pleasantness? And I was like, wow. Remember, she said she was going to start with pleasantness. But I mean, this stuff, it's just you can really. Yeah? Fascinating. That's fascinating. I wonder if there was something that could happen. Did you have something? Thank you. When you get involved in the story, when I get involved in the reason I had an experience where I thought what happened was supposed to be evil. And I'm kind of backing away from that thought because I can't really know everything about it anyway. But I was wondering what the place of morality was like. And I was wondering what the place of morality is like when we're thinking about something so that you know that you're not taking action or not having no action. I'm a very good soldier. Sometimes it's like it's something that I'd rather die. I'm okay with that decision. And let somebody else make their decision and not smile. And that happens to me and I'm still involved in that story that I'm telling myself. And I'm angry about it. And would you back away from this story at that point? You know, it's going on in my head a lot. And is there something with morality involved? Are you getting involved in the story? Sometimes there certainly may be. Are you saying that you have a sense that there was something immoral in what was done here? I felt that, but I'm no very evil about my thought lines that I just started to come. So I can detach from something if a person wants to die and take too much medicine and they're really an affordable thing. You know, I can live with that experience. But in the case that I have a family, the person is much happier. And she had a treatable cancer. I think you would find that repetition of thoughts often are things that need to be attended to in one way or another. That would be the main thing I would say. I couldn't possibly really fully comment on this because I wouldn't feel appropriate in doing that. But I can say that things that seem to keep coming again and again, and if they are serious, and that does sound like a serious thing that happened, that I would say you'd want to attend to that in some way. And it's not just a story in the typical way we're saying here. Yes, it sounds more like something that you would need to attend to. That's at least how it sounds to me. Yes? I don't know how to make this useful, but it feels as though we're studying their sensation. Well, getting a lot off into mindfulness of process, it seems, rather than mindfulness of darkness, because that's the process of having that raw sensation become amplified or entangled in the story, instead of just really keeping it, oh, there's an unpleasant sensation. Oh, there's a pleasant... I mean, I'm not saying I'm successful at that because that's very developed to be able to do it, actually. Sometimes one's lucky. I noticed when you said that that I had an unpleasant feeling in my stomach, and I was just, you know, successful in saying, oh, unpleasant, unpleasant. And then I noticed that a pleasant thought replaced it just suddenly I was thinking of pleasant thought, and I feel myself getting a little... I'm not sure I'm a pleasant thought, thinking of pleasant thought. So, I mean, because processes are a different level of what kind of sensation. Yes, but there are six sense doors, and they are described in here, and it's, you know, sight, sound, smell, touch, taste, and thought. So, yeah, you could get to that level, I suppose. I wouldn't say I move toward the story before I use it. Every now and then I can just stop with just that I am thinking now. But I don't know. I think for most people it takes a while because we're so used to being in that realm of these kinds of things going on and on and on and being allowed to go on and on and on that I find myself, at least for me, moving toward the story and finding the cessation point with the story and then kind of learning about it and pondering it and learning if there is something to learn about it, if it's repetitive. That's, as I said to me, that's an important thing to learn about. And for me, you know, it's kind of this... There are certain repetitive things that happen, and sort of being rejected or not being, you know, feeling close or something, that's something that I can get into very quickly. But it is possible, I'm sure, that you could just stick with the bare noting and just thought. You know, pleasant, unpleasant. That's true. That is absolutely true. And I think that as you move along, that's probably exactly where it goes. At least that's what I read. I didn't read some of the other things because it gets very deep about Jhana's and the concentrations and the types of very deep concentrations that will happen that replace some of this, you know, unproductive sensation. So it goes into that in the sutta. But I thought that was a bit much for tonight because we're being very introductory here, I think, for this session, this series, rather. Any other questions or stories or interesting observations? Yes. I wanted to follow up on that. So a great example last week was the kind of sound happens, what's the base sensation? And it's actually just vibration. So the sensing, if you include thought as one of the senses, then you sense the thought happening, and you don't attach any downy word or meaning to it. It's just, oh, this is thought. Okay, great. You might have that level of base sensing. Yes, that absolutely can. I'm sure of that. I just don't have that happen too often in my own personal practice, but I know that's something where it can go. And it does happen sometimes for me, but often I'm on another, you know, I go further than that. And the value to that, if I may, is that it's by, especially with thought, is by stepping aside from it, there's, I become more oblivious to that. And I think it's a good thought to me. Well, if you can kind of diminish the eyeing in the mind, which is kind of what you're talking about here, and which I know Louis is talking about as well, this is my thought, this is my emotion that he's stopping, this is my, you know, whatever it happens to be, my peace of mind or whatever it is, then all that identification, it also has a tendency to puff up a self or an identification with a self. And that's where the suffering comes from, no doubt about it. Yes, you have? I think I appreciate the confession of thought, but as I understand the purpose was to practice, to try to follow peace or virtue, place you can hug or feel and can rest. I would like to know if there's any, so for your case, you can enhance, that's what you're creating and your self here. I'm not just a student, I just want to know if there's any place or anything we can make us more aware, conscious, something can happen instead of going on, like turn off the chatterbox. Yes. I'm just curious, if any good solutions or, we have practice names, also you mentioned that there's those kind of feelings of pleasant, unpleasant, or if you just identify them or mark them in just that one way of saying pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, that can, and you can stop there, that would be ideal. That would be an ideal thing to have happen, and it is possible, and I have done it, but I don't do it every time, and I don't, I think it's my responsibility to tell you where I am right now, because I think there's a lot of other people in this room who are where I am right now, and I wouldn't want to in any way indicate that it's different, but it does happen for me, and it happens more now that I really understand more about what this really is. It's not just a concept anymore, it's really real to me now that I've been practicing with it more, just period, not more, but just practicing with it, and it's not something, the only place I had heard this gone to before I did this research and study, and personal experience with it, was the idea of feel where it is in your body, just feel where, that's the main thing I ever heard about feelings and the raw sensation of feeling, but I never quite got how this pleasant, unpleasant neutral could be so useful, you know, to kind of stop going to that next level of fabricating all kinds of clinging and suffering and other things with it, so I may be a slow learner, I don't know, but that is the fact for me, and that's how I've experienced the practice so far, and I'm very grateful, and I think this has been kind of a jump start to it, to be involved with this, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to tell you my experience with it so far. Yes? I think that the meaning of the practice is really the knowledge of raw states, the raw states of sounds, sensations and feelings, I think for this next sort of practice, you gain freedom by not identifying with either a thought, just being at power, feeling, feeling, sensation or a sound, as you practice it out and it becomes deeper, the basis of having knowledge, of being aware of everything that's happening, and not being, not taking the same down to gain freedom, not feeling shown, but being from the center, to the center because you tend to know that sound is just sound, knowledge is just sound, sensation is sensation, and none of it is everything that's going to happen. That whole self-identification, right, that's where the suffering comes from. I might need to refuse to discuss that fact because through lenses, how dominant will see from a clear perspective what is that wave going on? The more you just, I think, note it and identify it and see if you can stop it at that point before getting into a whole identification with it, and a whole, as he said, like an embroilment with it as being me, you know, my pain, my difficulty, whatever it happens to be. At this point I'd just like to give you a few ideas of places that could be VEDNA menus for you because a couple of them came to my mind. And I've talked a little bit about it, but one of them is definitely a car. And the good thing I think about a car is, and I've been working on this one, a car is a place where, first of all, you know where you are, it's a confined space and there's an activity connected with it, and it's one that's somewhat, it is somewhat controllable, and it's just you, preferably when you're driving alone, I think. So you get in the car and you just watch, of course you have to be driving, you know, and be careful in terms of your driving as you're doing this, but I've noted that they come really fast and furiously, the feelings of pleasant when, my commute is from Highway 92 in San Mateo to El Monte on Highway 280. And I can just tell you, boy, there's days when that road is just as clear as can be, and I am as happy as a clam, you know, I'm just driving down 280, so happy. And then all of a sudden, things stop around Sand Hill and I'll get into kind of an aversion thing, or geez, I've got to get to work now, or whatever it is. So somebody cuts you off, and it's always a BMW in my world, I'll tell you. It's like, what are these people in these BMWs anyway, these IPO people, you know, just getting off, just rolling along with, and pardon me if you're a BMW, and I'm just kind of telling you that it's always a BMW. So, and then on goes the story from there. But I think a vehicle has a real VEDNA possibilities, and the whole driving experience, as I said, don't get off on it too much, because I think it could actually be safer to travel if you're consciously aware of the VEDNA that's coming to you, versus trying to do something about somebody cutting you off, it's just, oh, in a hurry, you know, speed, whatever, cut off, just quickly, just let it go and keep paying attention to your driving. But it is some place where it can happen a lot, and as it's a confined place, a confined space, I think it's an opportunity. Another one is, as I said, on the cushion, I could just tell you that my husband and I, he's the manager of Saturdays, like the all days that we have here, and there's really very great value in sustained practice for an entire day. Very great value to that, so that if you come at 830 some days, and sometimes it starts at 9, this week it'll start at 9, but to go from 9 to 430, or from 830 to 5, whatever, and really have a sustained time that you give yourself and your practice to note these things, note the VEDNA, note the pleasant, unpleasant, neutral things as they come. And I just know, like, Monday this place is packed, Sunday this place is packed, and on the all days, you know, this would be almost packed about this many people. So it's a wonderful offering that we have here at the center, is to spend a whole day, or if you can't do the whole day, do a half a day, because the cushion can be a really wonderful place for practicing with your VEDNA. And then, when you get to me, it would take quite a bit of evolution, but I have worked with it, certainly. Our close relationships are a real place to see our VEDNA, a real place to see it, and there's a real privilege in that, to note, I have just started over the last three or four months, just telling my husband, this is going nowhere, let's stop now, when I feel that it's going to go into something that this is going to be. There will not be anything positive, I just know it, and he's gotten to realize, yep, that it's going to be one of those things, you know, that we just can get into a pattern back and forth and become very unpleasant. But just to note it and see it right then and there, and as soon as possible, to keep from eyeing and mowing and just let it alone, just stop, because it just plain isn't worth it very often times. But it can also be a place of, you know, either neutral, that everything is just kind of cruising along, or a place of great joy. But the real joy is when we're not in an attached place, as you know, because, as the Buddha has said, you know, it comes from, it's always changing. So this knowledge of this change and the reality and the acceptance for the fact that it's always changing, and so therefore getting attached to either circumstance is going to create a lot of suffering. So I really appreciate your engagement in this evening's talk, and I'm hopeful that it was useful for you, and I'm grateful for the opportunity of working together on it. Thank you.
