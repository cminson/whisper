Got it.
Great.
So welcome.
Hello and formally welcome to Happy Hour, dear Sangha.
Lovely to see you.
This is your first time as for some of you here.
Yay, welcome.
And if you're a regular Happy Hour participant, yay, welcome.
Lovely to be with you and practice together in this moment in time.
So for our practice this, in this moment in time, whatever times on your end,
I'd like to build on a practice we did on Wednesday.
And if you think, oh, wait, I wasn't here on Wednesday.
Don't worry, everything you need, I'll share with you.
No problem.
And also to say this practice we've done before in other ways,
I just want to relate to it in a different way.
So let me set the context as I always do in a few minutes and then start the guided meditation.
So the practice I'd like to invite us to explore is a merging,
a combination of compassion, Karuna, the second Brahma Vihara,
the second heavenly abode together with mindfulness of the breath,
also known as anapanasati, if that term makes sense to you.
So mindfulness of the breath and compassion combined.
And the reason why I'm saying it's building up on what we did on Wednesday,
because Wednesday, for those of you who might remember,
we explored metta, loving kindness, and the breath.
Just the sense of the breath being very easeful, the mindfulness of the breath,
the breath being infused with kindness, with ease,
as if you were petting a kitty and it would start purring in the sense of calm and ease.
And many of you observed that, oh yeah, what a lovely combination of these two practices,
metta, loving kindness, in fact, for ourselves, for our bodies,
that's what we did on Wednesday, together with the breath.
So related to that, today we'll explore compassion practice,
compassion when metta, when kindness means suffering,
when challenges are held by love, kindness, care,
and combining that together with the breath, right?
So, and today what we'll do is we can start with ourselves
and then we'll turn it outwards, we'll turn it outwards
to both have a sense of nourishment of compassion for this being who is ourselves,
as well as turning it outwards, compassion for the world as we breathe in and out,
especially because right now there's a lot of turmoil in our world
and there are many beings who are suffering right now and in a war zone,
so not to turn ourselves away, our gaze away,
but to sit with, to make space with compassion, with care and stability,
not to fall into it, not to fall into grief and despair,
but to hold witness, hold presence with compassion, with love, with care
for what is happening in our world, okay?
The last word I'm going to say about framing the practice tonight is
compassion practice plus mindfulness of the breath
is also what we have explored before in light of, some of you might remember,
Tong Leng, the practice of Tong Leng.
And yes, in the later schools of Buddhism, not so much in Theravada,
but in later schools, especially in Tibetan, it's a primary practice
and we've practiced that before, compassion and the breath.
It's a beautiful practice.
Many of you have shared that it's been nourishing to you.
So this is another way to enter into the same practice.
I didn't mention Tong Leng at the beginning, I mentioned at the end,
so that you realize, oh, there are other ways to get into this practice,
on upon ascetic mindfulness of the breath, plus compassion.
Enough theory, let go of theory.
Okay, I've set the frame, let it all go.
Let go of the thinking mind.
So now I'd like to invite you to sit, enter, enter the sacred space of practice
together, letting go of thoughts, letting go of words.
If you need to move and shift, so that you are comfortable,
whether you're sitting in a chair, on a cushion,
whether you're lying in the bed, it's all okay.
And arriving, first and foremost, we always arrive in the body,
letting go of thoughts, of memories, of plans.
Taking refuge, I am here, this moment of this precious life here now,
right here, right now, in this body.
Releasing, relaxing.
Letting the animal of your body to just be.
To just breathe. You don't have to be in a particular way.
You don't have to be impressive, or great, or grand, or smart, nothing, just.
Ah, let go, let go, release, release.
Oh, dear heart, dear heart, release, it's okay.
Your body, your heart, your mind can just be, can just be breathed.
In breath, and out breath.
In breath, and out breath.
And as the breath enters your body, for the purpose of this practice,
can we imagine, can we imagine that it's entering,
being breathed in and breathed out from the center of our chest.
The heart center, proverbial heart center.
And with each breath, ah, more kindness is breathed into the body.
Each out breath will let go.
Maybe with each in breath, we become more, become aware.
The body, if there are any challenges, pain, tightness, and with the out breath.
Ah, there is goodness, ease, love, care, breathed out.
Onto these challenges, onto whatever is ailing us in this moment, in our heart or mind.
Practice some self-compassion with each breath.
Thank you.
And with challenging thoughts arising, the in breath, noticing with brightness,
oh, this is challenging, sweetheart, this is hard.
With the out breath flowing out of the heart center, ah, releasing, releasing,
and bringing, breathing out goodness and ease.
Onto yourself, onto the thoughts.
Every out breath, releasing of goodness, care, love.
With each in breath, recognizing this moment, especially if there are challenges.
The body, mind, and heart, and in the out breath, letting the love, the care wash over the difficulties.
Hence it becomes a practice of compassion.
Challenges met with care, with love, with warm heartedness.
It doesn't have to be any different in this moment.
You can meet, we can meet this moment with love, with care, with ease for ourselves.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Remember thoughts arising, it's okay.
You can release, we can release with kindness, with care, without judgment.
Turning the gaze inward.
Are there any areas of the body that are achy, or tired, or tense?
The neck, shoulders, the usual areas.
The jaw, the forehead, the eyes, maybe the lower back.
If you are breathing in, breathing in the challenges, collecting the challenges, the tightness, the pain of the body.
Being collected or being observed through your breath, collected in your heart center where the breath is breathed in, transformed, transformed into a healing light and breathed out to the whole body.
Challenges, difficulty, breathed into the heart center, heart center.
This amazing space of transformation, transfiguration.
Challenges breathed in, transformed.
The holy fire and the bright light, they become, they become goodness, love, healing, energy and breathed out.
Breathed out through the heart center, through the whole body, wherever is aching, tired, either literally achy, or figuratively aching, even if it's your heart that's aching right now.
Breathing in, the challenges breathed in on their own.
The goodness, ah, sucker, healing light, breathed out, ah, covering the whole body.
Breathing in, breathing out.
Gleaning into their breathing out, releasing, releasing, ah, the tail end of the breath, ah, the tail end of the out breath.
Release, relax, ease, goodness, healing, here.
You
You
And this orb of light, this holy fire in the heart center, transforming, transformative, transforming challenges, sorrow, pain, into goodness, into love, the path through love.
Suffering as a path to love.
This bright, bright, healing light, the heart center is both yours and not yours.
It transforms, it heals. Just holding witness with the breath. Don't let it become effortful.
You
Let ease be your guide.
You
You
There have been any challenges today or right now arising. Let them be breathed in.
Let them be breathed in to the heart center, transformed into healing light, and breathed out throughout the body.
Let them be breathed in to the heart center, transformed into healing light, and breathed out throughout the body.
Thank you for watching.
You
You
You
The outbreath, the outbreath, bringing healing, love, care.
Ah, releasing, releasing, holding. As if wrapping this body in a blanket of meta, love, compassion with the outbreath.
There, there, sweetheart.
Now I'd like to invite us to expand our blanket.
As Ryokan says, Ryokan, respected Zen monk, oh, if only my monk's robes were wide enough to hold, to protect, to cover all the suffering beings in this entire world.
Expanding our blanket.
As we have stability and care for ourselves.
May this being have ease, this being who is me.
May she, he, they, me, may I have ease.
May all beings everywhere have ease, be free from their sorrow.
And just as with the practice of our breath, challenges are being breathed into the heart center, this magnificent, beautiful, bright, holy fire transforming suffering into bright light of love and healing and goodwill.
So too, challenges, difficulty, pain can be breathed in. It's not ours.
This heart center is not ours. It is ours and not ours. It's bigger than ours, greater than who we imagine ourselves to be.
Greater humanity, access to this amazing possibility of universal compassion.
This heart center of ours has to trust, to trust. Just holding witness without tightening our body or our mind.
Ah, challenges, difficulty, sorrow is breathed in and witnessing it be transformed. Wow!
I didn't know my heart could do this. Wow! Transformed into love, goodwill, healing wishes for the entire world and breathed out.
Shared with the entire world.
May all those beings who are living without safety and war, may they have ease.
My breath, with each breath, I hold witness and share my goodwill, personal and universal goodness for you, dear sisters and brothers, dear siblings, and common humanity.
May you have ease. May all of us have ease.
Breathing in, breathing out.
Breathing out, kind kindness to the entire world.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And for the last moments of this practice period, letting our hearts shine, letting it shine, trusting in the goodness of our heart, the goodwill for ourselves and others.
Don't get in the way, let it shine. It's empowering, it's powerful to just be humbled for a moment, move aside, let your ego move aside and be humbled by the capacity to care.
The capacity to love, the capacity of goodwill beyond our imagination for ourselves, all and all beings everywhere.
May all beings be free from sorrow and suffering, may they be safe, may they have well-being, may they be free.
Thank you so much for your practice, everyone.
So we have time for reflections.
You can type them in chat if you wish, if you type them privately to me, I won't read your name.
You type them to everyone, I will read your reflection and your name.

Bill says, warm and comforting. Thank you, Nikki. You are welcome, Bill.
Reflections, this one private, Nikki, your voice after a long day, so soft, so relaxing, zeezy, zeezy, zeezy. I'm putting you to sleep, you are so welcome.
