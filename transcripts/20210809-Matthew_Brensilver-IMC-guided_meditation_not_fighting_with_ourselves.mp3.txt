 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome folks. Welcome all. Sweet to see the comments here. Yeah, my name is Matthew Brent Silver and one of the teachers at IMC and happy to be with you. Quite happy. And, you know, I was don't want to feel like I'm crashing a little family party, the family, you know, 7am sit, gills 7am sit. But thanks for the warm welcomes and happy to see a lot of familiar names. So, yeah, I'll follow the custom around these parts and we will sit together for about half hour. And then I'll offer some some reflections on a theme this week. And, yeah. Yeah, so I know Gil left off with three weeks on on greed hate delusion and and freedom from non delusion from from delusion was the Friday talk and theme and yeah and this week I'll be exploring the theme of equanimity equanimity woven into really the fabric of our of our practice and so much of the goodness that unfolds. And so as we as we sit, we'll practice the way one of my teachers positions and young is we'll practice sort of the non non interference with the arising of sensory experience. Yeah, the nervous system not fighting with itself. And, you know, we can actually get a feel for that what it is like to not be in contention with ourselves not be in contention with experience to give a kind of radical permission for phenomena to to arise. And pass to give it our blessing. So, yeah, finding a posture that is sustainable for you. Just feeling that upright access with the spine and the rest of the body hanging loosely upward reaching spine and the rest of the body. And remember this crucial aspiration of our practice we practice for ourselves and for others. We cultivate our own heart, such that we become a cause of more joy and more safety, suffering in the world. Thank you. Thank you. The attitude we take the attitude in line with this theme of equanimity is a kind of deep nonviolence towards the whole of our experience. Thank you. Thank you. Wherever it feels like two solid objects colliding the solidity of some ache and the solidity of a contracted mind wherever it feels like a collision we soften awareness like space. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We can't get what greed wants. We can't get what hatred wants. We renounce the objects of clinging. We make peace with the imperfection, the human condition. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The forces of grasping have been a source of agitation forever, a source of inner friction, friction in our own nervous system. So we give up the fight, at least for this moment. Relax the body, relax the mind. Relax the mind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And even though equanimity is known for its coolness, it actually deepens the poignancy of life. Makes our heart more, rather than less, responsive to suffering, more rather than less responsive to joy, more attuned, not less. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
