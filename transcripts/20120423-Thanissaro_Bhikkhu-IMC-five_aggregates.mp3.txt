The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Tonight's talk is going to be on the aggregates.
So, dig in.
When you read the Buddha's description of the First Noble Truth,
he talks about the various forms of stress or suffering.
He starts out with things that we're familiar with, birth, illness, death,
not getting what you want, having to live with people you don't like,
not getting to live with people you do like.
And then he summarizes, everybody says suffering comes down to five klingey aggregates.
That's where it gets technical.
Of course, the question is, what are these aggregates?
Why would he analyze things in terms of those five categories?
The word aggregate in Pali, kunda, can mean category.
It can mean pile.
It can mean heap or mass.
In the Buddha lists five particular things that he lists as masses or heaps or aggregates.
There's form, which is any physical phenomenon.
Particularly, it's the form of your body as you feel it from within.
There's earth, which is the solidity.
Water, liquid, properties in the body that fires the warmth.
Breath is the energy.
But it also refers to just any physical thing you see or can touch.
That's the first category, form or rupa.
The second one is weight and feeling tone.
The feeling tone of pleasure or pain, neither pleasure nor pain.
The third one is perception or sannyā, which is perception in the sense that when you see something, you perceive it as something.
You look at the wall and you say, wall.
You look at the light and you say, light.
That kind of perception.
In other words, where you're putting a label on something.
The fourth one is sankhāra, which I translate as fabrication.
Sometimes you see it translated as formations.
It's the intentional part of the mind.
It's where you come up with ideas about what you want about something or take your experience and you put it in a shape that you want to put it in.
Then finally there's vinyāna or consciousness, which the Buddha classifies as a kind of activity.
It's an active principle.
But all of these are activities.
He defines form as the process of decaying.
Weight in our feeling is the activity of feeling, perception is the activity of perceiving, and so on down the line.
So it's not things.
We're not dealing with little bits of gravel or aggregates here.
We're actually talking about activities primarily of the mind.
And there's an intentional element in all of these things.
If fabrication underlies everything else, our experience has the potential to have form or feeling or perceptions,
fabrications or consciousness.
And there's part of the mind that wants these things and fabricates them into being.
You take the potential and you actualize it.
Now the question is, where did the Buddha get this list?
It seems pretty arbitrary, a way of analyzing your experience into these five categories.
Form, feeling, perception, fabrications and consciousness.
Because there are lots of other ways you could analyze your mind or the activities of the mind.
And tonight I'd like to talk about what I think is the underlying activity that the Buddha is talking about.
Because the way we understand our mind usually refers to an activity that we engage in very often and we're used to it.
And we tend to observe our mind as it's engaged in that activity, and that's how we understand it.
I'll give you another example from Western philosophy, which is Cicero, the famous orator.
Had a theory about human psychology has basically three functions.
There's attention and there's will and there's memory.
Now the reason he analyzed psychology into these three functions was because he was an orator and he was trying to influence people.
And he said the best way to influence people is one, get their attention.
And then two, try to make them remember things that you agree on or principles that you want them to think about
and you're going to try to persuade them, in other words in order to get them to will, what you want to will.
And so for an orator, like tonight I want you to remember certain things and I want you to pay attention
and I want you to come out of here with a certain idea in your mind.
In Cicero's case though he was more emphasis on getting people persuaded because after all he was a lawyer.
And that's what he was, that's his main activity and so he would observe human psychology as a lawyer would observe human psychology.
What can you draw on like in the jury's memory about what they believe in, what they think is right, what they think is wrong?
And then direct their attention to what you want them to pay attention to so you get a particular outcome,
i.e. you want your client either, either you want your client declared not guilty or you're the prosecutor and you want them to be found guilty.
In other words you've got an aim in mind.
So for a lawyer those would be the three functions of human psychology.
This is a particularly interesting list for me because you find it cropping up in lots of other places as well.
In the Middle Ages they took over Cicero's ideas and they basically said well this is how the human mind works
and when they tried to explain the trinity they would pull out these three functions.
Just as the human mind has three functions, God has three functions, you know.
But more relevant to our discussion tonight is I was reading a concert pianist one time, his name was Alfred Brandell,
he may know him, he came to the States a couple years back for his farewell concert tour and he was giving an interview
and I was reading his interview and he was talking about the psychology of being a playing the piano.
And he says basically there are three functions that you have to engage in while you're playing the piano.
One is you have to hold in mind an idea of what you want the piece to look like, how you want it to sound.
And then you have to pay attention to how you're playing and then based on what you hear yourself playing
and what you want out of the piece then you have to decide how you're going to play the next note
or the next chord or the next passage, the next phrase.
And he talked about, again, memory, attention, will as the three functions.
In this case it has to do with the skill that you develop as you're trying to monitor your playing while you're playing.
In other words, this is how you listen to yourself play so that you become a better pianist.
Closer to home we find it also in the Buddhist descriptions of how you practice mindfulness.
There are three qualities he says that you bring to the practice of mindfulness.
There's ardency, alertness and mindfulness.
And mindfulness you may remember means keeping something in mind.
Alertness is when you're paying attention to the present moment.
And ardency is when you're actually trying to do something.
In this case you're trying to get the mind to settle down.
You're trying to get the mind to stay with a breath.
You're trying to get it to do whatever you plan, whatever you want out of it.
I think it's interesting that you can look at the way you meditate in terms of these three qualities.
Ardency, alertness, mindfulness.
Either you are a lawyer trying to persuade yourself to settle down with a breath.
And you're giving yourself reasons as to why you want to stay there.
You're trying to capture your attention.
This is something you really want to pay attention to, this breath coming in and going out.
And you remember the various things you've learned about why you want to stay with a breath
and also techniques you've learned in the past for how you can stay with a breath.
And then you try to do it ardently.
In other words, you really try to do it as skillfully as possible so you actually can get the mind to settle down.
Or instead of looking at your mind as a lawyer while you're meditating,
you can look at it as an expert pianist.
You're looking at your breath right now.
How has it been going?
What do you need to change so you can push the meditation in the direction where you want it to go?
So those are one way of looking at the mind based on certain activities.
If you're a lawyer, you tend to look at human psychology in those three terms.
If you're a skilled artist or a skilled pianist or any kind of musician,
you also tend to look at the mind in those three terms.
So the question is, when the Buddha is talking about the aggregates, what is he looking at?
What activity is he sort of analyzing and saying,
this is a natural way of seeing how the mind works?
And I think the activity he's referring to is the activity of feeding.
The image of feeding is really, really basic in the Buddha's teachings.
In fact, all of Indian thought after the Buddha's time was basically on
how are you going to feed yourself after death?
They believe that in order to live as a being, you have to feed and the question came,
well, if you're going to be reborn, how are you going to feed there?
How are you going to provide that food?
And there's a lot of analysis.
You look at the Upanishads and you look at the other literature that developed around them.
And there's a lot of concern about how you're going to feed,
because beings have to feed.
How do you ensure that you're going to have a good, long supply of food up there if you go to heaven?
Because otherwise you're going to fall back down again.
And they have various ideas about what was happening to you.
My favorite one is the one that basically their idea was,
one of the Upanishads says that heaven is actually in the moon,
and the devas are up there feeding on the moon,
and you think immediately that the moon is blue cheese, right?
And this is why the moon looks so kind of modeled,
because, you know, devas have been eating it.
But your right to feed up there depends on the merit from the sacrifice that the Brahmins did.
You can see where this is coming from.
And the idea being that if once you ran out of merit,
then you have to come back down again.
And the question is how do you come back down from the moon?
They say you come back down as rain,
and then as rain you feed a plant,
and then the plant feeds an animal,
and then you're going to get reborn as that kind of animal,
which means if you're lucky you get to be eaten by a human being,
and then you get to go through the cycle again.
But there's a lot of speculation in the Buddhist,
prior to the Buddha, about feeding as the primary human activity.
And the Buddha picked that up, and he said,
this is really good analogy for what the mind is doing,
how we identify ourselves.
We're not only what we eat, we're also how we eat.
He talks about the very first question that was asked in Navas.
There's a series of questions.
What is one? What is two? What is three? What is four? Up to ten.
And the most interesting of the group,
I mean three is the three kinds of feeling,
four is the four, and well, two is five, is the five aggregates.
The most interesting one, of course, is what is one.
He's not talking about oneness as a universal principle.
He says all beings subsist on food.
Everybody has to eat.
In fact, that's what it is to be a being.
You have to eat.
He identifies your identity of yourself
as feeding on or latching on to or clinging to these five aggregates.
That's how you define yourself.
Once you've defined yourself, you have to sustain that identity.
And you sustain the identity by feeding,
not only physically, but also emotionally.
We take a lot of emotional feeding from one another.
We'll talk about this in a minute.
And you've stopped and think about, well, what do you do when you eat?
On the one hand, you've got this body that you identify,
and that's your form.
You've also got potential foods out there,
all these different things that you could eat,
that you could put in your mouth.
And you're driven to do this because, on the one hand,
there is the feeling of hunger that you have,
and also the feeling of pleasure that comes when you satisfy that hunger.
So it's the feeling there, which is driving this need to feed,
or your felt need to feed.
Then there's a question of recognizing what you can eat and what you can't eat.
This is where sannyā or perception comes in.
There's little children, you've seen them,
if you've had a child crawling across the floor
and sticking all kinds of dangerous things in their mouths.
And after a while, they have to learn what you can eat, what you can't eat.
And this is an important part of growing up as a human being,
is recognizing what's food and what's not food,
first physically and then also emotionally.
The fourth part is fabrication.
A lot of food cannot be eaten just as it is.
If you took a raw egg and just stuck it in your mouth whole, you'd gag.
You have to learn that you have to fix your food.
You have to fabricate it.
You have to fix it in certain ways.
You have to cook it. You have to chop it.
You have to do all these various things to make it edible, make it enjoyable.
And then finally there's consciousness,
which is your awareness of all these things that's kind of guiding the process.
So those are the five aggregates as parts of the process of feeding.
And I think it's useful to think of them in this term because it gives you an intuitive sense
of what the Buddha is talking about.
You've got the body that needs to be fed.
You've also got these things out there that you're going to feed on, forms.
There's the feeling of hunger that's driving you,
so you can get the feeling of pleasure that comes when you're full.
There's the perception, this is something I can eat, this is something I can't eat.
This is edible, this is not edible.
If you find something that's not quite ready to go in your mouth, how are you going to fix it?
And you start fabricating thoughts about them.
And that's not the only fabrication you do around eating.
If you're going out for a meal after this talk tonight,
you've probably thought about where you want to go, what kind of food you want,
and how good it's going to taste.
You're already fabricating.
And they say, no, I don't like that, I'm going to fix with this.
And there's a lot of fabrication that goes on in the mind around what you want.
You have to identify, back up to the perception a bit,
it's not only identifying what's food out there, but also identifying the need in here.
You have a sense, okay, are you thirsty? Are you hungry?
Do you want something salty? Do you want something sweet?
That's something you have to perceive.
You have to be able to label these needs, identify them.
Then you fabricate the food in order to meet that felt and perceive need.
And then your consciousness is what's basically looking at all these things.
So this is how we, because as a being, our main activity is to feed.
This is what the Buddha is talking about when he's talking about the aggregates.
We suffer because we cling to the aggregates.
Not only do we use them to feed, we also feed off of them.
As I gave you the case just now with the fabrication, you're thinking about the meal.
You can think about a meal for several hours.
You cannot eat the meal for several hours.
The same thing with a lot of the other sensual pleasures that we go for.
Sometimes they're really quick.
But you can figure out all kinds of ways of elaborating in your mind beforehand
and then, of course, of reviewing it afterwards.
This is that there's a lot of activity defining ourselves around us.
We really latch on to this kind of activity.
The Buddha said, we cling to these aggregates.
The word for clinging actually is another word for feeding.
He talks about that he uses analogies not only for the way we feed on physical food,
but also the way a seed feeds on soil to gain its nutrients from the soil,
pulls its nutrients out of the soil so it can create a plant,
and then also the way a fire feeds on fuel.
These are some of the governing images in the Buddha's teaching.
I think it's useful to think about the various ways we feed emotionally as well,
not just on physical food.
We take the same analysis and think about a relationship.
Parents feed on their children, children feed on their parents.
It starts out, of course, literally.
The child is feeding on the mother when the child is in her womb,
and then it continues feeding off of her milk.
But it continues.
There's the sense that you recognize your parents.
These are the people.
This is what they look like.
These are the ones I can run to for safety.
These are the ones I can run to for protection.
Parents are going to feed me, give me nourishment emotionally and physically.
And then, of course, there's the feeling the child has when the parents are far away,
and then this feeling with the parents,
the felt lack when the parents are gone,
the felt pleasure when the parents are there,
recognizing the parents,
recognizing what the parents can do for you,
and then manipulating the parents.
This is the fabrication part.
It starts with crying, and then it gets more subtle.
And then, of course, there's the consciousness.
The consciousness is the activity which is trying to govern all these things
that so the child can survive.
You can look at the way the parents feed off the children the same way.
You recognize the children have this way of looking really cute,
so you allow them to feed off you.
You recognize, of course, as your child,
you're extremely attached to the child, the child's appearance,
the feelings you have around the child,
the recognition you have of what the child has done for you,
what you think the child can do for you in the future,
the way you manipulate the child as well.
All this, there's kind of an emotional feeding that goes on.
And we feed not only on that,
you could look at any addiction you have in the same terms.
There's something really fixated, I need this,
because you've associated a particular feeling with that,
you perceive that as the way that you're going to overcome
that feeling of lack that you feel when it's gone,
or when you don't have that particular thing you're addicted to.
And then there's all the manipulation
of trying to get that particular pleasure.
My brother's an alcoholic,
and he came to the monastery once.
He had to do without it for three nights.
It was a real feat of heroism in his case.
But we drove into the town of Valley Center after picking him up,
and he picked up on something I had never picked up on,
which was where the alcohol was sold in Valley Center.
I had never really noticed.
But as we were driving in,
and we happened to drive past Fat Ivor's barbecue place,
and the first thing he asked me was,
can I borrow the monastery car tomorrow?
And I do know my brother well enough to say, no.
You're staying at the monastery until you leave three days from now.
So there is that kind of manipulation.
If there's something you're really hungry for,
you can figure out how you're going to get it.
That's the fabrication.
That's the sankara.
And of course, there's the consciousness that underlies all these things.
We can even feed off of status.
There was a commercial I saw a while back.
I think it was called the BMW Effect,
where this guy wearing a suit is coming out in the parking lot,
and he sees his BMW, and his shiver goes through him.
Just at the glance, just looking at the car,
not even getting into it, just looking at it.
Of course, it symbolizes, I can afford a BMW.
Whether you really need a BMW or not, that's another question.
But it's the form, the feeling, the perception,
the fabrication that goes around it.
This is what the Buddha is talking about,
when he talks about how we identify,
how we cling to these activities.
He says, but there's also suffering,
because feeding inherently entails suffering.
There's always that sense of lack,
and even when you fill up the lack for time being,
there's always something permanent.
There's always going to be something lacking.
It's going to come back again,
so you have to be constantly worried about
where's the next meal coming from,
physically, emotionally, whatever.
I like to camp.
One of the restrictions on you as a camper
is how much food you can carry.
You think about what it would be like
if you could camp without having to eat.
You'd be a lot freer.
The fact that we have to feed places a huge burden on us.
I mean, most of your jobs, I'm sure.
If you didn't have to eat,
you wouldn't put up with that crap.
But the fact that you need to feed on these things,
the various things that you define as
the things that you need to feed,
or how you need to feed,
that's what keeps you punching in the time clock.
And so there's a lot of suffering
that goes into this need to feed,
and this is what the Buddha is talking about.
When he talks about the five aggregates are suffering.
They're stressful.
And so what's his solution?
He doesn't start out by telling you not to feed.
You can't just starve yourself,
because that's not going to solve anything.
Basically, he gives you better feeding habits.
Particularly, he teaches you the old path,
which is a form of fabrication.
It's also food for the mind.
When the Buddha talks about the various factors of the path,
the one that he talks about as food
is the fact of right concentration.
The sense of well-being, the sense of rapture,
the sense of pleasure that comes
when the mind really settles down.
And then you have this immediate sense of well-being
that you can draw on.
And it turns out this is what gives you the energy
to keep going with the path.
He's got this image of a fortress on the frontier.
Mindfulness is the gatekeeper of the fortress
who knows who to let in, who not to let out,
who remembers the enemy, who's the enemy, who's the friend.
Right effort is the soldiers in the fortress.
He's got this image of your discernment
or your wisdom is the plaster wall on the fortress.
Now, the reason you need a plaster wall
is you want a wall that doesn't have any handholds or footholds.
You want a wall that basically doesn't allow the defilements
to get into the fortress.
And then the food for everybody,
the food for the soldiers, the food for the gay men,
is the four levels of jhana,
the four levels of right concentration.
You can compare us to different levels
and each level gets better and better
until the fourth jhana is honey and ghee and sugar.
They're really good stuff.
But this is the food that we eat as we practice.
But also, it's the point when the mind has been well fed.
The question comes often,
why would it be that insights you gain into the mind
when it's in concentration
would also have an effect on the mind,
give insight into the mind when it's outside of concentration.
The fact is, okay, you're basically giving the mind
a new place to feed, but you're also giving a position
where it can look at itself while it's feeding.
All these things, very clearly, and you can see the process.
And it turns out that states of right concentration
are made up of the same five aggregates.
There's the form that when you're dealing with a breath, say,
there's the form of the body.
The breath is also part of that form.
There's the feeling of pleasure, the feeling of rapture,
the feeling of equanimity that you're trying to encourage
as you stay focused in the breath.
Then there's the perception of the breath that holds you there.
And then there's the fabrication.
And when you're talking to yourself about it,
is the breath feeling good? Where can I change it?
Does this feel good? Does that feel good?
What can I do? That kind of discussion that goes on your mind,
that's the fabrication.
And even when you drop the discussion,
just staying with the breath,
there's that element of will that you're going to stay right here.
That also is fabrication.
And then finally, there's the consciousness
that is aware of all these things.
So basically, you've got those five aggregates
all concentrated in one place,
where you can watch them clearly.
And as you're getting the mind more and more into concentration,
part of the practice is to
look at the drawbacks of the mind outside of concentration.
In other words, the Buddha wants you to get
addicted to this kind of food.
So that you keep coming back,
coming back, coming back and seeing that
this is where you're finding much better pleasure
than you could outside of the concentration.
So he's basically cutting off
all of your other alternative routes
for looking for pleasure, looking for food,
focusing it here.
And then finally he wants you to say,
this still involves feeding.
And when you can finally
get rid of that attachment,
learn how to let go of the identity
that you build up around that,
that's when the mind is freed.
And it's interesting, when the Buddha is talking about
the process of freeing the mind from these various attachments,
these various clingings,
the word he uses is nibbida,
which usually translated as disenchantment.
But it also means you're sick and tired
of eating something.
It's the feeling you have when
you've gorged yourself on cheesecake
and somebody comes in and brings you another cheesecake
and you say,
and it's not hatred,
it's not that you hate it,
it's that you've had enough.
You realize, I've fed enough on this,
it's not worth it anymore.
And from that sense of nibbida
or the sense of,
I've eaten this enough.
Then there comes,
the Buddha says, then there's release.
When the mind is released,
then it goes to, it has,
it's attained something,
a well-being which is not a feeling anymore.
But there is a well-being
and then the Buddha said,
because it doesn't depend on conditions,
doesn't require that you eat anymore.
So what you're trying to do is learn
how to feed the mind in a new way,
so that you can actually give it the strength
that ultimately would find a well-being
and dimension where there's no more need
to feed and that's going to be the end of suffering.
So I think it's important
that we look at the Buddha's analysis
of the aggregates there.
Not as just a weird set of five concepts
that who knows where they came from.
But it actually relates to the way we eat.
Tomorrow when you have your breakfast,
look at the five aggregates
that you're engaged in as you're going to the cupboard.
You've got this sense of hunger.
I've got to eat right now.
What's in the hunger?
What's going to satisfy this particular hunger today?
And what am I going to have to do to fix that up?
Those are the five aggregates right there.
You can learn how to look at the other ways
in which you're feeding yourself
and see, okay, where's the stress in here?
Is this really worth the effort that goes
into this kind of feeding? Wouldn't it be better
if I could find a better way of feeding
or ultimately get so I don't have to feed at all?
This is the Buddha's message
when he's talking about the aggregates.
He wants you to look at how you eat.
Because we're not just, you know,
as I say, you are what you eat.
You are how you eat.
And it's not that he's imposing
something on you saying, this is what you are.
This is how you're defining yourself
as you're going through the day anyhow.
He wants you to see this clearly.
So you can learn how to go beyond it
so you don't have to keep on engaging
the suffering that comes back from eating
the same old way over and over and over again.
So those are some thoughts I had
about the top of the aggregates tonight.
I hope this helps clarify
why the Buddha chose those five activities
as one of the most central teachings,
one of the ways that you really have
to understand the process of suffering
and stress if you're going to go beyond it.
So that's it.
Are there any questions?
Yes.
Is there a mic? The traveling mic?
Okay.
This is not...
I'm just curious.
Is any other person...
defined
where the aggregates come from
like you just did?
Is this something that's ever mentioned
in any of the commentaries?
I just assumed that it was
one of the insights he had.
He didn't think about it
ever being a conscious decision
or a teaching tool.
Well, I think you really do have to back up
and see when the Buddha was going to teach people
he had to speak in a language that they were going to use.
I think it's important that you
teach people. He had to speak in a language
that they were going to understand.
And this was the language he was using.
Now, each of the five aggregates,
you find these individual terms
in the philosophy that preceded him.
He was the first one I know that brought them together
as that set of five.
What got me thinking in this term
was a comment made
by Mahagosananda one time.
He was saying,
the Buddha sees that everybody's eating
and made him very sad.
You start thinking about it
and you say, he was right.
There's a hand back here.
I was particularly struck by
I guess I've spent a fair amount of time
recently studying the Diamond Approach
which is very grounded in developmental psychology
and very early childhood experiences
for how we form.
It resonates a lot with what I've encountered
in my practice.
It was fascinating to hear this
connecting kind of Buddhist psychology
with that model
and I felt very excited.
I was like, wow, that's wonderful.
Do you have more thoughts or pointers
on where this could be explored?
There's a book called Paradox of Becoming
where it talks a little bit about
where we pick up some of our ideas
about who we are
and how we identify.
The topic of feeding is in a book
called Shape of Suffering.
There's a whole chapter on that topic.
As for child development,
I keep throwing it out here and there
in my writings that I haven't kept in index
of where you can find them.
We go on to access the insight
and write child.
Put child in the search box
and see what comes up.
Thank you.
Venerable,
is the sense of fabrication
in the five aggregates
the same as fabrication
independent origination?
Not quite.
In the independent origination
you also have bodily fabrication
which is the breath.
All those have in common
this element of intention
that goes into it.
In the five aggregates it's more the metal fabrication
the way you plan things
and the way you manipulate
the committee.
I have a friend, a psychologist
down in Southern California
talking one time about how the word manipulation
has a bad rap.
There's skillful manipulation
as well as unskillful.
Part of the path
is learning how to manipulate things skillfully.
One of my favorite instances
was I have two students
an American woman, a Korean woman
and they were going to go on a trip to the Himalayas
one time.
It was going to be part of a group tour
they wanted to take a couple of days off
and do something else that was not part of the group
schedule.
The American woman called up the travel agent
and wanted to make these arrangements
and after arguing with her for about half an hour
hung up
called up the Korean woman and said
looks like the trip is off, we can't get this.
The Korean woman said
could you give me her phone number?
Five minutes later she had it.
Everything was agreed.
The American woman accused her
of manipulating the travel agent.
Questions?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you for the
image and the teaching. It's wonderful.
I'm wondering how the Brahma vaharas
fit into food.
Is it just more good food?
You gain
a sense of well-being that comes from
thinking about good will
for all beings
and also
a lot of the Brahma vaharas have to do with your motivation.
It's interesting
that many of the cases where the Buddha is talking about
spreading the Brahma vaharas are in two cases.
One, when you are being wronged
and two, when you realize
you've wronged someone else.
In the first case
he's saying basically you don't react
because a lot of us
would tend to feed on
thoughts of revenge.
I've got to get back at this person.
I've got to do this, I've got to do that.
What kind of food revenge is?
It's sweet but it's not good for you.
There's a New Yorker cartoon where two witches
are sitting over cauldron.
It's too sweet.
You put in too much revenge.
The Buddha is saying it's better
for you to feed off of good will.
I don't want to harm you.
One that you're not going to retaliate
and you find an alternative way of feeding.
The fact that I'm not retaliating
is not a sign of weakness,
it's a sign of my strength.
That gives you the strength to
not harm and return.
The same when you realize you've harmed other beings.
It's so easy to try to deny that
because you don't like to think
that thought that you've been harmful.
The Buddha is saying it's much healthier
to admit the harm but then resolve
I'm not going to do that again.
And then you spread good will to everybody including yourself.
That gives you something better
to feed on.
Just to follow up very quickly.
Is it the same
in terms of looking at the process of feeding?
Before John, as you were saying,
could also witness the five aggregates
coming together in the process.
How does that fit with
the Brahma Vihara?
The Brahma Vihara, they become useful
when they induce that kind of concentration.
Then you look at the fabrication.
Thoughts of good will are a kind of fabrication.
They recognize all beings as
objects of your good will.
That's the perception.
You can go down through and analyze
the aggregates in that act as well.
But particularly when you get the mind concentrated.
The state of the concentrated mind
is where you're actually going to see
the aggregates most clearly
in action.
I had a question. In the beginning of the talk
I thought I heard you say something about
that form is the process of decay.
That's the Buddhist definition.
It's a pun in Pali.
The word form is rupa
and decay is rupati.
I think he's playing with words there.
But form does decay.
That's how we recognize it.
I've never heard that before.
Could you just say a little bit more
about
than
that part of
not needing
to feed? That's nirvana.
That's nirvana.
There are those moments
of contentment.
It turns out that you're feeding on the contentment
at that point.
But
where you don't feel that
there's no feeling
there's no feeling
of the experience.
Meaning
it's sort of like being in the zone
where you're not
there are those moments where you're observing
not
any of that.
The thing is
we sense
the act of feeding most
vividly when it's difficult
and not when it's easy.
This is the challenge
of trying to observe the mind and concentration
because the feeding is very
it's pretty immediate.
It's very easy at that point.
So when you're in the zone
everything is pretty effortless.
You're not conscious of your sense of self
at that time because there's nothing standing
in the way of what you want to do.
And you're not conscious
of the fact that you're feeding because
the sense of well-being just keeps coming
and coming and coming.
And yet you are actually feeding on that.
Is that a bad thing?
It's much better than going out
and shooting up heroin.
That's the whole point of the path
is to get the mind to feed
in better ways
that are more harmless
both for yourself and for the beings around you.
But eventually
you want to be able to recognize
because that too is a kind of feeding.
Thank you.
You made a distinction of originations.
Could you speak more about that?
There's a teaching called dependent origination
where the Buddha lays out all the steps
and he talks about fabrication
as one of the steps.
In fact, after ignorance, that's the first step.
I think it's interesting that it comes
even before our sensory experience.
He says we're already out there fabricating what we want.
And if it's based on ignorance
we're going to start feeding on all the wrong things.
But for him,
our awareness is not a passive thing
where we're just kind of sitting around
not thinking about anything all of a sudden
and it says we're out there looking.
And if our looking is based on ignorance
we're looking for trouble.
So when the Buddha is talking about fabrication there
he says in that sense
he's talking about not only your metal fabrication
but he's also talking about physical fabrication
even the way you breathe can become a cause
of suffering if you do it with ignorance.
This is one of the reasons why we focus on the breath
as a primary meditation object.
It brings some more knowledge to the process of breathing.
How can you fabricate the way your breath influences
the body and make it
in a more skillful way basically.
Bring more knowledge to the process.
Does that answer your question?
Not really but it's great.
Okay, well give the question again.
There was a distinction that you...
Okay, the Buddha talks about the five aggregates
and uses the word fabrication in the five aggregates.
And then in the course of dependent choral rising
he also uses the word fabrication
and doesn't have quite the same meaning.
That was the point I was getting at.
And it was the difference in the meaning
of trying to understand.
In the five aggregates it's purely mental
and in the dependent choral origination
it is physical and mental at the same time.
Okay, I think we've hit our time limit.
So thank you for your attention.
Okay, hope you remember this
and do something good with it, okay?
