Welcome  to the beginning  of a four-week  series  of talks 
on the Four Noble  Truths.  I will be offering  talks each  
week  on one of the Noble  Truths . This week  will be on 
the First Noble  Truth . Today,  I'll say some  introductory  
words  about  the Four Noble  Truths  in general.   
 
For many  people,  the Four Noble  Truths  are thought  to 
be the core teachings  of Buddhism.  When  I was 
studying  Zen in Japan,  I was given  a primer  for high 
school  students.  I was living  in the monastery  and given  
a book  in Japanese  about  Buddhism.  It talked  about  
how the Four Noble  Truths  are the core teachi ngs of 
Buddhism.  It claimed  that even  a child could  understand  
what  they are – but, at the same  time,  an older  person  
with lots of life experience  might  not understand  their 
depths.  I think  that something  like this is true. The Four 
Noble  Truths  provide  an ever-developing  series  of 
insights,  ways,  and perspectives  for understanding  our 
lives.

  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai , edits  JC-mg There  isn’t just one teaching  on the Four Noble  Truths.  
There  are many.  In the history  of Buddhism,  there  are 
different  interpretations,  applications,  and elaboratio ns 
of how these  truths  apply  to many  areas  of our lives.  
This idea goes  all the way back  to ancient  times.  The 
Four Noble  Truths  provide  a wonderful  framework  
within  which  to begin  studying  how to live a deeper,  
more  meaningful  life. In that regard,  one of the 
teachings  around  these  Four Noble  Truths  is that there  
is a particular  task for each  one. 
 
The Four Noble  Truths  have  to do with suffering  and the 
end of suffering.  It’s not a coincidence  that this 
discussion  about  suffering  follows  the week  where  we 
talked  about  care as a form of love,  compassion,  and 
goodwill.  Suffering  is central  to the human  experience.  
To value  and care for our lives and the lives of others  is 
to value  and care for our personal  suffering,  the 
suffering  of others,  and our collectiv e suffering.  We 
strive  to do this from a place  of groundedness,  
centeredness,  and non-reactivity.  We need  to work  with 
this in a wise way that leads  to a better  future  and 
freedom  from suffering.   
 
It's said that while  addressing  his suffering  and that 
which he encountered,  the Buddha  was immersed  in a 
noble  search.  There's  nobility,  dignity,  or worthiness  in 
addressing  and meeting  suffering,  and then finding  a 
way through  it and coming  out the other  side.  We don’t   
3 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai , edits  JC-mg address  suffering  to become  greater  victim s, or to 
diminish  ourselves  in any way. Instead,  we look at 
suffering  as a dignified,  ever-changing  process.  The 
Buddha  said that when  he was looking  for the 
alternative  to suffering,  he was looking  for long-term 
happiness  — one that's  not dependent  on the vagaries  
and changing  circumstances  of our lives,  when  we’re  
tossed  around  in the seas  of change.  
 
We’re  going  to address  this topic  of suffering  on the 
foundations  of care and faith.  One of the early  
meanings  of the word  ‘belief'  defines  it as something  
that you love,  or what  is ‘beloved. ’ So, what  is your 
beloved?  What  is it you love?  I like the idea that care 
and love are a deep,  heartfelt  involvement  with the 
topic,  touching  something  deep  inside  — as opposed  to 
looking  at it as a series  of proposition s or tenets  that we 
have  to believe  in or adhere  to, such  as a creed.  
Hopefully,  this is something  that will touch  us all in a 
deep,  even  tender  way — a tender  spot within.  Our 
value,  our nobility,  our dignity,  our worthiness  can allow  
us to really  touch,  feel, and experience  the full depth  of 
the challenges  and the potentials  we have  as human  
beings.   
 
We use the word  'suffering'  a lot when  talking  about  
Buddhism  and the Four Noble  Truths.  It might  not be 
the best translation  for the word  dukkha , but it's a 
translation  I'll use today  since  it's the most  common   
4 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai , edits  JC-mg one. Some  people  hear the word  'suffering'  and 
immediately  think  about  the big suffering  in their lives.  
And maybe  this kind of suffering  is a little bit irrelevant  
for how they're  going  about  their daily lives.  In fact, it 
may seem  a little overwhelming  to hear the word.  The 
word  dukkha , translated  as 'suffering,'  is meant  to 
define  the full range  of ways  in which  we feel stress  and 
distress,  and how we are challenged  by this life in big 
and small  ways. If we study  and look deeply  into our 
suffering,  we can find an alternative,  a different  way of 
living  in the world.  We can find something  about  how 
we suffer  that doesn't  have  to be there.  
 
I want  to clarify  that the word  dukkha  defined  as 
'suffering'  also points  to the large,  big suffering  that we 
have.  It points  to the things  that are most  challenging  
for us and may not be a part of our ordinary,  everyday  
lives.  It points  to the things  that we will encounter  
sooner  or later,  to things  can anticipate  we will 
encounter,  or the kind of things  that sometimes  when  
we're  young  we don't  think  about  so much.   
 
The Buddha  is said to have  lived a life of privilege,  
protection,  and luxury.  He didn't  really  know  about  the 
large  existential  challenges  of sickness,  old age, and 
death.  As the myth  goes,  he escaped  from the palace,  
and supposedly  saw sickness,  old age, and death  for 
the first time,  as a twenty -seven -year-old man.  (Imagine  
living  protected  from life for that long!)  As protected  as  
5 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai , edits  JC-mg he was, it probably  came as a shock  to him. And maybe  
some  of you have  been  shocked  by your encounter  with 
these  things.  Sometimes  there  are sudden  losses , 
deaths , and changes  that turn our lives upside -down.   
 
I like to think  that the Buddha  designed  the Dharma,  not 
so much  as a place  to deal with the everyday  stresses  
of life — certainly  it addresses  that — but in fact to 
really  prepare  us, with care,  love,  groundedness,  
rootedness,  steadiness,  and courage,  for the biggest  
challenges  that come  existentially  in this life. In this 
regard,  when  the Buddha  laid out some  examples  while  
addressing  suffering,  he used  powerful  words  that 
translate  into English  as, “grief,  mourning,  pain,  
distress,  and anguish.”  
 
In looking  at the Four Noble  Truths,  we're  looking  at the 
truths  of grief, mourning,  pain,  distress,  and anguish.  
We’re  seeing  that these  powerful  feelings  are doorways  
or conduits  into something  that’s  on the other  side of 
them  — something  that the Buddha  called  'freedom'  or 
'peace.'  Dharma  practice  can open  us up to a deep  
respect  for and acknowledgement  of these  things.  It can 
allow  us to really  see and understand  them  well. As we 
step into these  tender  and challenging  areas,  we have  
to do so with a lot of care,  faith,  groundedness,  and 
stability.  Being  simply  present,  conne cted,  and 
grounded  — without  getting  caught  up in ideas  and  
6 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai , edits  JC-mg abstractions  — is central  to making  Dharma  practice  
effective.   
 
For some  reason,  the Buddha  doesn’t  mention  the word  
‘fear’  in his definition  of dukkha . I don't  know  why that is, 
except  that maybe  fear by itself is not always  a 
problem.  It doesn't  always  arise  out of attachment  and 
clinging.  In fact, fear can be health y and appropriate.  
The biological  fear around  survival  is not necessarily  
rooted  in greed,  hate,  delusion,  or attachment.  It comes  
in the package  of being  alive.  The Buddha  did say, 
however,  that the world  of clinging  and attachments  is 
something  that gives rise to tremendous  fear. So to 
really  delve  into these  deep  topics  of the Four Noble  
Truths  is to also address  the kind of fear that is rooted  
in attachment.  
 
Scholars  sometimes  say that in early  Buddhism,  there  
are different  layers  of how these  truths  were laid out. In 
the earliest  layer,  the Four Noble  Truths  were  very 
simple.  The text says:  
This is suffering.   
This is the arising  of suffering.   
This is the cessation  [the end] of suffering.   
And this is the practice  leading  to the cessation  of 
suffering . 
It was very simple  and direct.   
 
Then  later,  the word  'truth'  was added:    
7 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai , edits  JC-mg This is the truth of suffering.   
This is the truth of the arising  of suffering.   
This is the truth of the cessation  of suffering.   
And this is the truth of the practice  leading  to the 
cessation  of suffering.  
 
Then  later again , the word  'noble'  was added:   
This is the noble  truth of suffering.   
This is the noble  truth of the arising  of suffering.   
This is the noble  truth of the cessation  of suffering.   
And this is the noble truth of the practice  leading  to 
the cessation  of suffering.  
 
What  we find is that these  wonderful  statements  have  
no pronouns.  I am very inspired  by this. The idea of 
addressing  suffering  is not directional.  It's wherever  we 
encounter  it. Certainly  the suffering  we have  in 
ourselves  is a place  where  we can take the most  
responsibility,  and where  we can delve  most  deeply  into 
the very roots  of what  it's all about.  But these  powerful  
formulas  also address  the suffering  we encounter  in the 
world.  This is something  that we want  to attend  to, 
study,  and understand.   
 
So as we go through  the Four Noble  Truths,  we want  to 
be inclusive  of the world  and have  our practice  be part 
and parcel  of the wellbeing,  freedom,  and happiness  of 
all beings.  I want  to end with a statement,  which   
8 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai , edits  JC-mg certainly  has great  value  for me and, I believe,  for all of 
us as we begin this study  of the Four Noble  Truths:  
Your  suffering  is my suffering.  My suffering  is your 
suffering.   
Their  suffering  is our suffering.  Our suffering  is their 
suffering.   
Your  welfare  is my welfare.  My welfare  is your 
welfare.   
Their  welfare  is our welfare.  Our welfare  is your 
welfare.   
 
Let's  care for the welfare  of all. Thank  you.
