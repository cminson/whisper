 Connecting to your experience here and now in a simple way, just how are you in this moment? How is the body starting with checking in? How is the body? Is there ease or tension? How is the mind? Is it active, a little bit agitated or is it settling into just this moment? Starting with an acknowledgement of how we are, not trying to fix it or change it, but just this is how it is right now with an attitude or a kind of a curiosity of how is it right now. That can create the conditions for there to be a settling. So sometimes it seems paradoxical but acknowledging how we are even if that's agitated or tense. Sometimes that very acknowledgement without resistance, without struggle, but just, oh, there's tension right now. That can sometimes create the conditions for the tension, the agitation to soften. The allowing attitude of mind is what supports that when we're attending to our experience. How can I fix this? How can I change this? That includes attention and an agitation. And so the very way we may be attending, maybe holding that tension or that agitation in place. And so just acknowledging, oh yeah, this is how it is. And then seeing, opening to the possibility of a shift in that experience because changing experience is the nature of experience. We could say explore the possibility of being with ourselves as we are. It's not only being open to how we are in this moment, but being open to that it will change, open to the changing nature of experience. This attitude of allowing, of receiving that can support the mind to be able to hold to the changing nature of experience is supported with relaxation. And so if allowing feels a little distant, then maybe just dropping in a kind of a possibility, maybe there can be relaxation. Not necessarily trying to do that relaxation, but is there relaxation available? Relax and receive what is already happening. And remembering that moment after moment, what is already happening is a changing dynamic flow of experience.
