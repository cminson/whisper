As you sit here, you could become aware of the stillness in the room, and also the silence
that's in the room. Even though there are sounds coming from outside, you might be aware of the
silence that's here.
The silence that might be highlights the movements and arising sensations
within your body.
And the silence that highlights the noise within.
And part of mindfulness is to be aware of thinking.
Not so much what we're thinking about, but to be aware of thinking is a phenomena that
arises as if you can step away and observe your self-thinking.
And you might, for the next few minutes, allow yourself to think, and in allowing yourself
to think, to be aware, clearly aware that you're thinking.
And in being aware of thinking, can you notice whether you think more in words or more in
images?
As you think, are you involved in your thinking?
Are you interested in your thoughts?
Are you hooked into them?
Do your thoughts come with a lot of authority?
Are you bothered by your thoughts?
And what would it be like to just know a thought is just a thought.
Not something to be believed or bothered by or engaged with, a thought passes through
the mind as the wind passes through the trees.
And in mindfulness practice, it's important to notice how you're aware.
Are you aware with judgment or contraction?
With being for or against what you're aware of?
Can you be aware of thoughts, thinking, without being for or against it?
Perhaps by relaxing the thinking muscle.
Sometimes when we're thinking, there can be tension or pressure connected to the thinking.
Some part of our body feels activated or energized.
The body and the brain, the eyes, the jaw, the chest.
We think and there are subtle muscles that get pulled or tightened up.
If there's any energy or tension connected to thinking, as you exhale, can you allow
that tension to relax like you're relaxing a muscle?
Softening, relaxing the thinking muscle.
Be with the image of an agitated surface of water.
Falling down and flattening out.
And if you're watching your thoughts, your thinking, you'll be able to relax and relax
Is there any emotion connected to your thinking?
It could be very subtle, it could be strong.
But emotions sometimes are both the fuel and the hook of staying involved in thinking.
They're caught up in it.
But if you step back with your awareness and look at the emotions that might be part of
thinking, and that's stepping back, can there be an unhooking?
Sometimes, it's possible to be aware of the effort that it takes to think the energy and
to contrast that with the awareness, a kind of an awareness that doesn't really require
any effort.
The awareness that remains when conscious mental effort is relaxed.
The awareness that remains when conscious mental effort is relaxed.
The awareness that remains when conscious mental effort is relaxed.
And there's a way of being mindful of thinking, being aware of thinking, where the awareness
is undisturbed by whatever we're thinking.
Just aware.
And then if the thoughts are not predominant, if they recede in the background or quiet
down, you might be aware of the space between your thoughts.
Or the spaciousness around your thoughts.
And then if the thoughts are not predominant, you might be aware of the space between your
thoughts.
And if the thoughts are no longer compelling, you can also return to awareness of breathing.
And if what I'm about to say makes sense, you might try it.
But it's possible to be aware of your breathing without making any conscious mental effort.
Just by letting go of conscious mental effort and allowing the body to be centered on breathing.
The body's awareness, the chest, the belly's awareness of breathing, is where awareness
resides.
The mind relaxes and mostly letting go of mental effort.
So you're left with awareness, the awareness of the body, aware of breathing.
And then if the thoughts are not predominant, you might be aware of the space between your
thoughts.
And then if the thoughts are not predominant, you might be aware of the space between your
thoughts.
And then if the thoughts are not predominant, you might be aware of the space between your
thoughts.
And then if the thoughts are not predominant, you might be aware of the space between your
thoughts.
