The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Welcome everyone. I hope you're sitting next to your pleasure and your ease and
that you felt the unwinding. So certainly my intention and my wish for you. But
like everything else, I have no control over that. I'm reminded every day what I
have no control over. And I was inspired today by things I have no control over
to talk about patience. Patience. A few weeks ago, somebody asked me, so what's
the Buddhist principles around patience? You know, and I don't know exactly what
he was looking for when he asked me that question. I couldn't point to what the
Buddha said about patience. So I'm sure I said something off the cuff like, you
know, patience being related to creating space for wisdom to arrive. But the
curious thing is that it started me thinking about what happens when I get
impatient. And what is impatience anyway? And how do I feel it? And what's the
absence of impatience? What's the presence of patience like? And does
patience have attached to it aversion that you're tolerating something? When
does patience become ease, as opposed to toleration, which somehow doesn't feel
right? There's a version written all over that. And so I started thinking about
what I do that, you know, when I notice irritation and agitation, then I'll say
to myself, well, you know, what is my intention and what's actually going on
here? And are any triggers being pushed? And sometimes all I can do is say, just
do nothing. Nothing is the only wise thing to do now is nothing. Because
nothing is the only way I don't create karma. When it all seems past me or
beyond me. But like all formulas for how we cope with things, it's only an
approximation of wise action, wisdom. What we're really looking for is how does
how does patience manifest itself as wise action and wise way of being? Where
does wisdom come into the picture? What can it be something other than a
version to whatever is happening? So the other day, I said something that,
you know, sometimes things come out of my mouth. I don't plan to say and I say,
gee, that sounded good. I wonder what I meant by that. So one of those things
was the other day I said that the hindrances describe the mind state
between what is and what we want to be. That's interesting. The hindrances as a
mind state. And so you're going to hear a lot about mind states here for the next
few minutes. So in the mind state of doubt, there is uncertainty, self-criticism,
fear of failure, fear of not being liked, all kinds of fears stuck in in the
middle of doubt. You know, I'm not good enough. This is part of the, well, maybe,
maybe I can't do this. The uncertainty, there's uncertainty in doubt. In the mind
state of a version, there's a lot of not wanting. You don't want this. I don't want
this. I want it to be different. I want you to be different. There's a lot of not
wanting. Ill will is that is found in in the hindrance of a version.
Frustration, irritation, fears of all sorts, resentment, all of those are found in
that in the mind state of a version. It's not like a version is a thing. It's a
mind state of not wanting. In desire, there's weariness, weariness, craving,
clinging, fear of abandonment, there's loneliness, and it's hiding out in that
place of a version. In desire, in sloth and torpor. In sloth and torpor, there's
weariness also. You know, it's just that I'm tired. I'm just tired. I'm weary of
whatever is happening. There's laziness. There's the absence of hope. I give up in
sloth and torpor. This could also be part of doubt. I give up. There's no hope
here. We all know those feelings that they're they're kind of hidden in that
mind state that we're calling a hindrance. In short, many emotions hang out in this
mind state. And it may not be useful to try to pick out the emotion and say,
okay, this is what's happening here. And because that gets us off into describing
why we think it's that. And we're in the world of stories. But what we name them
in terms of of the hindrance, I don't want it, I want it. I don't think it's
possible. I'm really agitated. What we name it has something to do with whether
we're leaning into it or pushing it away. My point here is that the hindrances
actually are not so different from one another. They're all about the mind state
between how things are and how I want them to be. What is true and what I wish
was true? What is what is true? And what I really am working toward to be true?
Either about the past, the present or the future. Some dissatisfaction. And patience
comes in, because patience has to do with our willingness to let things be as
they are. To see them as they are, accept them as they are. That patience has
something to do with, okay, it's like this. It's like this. And we can say
that to ourselves. We can say, oh, it's like this. But whatever is causing that
lack of patience is still there. And there's, if we take something, if we take
an energy level associated with restlessness, it's, you know, it's
jagged, like it's moving quickly. And whether we call it restlessness or
excitement has everything to do with the mind state of whether I want it to
happen or not happen, whether I want to be distracted or don't want to be
distracted. Right? I mean, if I don't want to be distracted, it's restlessness. If I
want to be distracted by it, it's wonderful and it's glorious. There's
this trade-off of what do we want and when do we want it to happen? So if I
think of the hindrances as just a flag saying, pay attention here, your suffering
is caused by you. Now, who wants to believe my suffering is caused by me? Of
course it's not. But in truth, it's because we want something to be
different than it is. And what do we do without wanting? So patience describes the
condition of peaceful waiting. That I'm waiting for impermanence to reveal
whatever's going to happen next and I am at peace with it. There's an aspect of
patience that has to do with just allowing what is true to be true. The
traffic has stopped. There is nothing I can do about it. I can chew the inside of
my mouth and grip my steering wheel, but it's not going to have any effect on the
outcome. So if I can see patience as the absence of extreme not wanting, not
wanting whatever is happening, and just see it as acceptance of this is what's
true now. This is what's true now. It doesn't mean we give up anything or any of
our intentions, but rather that we really absorb the idea that this is what's
happening. It's the suspension of the need to fix it or control it or change it. A
suspension. It doesn't mean that we give up our efforts to improve something or
finish a project. But the feeling that despite what is true, it shouldn't be. It's
the place that is a lack of patience. I find lurking in my thoughts of
irritation when I feel the absence of patience. What am I missing here? How
often have you said that to yourself? What am I missing here in frustration and
irritation? Because there is this miasma of feeling in the place of
impatient, impatience that surely I can do something about this. Surely this,
surely I don't have to accept that this is the way it is. Surely. And somehow with
patience, there's a time factor, right?
There is a sense that this should have happened already. I don't know where this
sense of urgency comes from, but I've noticed it shows up when I'm feeling
impatient. It's like something should have happened already. You should have
learned your lesson. I should have learned my lesson. I should have found a
job by now. I should be more calm in meditation. My practice should be showing
these signs. All of it has to do with a comparison and a dissatisfaction and
somehow seeing impatience as not. Impatience has associated with a sense
of trying to establish blame. We blame ourselves or we blame others. And the
acceptance I'm talking about, the peaceful waiting part, is devoid of blame.
I give up the need to blame myself or others or the conditions. And I simply
say, these conditions are here.
This morning, I just totally lost my patience, just totally lost it. And in
the, in the few minutes before, I was thinking, I just can't stand this. I
just can't stand this. The pressure is so great here. Just, I could feel the, and
I got up to leave the room because it did not seem like I could control the
adrenaline running through my body. I could feel it. I could see it. I could say,
my intention is to be kind. I was just sitting with it and just feeling the
buildup.
And it's really about saying, this is how it is, however you want it to be. It is
this. The radical fears is like this part. It is like this. It's like this. And
even the way your voice said, you begin with us. It's like this. It's like this.
It's like this. It's like this. And in the, in the final, it's like this is the
settling. What this is most like, what this reminds me about is, is the factor,
the five faculties, that the way that we develop patience is that we develop the
five faculties that, and they are faith or, or confidence in what we're doing.
Perseverance, effort, perseverance, just sticking with it, just sticking with it.
I'm losing it. I'm losing it. No, I'm still here. I'm still here. I'm still here.
Awareness, mindfulness that says, this is the person who's showing up here. This is
this frustrated person showing up in this moment. And this is what it's like. This
is what it's like to be frustrated in this moment. I get it. So that you see as
clearly as possible. And we try to, we try to operate with a stable mind when you
feel all the chaos. What we want to cultivate is a sense of, okay, I'm here.
Whatever else is true, I am here. And you feel that settling in feeling, the
stillness of concentration, not the concentration that is one focused, one
subject focused, but the settling of concentration, which is the, the sinking
into the moment. And we do this so that there is a pause and opportunity for
wisdom to show up. If, if I don't have to have such an urgent approach to what I'm
calling patients, if I say, okay, I'm going to accept it like it is, but I need
some space here. Not I need time for patients, but I need space to allow my
better impulses, my skillful actions, my intentions to come to the fore. I need the
space. If I think of it in terms of space instead of urgency, it helps me create
a place for wisdom can emerge. We say the grieving process takes time. While this
may be true, I would argue it takes space, the space of patience that says, okay, I've
been hit many times and I'm still here. The place to say, okay, at this point, I
just have to know that things will change and I don't know how they're going
to change. The embracing of uncertainty, that kind of wisdom, okay, I'm uncertain,
which means whatever my worries are, I have no way of thinking those are in fact
going to happen. So I'm just going to give myself space to absorb the dashed
hopes or the loss or the disappointments. Okay, I'm just going to see, yeah, I'm
hurt. You know, sometimes we're rushing ahead in with impatience because we're
unwilling to just say, damn it, that hurt.
And sometimes just seeing that hurt or that scared me is enough to allow us to
settle. It's the cultivation of these faculties, not developing some magic
formula to figure out how to be more patient. It's about being able to use
all of these things that we have that are tools, not techniques. And so every time
we develop our capacity for just being here, just being aware, or the capacity
to just have faith in impermanence, faith in impermanence. It isn't only about loss,
it's about arising. Let's see what arises in this moment.
And of course, we contemplate all of these difficulties in a state of awareness,
of weariness. Usually it happens when we're just tired. We're tired of how
things are. We're tired of the conversation. We're tired of things not
happening on time. The package is five days late. I needed it yesterday. I thought
I ordered it early. Who's to blame here? Well, it's like this. It has something
to do with China. Who knows? There's things we have nothing to do, no control
over, and somehow we're out here trying to fix it. Okay, it's not here.
Patience is the place in which we give ourselves space. It's the place of
persistent effort. It's a place where we value seeing clearly over judgment and
comparison. Just see. Just see.
So I have a quick poem that appealed to me on this topic. It's another Jane
Hirschfield poem. It's called Evolution in Glass. For days, a fly traveled
loudly from window to window until at last it landed on one I could open. It
left without thanks or glancing back, believing only quite correctly in its
own persistence. This is how we develop patience. We just keep
trying and we keep bumping against that glass that won't open until somebody
opens. Oh, look, I'm free. And we don't think at all about what next is. It's not
as if it was caused by anything we did.
Things happened together. And our task, our process, our practice is just
persistence, perseverance, allowance. These are not hard words where you have to
go charging into the next life. It's like this. And feel the resistance against
that. And to say, sorry, it's like this. It's just like this. So those are my
thoughts. I hope it was useful. And I welcome any thoughts you have or
comments or questions.
Yeah, I'll be
there. Hi, Maria. Nice, very nice to see you. Thanks for that talk. I'm just
wondering as you were talking about this great topic. I'm wondering how much
it's embedded in the culture of the West, actually, just rushing because of the
productivity that we all are supposed to have and be. And whereas, I mean, that's
kind of like not trained in being patient and just sitting with things
because you have to do, you know, the efficiency is and then part of the
efficiency is hurrying and rushing is so much rewarded in the culture. Whereas,
you know, in some of the other cultures, I know they sit for hours watching a
train go by. And I mean, that kind of like develops a lot of patient is
embedded in the culture. So I'm just wondering if you can just comment on that
aspect of the cultural aspect of the patients in the West.
Well, you know, yes, we live in a world that values productivity. It's a
cultural norm for us and always improving and always striving and always
being better. And and what this does is tend to warp our sense of what is
better. Yeah, what is it that we want? What is it that brings peace and
happiness and ease? And, you know, I've been retired for a long time. I'm in my
early 70s and and I feel like my schedule is just overwhelming. And I ask
myself, what's this about? You know, this is caused only by me. There's
nobody making this schedule for me. It's me doing this. And and to watch when
I say, Yeah, but, you know, I kind of think I ought to do this. And I hear
the I ought to part. And so part for me of developing patients is saying,
whose values am I trying to reach? Whose values am I adopting? What does it
mean? To just be? How can I just be? And still be a productive, involved
person in the world. But but that doesn't have to be measured in terms of
numbers of things, numbers of activities, numbers of hours, numbers of, I
don't know, dollars, whatever, you know, what, whatever the measure that we're
using. Perhaps it's the measure that needs to be abandoned. And the the being
examined in terms of what are my intentions. You know, I was talking to
somebody the other day, you said, Well, I wanted such and such to be true. And so
here's how you do it. And I said, Well, yeah, but you're attached to here's how
you do it. And it's really this that you want to do. So revisit this. If you if
you believe, for example, that the way to relax is to sit quietly on a chase
lounge in the sun on the beach, and you can't get to the beach. Does this mean
you can't relax? Well, if you're really attached to the way that you get
somewhere, yeah, it means you can't relax. But it turns out that relaxation has
more to do with letting down your guard and giving up the need to fix. Every
time I plan, okay, I'm just going to I have this hour, I'm going to sit down
and read and I've got this great chair over here. And I've got I've got my
my my coaster and I can bring my my soda over here. And I got my music set up
by the time I get everything lined up, I've a half hour gone when I could have
just sat down. And and that's the trap that we get in the trap where we have
to control all the conditions. Instead of saying, Here's what I want. Here are
the conditions. What do I do with these conditions? Instead of trying to massage
the world to make it into a form?
Do I say that? But it's also true that I know if I don't leave myself quiet
time, that this is a value that is really necessary for maintaining the
mindfulness that I have elsewhere, that in order to sustain mindfulness in the
rest of my life, I have to have a space where I'm not doing something and
having to be somewhere, I need just a space. And when I don't create that
space for myself, I suffer. So seeing the wisdom of what feeds my intentions
and what gets in the way of intentions
requires noting, noticing, but not being too attached to whether I'm fighting
that hindrance or the other hindrance, but rather what's showing up here.
And what is the overall attitude of the mind state that I'm trying to use
and work under?
It's really seeing what's true here, so that I can say, oh, this is here, this
is what's happening. Here's the person who's showing up now.
And not creating plain to explain shortcomings, but here I am with all
my shortcomings and my intentions. And I take the next step.
Whoops, that step wasn't there. Who did that?
Okay, it's like this, the step wasn't there.
And that the cultivation of patience is tied into the cultivation of faith,
effort, mindfulness, stillness, steadiness of mind, and wisdom, the
wisdom of, oh, that's what's happening. We cultivate those and the patience comes.
Thank you very much. And thanks for being here, Maria.
Thank you. So does anybody else have any comments they'd like to make?
Complaints are welcome, too. I was reading something from Taysha Nia today
that that that if you find somebody is always being defensive around you,
it's time to figure out what you're doing to trigger that defensiveness.
Oh, oh, what do I have to do with your defensiveness? Oh,
just, just watch, just watch and be at ease.
Yeah, Peggy.
I was thinking, while you're talking, that I used to work with
developmentally disabled people, you know, people say, oh, you must be so patient.
And really, what I miss about the job, because now I do business real estate
stuff, which is like, here now, do it now. But I miss that, that settling,
because all you could do is be patient, you can't rush them or it's going to go
even more wrong. And it's kind of weird, because I realized that, that I missed
that, because I just say, okay, and it was almost an invitation to just be
and, and see what beauty was there. So in a way, it was really nice.
And that's kind of the thing. Yeah. And I got a hammock recently, and it's,
it helps patients. There's something about lying in that, but it's just kind
of a floaty, it invites me to just be. So it's nice.
It invites you into the moment is what it does. Yes, this moment.
It doesn't have to be anything. The moment doesn't have to be anything.
So take advantage of the moment. And just let, even if it's just that long,
settle. Now I'll go back to the chaos. The chaos in my mind, the chaos in my
house, whatever it is, it's just, okay, that the dealing with yet another
loss. Okay. Okay, I'm still here.
Thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for your practice. Thank you
for the ease of just saying hello.
And know how grateful I am that you're willing to do that.
And the world should be grateful.
Good night, everyone. Thank you, Maria. Good night. Good night. Thank you, Maria.
Thank you, everyone for coming. Thank you. Nice to see you, Maria. Yeah. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye, Peggy.
Erica, are you still here?
No, I think so. Okay, good night.
