 I find it helpful in looking at practice and looking at life, my life, to consider that the present moment has two aspects. There is the aspect of what's happening in the present moment, whatever it might be, externally in the world or internally within us. There's what's happening and then there's the way that we're relating to what's happening. Buddhist practice belongs to that second category, how we relate to what's happening. Part of Buddhist practice then is to have some intentionality, some choice, some will, some involvement in how we relate to what our present moment experience is. Part of the present moment experience, when there's no practice or no sense of having some choice in the matter, part of the present moment experience is our unconscious or subconscious or automatic or habitual response to the present moment which colors it and affects it. And often the way we respond, the way we relate to the present moment, there's many different aspects of that. There's our attitudes towards the present moment, there's our intentions, there's our views, our understanding about the present moment. We bring a lot to bear on the present moment and often that's invisible to us, we don't see that because it's happened so spontaneously, so naturally, so seemingly. We think it's just inherent in existence, this is the way things are and we don't even necessarily know that we're actually contributing something to the present moment in understanding of the present moment. So a very mundane example would be if you're driving down the street and you see on the intersection, the corner of the intersection, the sidewalk, a pole. On top of that pole is a box and on top of that box there's three colored glass, circles of glass. One is red and one is yellow and one is green. And if you watch that for a while you see that a light, it lights up behind them at the intervals, alternately, differently at times. They don't seem to all light up at the same time but sometimes there's a green one lights up and sometimes a yellow and sometimes a red one. And that's interesting, right? I mean, just a pole with a box with lights. But we see that kind of, most of us pretty spontaneously as being a traffic light and that the red, green and yellow lights have meaning. And when they light up it means something for us when we're driving and that we should respond accordingly. And there might be a lot of, there's certain understanding then it goes into seeing that box of lights and it seems, it's so ingrained or so inherent or so easy, part of how the mind works, that but it's the working of the mind. The mind has to be active, has to understand, has to project that understanding on the situation and has to have certain intention or relationship to that understanding. And it gets pretty complex pretty quickly when you tease apart what goes on we see this box on a pole that has lights in it. And there might be all kinds of attitudes towards that pole with a box that have lights on it. There might be attitudes of annoyance. She, you know, you know, it doesn't realize I'm in a hurry to get somewhere. It's an imposition and my freedom to do anything I want and go ahead. I have to stop with this red light. And then you might have all kinds of fantasies that get born because of that. But wouldn't it be great to have a little kind of device, little radio device in your car, only in your car, no one else's car, that somehow communicated those lights so whenever you came to the intersection it was always green for you. Wouldn't that be great? Or it might be a certain level of fear arises in relationship to that light as it turns yellow and you consider I think I can make it. And so, you know, so there's a kind of fear, you know, you kind of hope there was no car, no police car, no car that's painted black and white that has little these lights on top of the roof that somehow, you know, is in the neighborhood that could watch you. That, you know, black and white car with lights on top means something and there's a whole attitude. You're not just, you know, all attitudes, understandings and intentions in relationship to this black and white car with lights on the roof. And so we live in a world where there's a lot we bring, we bring to bear a lot. We add a lot to the, to what we see, what the immediacy of the experience is in terms of views, understandings, attitudes, emotions, a lot that goes on. If we just kind of go along in our lives, not taking any responsibility for what we contribute to the present moment, then our contribution to present moment will be habitual, will be very much influenced by our reactivity, our greed, our ignorance, our aversions, our the ways we've been conditioned by society, conditioned by our life experiences. And in a sense, we're kind of then just, I wanted to use the word victim, I don't know if it's the best, very good choice of words, but a victim of, or just kind of passive recipient of life, passive, passive kind of passenger in our life and things happen and we don't take much responsibility for what's happening to us. My understanding of Buddhist practice is that it really has a lot to do with taking responsibility for that contribution that we add to our present moment experience. So that we are start becoming clear and clear about where the choice is and begin changing the organizational principles for how we choose and our intentions from being motivated by greed, hate and delusion to being motivated by wisdom and compassion. So Buddhist understanding is that most people who don't really start taking responsibility for their actions in life, their views of life, their reactivity is very much influenced by greed, hate and delusion or the different varieties of that. And Buddhist practice is moving us in a direction of changing that so that the organizing motivations, reactions for our life are not greed, hate and delusion, but rather becomes wisdom and compassion. And so we organize our life and how we choose to respond, how we respond becomes out of wisdom and compassion. And that also, as it becomes deeply, kind of deeply enters into us in some way, can at some point start becoming almost a natural response, seemingly spontaneous response, seemingly as if it's not a choice anymore that we're acting out of compassion and wisdom, but becomes who we are in a certain way. So I'd like to read you a story about intention, the attitude we bring to what we do, to what a situation is. It's a story about a man who is transformed, kind of almost seemingly led along by the different people he encounters, each person doing the same activity, but each person doing the activity with a different attitude, a different intention, a different thing that they bring to the same activity. And this has to do with a man who was an abbot of his end monastery. The abbot was a most unusual man. He seemed always to have a smile in his eyes and a look as if he knew, as if he knew you better than you knew yourself. He once told this story about himself. When I was 13, my family would send me up to the mountains around the monastery to collect edible plants to be used for our evening meal. This foraging trip was the only work that I enjoyed doing. Otherwise, I tried every trick I could to avoid work on my family's farm. I was still going to school, but school had no interest for me. And my ever-present anger was a welcome barrier to learning anything the teacher was teaching. Occasionally, during my foraging trips, I would pass by the monastery while the monks were out and about sweeping the leaves from the many paths. The first time I saw the monks working, I was mesmerized in watching them going about their work. For many months afterwards, I would often stop for a while to watch them sweep. They went about their work silently and with an efficiency that seemed effortless. One day, a monk walked up to me and asked what I was doing in the mountains. Immediately, I became defensive and scared. I resented anyone who tried to get to know me. So instead of answering the question, I countered by asking him what he was doing. The monk smiled and answered that he'd been told to sweep and that he was just killing time until he could return to his room for a nap. As I walked home later in the day, I thought about his answer and was glad that he did not seem any different than myself. When I was required to do anything, my heart was never in it. And my attitude was that I was passing time until I could be excused. Taking a nap was certainly preferable. The next day, I passed by the monastery on one of my foraging trips and another monk stopped his sweeping and also asked what I was doing. Again, I resented the question. It felt like an intrusion. However, this time I did not feel as scared. Again, I deflected the question by asking what he was doing. He answered that he was doing extra work in hopes of being assigned to the kitchen, which was warm in the winter and always seemed to have one or two extra sweet rice cakes in the cupboard for cooks to nibble on. Without saying anything, I nodded and left to continue my foraging. The monk's answer resonated with me since I too like to be warm and eating sweet cakes was one of my favorite activities, second only to sleeping. The next time I passed the monastery, a third monk asked me the same question. This time I was surprised that I wasn't defensive or resentful of being asked. However, again, I deflected the question back to him. He explained that he was sweeping as a spiritual discipline to help him overcome his anger. Later, as I walked the mountain trail with my bag of plants, I felt a kinship with this monk. Like me, he had anger, but I was perplexed that he would want to overcome it. For me, my anger protected me. A week later, I was again outside the monastery watching the monks sweep. Yet another monk came up to me. When he asked me what I was doing, I mumbled something about collecting plants. I doubt he could hear me. My voice was so faint. But I did muster up some strength to ask him what he was doing. He replied that he was beautifying the monastery so that others may be inspired in their work of spiritual transformation. Before I left him, I glanced down the well-swept paths and realized that part of the reason I was compelled to watch the monks sweep was that they seemed to be transforming the paths into something that made me feel peaceful. The next time I stood outside the monastery watching the monks, I was drawn to walk over to a fifth monk. And before he could ask me what I was doing, I asked him. He looked at me with kind eyes. And after what seemed like a long but quite soft silence, he explained that he was sweeping to be of service to all who used the monastery. In practicing this way, he hoped to find the ultimate peace. As I left the monastery that day, I thought his answer strange as I didn t understand what he meant by service and by peace. I certainly couldn t see how these had any value for me. The next time I visited the monastery for the last time, I had an unfamiliar feeling as I walked up into the mountains. Just before I reached the monastery, I guessed that I was looking forward to seeing the monks again. I felt a warm glow of gladness in anticipation of what I would find. When I arrived at the monastery, I walked right up to the old monk who seemed absorbed in his sweeping. I inquired what he was doing. As he answered, each of his words washed over me like cleansing water. Me? He said, I am not doing anything. My ego was swept away long ago. There is no I that does anything. Now the awakened life moves through my body, my mind, my heart, and my mouth. No one sweeps, there are no paths to sweep, and there is no dirt to brush away. I was stunned by his answer and before I could respond, he handed me the broom and walked away. I have been here ever since. So each of the monks had a different attitude to the sweeping, the same activity for different attitudes. Do you have any choice in the attitude you bring to your activities, to whatever you do, to the life that you live? Part of what in modern psychotherapeutic terms creates a strong sense of self is to have a strong sense of purpose and values for our life, and then to be able to organize our life and our intentions in the direction of our life according to those aims and those values. The same is true in Buddhist practice. What Buddhist practice suggests is that it is possible to organize one's life around long-term aims and very deep values that have a coherence to them, that work together. Part of having a healthy sense of self or a healthy way of living life is to have our life organized around coherent values and coherent aims for what our life is about. And not just simply responding to the moment in the moment for value what happens in the moment, but as we respond to the moment, as we make choices how we live in the moment, to understand how it works in supporting long-term values and aims for our life. So to have some sense of purpose, some sense of value, some sense of intentions and attitudes that are useful to bring to bear on how we respond to the present moment, and to have some sense of how that might fit into long-term aims. One of my favorite stories or little examples, which maybe I've talked about enough, is the one of the parallel lines, have I talked about that recently? That if you take two parallel lines, it's almost parallel, just a shade of an angle difference. For a long time you can look at those almost parallel lines kind of going off into the horizon and they seem like they're parallel. They seem like you can follow along and they seem like no change. But if you follow long enough, a week or a year or 10 years, slowly there's a divergence and those lines will go further and further and further apart. And after 10 years, it's a huge and important difference between the difference, the direction they've gone. So the same thing in our life. If we make a small change in our life, regular change, that seems almost insignificant today, then over the weeks and the months and the years, if we maintain that direction, it can make a huge difference down the line. If we start acting, trying to act just a little bit kinder in our life, just a little bit, just a small little teeny ways today, that kindness can grow and make a big difference in 10 years. If we try to be a little bit more mindful in our life today, just a little bit, that's making that as a direction for our life can make a big difference. And if we're measuring the success of our practice in a daily way, oh, we've been practicing mindfulness for a day and there's no difference. I think I'll give up and try something else. That's kind of too quick to judge. But if you have an idea that there can be a long-term goal and how these lines separate over time, that you can make a huge difference down the line. Just, for example, sitting every day. Doing a meditation practice every morning and sitting every day might not seem so significant in one day or two days or in a week or maybe sometimes it'd be in a month or in a year. But over a lifetime it can make a huge difference. 10 years into the future might seem so far ahead, so far into the future, that why would you even bother about it? Why would you think about that? But if you think back 10 years from where you are today, boy, I wish I'd started 10 years ago. Because boy, then today it'd be really different. 10 years from now, for a lot of you, will just be a blink of the eye once you get there. And having started today to try to take care of 10 years from now can be very significant in 10 years. So to have a coherent sense of values and a coherent sense of an aim, I think is a very important part of Buddhist practice. And one of my suggestions is that in Buddhist terms, and you don't have to be a Buddhist or even adopt Buddhist terms, but this is a Buddhist center so I'm allowed to say it, is to begin orienting towards the cultivation and development and the response of compassion and wisdom. To begin to explore and bring, to bear on the present moment, an intention to meet the situation with compassion and wisdom. And the word intention is a very important one here. Because intention is not positive thinking where you're overlaying or repressing or denying what's there and trying to kind of pretty it up. Part of the wisdom is to be very honest about what is here in the present moment. So to bring honesty to bear with the present. To be really honest, what's happening now? And then given that honesty of what's happening now, what is useful intention to have in relationship to this? And the intention doesn't mean that you have to be, like if the intention is to be kind, doesn't mean that you need to stop being angry or you deny it or push that way or sweep it away or something. But it means, oh, can I try, can I, can that be my aspiration? Can I, you know, in spite of my anger, can I, being honest about the anger being there, can I act on an intention and aspiration of kindness, of compassion? For sometimes the wisest way of responding to the present moment is to get out of the way of the present moment. To seemingly not interfere with it. To not have any intention to try to do anything with it or respond with kindness or with compassion or wisdom, but rather just kind of be very spacious and very open and kind of about just let it be. That's a very wise response, but that's still the response that we can choose to respond, you know, way of responding. There's a lot of different responses that we can bring. And Buddhist practice has a wide range of practices, of ideas of how you might respond to the present moment. The point today in this talk is that a very important part of wise living is to begin taking responsibility for how we respond to the present moment. And beginning to take small moments of responsibility might seem insignificant, but as you begin exercising that muscle-taking responsibility of choosing to respond differently than the habitual way or the conditioned way, that slowly changes who we are. It changes the psyche, it changes the heart and the mind. So that the psyche, which is malleable, can begin having as its organizing principle, as its organizing orientation, as its software that runs the program, something like compassion and wisdom as its organizing principle. Having goals, having an aim for our life, having a coherent aim, and being very clear about what our intentions are in the short term and also in the long term, can give a lot of power to a person's life. A lot of strength, a lot of inspiration, to not have a coherent sense of purpose and goal for our life can actually drain a lot of our power, a lot of our energy, a lot of our kind of, you know, the coherence brings a lot of power. Today I read a little bit in the paper, I read out loud to my son in the Chronicle. About 50 years ago there was, I guess, three men were competing to break the four minute mile to run. And these guys had this really, had a lot of power because of the strength of their intention and how they organized their life around trying to train in order to be able to be the first humans who could run faster than four minutes. And apparently two years of really intense training, these three guys in different places in the world competing to do that. They had a certain coherence and power that came from that kind of focus and what their life was about. It's possible in Buddhist practice to have similar kind of focus and intention and coherence. This is what my life is about. It doesn't mean that you have to compete for the Olympics, the Buddhist Olympics. But it's possible to have a certain strength, power, each of us in our lives by the focus that we have, the purpose that we have, the value we have, but how we're going to organize our life, what our life is going to be focused around. I would suggest that you look at your lives honestly and carefully. Use your mindfulness, use your reflection, use your contemplation, use your discussions with your friends to try to understand much better and honestly what it is that tends to motivate the choices you make in your life, what motivates how you respond to your present moment experience, the motivation behind your long-term aims, if you have any. So look at it honestly and fully and completely. And what is the underlying motivation there? To what degree is it influenced by the varieties of greed or ambition? To what degree is it motivated by the varieties of aversion or ill will or hate or avoidance? And what degree is it motivated by delusion or ignorance, confusion? And is it possible, is it interesting, would it be useful for you to bring to bear, to bring up, to evoke, to arouse compassion and wisdom as the organizing principles? In the Buddhist tradition, there's a lot of emphasis on not-self, which is a very confusing topic for a lot of people. And in the story, the last monk talked about, you know, this in some indirect way, talked about me, I am not doing anything. My ego was swept away long ago. There is no I that does anything. Sincerely, you have no I, not-self. The Arah, the person who's fully awakened, the awakened person, doesn't become some wishy-washy person, kind of just goes along and how things are and there's no self here to kind of relate to anything. So traffic lights don't mean anything and police cars don't mean anything. And whatever goes, goes, and trash is on the ground, and dirty dishes pile up in their sink. It's fine. There's no self here to be concerned about dirty dishes and no self here. I just trust the spontaneous working with my mind or whatever. The person who's enlightened, I would suggest, maybe has in a sense no self-identity, no strong sense of self around which they coalesce or which they're craving or gripping onto. But what they have in sense is a very powerful and cohering impulse towards compassion and wisdom. And there's a tremendous coherence in life. I think of someone who's fully awakened. And I'll end with a little study that was done some 20 years ago. When some psychologists went to India, or some colleges were taking these, I apologize, but I'm not pronouncing it well, Roshak, that's it, Roshak, blots. You know, you're supposed to look at these blots and then you have people interpret what they see, tell you what they see there. And based on what they see, you can kind of understand something about the psychology of the person. So they went around and did that to a lot of different people and people who meditated a lot to see if the meditation changed who they were. And they did it for people at the beginning of their three month retreat, the end of the three month retreat to see the changes. And then they went to India to do these tests on two of the people who are understood to be some of the most realized in our particular tradition of Ipasana. And they were blown away by the results, what they saw. Because as they looked at these blots of ink, their interpretation and what they saw there was Dharma teachings. That's what they saw, was teachings on wisdom and compassion. That's how they tended to see the world. It was through that filter, through that understanding. If you left here today and you were going to see the unfolding of your life over the next couple of hours, as you got in your car, you went home or went to whatever you're going to do next, a singles brunch or the meeting of gays and lesbians and so forth and cleaning the temple afterwards or whatever you had to do next. And if you were going to enter that situation, not with greed or hate or fear, but enter it with love and compassion, what would it be like for you? Maybe you can't enter it with love and compassion. But more important, almost more important, maybe more important than that, is not being able to do it with love and compassion, but to have the intention, the wish and the desire that this would be really good if you could. What would it be like to try, to have the intention, to water the seeds of that intention, to give a chance for that intention to surface. Part of what we do in meditation is many things that happens in meditation, but part of it, meditation is learning to relax. And one of the things we're relaxing is the grip of the old motivations, intentions, responses, habitual ones, the unhealthy ones, that we're kind of in the grip of often, that we're seemingly have no choice but to respond that way, or fear. And to relax that, so in that relaxed space, there's a chance for other intentions, deeper intentions, to begin filling the space. I learned at some point in my practice that if I wasn't afraid, in certain settings, certain situations, that if my mind had no fear, I didn't have to think. There would be very little thoughts in my mind. And there was a very powerful connection between fear and needing to think. And I didn't disappear, I wanted to become some zombie when the fear wasn't there. Just the mind seemed very peaceful and empty in many ways. But in that emptiness, it was like an empty container that was ready to be filled by something else. So may you all become emptier vehicles so that you can be filled with love and compassion and wisdom. So we have a couple of minutes, a few minutes, if anyone wants to make any comments or would like to ask any questions. How can you manifest intentions and long-term goals if you're intent on being alone? So how would you manifest long-term goals if you were intent on being in the moment? Well, it's possible that you have a long-term goal to be fully present. And so you have to do it in small steps to be fully present in this moment and just keep it up. But if you don't have the long-term sense of aspiration of what's possible, you might not keep it up to do it. That's one way it manifests. But just being fully present, there's a lot more that goes into being fully present. To be fully present, it's kind of like an empty container that's only a quarter full. When you're fully present, what do you bring to that? You could be a fully present thief, right? Thieves are really present. They gotta be, otherwise they end up in jail. And so what else do you bring to being fully present and having a long-term sense of, yeah, I can change myself. I can become a better person, I can become a freer person, I can become a more compassionate person. And this is something I'd like to work with in my life. And in order to do that, I have to be fully present. But in being fully present, then how do I meet what I'm present for? So I would encourage you to add a little bit more to your practice of being fully present or understand being fully present in a wider, a little bit wider view. Is that a good enough answer? Enough for you to think about? Maybe not a good answer, but if it's enough for you to think about for a while, I'm content. The value is part in my study. It can sometimes, initially. It doesn't have to, but it could. I'm just wondering where do the goals come in? Where do the goals come in? They come into our intention. I mean, where do they come from, you mean? Or how do you decide which goals? It feels, goals in this culture, it feels like contracting around a thing. Yes, it can be. So a lot of Buddhist teachers have come to the West and have talked a lot about the importance of being goalless in practice, having a practice which has no goal, has no purpose beyond itself, and letting go of everything but just being fully in the present. There's a lot of wisdom to that approach of practice. And there's two things I like to say, a number of things, a lot of things I could say about that. One is it was a really important medicine for people who grew up in Western culture, because we contract often around a goal and we compare ourselves, we strive and all that. And we just needed to relax. And having goalless practice was the best way to relax. The other is that that kind of approach to practice is also sometimes understood in Buddhism to be the highest practice. And sometimes people will take the highest practice as the only practice they're allowed to do. And there are a lot we can do in Buddhist practice, a lot that we can do in a wise life. And sometimes, one way of, one traditional understanding is that you don't do the highest practice until you have a really good foundation for it first. And so first you get the foundation in order, and then you do the highest practice of being goalless. If you do it too soon, you end up in trouble. Another thing is that goalless practice can coexist with a goal. They don't have to be exclusive of each other. So you said something about study. I think it's really valuable in any human life to spend some time reflecting on what our deepest values are. And then, and exploring it in different ways and trying to see, you know, what are the values you really want to live by. And it affects things like, you know, things like the kind of car you drive. To be goalless fully in the present moment is not going to help you decide to get a car that consumes less fuel. But to some people, that's a value they have. And there's an interesting car parked out here. I'd love to hear, the person's here, I'd love, maybe they stay afterwards and tell me about it. There's a car parked out there, a little Honda, right out here on Hopkins, that has city car share written on the side. Is that yours? Yeah. So it's not your car. You just kind of grabbed a hold of it. It's a collective in San Francisco. Collective in San Francisco, they share their cars and you've jumped in this morning and drove down here. Well, sort of. And how many people share that car? Hundreds of people share that car. It looked like a nice car. It looked clean and in good shape. And it's, you know, there's probably, saves the environment lots of things. But you don't get parking tickets in San Francisco? Sorry? You have to pay for parking meters? Are you exempt from parking meters? I see. Those are great. So isn't that great? You know, some places in the world have these bicycles that they kind of leave and everybody jumps on the bicycle in Amsterdam. Yeah. Bicycles? Yeah. It's a local right here. And so cars and you know, what if we, you know, it's like a library, right? We don't have to have the same book. We don't have to own the same book. We just go to the library and borrow it. So we have this car library. And so, you know, we don't need as many cars. So just being fully in the present moment doesn't really help a person make a decision to do something like that. Right. But you have to be fully present. You have to plan for it, right? You have to plan for it and think about it. So why, why any, any life, any life at all requires planning and thinking and intention and values. There is no life without it. And so, and it's valued to be fully present. And then it allows you, if you don't want to make that decision and that goal to join that club, that stuff, then you can let go of that. Then you drive down and you can be fully present for driving and you can let go. And you have to go let go of the, maybe you have to let go of the goal of getting down here to be, to drive well. But you have to know what direction you're going. It's like I heard the other day someone say that if you drive up to in Canada, Mount McKinley, if you're going to go drive to Mount McKinley, it's apparently really flat in the area around there, flat enough. So you can see Mount McKinley far, far in the distance. And if you want to go there on the road, you have to have an intention to get there, a long-term goal to get there. But you got to keep your eye on the road. You don't keep your eye on Mount McKinley because then you drive off the road. So you have to know when to let go of a goal and when to have it. And sometimes they work at different times. And so having a part of, part of having a goal sometimes is to reflect on it, set your, set your sights on that goal and then know how to forget it as you take the steps to get there. Yeah. I just come out of an intensity period of Soto Zen practice. And before that I did the laundry kids spirit vlog last year. And I was very interested in taking some contact with you because I know you've done both positions and I recognize a teacher of both positions. And I'm not sure there's a short way to summarize his question, but I'm curious to know, I'm curious to talk to you another time in more detail what your thoughts are about the forms of Soto Zen, whether or not you found for yourself that there just became a burden from the God in the way or whether it's better to just let go and to be in a thousand long and recognize the forms. So the question is about monastic forms. And Soto Zen has a lot of them because Soto Zen kind of brought with it monastic forms from Asia in a way that the Vipassana community hasn't. But the Vipassana world has a lot of this in the Theravadin world and its monastic environment has a lot of the same forms and some places more and some places less. So it's not really a question that needs to kind of be about Soto Zen, it could just be about forms in general. And I think that forms are very important. There's no life without forms. And some places have more formless forms and some places have more form forms, but there's always forms. And then the question is how, you know, are they useful? How are they useful? When are they useful? When are they not useful? When do they get in the way? And those are very important issues. And I found monastic forms, Soto Zen and others, to be very helpful for me and something which I learned to deeply appreciate. But the way I was taught Soto Zen was you have to at the same time see through the forms and see their emptiness and see their usefulness and the purpose and their value and kind of plunge into them at the same time as seeing that they have no ultimate value. And so I found it really lovely to just do the forms. And I never really found them to be a burden to form monastic forms. But there was a change at some point where, various changes at various times, where they lost, one change was they lost their mystique. And that was very important. They were kind of just going to aura charisma of this great, mysterious, wonderful practice. And they just became these forms. We do and they have value and their kind of child's play. When I went to the kitchen at Tassajara, when I started the year in the kitchen, the kitchen seemed kind of so big and daunting and challenging and confusing place to be. And I was intimidated and all that. After spending a whole year in the kitchen, the kitchen seemed so small and so easy. And I was so big in relationship to it. And I could just spin around. I became huge. I'd grown physically. And so my whole relationship to that, changed from being kind of intimidated and small in the midst of it. So same thing with monastic forms. When I started, I was an intimidated little kid. And at some point, to some degree, a little bit, I grew up and this form just seemed kind of... Would you say you outgrew them? You sort of grew out of that whole way of practicing? Did I grow out of it? I'm not really reluctant to say that. That I outgrew them. But I'm not following those forms so much these days, in a strict sense. I think some of the value that they had, a lot of the value they had when I was in, earlier in my life, when I was kind of immersed in that world, no longer serves that value anymore. But I don't want to say that I've grown them. Okay. So many thanks for this morning. And it's nice to be here. And I wish you all well on your short-term and long-term goals.
