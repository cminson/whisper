 
 Practice  Note:  Connecting  to the 
Present  Moment  
 
Transcribed  and edited  from  a short  talk by Gil

One of the interesting  reference  points  for 
mindfulness  practice  is the distance  or obstructions  
you have  in being  present  for what’s  here and now.  
If you are pulled  into the world  of your thoughts  – 
thinking  about  the past,  the future , or a fantasy  – it’s 
good  to take a moment  to notice  how this create s 
distance  from the actual  world  here: your experience  
of breathing,  being  in your body , or stepping  as you 
walk.   
 
Get a sense  of how, when  you hopefully  shift into 
the present  moment , you are mindful  of something  
specific,  like the sensations  of your feet on the 
ground,  sensations  of the body,  or what  you see. 
Sometimes  seeing  is a good  exercise  for what  I’m 
talking  about.  When  you are present,  it is possible  to  
see when  the obscuration  or distance  in being  
caught  up in thought  is no longer  there.  It’s been  
cleared  away  a little bit. Begin  to appreciate , see, or 
understand  how thinking  distances  you from your  
 present  lived experience , and obscures  you from 
yourself  so that you’re  not really  connected  to what’s  
here.   
 
It can be a very helpful  to understand  that because  
you get a sense  that drifting  off into thinking  is not 
valuable  because  you’re  now in a virtual  reality , an 
imaginary  world. You can get a sense  of how you’re  
not connected , and that it would  actually  be richer  
and more  valuable  to be grounded,  connected,  here,  
alive – rather  than lost in a personal  world  that takes  
you away  from being  connected  to the world  that is 
here.   
 
To summarize : when  you find yourself  strongly  
drifting  off into thought,  notice  how that create s a 
sense  of distance  or obscuration  from the world  
that’s  here and now.  You’re  not really  here in some  
vivid,  clear  way. Sometimes  it can be quite  dramatic , 
and you literally  can hardly  see what’s  going  on 
around  you because  you’re  so absorbed  in some  
wonderful  or horrible  fantasy , or so strongly  involved  
in some  other  preoccupation  of the mind.   
 
The more  you understand  how this works , the easier  
it will probably  be to not do that when  you meditate , 
and instead  to really  be here.   
  
 I hope  that is helpful  today.
