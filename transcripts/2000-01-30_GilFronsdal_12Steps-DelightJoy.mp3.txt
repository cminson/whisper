 So there's a distinction which periodically is made between being and doing. And usually when people make the distinction they consider doing the problem. And certainly it's our doings which tend to cause our sufferings. But not all doing causes suffering. But because so many people are so striving so much or so overly actively doing, trying to do too much or too ambitious in the doing, that people point to the doing as being a problem. And if you just rest in your being, just be, then everything will be just fine. And one of the unfortunate manifestations of this is a misunderstanding that being is just a passive phenomenon. Just like being Mr. Natural just hangs out and doesn't do anything. And not understanding that out of being can come and doing also. So in Buddhism this distinction doesn't exist between being and doing. It doesn't quite represent Buddhism either, but just begin to get to there and do the steps. The distinction in Buddhism is more like between being and becoming. And what's problematic in Buddhism is the movement of becoming. And becoming here means doing things with a little extra agenda. Doing things in order to become someone in a way that is a little bit anxiety producing and erotic. It creates kind of artificial senses of who we are. So a very, very mundane example is you can choose the clothes you're going to wear out of functionality. And perhaps some people have roles they have to play. So they wear clothes that belong to that role. Or you can choose the clothes you wear out of a need or desire to impress people. And then the need to impress people is an extra bit of becoming. We want to become something in the eyes of other people. Or we want to become something in our own eyes in order to create an impression, in order to create a sense of identity. We want people to see us in particular way. So it isn't just simply putting on clothes for its function of keeping us warm or wherever. But it's putting on clothes for this movement of becoming, creating something, making us into something that maybe we're not exactly. And so this movement of becoming, of creating, making us ourselves into something to make an impression to ourselves and to other people to create a sense of identity. In Buddhism, it's explained, tends to cause a lot of suffering. Now, the opposite side of that distinction of just being, being versus becoming. Being is a little bit simplistic also because being implies just being the status quo. So if you're the kind of person who likes to impress people, well, I'm just going to continue being that way. Thank you. So in the sense of being, being can be understood as just kind of, well, I'm just going to accept who I am and who I am as a, you know, person who's constantly trying to create a self-identity that everyone else sees. Then I'll just continue that way. The distinction is more Buddhistic, maybe between, and this doesn't work in English, of course, between becoming and unbecoming, being becoming, being unbecoming. And maybe the better word, the more Buddhist word actually is between, is between the distinction of becoming and the unfabricated, the unmade, the unconstructed. And the sense of doing that Buddhism kind of in a sense points that is that, that functioning of life, that functioning of our mind, of consciousness, which doesn't have to make anything happen, which doesn't have to, that aspect of awareness of consciousness, which is unbecoming, which is unmanufactured, uncreated. Most of our states of mind that we live in are not our fabricated states of mind. They're states of mind that arise because we want to create something. We have an expectation of what's supposed to happen. And so we're trying to, the mind is in propelled forward with that expectation, with a desire, that ambition, or that aversion. And the mind is constantly preoccupied, is a very good word, preoccupied with the objects of the mind, with the objects of awareness. And the way in which the mind is preoccupied with its concerns creates the kind of consciousness that you have any one moment. So if you are preoccupied with an object of desire, and you're really lusting after that, or really you know, desiring it, or preoccupied and getting it, that shakes that consciousness for that moment, that consciousness is conscious, which is concerned with making something happen. When you're filled with aversion for something, and you really hate something, you really want to push it away. I don't want that. Then it's a consciousness which is, as a making, is part of it. It's a constructive, creative consciousness. How that consciousness in that moment is made, is made out of that aversion. Today in a Sunday paper, we got a came in plastic wrap. I don't know if it happens to you. We get the chronicle. Inside the chronicle was this little jar, small jar of a steam, kind of very small jar of anti-wrinkle cream. So what state of consciousness gets born, gets created, when this wonderful little anti-wrinkle cream, you're right, shows up. Is it a state of mind, is it a consciousness, which is what gets created, the consciousness gets created, is there a consciousness, an awareness of mind, which, oh great, this is a great thing. I really always wanted to have a face without any wrinkles. Here's my chance. And you're so filled with desire. Or is it a consciousness and awareness which is born out of aversion? Oh, all my wrinkles, I've been reminded of them. I just woke up at Sunday morning. I wasn't thinking about it. And now I get the paper, oh my God, you know, it's embarrassing. And you know, and I hate my face. And so that kind of consciousness gets born. It's also possible to have a consciousness or a state of mind or a mind which is unbecoming or unmade, is better word, uncreated, unfabricated, which is not fabricated out of our desire, not fabricated out of our aversion, not fabricated out of our reactivity, out of a desire to become something or to be something or push something away or obliterate something. But rather, doesn't create anything, doesn't want to create anything, and maybe isn't created by anything also. So becoming versus becoming, which in Buddhism is a problem, versus the unmade mind, the unmade presence, a presence of being, which doesn't need anything to happen, doesn't need, they're not trying to create anything to happen. So in the kind of analysis of the human condition, Buddhism tends to be process oriented, that human condition is involved in processes. And so there's a stick on the process, which is the process of becoming. And the process of becoming is cyclical, goes in a circle. So, and there's another process which is a process towards freedom, towards the unmade, towards that presence which is an unfabricated, that doesn't need anything to happen, doesn't want anything to happen, doesn't want to make something happen, but just resting in what's called the unfabricated. And that is not a circle, but rather some people call it a spiral, but some people just, when they diagram it, just have a straight line out, straight line. But it doesn't go circular, it doesn't come back and feed itself. So these two kind of processes are very important in Buddhism, and both of them begin with dukkha. And two weeks, a few weeks ago, I talked about suffering. As many of you know, our suffering is, the dukkha, as I said, usually suffering in English, is kind of often the beginning place where Buddhists like to analyze the human condition. Because Buddhism is concerned about how to end suffering. So we start there, and we look at that part of human life, like a doctor. You know, if you have, you know, some kind of, you know, if you have gallstones, you know, and that's your condition, you know, your aim, you go to the doctor and say, you know, we're having some trouble. And they say, well, yes, well, you know, it was more your wondering, you know, how your, your angle of toenail is. How's that doing today? You don't want your suffering in gallstone infection or whatever it is. You don't want the doctor to ask about your toenails. You want them to really deal with the issue at hand, which is the gallstone. So Buddhism, if you want to be free of the suffering, you say you should study your suffering. The word dukkha is better translated, perhaps, as a generic word in English, as unsatisfactoriness. And maybe in a way that can be understood by, be understood by many of us in our lives, is in the Buddha said that life has inherent aspect of unsatisfactoriness. Maybe another way of saying is life is built into an inherent sense of limitation. All of us as human beings are living limited human lives. We cannot follow unlimited opportunities. There's limitation. As we get older, there's more and more limitations in our body, puts on us, a mind puts on us, have circumstances, places under. And there's always some limitation. So the mind, in a sense, the fabricated mind, the mind that wants the mind to have the version, just wants to have unlimited opportunities to do whatever it wants. But we encounter the world which puts limitations on us and some people put closer limitations than others. So the word dukkha maybe can be translated into English as limitation. How do we cope with the inherent limitations of being a human being? And some of these limitations we don't see until they actually occur. And I love it. I've said it many times now that Sunday morning we're sitting literally right on top of the San Andreas Fault. Maybe none of you will come back now. And you know we're sitting here quite happily and contently and the floor is very solid, thank you. You know it seems like we can trust the validity of the floor. But if it suddenly just for a moment and I just buckled very nicely when wave goes through and you always thought that asphalt, you know slab floors were quite solid. So there's inherent limitations like that, you know, that we can't rely on the solidity of the floors on the earth. So how do we relate to limitation? How do we relate to things which are unsatisfactory? How do we relate to the sufferings of our life when our life suffers? So Bruton tends to begin the analysis there. And then there's two forks that arise without our encounter with suffering. And to realize these two forks is very important so you can choose the right fork. One fork is cyclical and that is the fork of becoming. So we encounter some unsatisfactories of life, limitations of life. And then desire arises, we would like it to be different. We would like to have more happiness, we would like to have more greater sense of identity, we'd like to have a Porsche, we'd like to have all kinds of nice things we'd like to have. And that desire in itself is pretty innocent, perhaps. We don't want to make a problem about a simple desire. But that desire very quickly, to be immediately, is entangled with craving. I gotta have this. It has to happen. You know, a desire which is just kind of just floating is fine, but a desire which then is channeled into energy, into contraction in the body, into action. Brutism calls it craving. It can be called craving. And craving is a demand for something to be a certain way. As it presents demand or expectation or a certain neediness, this is the way it needs to be. And that's so, so desire gives birth to craving. And craving, as we follow through on that, gives birth to becoming, to becoming something. Something manufactured, something created comes into being. And what is, it can be simply a habit formation, that every time we act out of hate or act out of clinging or desire or craving, we create the conditions, the habit conditions, to first respond that way more in the future. I've seen in my own mind that days where I tend to be filled with lots of desire and really trying to do a lot of things and get a lot done. And then I sit down to meditate. I can feel the momentum of that craving in my mind. And it makes me kind of impatient when I sit there. It kind of creates a trick in my mind that there's more important things to be done here. I've got to get the stuff done, you know. I've got to, if you know, whatever it is. And it can be very compelling, the momentum of desire, the momentum of making and becoming and creating that the mind gets into. It can be very innocent, the things that we have to get done in our life. But we get involved in them and kind of ahead of ourselves. We can go within kind of a desperation or neediness that has to be done. And when that happens, if you sit down, what you'll notice is the momentum is there of habit formation, of creating and making and doing. And you can sit down to meditate and it can be seen so much more important to defrost the freezer than it is to continue sitting there because of the momentum is still there. And that movement of becoming, that kind of becoming Buddhism is talking about, then creates something and that creation of it creates suffering for no other reason because it's impermanent and it passes away. But in that, the kind of becoming, the kind of manufacturing of a state of consciousness, a kind of mind we make that involves cleaning the contraction in its making tends then to lead to further suffering. Something becomes, it's impermanent, it passes away, we're disappointed. Something becomes and we create a certain habit formation of reacting that way in the future. And so it tends to create further and other points of suffering as a result of falling through on that. And then we're back at the beginning of the cycle again. How do we react and respond to suffering? So it can be a cycle where we react in a certain way to unsatisfactory limitations of life. And that itself creates further suffering and so we react the same way again. Does it make some sense to you? And so it becomes a cycle of reactivity, a cycle of reactivity over and over again. We react maybe in the same similar ways. And many people live their lives in these cycles, over and over and over again, these cycles. We react a certain way, that reaction creates the conditions for further suffering. We react the same way again because we don't like suffering and so it goes around and around. The other process is a process towards the unfabricated, towards the unmade presence, towards the unmade consciousness or mind, the unfabricated. And that begins also by our encounter with suffering. But we choose to relate to suffering in a different way. And we choose to relate to suffering not through our normal reactions of greed or hate or desire or wishing of fear. But rather we see that in that suffering is, that suffering is there because of the way that we've chosen to relate to the world. And we're going to choose now to relate a different way. And we're going to choose to relate to the world by not reacting to it. We're going to choose to react to the suffering that we encounter, the specific suffering we encounter by beginning to bring a spiritual practice to it. We're going to see it as an opportunity, as a place to begin a different way, a whole different way of relating to the world. So three weeks ago I talked about suffering and talked a lot about this, about how we work with suffering, we practice with suffering. We didn't see it as an opportunity to not be in a reactive mode, but we see it as an opportunity to practice mindfulness, to practice awareness, to practice just being with it and seeing what happens when we just be with it rather than reacting to it. The and then the following week I talked about faith, if you remember, confidence. The process of leading towards freedom, leading towards the unmade presence, the unfabricated presence, begins with suffering and then there's 12 steps that the Buddha laid out. The first step is just encountering suffering, having a wise relationship to suffering, understanding the nature of our limitations, the nature of our unsatisfactress of life, the nature of our suffering, the nature of how we create our suffering. It's very important to understand this really well and then see if we can relate to the suffering in a wiser way. And that wiser way of relating suffering hopefully gives birth to confidence or trust or faith. Oh, I know another way. I know a way that doesn't lend me to endless cycles of repetition. I know a way that leads me towards freedom, to the possibility of not being caught up in my reactivity. And to know it, which are the examples of other people who have done that. The Buddha is a great model, but other people who have stepped off the endless cycles of constantly reacting. And to have some confidence in that that's a possibility, to stop the normal reactivities. So suffering is a prerequisite for that kind of confidence. Oh, it's possible not to continue this. That confidence then is a prerequisite for the next step of these 12 steps. And that is surprisingly is delight. And the third step is delight. And the fourth step is joy. Isn't this great? So you've been waiting for this, you know? You've been talking so much about suffering. Where's the joy? Where's the delight? The delight and the joy. So out of all encounter with suffering, there needs to be some experience of confidence that there isn't another way. Than being mired in this process. It has to be another way, then opening up the Sunday paper and seeing the anti-wrinkle priest. That's been another way than just simply, you know, suffering because of it. You know, oh my God, you know, this is such a small container. I wonder, we know, not enough for one day, even what kind of stores open. And I don't know if gas in my car. And, you know, and, and to get, you know, but I have to drive down there, you know, and get it. But then I've done and get it. I'm driving this car. I don't want anybody to see me in it because it's so old and beat up. And, you know, I better maybe I can go rent the car. So people see me in a nicer way. So I can go to the store and, you know, the kind of stores that sell these things, you know, probably are more upscale stores and upscale car. You know, and so off the mind goes, right? But rather than just see that, you see, oh, being to suffer against his reaction, there must be another way to this, another way. And there's some confidence in the other way. And that confidence beginning to pull us out of that reactive mode of being. There's some confidence that there's another way we don't have to follow that road. So after the confidence comes to light. And this is very difficult for us Westerners to understand. What the Father blew to find this delight out of this confidence in another way comes to reflection. Yes, I'm going to follow this other way. And that requires me to have a certain level of self respect. It's very difficult to follow a spiritual life unless we have a certain level of self respect and self contentment. And this is self respect that comes from knowing that when we decided to follow the other way, really clear for us, we're going to follow the other way. That I am not going, I'm not no longer going to lead an unethical life. I'm no longer going to lead a life which harms other people. I'm not going to lead a life that involves stealing, even small things. I'm not going to lead a life that leads to my callous disregarding life of other beings, either in insects. I'm going to be very careful with my conduct from this point onwards. I might have done terrible things in the past. From this point onward, I'm really going to decide I'm going to try to live a better life. And you agree to better life is all what we have to negotiate, what's workable for you. But as a some degree, I'm going to work a better life. I'm going to live a better life. The Buddha's expectation was that once you make that decision, that to some degree, you're going to live a better life. You're going to feel the light based on that decision. How easy is it for you? Do you guys feel some delight when you decide to live a better life? Great. So the Buddha, you have to feel that delight. That delight is really great. It's really important to have that kind of delight, to choose to live a better life. And from the moment you decide that, to take to rejoice, to feel delight in that now you're living that way to some degree, trying to at least. So the delight of feeling some self-respect, the delight of feeling some personal sense of integrity, the delight of knowing that there's another way of living here, is the right of knowing I can begin to take some responsibility for the choices that my mind makes, choices of what I chase after or what I avert. So this, of course, takes mindfulness. And that's why it's a mindfulness practice. We begin practicing to be mindful of our choices, mindful of our behavior, mindful of what we do with our mind. And we then choose to do a better job. And from that, hopefully, you're supposed to feel delight. But it's not so easy for a lot of Westerners to feel the delight in themselves, because the conditioning of feeling bad about ourselves and being convinced that something is wrong with us, fundamentally, is so ingrained in some of us. The cycles of reactivity, cycles of becoming get really embedded in our psyche. And one of the ways it gets embedded is feelings of tremendous lack of confidence, tremendous sense of lack of self-esteem, tremendous sense of of I'm unworthy. And it becomes a kind of self-perpetuating cycle of becoming. And you need to have very strong mindfulness sometimes to step out of that cycle so that we can begin experiencing some delight in who we are, in the choices we make. And it's really helpful to have that sense of life. The Buddha put it as a third step. You encounter suffering. From your encounter to suffering, from your wisdom and understanding of another possibility comes a confidence. That confidence grows with time. From that confidence then comes a short decision to live a different life. Now to add a spiritual life to all the life, not to think that the world is full of unlimited opportunities. I'm just going to barrel ahead and do exactly what I was doing before. No changes at all. But I'm going to have this sprinkling of spirituality in there, supposed to lubricate it and make it all just perfect. I think that some people operate that way. And I think that's really naive. But to have this but out of that confidence that another way is possible to choose to live a little different life. I don't know how different are you. But at least a life maybe that is ethical. And then to feel the light in that. If you were, if you've been taking pencils from work or the equivalent of that, I don't know what it is, the equivalent of that might be. But no one's told you you can do that. You decide I'm going to stop doing that. Can that be a source of the light as opposed to, oh yeah, I'm not doing it, you know, boy, my foolish. The source of the life is joy from that. So from that delight and that's a condition that helps us feel joy, which is the fourth step in this process towards freedom. And joy is a very important element of meditation, the spiritual life. So the question is, how can we cultivate joy? How can joy become part and parcel of our spiritual life? Without some degree of joy, it's very hard to get concentrated. Without some degree of joy, it's very hard to have a healthy kind of peacefulness. The fifth step is peace, peacefulness. There's some peace or contentment or ease of being. Without some joy, it's hard to have some ease or peace. Without some ease and peace, it's hard to get concentrated. Without being concentrated, it's hard to have happiness. And without some degree of happiness, it's hard to see what's really true in life. Without really seeing what's true, it's really hard to do the deeper work of choosing the unfabricated, choosing going in the direction of that presence which is not created by anything. We're turning away subtly from the constant cycles of fabrication of creating. And without turning away from the constant patterns of creation, it's hard for the set of mind to totally completely free. So we have suffering, we have confidence, we have delight. It comes from a kind of reflection about our integrity. And then comes joy, the fourth step. Can you allow yourself to experience joy in your meditation at least? Can you look for joy? Can you appreciate the arising of joy? It's not always there by any means, but maybe it's there more often than you realize. Maybe it's something you can cultivate more in your meditation. I know for me, if I sit down to meditate and I'm quite agitated, or I'm suffering around something, I have a certain element of joy. Because I know how healthy and useful it is to sit down and meditate and create a space of awareness around that agitation. I actually feel some joy from that. Wow, this is really great. I have enough experience now. This is a really fantastic thing to do. And I actually feel some joy wells up inside of me in the midst of all that agitation and difficulty I might have. To experience your breathing and maybe to find is there some sense of joy or comfort or ease in the breathing as we breathe. Sometimes there can be. And then to allow that sense of joy to arise and to tickle you, to delight you, to feed you. The word joy is in Pali's Pithi. And sometimes in Buddhism is translated in other ways besides joy. Sometimes it's translated by the word enthusiasm. Sometimes by the word interest. The joy that's born out of this kind of joy is the joy that's born out of real interest in the process of freedom. Real interest in paying attention to carefully to our breathing or to whatever the focus of our attention might be. To feel as valuable as has purpose that leads to freedom. You know, I think many of us have the experience when really engaged in some activity we really love doing. The sense of time might drop away. The sense of our concerns and even the world drops away. We're just totally involved in our activity or our hobby or whatever it might be. The interest is really powerful. It's possible to have a level of timeless interest, enthusiasm for something like our breathing or our mindfulness meditation, just moment by moment. What's happening now? What's happening now? And to begin cultivating that interest. This is really interesting to do that. My breath or my moment-to-moment experience is so interesting. It actually has greater value than sitting here wondering about anti-wrinkle cream or wondering about cock payments or wondering about, you know, what videos are meant for tonight or whatever, you know, the direction your mind might go. It seems so interesting in the moment. As our interest in the meditation, we can feel more settled and committed, have more confidence. I'm going to sit here and be here in the present moment with this activity, with this focus. Greater and greater interest comes and great enthusiasm comes. It comes like a feedback. There's another, there's a healthy cycle. The greater the interest, the greater the joy, the greater the joy, the greater the interest. And so the joy that can arise sometimes in meditation sometimes is called the rapture. And the Buddhist text describes five different kinds of rapture you might experience in your meditation. There's minor joy or minor rapture. There's a momentary rapture. I'm not sure if I have the best translating, but cascading or... Cascading maybe is the best word. Cascading, excuse me, like waves washing over you one way off the other. It's a wave, it's huge. It's kind of like an orgasm to, you know, 10 degrees more strong, or you know, 10 times stronger than an orgasm because it's so thoroughly. There's a ways of cascading, pounding, full bodily wave of this rapture of joy that just passes through the body. And then there can be a transporting joy, the fourth kind we show. It feels like you're being lifted off the ground. In the ancient texts they say it's actually are. You can actually fly different places when you have this level of joy. I don't know, but it feels that way. And then there can be the joy of... and then the last fifth one is all-pervading. You feel like a balloon which has been blown up to its capacity. It feels a filled capacity, just bursting, really diverse with delight. But whether it's that intense or whether it's just very kind of small, subtle joy, joy is a very important element of the path. But nor do you feel joy. There has to be a sense that it's not only okay to feel it, but that it's appropriate to feel it. And then maybe it's there more often than you realize. And it's a matter of kind of looking for it or relaxing or open into the possibility of it being there. Because when we're so consumed with our preoccupations, our preoccupations don't allow us any space in the mind to notice the joy that might be there. And there's a lot more joy in our lives than most people will admit or allow for. It doesn't take much to experience some joy for many people. Maybe this is a dramatic example, but yesterday I went to the beach with my son. I just, you know, we had this wonderful time on the beach together and then we went and put him in the car seat with myself in the front seat of the car. And for some reason he was really content sitting there. And I gave him his cracker. He was eating his cracker. And he was content to be left alone for a while. And I was all concerned about making sure he was happy and anything. And there was this movement of becoming, this movement of preoccupation and concern. And, you know, the cycle of my reactivity to him. He has to be happy and I have to make him happy and make sure he's well fed. Because if I don't, then he's going to want even more from me. And I was like, could a little bit preoccupine this world of taking care of him, you know, a sick little world of parenting. And it took me a while to realize that he was basically, he didn't need anything from me. I probably could have realized a little bit earlier. But, you know, I was like, you know, my cycles, right? I thought, hey, wow, I can do anything. I need to sit here and relax in the dark with you and look out at the ocean. And all this joy was right there. You know, it wasn't very far away. All I had to do was stop my preoccupation with his happiness. And it was there. Oh, at the ocean. Looking at the big waves. I don't know if that was a good example for you, but... So I thought I was talking about this today because I had noticed that in one week, a few weeks ago, I talked about suffering. And the following week, I talked about faith or trust or confidence. And then I remembered, actually, that's the beginning of this 12 steps towards freedom that the Buddha laid out, the process towards freedom. That's the alternative to the process, the cyclic process of becoming and suffering. So then I'll talk a little bit about joy, delight and joy. I'm going to better explain where it comes from, why I'm doing it now. So that's my thoughts for today. I didn't cover joy and delight very well, but... You're not going to be terrified like that, are you? Okay. So we have five minutes. If you want to react, you have comments or questions. Do you see what I said? Yes. I was working with William Kaini's presentation by then. I was wondering if the difference between may I be happy or the affirmation for the new age of I am happy. What do you think you're feeling when you're talking about one's feelings and kind of connection? Or why do you feel may I be happy? I am. So I can feel joy, just the fact that she asked that question. Oh. She wants to know the difference between the Buddhist loving kindness meditation, where the phrase is, may I be happy, versus what she called the new age practice of affirmation, where you say I am happy. She seems to be related. And I then kind of start the question immediately by just pointing you taking an opportunity to point out that I could have been very preoccupied with her answer. And with my sense of becoming, are there a pleaser, have I had a wise answer, or you know, all these people are listening, us with the teacher, you know, and in order to be a teacher, I better kind of have a good answer for all of you. And that's the cycle of becoming. I need to become something and create something, a good answer. And that just creates more suffering to do that kind of way. Or I could just kind of take a moment and relax and not be preoccupied with that. And that's a great question. And the fact that she's a human being is interested in that kind of question actually brings the light to me. I mean, wow, someone who tries to explore this issue of loving kindness and happiness and how it comes about. It's great. So I take the opportunity to feel more joy in the question than I do in how good this answers. But you're still ready for an answer. I know it very well. So the difference between an affirmation I am happy and may I be happy? It might be that you are happy and being reminded of that by affirmation might be the really wise thing to do. I think there tends to be more happiness under the surface if we just turn to it than sometimes we realize. If we're really preoccupied sometimes. But the movement of affirmation sometimes, and the reason I distrust it, is because sometimes, not always, it tends to be an overlay of a demand. This is the way things should be. And sometimes it does change our consciousness and we can feel happier as a result. But it tends to have a happiness which is all too easily kind of a superficial overlay on top of the actual movements of our psychology. And Buddhism tends to focus more on understanding what our reactive psychology in a deeper way so we can uproot it once and for all rather than to overlay a nice veneer over it. Loving kindness practice, may I be happy? Or it gets born out of some confidence that, yes, it's possible to be happy. I might not be happy right now. It's possible to be happy. And it's a really beautiful thing to have that intention that I'd be happy. I don't know if I'm going to... It's kind of like, the may I be happy intention is kind of like, Buddhism doesn't say this because it's not a theistic religion, but it's kind of like saying may I be happy? God willing. You know, it's like your intention is there and that intention is very powerful. It kind of plants a seed which gives fruit. But we don't know when. That intention is a beautiful thing in and of itself. And if you properly understood it, to have that intention for your own happiness can bring happiness itself. And it's not a good thing to have that intention you want to be happy, but the desire for the intention when done wisely is a happiness producing state of mind. So sometimes if you say may I be happy? When I say may I be happy? Something like happiness is just right there. And I just feel all this happiness just in the moment. That's all it takes. I say may I be happy? May I wish for that happiness to be there? And sometimes it's not there, but the fact that I'm practicing and fueling or in a sense or feeding the intention, may I be happy? Conditions me in the future. Just happiness to be more likely to arise and to surface. So the loving kindness practice is strengthening an intention. The affirmation is kind of an overlay. And the intention I think of it that hopefully with the loving kindness it's strengthening an intention which is sincere. I am happy as an affirmation. May or may not be sincere. It may be born out of tremendous aversion or your state of being. So okay, I am happy no matter what. So is that approaching an acceptable answer? I just wanted to know when it creates a cycle of becoming. Well, it's a little bit awkward to say this, but they both create cycles of becoming. Loving kindness meditation also creates a cycle of becoming, but it's a healthier cycle. It is you can you can participate in the cycle becoming in healthier and unhealthier ways. And there are healthy ways they still perpetuate the cycle of becoming and creation and becoming. But loving kindness participates in the cycle that tends to create a healthier cycle. It's possible they're really healthy cycles. There's a lot of happiness in joining it, but still cyclical and it's not the same thing as freedom. But the loving kindness as it creates a healthier cycle makes for much better jumping off place for freedom to happen. Yes. Oh, maybe ties to what I just said now that in the cyclic, the cyclic world of becoming, we can create a. Maybe it's like the cyclic world like a cylinder. But it's like it's like a hoop. And on that and we go around the mountain, the cylinder. And if we end down the bottom of the film, there's like a can, right? And on the can, it's all rusted and kind of, you know, kind of sharp and painful. And then you get to the top where it's been kind of above the moisture or whatever. It's really smooth and shiny and just just like you can just kind of put your ice skates on, just kind of skate around really easily. You know, happily. But you still. Also just skillful, which are conducive towards going up higher in a cylinder and unholstered actions are conducive to going down through the rust in the sharp corners are and stuff. And they just say differently that the choices we make, but how are we going to choose to act have consequences? And if we choose to act out of hate, that means when the circle comes around again, what goes around comes around, they say, right? So if we act out of hate, it tends to condition further suffering and further habit formations of hate. It tends to drop us in lower level on the cylinder. If we act out of love, what comes around goes around, what goes around comes around. So we act on love. It comes around again for the becoming. But we tend to float up to the top of the cylinder, which really nice. We're still in the cylinder. Freedom is getting off the cylinder. It's easier to get up to the cylinder if you're not at the bottom with all the rust and all that. Which will be very difficult. So so so right action is the action that tends to help us with the conditions so that it's easier for us to step off. So, for example, if you if you just did a whole bunch of awful things last week, just did a lot of terrible things, a little lost, consumed in desire and ambition or consumed with hate and ill will towards everyone else around you, just consumed in all this stuff. When you sit out to meditate, that momentum is still there. It's very hard to see, oh, I have a different, I have another, I have a different choice. It just seems so compelling to be filled with hate or ambition. But if you choose to act out of more love and out of more generosity, then you sit out to meditate, and you're going to sit down to meditate. That blood and generosity probably hasn't created the same force of preoccupation. And it's going to be a lot easier to see, oh, it's possible to to respond to this in a nonreactive way. And therefore, you're stepping off the cycles of reactivity. Could make some sense? The goal in action. In or the goal is, I think I said in action, in acting. Oh, yeah, the goal is in action. The goal is, in a sense, is to know that there is a possibility to know, experience, the unfabricated, the unmade aspect of reality, an unmade, unfabricated mind. That does not need us to become passive, but rather leads us to actions, to activity in the world, which is not tainted by anything extra. Any sense of ego, any sense of wanting to become something, any sense of trying to create something for the mind. There's no, as some people say, there's no traces in the action, no traces of ego. So people who are enlightened still go around doing all kinds of stuff. You know, they go pee and eat their food and help other people and do different things, but there's nothing extra about it. There's an un-fabricated aspect to it. There's a presence, kind of like a sense of there's a presence, but they're at home in, which doesn't require them to be anything for anyone, including for themselves. But just discover that presence, it's helpful to create healthy conditions. Like the life, like the, the life that arises out of you, feeling your integrity, creates healthy conditions that becomes, makes it a lot easier than to step out of the cycle of directivity into that unfabricated presence. And how you choose to act, once you're in that untrabricated presence, that's up to you. Buddhism doesn't tend to give a prescription, how you're supposed to be when you're there. Maybe. So. So this is, this teaching that I kind of did very briefly today is considered to be a very profound part of Buddhist teaching and Buddhist practice. And if it didn't make any sense, because I covered it too quickly or too as simple as sickly, I apologize. And if it confused you, just, you know, it was very valuable to grapple with it and try to understand it better. It confused you. But if it really bugs you, then just leave it here. So thank you for your listening so carefully.
