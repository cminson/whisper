The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Okay, so welcome, welcome, welcome everybody.
It's nice to see you all.
It's a beautiful thing that we're doing, coming together and practicing together.
Kind of touching into the heart, making space for each other and for ourselves.
And today I wanted to talk a little bit about, before I turned on the recording, I mentioned that some of you have been coming for years regularly.
It's a beautiful thing. It's a beautiful thing.
And it might be that sometimes you come and you feel like, okay, I'm not even sure why I'm doing this.
It's enjoyable, but whether or maybe it's not even enjoyable sometimes.
Maybe it's made a whole range of experiences.
We might feel like I'm not sure if this is doing anything for my mind or heart, but I think it is.
So I think I'll just keep on going.
And I want to say something about this idea of a little bit of persistence or a little bit of just keep going this with the idea that just a tiny, tiny little step at a time.
It doesn't have to be that every significant time that we show up for happy hour or meditate in whatever way has to be with new insights or heart opening, mind blowing.
It doesn't have to be any of these really grand experiences.
There's something about just again and again bringing our hearts and minds to give it an opportunity for them to be quiet, to settle.
And for us to do this in a way that's with a caring attitude, with a warm heartedness about it.
So I'd like to read this poem by Rosemary Traumer.
Many of you will not be surprised. I love this poet Rosemary Traumer. She's just amazing.
And as it happened, I just was looking at Neil and I could see as soon as I said this name, he went to go like maybe go find this poem because he often puts them into the forum.
And it's one of the things that I share or Nikki shares, which is a very nice thing. Thank you Neil for doing that.
So this poem is called How the Healing Happens.
And it goes like this.
Again, today, I dig with my teaspoon into the soil of sorrow.
I said there is healing water somewhere below.
Perhaps I wished for a shovel.
Perhaps there was no shovel to be found.
Perhaps I did find a shovel, but the work was too heavy, too hard.
It is not hard to dig one teaspoon at a time.
No one can do it.
The hole gets wider deeper.
Soon it feels like a well.
It's easy work.
It is the hardest work I've ever done.
I thirst.
Yet what heals us is not only the promised water.
What heals is the work itself.
Dry and slow.
One spoonful.
And another spoonful.
And another parched spoonful.
And another.
What heals us is not only the promised water.
What heals us is the work itself.
Dry and slow.
One spoonful.
And another spoonful.
And another parched spoonful.
And another.
I appreciate this very much.
So often.
And I know this certainly has been the case in my life.
I had this idea that things needed to be efficient.
And so therefore like to get a shovel and just, you know, do it.
Exhaust oneself with a shovel.
That was like the best way to do it.
You know, just get in there and attack whatever needed to be done.
But, you know, it turns out.
That's not necessarily the best way.
And I would say.
Especially with our hearts and our minds.
It's not about efficiency.
It is not about efficiency.
It's not about linearity.
It's not about the most simple or straightforward.
But it's something about just coming back again and again.
Which is one teaspoon.
One teaspoon full.
And to gain a well.
So we can apply this in so many different ways to our practice.
Including, of course, our loving kindness practice.
So.
Please join me as we with one teaspoon at a time.
We do some meditation practice.
So.
Hmm.
We'll start with some mindfulness and.
And do some loving kindness.
Taking a posture that.
As comfort.
As well as uprightness.
Some ease.
As well as a commitment to being present.
Feeling into this moment.
What is it like to be here now?
What is it like in the body?
What is it like in the mind?
As if it were okay, however it is.
We're just gently inquiring.
As we breathe in and out.
Tuning into the sensations of breathing.
Feeling the rhythm.
The stretching.
And.
Keeping it simple.
As we breathe in and out.
As we breathe in and out.
Begin again.
As we breathe in and out.
As we breathe in and out.
As we breathe in and out.
As we breathe in and out.
As we breathe in and out.
As we breathe in and out.
And then to begin our loving-kindness practice, starting where it's easy and complicated,
readily accessible, not being in any hurry to fix something, but instead just allowing
ourselves to feel nourished, supported by loving-kindness, by tuning into where it's
easy. There's a person for whom, when you bring them to mind, there's just a little
bit of delight, a lot of delight. Somebody you know, or maybe there's somebody that has
really touched you with their teachings or writings. Or maybe right now it feels more
accessible to connect with imaginary kittens, puppies, babies, and connect with the lovable
being. And if it's there, doesn't have to be, it's perfectly fine if it isn't. But
if there is a little upwelling in the heart, allowing yourself to feel that as you connect
with the lovable being.
And to support our intention of cultivating loving-kindness, you can say these phrases,
kind of, are an anchor that we can return to again and again as a support for our cultivating
loving-kindness. May you be safe. May you be happy.
May you be healthy. May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
Connecting with the lovable being. Modifying the phrases if that feels comfortable for you.
Feels more resonant for you.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
And then to extend our loving-kindness to include ourselves. Of course we include ourselves.
Feeling into this moment, this body, this experience.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
Reading from this poem.
Again today I dig with my teaspoon into the soil of sorrow.
It is said there is healing water somewhere below.
Perhaps I wished for a shovel.
Perhaps there was no shovel to be found.
Perhaps I did find a shovel but the work was too heavy, too hard.
It is not hard to take one teaspoon at a time.
Anyone can do it.
The hole gets wider, deeper.
Soon it feels like a well.
It is easy work.
It is the hardest work I have ever done.
I thirst.
Yet what heals us is not only the promised water.
What heals is the work itself.
Dry and slow, one spoonful and another spoonful
and another perched spoonful and another.
Thank you.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
To extend our loving kindness to someone we do not know.
Someone in the Zoom meeting, somebody you see in your neighborhood.
It is helpful if it can be a particular individual rather than just the generic person you do not know.
Can we have goodwill for strangers?
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So this idea of one teaspoon at a time, working with our life, working on,
softening the heart, softening the heart, quieting the mind, one teaspoon rather than a shovel,
or rather than thinking like, oh, I should have a shovel, everybody else has a shovel, I used to have a shovel or something like this, just one teaspoon at a time.
So I think it can be helpful to talk about some of these ideas with other people. This idea of not having to be efficient and what does it feel like to give up that idea that everything has to be efficient.
Maybe it feels like a relief.
Maybe it feels like, I don't know, I'm so used to trying to do things efficiently.
So shovels are better and I'm not even sure I can wrap my head around this idea that just to use a teaspoon to dig it well to open our hearts, settle our minds.
So I'd like to put you into groups of three or four.
I think it's a good chance to be kind of like explore some of these ideas.
It can be helpful to just say one thing, and then let it go to the next person and then they say one thing and let it go to the next person and then they say one thing kind of like this spiral method, as opposed to saying everything you know about a topic.
It's a contrived way of talking. It's not the usual way that humans talk when they get together, but it's a way in which we allow all the introverts and the extroverts everybody to have time and space.
It's an opportunity for us to put into action this love and kindness we've been cultivating, maybe with somebody you don't know, just exactly as we did, you know, kind of wishing them health and happiness, safety, ease, these types of things that were in the groups.
So, just going to do one little adjustment here.
Okay, so you'll be in the groups for 14 minutes and if it's helpful, you can go in alphabetical order sometimes it's helpful to figure out who's going to go first.
Etc. Okay, here we go.
Welcome back.
Welcome back everybody.
Does somebody have a comment or question or something that they'd like to share
something about teaspoons or
Malika you have a thumb up it means like kind of like you'd like to ask a question.
So, the thing I was saying at the end of our breakout session was why not practice joy.
And I just wanted to say because it was like right at practice joy I was like why not click. And it's this video that Jane Bratz had recommended where a seven year old boy talks about how you'll become what you practice and if you complain a lot you'll become a good complainer so why not practice joy.
Why not practice joy is a great question. And I also appreciate your highlighting that teaspoon to teaspoon right we're cultivating something and why not be something that we will make our life better.
Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you, Malika.
Yeah, I just wanted to I shared in our breakout room to how I don't know something I really am amazed by in this practice is I'm so focused on the whole I'm teaspooning away on that sometimes they kind of look up and look around and all these holes that I think I'll never get to.
Somehow they're getting dug. I don't know it's really beautiful.
It really helps me appreciate the teaspoon more, you know. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, right. I love you're the same as or that's so often the case we notice. Oh wait, this other issue topic something is also just work happening over there.
Thank you, Nick.
You're right above Neil and my little screen so
how many of us have a comment.
Just a quick one. Yes.
I'm wondering who the author was of that poem.
Rosemary trauma.
And she spells her name was Mary as in Merry Christmas.
Okay.
I read a lot of her poems on happy arm a big fan she's a beautiful fabulous. Oh look, Neil even has the web link the link here for the if you want to click on that you find the poem.
Okay. Okay, so thank you all. Thank you for your practice and coming together to do this happy hour.
One teaspoon at a time one session at a time, one breath at a time right.
And if you'd like we can unmute and say goodbye in a raucous way so bye bye. Thank you.
Bye bye.
Thank you.
