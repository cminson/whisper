Dharmette: Causes and Conditions  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

In the teachings of the Buddha , there are references  to 
causes and conditions  – the many causes and 
conditions that come into play to create anything , such 
as this group  being here together today . Many causes 
and conditions have brought us together . Each of you 
has your own causes and conditions . Causes are more 
direct , and then there are  also condition s for something  
to arise . All of you came here today , and maybe the 
cause of your coming was a desire to be here and you 
acted on that. B ut the condition s that allowed you to be 
here are many . One condition is that probably most of 
you have a means of transportation . My guess is that a 
lot of you wouldn’t be here if you didn’t have a way to 
get here  – because it’s too far to walk from wherever 
you live. And then the roads were usable,  and there 
wasn’t too much traffic . A lot of conditions allow ed this 
group to come together today . 
 
Sometim es in Buddhism we focus more on causes , and 
sometimes we focus more on conditions . In terms of 
developing a mindfulness practice or helping us find a 
greater sense of well -being , peace , or freedom  – sometimes we focus on the causes and sometimes on 
the conditions .  
 
I suspect that a lot of people naturally focus on the 
cause s: “How am I going to become more peaceful  and 
less stressed? How am I going to cause my suffering to 
go away? ” Sometimes it take s the form  that there must 
be a switch in side: “If I just turn that switch , everything 
afterwards will be good . Just push that button , and I ’ll 
find the key. There’s something to understand, 
something I’m supposed to do , and then I can make 
everything go b etter.” Certainly, a  part of mindfulness 
and wisdom  is to see clearly how we’re operating – 
what we’re doing and seeing , what we can let go of,  and 
what we pick up . We can have particular causes that 
are beneficial for us  and for the world around us.  
 
But there  are also conditions . I think that often we don’t 
fully appreciate  how important it is to have supportive 
conditions which allow us to grow, develop, do the 
practice , and let the practice unfold for us . Unlike direct 
causes, conditions are a wider  field we can put  into 
place to allow  or support  something to happen .  
 
The analogy is like planting seeds in the soil . The cause 
of having the seed in the soil is that the farmer put the 
seed in the soil , but the farmer doesn’t cause the seed 
to sprout . The farmer creates the right conditions for the 
seed to sprout . What are some of the conditions? The soil has to be fertile and the right kind. I f the soil is 
parched and dry , the seed probably won’t grow or even 
sprout. If you try to grow corn in a submerged rice field , 
it probably won’t grow because corn can’t  grow in water 
the way rice  does . If there  are no nutrients in the soil 
whatsoever , you might water the soi l and the seed  
might sprout , but the plant will wither pretty quickly , 
because it ne eds to take some nutrients from the soil. 
And you need to water just enough. There needs to be 
sunlight . The soil can be just perfect, just the right 
condition to grow the plant , but if your tomato or corn 
seed  is planted in Alaska  in December , the c onditions 
are not appropriate for germinating a tomato seed or a 
corn seed . There ha ve to be the right conditions for 
seeds to sprout.  
 
This analogy applies  to us. We have seeds inside . 
Buddhism use s the analogy of seeds to refer to our 
karmic actions . How we act with our intentions, what we 
aspire to , and what we act on plants seeds inside us . 
Those seeds will sprout when the causes and 
conditions are ripe . We all have capacities  or many 
different potentials , and, depending on the conditions 
and causes , they may or may not sprout .  
 
Some of our seeds  don’t represent the best part of us . 
You probably have seeds of anger and hate  inside of 
you. You probably have seeds  of greed and lust , or fear 
inside.  If conditions come together in a certain way , those seeds can  get watered and fed . But you also have 
seeds inside of yourself for compassion, peace, love, 
generosity, and wisdom  – and those  too can grow in the 
right conditions.  Part of Buddhist practice focus es not 
only on causes  – as if you can be responsible for a 
cause and make something happen . Instead it’s about 
putting into place the proper conditions to allow the right 
seeds to germinate and grow for you.  
 
What are some of these conditions that we put into 
place? One  classic condition emphasiz ed in Buddhism 
is the importance of living with integrity  – being ethical . 
Without an ethical foundation , you’re not going to have 
the right conditions . You’re going to be agitated  and 
afraid . You’ll  have all kinds of inner conditions that will 
then create  something . But being ethical creates very 
different condition s. You might not see it today , but in 
five years  you will see the cumulative effect of living 
unethically . If you  have  robbed a bank , chances are you 
can’t sit down to meditate and be calm – it’s just not 
possible. If you lie to a friend , at the time  it might feel 
like a good choice that got you out of trouble . But when 
you do meditation practice and get quieter and quieter , 
you become more sensitive to the depth s of what you 
are carrying – the depths of what’s operating inside of 
you. A t some point in the  stillness, the  cost of that lie 
might germinate into remorse, regret,  or something els e. 
When we live ethically , we might not see  obvious 
benefits today  – but by living ethically , we create the conditions where it becomes easier for the mind to 
relax . When the mind gets still and quiet , we’re not 
going to bump into remorse, regret, fear of being 
caught, or agitation . If you’re interested in mindfulness 
and meditation practice , it’s really essential to have the 
conditions in place that allow the mind and the heart to 
open up  and settle fully . I wouldn’t underestimate the 
tremendous importance of being ethical.  
 
Anothe r classic condition that allows the good seeds of 
practice to germinate is generosity . One reason 
generosity is considered a useful condition for the 
blossoming of the heart is that it creates a positive 
sense of self . You have a reference point inside that 
allows you to feel  good about yourself : “I’ve done  a 
good  thing  – a joyful thing ; I’ve done a beneficial thing ; I 
do things that are good .” When you act generously , and 
you rejoice and are happy about your generosity , the 
conditions in place are very different from those you 
create  when you are miserly , holding everything for 
yourself and afraid of giving anything up . That creates a 
field of conditionality  – a particular kind of soil – where 
certain  seeds will grow , and other seeds will wither 
away in tha t miserly soil.  In the soil of generosity , 
certain kinds of seeds will grow and others  will wither. In 
Buddhism we hope that one thing grow s is a sense of 
joy and delight . Or to use a Western concept:  a certain 
kind of self-esteem  can grow because you feel good 
about yourself . You think about wha t you’ve done and you feel good:  “Oh yes this is good. I’m blameless. I’ve 
entered into this situation , and  I’ve tried to contribute to 
things becoming better ; I can feel good about that. ” 
Then w hen you sit down to meditate , you can call up 
that sense of goodness  – not in a selfish or self -
indulgent  fashion,  but as a w ay of feeling some kind of 
open -heartedness, warmth, or delight . That then 
becomes a condition for further opening, and further 
deepening your practice.  
 
Another very supportive condition the Buddha 
emphasized is hav ing good spiritual friends  – people 
you spend time with and whom you respect because of 
their wisdom, their ethical integrity, their practice . When 
you are with them , their viewpoint  or their example  
inspires yo u, and is meaningful for you. They kind of pull  
out the best in you . If you spend all your time with 
people w ho complain and grip e, or rob banks , that 
creates certain condition s, and you ’ll have to be a very 
powerful personality to not somehow  be influenced by 
that. The people you hang out with ha ve an impact . The 
Buddha said – he didn’t say it this way, but I’m saying – 
that on this path,  one of the conditions for growth is to 
have a few good spiritual friends, good friends who m 
you respect . When you’re with these people , you feel 
that you become a better person .       
 
The last condition I will mention is kindness , or 
friendliness to yourself and to the world around you . To try to cultivate and act on your impulses and desires to 
be kind or friendly  – not in a Pollyannaish  way – but in 
simple ways . Call on that , because being kind sets in 
place very differe nt conditions – it tills the soil very 
differently – than being mean , or being aloof to what’s 
happening.  
 
You might not be able to cause  some of the seeds 
inside of yourself to grow . And you can’t necessarily just 
will yourself to become a better person . But you might 
be able to put together a series of conditions that make 
it much easier for things to change . It’s almost like a 
natural process , just as  the germination of a seed is a 
natural process if the conditions ar e right .  
 
You don’t have to take too much responsibility for the 
germination of your own inner seeds , but you do need 
to take some responsibility for putting in place good  
conditions . You  till the soil, prepare the soil just right , 
and then wait . And then you see the good and beautiful 
seeds inside of you  develop in their own time and place . 
Everyone has great , beautiful seeds , which can grow 
and develop . And a lmost everyone has some rather 
unsavory seeds as well .  
 
Which seeds do you want to germinate? What comes 
forth will have  a lot to do with what conditions you put in 
place . Part of Buddhist spirituality is to begin taking 
some responsibility for the conditionality, the conditions  – the soil you are tilling and creating. Make some 
sense?  
 
Thank you.
