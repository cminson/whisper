 Who kind of starts slowly if a few people are still coming in maybe? And could you hear me okay in the back today? Even though there are some of the instructions? Was okay? Adequate? Enough. I'm getting these longer eyelash eyebrows now, they're all during. And Zen, Zen Master said these big, bushy eyebrows. And it's kind of like the Pinocchio principle, you know? That you can't really teach the truth, it's not possible. And so Zen Masters are kind of getting these big, long eyebrows because they're always teaching so much and really missing the point. So I noticed I'm getting these long... it's happening to me now. And also, maybe not now, but it would be nice if some of you gave some feedback about how it was to include yoga in a day like today. Some of you did it and how that was to include it, and some of you didn't do it, and how was it like to go off on your own and not be part of something that was being offered? Just so... I think my general feeling is it's probably very nice and helpful, we might do it occasionally. But unless they hear from you, so you come up to me and tell me at some point. And also, it was new to have these kinds of... divide up the different people, and by, you know, relatively new people, and under two-year people, and over two-year people, and have these little kind of group meetings through the day, and how that was for some of you to do that. And I thought it was quite nice to do it as an option for people. And what else? There's some flyers up there on the table. The next one-day sitting that we're going to do here in Palo Alto is in July, and Julie Wester, who's a great teacher, one of the teachers at Spirit Rock, and she leads a lot of women's retreats, and she's agreed to come down to Palo Alto and lead a women's retreat down here for us, a one-day retreat for women. And it's going to be July 20th, and it will not be here, but rather it will be at the other place where we have our meetings, at the Friends Meeting House. And the address and everything is on the flyers. So I think that should be quite nice. I'll never know. And... okay. And then for the men who are interested, you know, then everybody can come. Again, on August 17th. So the men have to wait a little while, a couple of months. And August 17th, we'll meet here again in this room, and Wes Nisker, who's a teacher who lives in Berkeley, and a very interesting man, will come and lead a one-day sitting for us. So what I wanted to do today was to actually tell you a story, tell you a myth. And the myth, the modern myth about myths, or the modern story about myths, is that you can take myths, all the different characters of the myth, being yourself, different aspects of yourself. So that's one way of looking at them or incorporating them. I like to think of that as the modern myth about myths. And this is an old myth that goes back, you know, it's before Freud, before the Gospel and Genesis, before the Old Testament. It's a Sumerian story that's probably about 4,000 years old. So in some ways it's going to be one of the earliest myths we have of our Western culture. And it's a story of Inanna, I think you pronounce her name, and she's the Queen of Heaven. And the Queen of Heaven decided to go visit the underworld, the world below. And the way the text says it, she decided to put her ear to the great below. It's kind of a nice image, to put her ear to the great below, to go below. And so she puts on her crown, and she puts on her great robe, and she puts on her necklace and her bracelets and her breast armor, and her regalia. And then she goes to a friend and says, I'm going to the underworld, but if I'm gone for more than three days, please come down and help me out. It means I'm stuck down there or something. So she goes to the first gate, there's seven gates to the underworld. She comes to the first gate, and the gatekeeper says, who's there? And she says, it's me, it's the Queen of Heaven, Inanna, and I'm going down to see my sister. And her sister is, maybe some of you know how to pronounce it, but I know it as Ershigal. Ershigal, you know the story. So Ershigal is the Queen of the Underworld, her sister. So the gatekeeper says, wait a minute here. And the gatekeeper goes to Ershigal and says, your sister Inanna is here, and what should we do? And so Ershigal is described as having hair like leeks, and as wild, you know, and full of fiery fury and pain and whatever. And she says, oh great, let her in, and she licks her teeth. So the gatekeeper goes back and says, you know, she says to Inanna, you know, anybody who comes in here through these gates, will never, is never able to leave again. And so, so Inanna says, I want to go in anyway, over. But Ershigal, before she agrees to let her sister in, she says, let her in, but as she goes through each gate, she has to take off one of her things she's wearing, because she needs to come to the underworld naked and bowed, in humility, I guess. So Inanna decides to go through, even though she's told she can never come back, and before she goes through, the first gatekeeper takes off her crown. And she says, what are you doing? And she says, this is the way of the underworld, you have to, the ways of the underworld are perfect, and you requires you to take off your crown. So she goes into the next gate, and the same thing. She takes off something else, her necklace. Finally, she comes in front, she goes through the seven gates, and they're locked behind her as she goes through. And she comes finally to the underworld, and then she's there naked, she's left there, all her coverings behind. And she comes through to the underworld, to the court of her sister, and her sister sees her, and her sister steps down to meet her, walks up to her. And as she does that, the judges of the underworld condemn Inanna to death. And things happen very quickly down there. So she dies, and then she's hung up, her corpse, which is just a kind of a dry, just kind of a bag of skin, that's all that's left, just this dry skin, is hung up on the wall of the great chamber of the underworld. And then I think, and then, Irskala, Irskigal, then, I think she partly celebrates, but partly, she's wracked then with pain, and she's filled with pain and suffering. And the pain is described as like the pain of giving labor, like she's giving birth, and it's great pain. So after three days, this friend who's left back up in heaven remembers, you know, Inanna hasn't come back. So her friend goes to some of the other gods in the heaven and says, you know, Inanna has not come back. And the god says, well, Inanna went to her own free will to the underworld, so we're not going to help her, leave her down there. So finally, she goes, the helper goes to Enki, and Enki is the god of nature, and says, you know, Inanna, the queen of heaven, you know, has not come back from the underworld. Can't you go and do something to help? And Enki, the god of nature, decides to help. And it's, I don't know quite, it's kind of a strange image, but he takes dirt from underneath his fingertips, and he fashions two little creatures from this dirt. And it's said that they're neither female or male. They're just kind of androgynous, I guess, or whatever. And he gives one of them the water of life, and the other one the food of life. And he says, you guys fly down like little flies and fly down through the lock of the gates and fly through and go into the inner chamber. And when you find Urshigal there in her suffering, just buzz around her. And when she says, all my suffering, or all my body hurts, or all this is terrible, just repeat to her. And when she says, all my body hurts, just say, all your body hurts, all my suffering, all your suffering, all, you know, whatever. Just repeat it to her, just gently. And when she hears that someone is compassionately kind of concerned, and hears what's going on with her, she's going to offer you a gift. And when she offers you a gift, ask for that corpse of Inanna that's hanging on the wall. So these little flies, these little creatures fly in there and do that. And Urshigal says, all my suffering. And little creatures say, all your suffering. All my poor knee that hurts. All your knee hurts. All my self-pity. All your pity. My back, you know, you name it. You probably had all had your chance to do that today. And it's a very compassionate thing just to be present and to be attentive and to notice the suffering. Just, oh, call it by name. Suffering, pain, anger, grief, sadness, you know, just to call it. So sure enough, Urshigal says, oh, who are these compassionate creatures? And, you know, what can I give you? And they ask for the corpse. And she says, oh, the corpse, you can have it, you know, whatever you wish. And so as soon as they're given the corpse, they take it down from the hook on the wall and one of them gives it the water of life and the other gives it the fruit of life. And Inanna comes back to life. And so then Inanna starts to leave the underworld. But they said, but then it turns out the real, it isn't that no one can ever leave the underworld. But the rule is no one can leave the underworld without leaving a substitute to replace them. So the demons of the underworld follow her out and say, you know, you have to provide someone who's going to be your replacement. And so as they leave the underworld and they come to this person, this friend of Inanna, and say, oh, no, I can't be that person, it's my friend. And then they come across this person and Inanna says, no, I can't be that person. They come across her sons or her children who've been in mourning because Inanna's left or it's gone. And they died. And so they said, well, we'll take your children. He says, no, you can't take my children. They're mourning. I love them. You can't take them. And finally they go through all these different people and finally they come to the court where Inanna and her husband rule and they find her husband there, I guess the king of the heavens or whatever. But their husband didn't mourn her absence. Actually was kind of happy, I guess. And so the demons see the husband and say, well, we'll take him. And the husband runs away. And so the demons chase. And apparently the story as I've heard it, there's a long piece where they describe this chase of the husband. And finally the husband comes to the house of his sister and takes refuge there, but they get him anyway and take him down to the underworld. But Inanna isn't so happy about this arrangement after all. And so she goes to the sister of the husbands and asks her if can she go down and take turns with her brother. And so six months of the year her sister, the sister goes down to the underworld and lives there. And six months of the year the husband goes down to live there and they can alternate. And so that's a story. And it's kind of an interesting story. So how do we take if you take all these parts to be ourselves, how do we take them to be ourselves? And that's kind of the task, the homework. And first I think it's nice that she wanted to go down to the underworld. She put her ears to the great below. And I think in some ways in meditation that's what we do. Is we're going to go into the unknown. The underworld is the unknown. And the present moment is the unknown because the present moment is just the present moment. The before and after, what's next we don't know. Who are we in the present moment? Really fully in the present moment who are we? We don't really know. So the willingness to go into the unknown and to explore that, explore the depth of it or whatever might arise in the midst of it. And that's in part what you know one thing one way we can describe a retreat is we go into the unknown. We go into to discover what it is. To be present, to be alive, to give voice, to listen deeply to what's actually here. And then she puts on all her regalia of her identity. She puts on her crown, things which are birthright I guess. Maybe some of it and some maybe not. She puts on her identity, her clothes. And I think what's asked of us as we practice is at least for a period of our time, not necessarily always, but for a period of practice is to be willing to put away all the different things we put on top of ourselves. We add to ourselves to form an identity. And to appear in a sense metaphorically at least naked and exposed. To have enough trust and enough willingness to let go of the things we have on to protect ourselves, to defend ourselves, to project ourselves into the world in a certain way. So as she went through these seven gates, it's kind of like going through the seven periods of the day in meditation. It's just going through the progressive letting go that has to happen for us to really be intimate with ourselves and allow these deeper parts of us to be. And then she comes and there's a kind of a dying that happens. And that takes many forms, a kind of total letting go. The image of dying seems very powerful, kind of a little bit grotesque to hang your corpse up on a hook and the wall, dry corpse. But she meets her sister and her sister, there's two parts of herself perhaps, of ourselves. There's parts of ourselves which are full of energy and wild and fiery, maybe uncompassionate. Who knows what the shadow sides are, what the different parts of ourselves are? But we give room for it, we allow it to be there, we go visit it, we meet it. And maybe the meeting isn't always pleasant. And maybe sometimes the shadow sides of ourselves, the parts of ourselves which are angry or full of grief, that maybe are not necessarily compassionate, that maybe actually are destroyed, even parts of ourselves which are wholesome. We allow it to do that, to see it clearly, allow it to be there. And then we bring the wonderful compassionate practice of mindfulness to all that. To really see who we are, we see the pains of ourselves, the pain of labor, something new gets born. So we bring our mindfulness to see our pain, the suffering of who we are when we're quite attentive and open ourselves up. And we simply are attentive to it. And I think it's wonderful this myth, this ancient, ancient myth, simply says, pay attention to the pain, to the suffering, call it for what it is, all my suffering, all your suffering. I think it's tremendously healing to do that. Just call it for what it is and just allow it to be and see what happens. To see ourselves, to bring the gift, the blessing of attention to who we are. And then doing that brings back life, the rebirth that happens. Maybe that's the pain of labor that Urshghal was feeling, this new birth that was going to come. And we don't know. And oftentimes practice, intense practice, is a kind of re-birthing, new stuff that gets born. Maybe it's just simply what gets born is our compassion for ourselves. And then there's a coming then back into light, coming back into the regular world, back into heaven. And I find it very interesting, I don't know what to make of all this myth, but I find it very interesting that Inana couldn't just come back clean, that's it, you're back in heaven. But some part of her had to always go back and visit, to always be there in the underworld, or in the shadow world, had to stay connected. With that part of oneself. And so there was an arrangement made. And so I don't know what arrangements you guys make. But she sent her husband. And her husband's sister. So I think it's a very interesting myth. And it seems to me to tie into one way of understanding spiritual practice that we have here. You don't have to use the myth to understand it, there's other myths we can use. But what do you think of that? What do you think? Do you feel a connection between your practice and your life? And even what you did here today, and this going into the great below, and meeting different aspects of oneself, letting go of different aspects of oneself in order to go really deep, and then meeting areas of great suffering, and being compassionate, and being reborn. What do you make of that myth? Do you recognize it, identify with it? I thought Anana's clothing was light, or her regalia, her crown, and all that stuff. To me that was like the commentary that runs through my head. I think that's how I build up my own identity. It's through this band of things that keep going through my head. They're still there, and they're going to stay there. But I like them being there because it builds up who I am. That's a really hard time when you go there. So maybe you don't have to let go of it once and for all. Maybe it has some function even that's maybe actually healthy. But it would be very nice if at least once you can give yourself a chance to find out what's there when the commentary is not there. Supporting a sense of who you are, and creating who you are, and the world who you are. So to go through all seven gates and take off all these commentary as you go. One of the ways to do that is to really be intent on following your breath, really doing the practice very intently with great bravery. It takes tremendous courage. What would it be like to really let go of all this stuff and find out what it would be like not to have any commentary, to have the mind meeting the world fresh and clean. Any ideas of who I am, what the world is, without resistance, without fear. And to really kind of in a sense metaphorically go naked. And the myth is kind of interesting because it isn't simply going naked into the world. But it's actually going naked into the underworld. And perhaps the underworld, the shadow side, requires us to go in naked. Not to have the identity, not to have the resistance, maybe. Phil? In talking about being naked, there was a period of time in my life, in which people were seriously clothing the option. And I got to a point, actually I got to a point very early on because my father is very much that way. He was a man who didn't care what particular wadi war, what war it was, or whether he was naked or not. He once said that his greatest ambition was to have a house in which he could rely on in the morning. So I grew up with a sense of not feeling embarrassed about him or having any clothes on him because we can force you to do that. And in the intervening time, I have developed a sense of, I guess, false modesty, I would call it. But I can remember times in my life being very comfortable that way, that it didn't matter. It didn't matter whether I was in shape or what I looked like or any of these things. And sitting here this afternoon, it seems to be the other places that I want to get back to appropriately. Yeah, please. I think that being excessively self-conscious about how we look is one of the great places we limit ourselves and cut ourselves off from ourselves. I talked about this early in the morning about body image from the outside versus body image from the inside. I think in mindfulness we're learning to come from the inside rather than these ideas from the outside. And there is some sadness, and for me there's a little bit of sadness in that our culture has changed. I grew up also with my family attitude was kind of the same about nudity. It was very relaxed and there was nothing special about it at all, just who we were. I was very young, it was explained to me that my parents, you have to be a little bit careful because people in society around you didn't have the same attitude. So that was okay with me. Then I grew up in the late 60s and early 70s, you know, and it was a great time. There was parts of it that were really beautiful. I looked back at nostalgia, I had a little sadness that some of the healthy, what I thought was really healthy parts of the counterculture, the culture that I was part of, is not possible anymore, it's not easy anymore. Nudity was one of them, and there was all this nudity happening, and no one thought of it twice, at least, you know, and maybe there was some abuse of it too, but I was so comfortable, we were all so comfortable with each other's nudity. And this almost doesn't happen anymore, that I'm in environments where there are people who are comfortable with each other's nudity. And that's a little bit sad, I feel. The culture has changed and shifted. So, you know, partly, and partly who I am is, I'm in response to the culture I'm in. And I don't want to hurt people, I don't want to upset people, so I'm willing to go along to some degree with also, you know, I'm pretty comfortable with my nudity, but I'm not going to do what I did in the 60s because the people around me don't seem so comfortable. So it's for their sake. And so there's a kind of give and take between, that I think comes with sensitivity to others, that's kind of a give and take, we don't necessarily do things just for ourselves, but there's sensitivity to how other people are also. But in negotiation, you know that sometimes, hopefully we do it in a way that's honest and doesn't cut ourselves off from who we are. But anyway, it's... Thank you. Yes? Beautiful. Thank you. So what does it take to see the world as medicine? From where? I just think I also want to say that what you said about meditation is that it touches me. It touches me because of my own personality. My family that I was in was very comfortable with nudity. And I remember that my mother was very comfortable, but my father wasn't, and I was never comfortable around my father with nudity. I described a lot of that in it. But other than that, what I wanted to say about the myth, and that... It speaks to me so profoundly, and I once heard that myth spoken of as also the journey of illness, that when we're ill, that we actually enter. We at least... the part of the healing is gripping ourselves, maybe aging too of the travents, of our personality, and the way we want to present ourselves, the way we think we're supposed to be seen. And that always stuck up to me, and when I was ill, I was in a program that helped me to very profoundly go enter into those dark places. And one of the methods that they used was this mirroring. So whenever I spoke, all they did was... Speed pack. And I learned that form of communication, that when people speak to me, to just acknowledge that I don't need to do anything else. But that's the healing is to be heard. And so profoundly that as we do this, when we strip our personality, in some ways we are just, we're lifeless. Until we bring compassion to the inner front of us, to that deepest part, and to the parts that maybe were dark, that we put away, that we don't allow ourselves, that are not acceptable, either to society or to ourselves, or to the people around us, maybe more specifically. And that's what things like that and the healing that allows us to go back to our... So we do it in our mindfulness practice by ourselves. We do it ourselves. ...by when we feel something or we experience something, whatever, the darkest, nastiest, to think of. Darkness. That's very powerful. With compassion. So that made a question. Those compassion little beings, little flies, why do they come from underneath the dirt from the fingernails? Of the earth. Of the earth, that way? So why? So they are... Okay. That's good. I was thinking that the dirt in the fingernail is often inconsequential. You kind of throw it away right away. And perhaps the earth, perhaps compassion is... We often see it as inconsequential and we're so quick to kind of throw it away. But actually something so inconsequential is a little dirt, is what compassion is. Compassion is actually quite consequential. Something like that. Yes? Could it be that I don't know about their culture, but in our culture it's not okay to have dirt under your fingernails? And so it's like a paradox of turning something that was not acceptable into something that was very beautiful. Turning poison into medicine. It seems like an agricultural myth that came in the agricultural times. I don't know if they had the same stigma. Because there's somebody working with the earth, like a farmer or something. So they're connected to the earth. That was it. I'm just curious, is this a summer, winter, or something? Because of the movement between the... I was wondering that too. I don't know any more than that to what I've told you. It's about all I know. What? It's like the satanic Greek myth that satanic goes to the underworld and then she ends up going six months and then winter and then it's back to the world. It makes sense. And they were an agricultural myth. Yeah. In association with the dirt under the nails of, there's some transparency when you see it. And maybe it works as part of our dark side. There's always lookups. I mean, kind of get used to having things under our nails. Having things that are just so spooky. I think they've become so familiar that we don't have to... Except for... Except for... When I met with one of the groups today, a lot of the people there talked about how difficult it was to be here today. For one day sitting. Difficult emotions, difficult body stuff. It's a tremendous challenge, this practice. And I think somehow for me this myth, the imagery of the myth of going into the underworld and the gates and shedding of identity, it's a tremendous challenge. I think at times it takes tremendous courage to do it. And I think a lot of people come to a spiritual practice, to Buddhism here in the West in California, a little bit with new age idealism. It's all light and great and shiny and peaceful and whatever. And certainly that's part of it. But that there is beauty and compassion and love and things to be discovered, but it's a whole life. The whole world is medicine. It's the whole balance stuff of the full spectrum of who we are. And so I like this myth because it shows the challenge of the practice also. Anything else that should be said before we finish the day? Any last thoughts about this myth or about the day or questions? Yes? Well, it's interesting that it was the Queen of Heaven, and I think a place of light, who wanted to hear her ears to the ground and wanted to know what was underneath. It wasn't the Queen of the underworld who wanted to appreciate something else. She was, and some of the stories about that. The movement happened because there was no openness. And I suppose it's intended that even though the journey into the underworld is healing, that bonding, and something we do in our lives and whether we do or not we'll end up doing it. But as if we do it willingly or not. But that this other place is dark and narrow, and we don't move about and think of possibilities. I wonder what it would be like if, what would this take out? So the person who started the thing, he'll come from light. Yeah, and light, I mean, awareness sometimes is used to start metaphorically as light. You bring the awareness with you down into the darkness. The darkness doesn't have much chance of maybe doing much. But I like also the idea of light, also this idea of being in heaven. It kind of seems like a very holistic or healthy place to start. And the idea of putting on all her regalia, her crown and everything, it's a beautiful image. It's an image of kind of starting off whole or starting off with a healthy sense of self perhaps or a balanced sense of self. With all this goodness, I don't think of her as being in an ego trip. I think Inana as being someone who's kind of putting on all her goodness, being the best person she could be, best person ethically, the best person compassionally, the best person. And bringing all the best that you are, you go into that underworld. You might have shed all that, but you don't have to deny it. Does that make sense? Yes? There's also an echo of Prince Siddhartha leaving the castle for the first time, experiencing sickness and death. Yeah. And many people don't really practice seriously until they really have confronted some of these things for themselves in a thorough way. Someone in the back, I saw a hand. That's what today was like? The morning and the afternoon. Did little flies come visit? Happy birthday. Thank you all very much. And thanks to Terry for coming and doing yoga. He was very generous. Thank you. And thank you all for coming. He was very generous to come. And next time I do it, one day sitting here will be in September. And the next one will be pretty sure the September one, because we alternate when I do them, between this kind like we did today, which is what it was, you know. And then ones which are more for experienced people, there's no instruction given at all. And it's just a day of silence. And then I put up a sign up sheet and people do 15 minute, if they want, they can do 15 minute interviews. If not too many people sign up. And so anyway, that's what's happening. Also we need to fold up the chairs again and put them in the corners. And if someone wants to volunteer to sweep the floor, that also would be nice, just to kind of offer the room back in a nice shape to the Unitarians. Thank you again.
