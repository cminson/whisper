Hi folks, nice to see everyone there.
Those of you who are signing in, I'm always so happy to see how broad our group extends all the way around the world really
and of course it's kind of a holiday time, so I'm glad some of you are able to show up today.
Okay, well I'm thinking that we should go ahead and get started.
According to my clock, it's on the hour.
So why don't we just start right away with the meditation and we'll continue on after that with our list of one.
So settling in, finding the spot to sit.
Allowing yourself to ease into the mind state of meditation.
Maybe taking a couple of long, slow, deep breaths and on the exhale just allowing the body to settle more deeply into itself.
So finding a natural feeling, sitting posture or maybe you're lying down or standing.
If you're comfortable doing so, you can close the eyes.
Maybe softening a bit, softening the face, the head, shoulders, letting them drop down through the belly and the arms and legs.
Just inviting the posture that's upright and also relaxed.
And climbing the mind and the body toward ease.
Perhaps allowing the attention to just naturally rest onto the sensations of breathing in and out.
Just to give the mind a simple experience to connect with that's in the present moment.
If the mind is busy or if there are some emotions present, that's all fine.
We can just allow those and also sense the breath in order to give the mind something to rest with.
And then inviting into your awareness a sense of confidence in the process of meditation.
It doesn't have to be a large movement of mind, maybe just remembering that we do this because you know it has some good effects.
Letting this simple confidence or trust or faith be the foundation.
And today we'll primarily be looking at our mind in this meditation.
So in the realm of the mind there's kind of two things going on. There's how the mind is or what's the content of the mind is.
And then there's also how we are paying attention to that.
How is the quality of the awareness that's observing that or being with that.
And we'll actually start with how it is that we are attending to our mind.
So you might just notice if there is a certain flavor to the way we're paying attention.
So I'm going to just offer three common flavors that we might have that can color the mind.
And a possible way to balance that out.
Just so that we can kind of hone the way that we're paying attention.
So it may be that we have some degree of ill will in the mind. We may be irritated about something in our household this morning or dreading something that we have to do later.
In some way the mind is in a little bit negative state.
And sometimes we meet that by wishing it weren't that way. So we add more ill will onto the ill will.
So the invitation is to explicitly include a sense of warm acceptance in the mind.
Maybe at first what we're accepting is that the mind is in a state of ill will.
At least we can start with accepting that.
And that's okay because it was conditioned. There were the conditions for it. That's why it's there.
And then maybe we can even accept what it is that we're a little irritated about.
Okay, yeah, we have a certain thing going on in our relationship.
There's something that needs to be done.
At least for now, for this meditation, we can just include that, accept that part of the mind, that part of our life.
And the heating isn't working. Okay.
Another very common flavor in our mind that can color how we pay attention is a sense of self criticism or self doubt.
Am I doing it right?
Am I okay?
Probably everyone else is more mindful than me.
So this is also very common, normal in a sense.
And I would invite sense of respect as a natural counterbalance.
You are sitting at this moment.
That's a pretty big deal.
You can respect that you made it to the cushion or the chair, you made it onto this live stream or this recording.
Right there is something worthy of respect.
Just a little smile or even wanting to meditate.
You're engaging in a very beautiful and noble practice.
And all the other stuff about how we are in life, how we made that mistake.
We could think about that later maybe.
For now it's just really good to be sitting here.
Maybe feeling the breath in and out again, inviting me through the body.
And then a third flavor that we often carry in the mind is a kind of striving.
So wanting to be more peaceful, wanting to be really present, wanting to get concentrated.
So in a gentle form of course it's good to wish these things for ourselves.
But there's a way in which the very wanting of them can bring a certain tightness into the mind.
We can feel that actually when we're attuned to the mind.
So the natural counterbalance is to invite, continue to invite ease into the mind.
A little bit like those toys where you put your finger into it, it's kind of a woven toy.
And when you put your finger in, if you try to pull it out, it just tightens around the finger.
And to get it out you actually have to push inward and then gently remove the finger.
So there's a way in which pushing just lines us up even more.
And it's actually through ease that the mind can settle.
So there's really nowhere to go, nothing that needs to be done right now.
So this is something that can be done at the beginning of a sit is to notice the attention.
The way we're being attentive and invite acceptance to counter ill will.
Respect to counter self criticism or self doubt.
And ease to counter striving.
We may not need to do all of them, but I wanted to offer a whole spread.
I actually consider these three acceptance, respect and ease to be different facets of meta, different aspects of how we can flow.
So we're just resting for a moment, perhaps returning the attention to the breath.
Thank you.
Now that the way that we're paying attention is fairly balanced,
we can look a little bit more carefully at the natural flow of what's in the mind.
We might check if even now there's a sense of sensual desire in mind.
Or there may not be.
And then we feel what it's like to have a mind that's not particularly influenced by sensual desire.
There's no need to change how the mind is since we have our clear balanced attention.
We just notice what it's like to have or not have desire in mind.
And we can do the same with any sense of anger or irritation or real will.
Just looking with a balanced attention.
What it's like when that flickers through the mind, this is a mind that's influenced by a moment of irritation.
Or if that's not there, this is what a mind is like when it doesn't have any irritation in it.
Okay.
Interestingly, this can also be done with delusion.
We might think, oh, there's no way to see delusion by its very nature.
But actually we can. We could see if the mind is busy with some kind of story that we know isn't really true.
We just say, oh, okay, there's some delusion present in the mind.
Or if the mind's a little fuzzy.
Or if it's not, maybe it's quite clear, feels balanced.
We say, okay, this is a mind that is not strongly influenced by delusion right now.
Okay.
And we can also notice the degree of concentration in the mind.
Is the mind fairly well gathered, steady in the present moment?
Does it feel like an unstable molecule ready to fly apart at any moment?
Scattering off into its own thoughts as soon as my voice isn't present.
And that's just one more thing to notice.
Oh, this is what a scattered mind is like.
Remember, this is what a fairly gathered mind is like.
It can be quite empowering to realize that we can simply observe how the mind is.
And that's perfectly good meditation.
In the words of Ajahn Sunido, right now, it's like this.
Thank you.

There may be times when we observe our mind and we notice that it's not particularly influenced by sensual desire or greed at this moment.
And it's also not particularly influenced by hatred or ill will at this moment.
Nor does it seem to be strongly diluted at this moment.
It's possible after a period of meditation, the mind is in a state like that.
Given that liberation of mind is said to be the absence of greed, hatred and delusion,
such a mind is somewhat close to liberation.
Of course, we may have those tendencies still looking in the mind.
But it may be that at this moment, your mind is relatively free.
We can appreciate that.
Realizing that can deepen our confidence.
So it may be that freedom is a relatively simple thing.
Something we could carry in our heart throughout the day.
A place we could return to rest throughout the day.
A place we could return to rest throughout the day.
A place we could return to rest.
