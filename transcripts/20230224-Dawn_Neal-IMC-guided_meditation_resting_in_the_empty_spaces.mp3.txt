 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Good morning. Good morning, YouTube. I am Sia Sangha. Happy to see you. Good morning. It's a rainy day, rainy morning here in Redwood City, California. I'm enjoying seeing the weather reports. Even here in Redwood City, power back on. Sunny in Tucson snow. Nice to see your friendly greetings. Oh, please, please enjoy. I'm reading the chat and just enjoying it. Enjoy the warm greetings of your fellow Sangha mates. And little observations in different places. Please help each other out with technology if you can. And drink in. Drink in the goodness, the friendliness. Coming from all over the world. This little screen. And when you're ready, you're ready. Maybe taking one or two deeper breaths. One last cup of tea. Sip of tea. And settle in. Settle in into your chair, your cushion, your mat, whatever it is that you are currently sitting on or whatever kind of surface is supporting you. Saffoning the eyes. Maybe closing them if you're comfortable closing them. Tuning in. Turning into your surroundings. Maybe one or two more intentional deep slow breaths where you let any excess tension, anything else out on the out breath. Allowing the tongue to stay soft. The face to stay soft. Noticing your immediate surroundings. Maybe a different distant train whistle, soft rain. Walk cries or birdsong. Whatever ambient sound is around you. And noticing too, through your body, it's situated and immersed in the moment. Feelings of warmth or cool. Pressure. Or lightness. Perhaps vibration or tingling on the inside of your body. And the comfort to sense of support. Support of the chair. Maybe the support of the mat, the ground beneath your feet. Feeling health held by the earth. Letting the attention rest. Resting on the breath. On the sensations or sounds flowing through this moment. Settling. If distraction arises, or the mind continues in the whorl of thinking that is so common, just noticing that with kindness. Beginning again. Returning to the moment. Rededicating yourself to awareness. This breath. This sound. From time to time, rededicating yourself. To non-preoccupation. To the simplicity, the silence, the spaces in between. The spaces in between. But breath. Sound. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. Simply being. In the last few moments of this meditation, the invitation is, you haven't already let go of any primary anchor of attention. And rest. Allow. All sounds, sensations, mental phenomena, emotion, anything just to flow through. Noticing the knowing, allowing. Resting in this moment exactly as it is. Resting in this moment. Resting in this moment. Resting in this moment. As the formal meditation practice begins to draw to a close. Taking a moment to appreciate. Gather up, soak in, savor any moments of peace, quiet, patience, goodwill, mindfulness, anything. No matter how small, gather it up and savor it, appreciate it, your heart and body. And then casting your internal gaze outwards, generating the wish that others may experience goodness, kindness, patience, goodwill, awareness. Reflect on how it feels to wish them well. Perhaps setting the intention to be one of the causes and conditions for that goodness in your life. Resting in this moment. Thank you for your sincerity of your practice.
