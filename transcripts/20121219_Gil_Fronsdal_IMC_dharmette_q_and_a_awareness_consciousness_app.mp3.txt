Dharmette : Q&A – Awareness, 
Consciousness  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

Is there a nything you would like me to talk about?  
 
Participant 1 : How do you suggest we observe 
awareness?  
 
I don’t know.  I have no idea. How do we observe 
awareness? It’s kind of like trying to touch your right 
elbow with your right hand. You know you have an 
elbow, but you can’t quite get to it. Or it is like trying to 
observe what’s behind your eyes . You know there’s 
some thing behind your eyes , don’t you? But can you 
look at it? What happens when you look at it?  
 
What is awareness? It’s a pretty palpable  – sometimes 
it’s a powerful thing to be aware . But what is it ? And 
how do you observe it ? How  do you know it? It’s a good 
question. Professionally, i t seems like I should know the 
answer  [laughter] .  
 
Sometimes I’ve said here that awareness is not a thing  
– it’s a composite . Maybe it’s a little like a rainbow. Does a rainbow exist? In a certain wa y, it exists . But 
you had better not chase after it , because it doesn’t 
exist in that way. Like a rainbow , awareness i s not like a 
single activity of the mind .  
 
There’s knowing ; the mind can know something . I can 
know that I’m not sure how to answer your question ; 
there’s knowing of that. I can see you sitting there . 
There’s seeing ; there’s hearing ; there’s feeling what’s 
going on . I feel a little bit cold . I feel my concern for 
meeting you with your question . It’s a good question , 
especially given what we  do here .  
 
There are all these things I can kno w, and then there’s a 
sense that there’s a field of awareness or 
conscious ness  in which it all occurs . That wider sense 
of a context or a field is something that I can sense and 
feel. But I don’t know if it makes sense to turn towards 
it, look at it , and observe it . The fact that it’s a feeling or 
a sense  – does that make it something more than a 
rainbow?  
 
It’s possible to feel awareness or attention . These words 
are vague , right? What’s attention? What’s aw areness? 
What’s consciousness? Is it a unitary thing? Is it the 
harmonious functioning of many things working 
together?  
 
On the last retreat I was teaching with Andrea Fella , someone asked about awareness . Andrea  referred to 
her teacher , U Tejani ya, who, when  asked what 
awareness  is, said, “The variable interaction between 
the five faculties  – that’s what awareness is. ” The five 
faculties are faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration 
and wisdom . Somehow , for him those things come into 
play in differen t ways, and awareness can shift . What 
awareness is and how we feel it shifts and changes too.  
 
Sometimes awareness feels constricted  and narrow ; 
sometimes it feels expansive and open . Sometimes it 
feels colored by mood , or by what we’re doing . 
Awareness s ees things through the lens of a certain 
mood or feeling . Sometimes awareness doesn’t have 
much energy  – it feels dull . Sometimes it’s crisp and 
sharp . Sometimes awareness comes with deep knowing 
and understanding ; sometimes it doesn’t have any 
understanding .  
 
For U Tejaniya,  the five faculties somehow define what 
awareness is . But that doesn’t quite work for me . It’s a 
definition of awareness . It certainly works for me to 
represent the different things that can influence how w e 
experience what we call awareness  – but I don’t know if 
awareness is a thing .  
 
When I use the word ‘aware ’ – many teachers use the 
word ‘awareness ’ – I think it’s a pointer to something , 
such as  being mindful, pay ing attention, be ing in the present moment . Then as we do  that, it deepens, or it 
gets focused or stabilized in the present moment . And 
then what we call awareness or attention becomes 
stronger . At some point , it stands out in highlight , so that 
what  we’re aware of recedes from impor tance  – and 
what we’re aware of is not really that important  
anymore .  
 
What becomes important is the strong sense that there 
is awareness ; there’s consciousness . Then you can 
sometimes turn towards that strong feeling when it 
stands out in highlight  – but that’s because it’s there . 
However,  if you look at it carefully, y ou can’t quite turn 
towards it . Maybe you can , but I don’t know how to do it  
– to turn towards it and actually look at it .  
 
It’s kind of like walking in the dark . If you want to see 
something with n ight vision, apparently you are better 
off looking a little to the side . In the dark, y ou have to 
not look in the usual way . You can’t just look and stare , 
because then you don’t see as well , You have to look 
with a loose focus  – a little off t o the side , so more light 
comes in . You can’t try too hard . It’s a little like that . If 
you try too hard with awareness, if you look at it directly  
– I don’t know . 
 
I think one of the great challenges of neuroscience  and 
psychology has been  to figure out what consciousness  
is. Sometimes awareness and consciousness are used synonymously . I don’t think anybody has come up with 
a really good definition or understanding of what 
consciousness is that’s agreed by everybody . There are 
all these different ideas of what consciousness is . And 
there  are all these ideas  of multiple mental ways of 
functioning that work harmoniously together . As long as 
they work harmoniously together , there’s a rainbow . But 
once things start breaking do wn in the brain , 
consciousness starts getting frazzled . I don’t know . 
Sorry.  
 
Do you want to ask some more? Why is it an important 
question?  I think you wouldn’t have asked that question 
if I hadn’t have made a big deal about it earlier  this 
morning . Was that meaningful? How did you observe 
awareness then?  
 
Participant 1 : Well my tendency is – as you were 
suggesting – to have  a light touch . Just let it flow , and 
follow it as it goes . And not worry too much about it . 
Just knowing and appreciating that it’s there. When you 
spoke this morning , I guess I was trying to appreciate it 
more , and I got a little frustrated . So I decided not to do 
that anymore.  
 
Good , that’s wise. That’s good. Are there other times in 
your life w hen you are a little bit amazed by the very fact 
that you are aware?  
 Participant 1 : Yes. I am a little bit amazed by it ; yes. 
 
In my mind at least, it’s similar to when I’m amazed that 
I’m alive . When I’m really amazed to be alive, the sense 
of being alive – whatever that is  – the sense of being 
aware or conscious is close at hand , or it overlaps quite 
a bit. But in order to have some sense of this  – of 
awareness, of being alive  – you have to be in the 
present moment . So if you are still thinking about the 
high school prom, or are caught up in that whole world  – 
chances are,  you’re probably not so fully present for the 
bigger picture  – the bigger context of your life.  
 
It’s the s ame thing if we are caught up with self-
preoccupation . Then it’s hard to be aware of the larger 
context. Or if we’re caught up in fear about the future or 
what’s supposed to happen, it’s harder to get a sense  of 
this. So we’re limited . But the unlimited life  – the 
unlimited sense of awareness, pr esence, or life  – the 
door to that is really in the present moment . And as that 
becomes stronger , then it’s a lot of rainbows ; it’s 
magical.  
 
Okay , so here we are. I like the expression , “Here we 
are,” because it’s so amazingly profound – and so 
ordinary . We should not to be fooled by a simple 
statement, “Here we are,”  thinking that it doesn’t mean 
anything . It means a lot . “Here we are,”  and we share it 
together . We shar e our present moment .   
In monas teries, temples, and retreat centers, I ’ve done 
a lot of cleaning together with other people . It’s 
interesting to watch the mind and one’s  awareness .  
 
What happens to your awareness? What do you get 
caught up in? Can you clean in such a way that you are 
not caught up in your inner stories , dramas , and 
concerns ? But rather, you are present not only for what 
you do in a nice way, but also so that your awareness is 
a little more relaxed  – wider  and open . You take in 
what’s going on around you as well .  
 
Some of that goes on in this fifteen -minute cleaning 
we’re going to do . It’s a bit of a dance . You are 
participating in this bigger dance with all these people 
doing different  things.  How do we interact and do this  
together? What kind of awareness, or attention do you 
have in the present moment , but which is more open  – 
so that you have this wider context of the work you are 
doing?
