Settling in and connecting with just sitting, just yourself as you are in this moment. 
Opening to how the body is. 
How is the mind? Remembering how supportive it is to allow relaxation of body. 
Perhaps scanning through the body and just checking in if there's places or ways to release tension. 
And sometimes I find it helpful to check in internally. 
Maybe the inside of the throat can relax. 
Maybe the heart can relax. 
Maybe the stomach, the intestines can relax. 
Maybe too there can be a relaxation of the mind of mental tension. 
Letting go of worries, concerns about the past, the future. 
And just receiving the present moment, this changing, very dynamic present moment. 
I can simply settle back and receive what is obvious. 
Relax and let what is the most obvious experience be known. 
That is actually, it's already being known in a way. 
It's kind of an easy way to land with experience, can be. 
So what's obvious in this moment? Often at the beginning of a sitting, it is something physical, either some body sensation or sound that's happening. 
So maybe for a time the attention is connecting with physical sensation or sound. 
Can be emotions or moods too. 
You often use that question, what is obvious? Sometimes I find another question can be really powerful too. 
What's true right now in your experience? Can be the truth of being tired or frustrated or confused or curious or easeful. 
Can there be a kind of a taking in of what's true in this moment? The truth of ideas or thoughts, the truth of content of thoughts. 
What is the truth of this moment's experience? Can the mind take that, oh, this is what's true right now. 
Not trying to change it or fight it, but to just acknowledge this is what's true right now. 
Sometimes I find that perspective lets my mind relax a little bit if something that happens to be arising, something that happens to be the truth of the moment is challenging. 
And that perspective of, oh, this is frustration. 
Frustration is what's true right now. 
Sometimes the mind will just relax around that and there can be a way that that lets you be with experience more fully. 
So you can play with that, that sense of what's true right now. 
And for some of you, what's true may be that it could be supportive to settle with something like the breath. 
And if that is what is true for you, that's fine to connect with a particular area of experience. 
Relaxing. 
Receiving experience. 
Whether you're allowing that experience to be just simply what's obvious or what's true in this moment. 
Or if you are choosing to direct the attention to a particular area of experience like the breath, there's a way that you can aim at the breath and then receive. 
What's the truth of this breath? Smooth or jagged, short, long, rough. 
Relax. 
Connecting to your present moment experience.
