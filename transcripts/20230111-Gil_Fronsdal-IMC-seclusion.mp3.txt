 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Very much in people's minds, the way they're... almost everyone I talk to, like, on any occasion, the first topic of conversation is the rain and the weather and, like, how are you? Are you okay with it? And so there's something about this moment in our time, this day, maybe there's something here that's your equivalent of cozy or intimate or gather together, just being here, that supports meditation practice. And maybe you can avail yourself of that, kind of remember that or think about it or kind of feel into it, because when it's not strong, if it's not a big blaring storm outside and you're safe inside, it's so easy for the mind to wander off into its preoccupations and wander away and not really be here. But to use the occasion to kind of... how is it you can be intimate, gathered in, really here with yourself, that supports you to be mindful moment by moment, to be present and connected. And this is using something that the Buddha has a support for practice, that the Buddha talked about, which is usually in English, it's translated as seclusion, viveka, and now they say it's kind of becoming a little bit, a little bit kind of not secluded in marginalized or pushing things away or shutting things out, but kind of gathering in and being close and intimate here, as opposed to spinning out to what's out there. So may that be the case today, and I welcome you and delighted we can be together this way. Thank you.
