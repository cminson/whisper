To understand the predicament of anxiety, we need only sit down quietly, draw our attention inward, and watch our thoughts as they tumble by. 
Our fears and concerns need not assume vast proportions, but beneath the melody of constantly changing thoughts, punctuating them like the thumping of the bass in a jazz quintet, is the persistent throb of worry and care, the second rhythm of the heart. 
So I've read that and found that a provocative and evocative description of life, the thumping of the bass in the jazz quintet of anxiety. 
So I thought I would reflect on this together. 
Freud may be in some way similar to Bikku Bodhi. 
He once defined anxiety in such a fundamental way that he said that anxiety is basically what gets us to do anything. 
This fundamental motivating force. 
And when we look in the suttas in the Buddhist tradition, this word dukkha, or translated alternatively as suffering, sometimes actually tenisero, but who has stress, that's his translation of dukkha, stress, close to anxiety. 
That word etymologically what I've learned from scholars is that it's like the axle not fitting into the wheel well perfectly. 
So that it's not always a smooth ride. 
That's the first noble truth. 
There is that. 
And when I think about my life and how I, you know, what is a kind of propelling force in my life, you know, what gets me checking my third email account again. 
It's something in the neighborhood of restlessness. 
And I think one of the defining characteristics of the mind when it's quite free of kilesa, habits, habit energies, the afflictive energies, it's the restlessness that flatlines. 
That in some of the states of mind or stages of awareness, the restlessness is gone. 
We notice that and it can be like the rumble of like a loud refrigerator or something that shuts off. 
And we didn't really know it was rumbling and then it shuts off and there's that like delicious peace. 
And when restlessness, when anxiety really fades out, we there is this deep ease, deep ease. 
Now it's useful to distinguish kinds of some kinds of fear maybe from anxiety. 
You know, fear of being a deeply conditioned response of the body and something that we should be grateful for. 
Fear is more like the alarms that go off when there's a harm that is in front of us that can be avoided. 
Like that would be a useful time to feel fear. 
And so Ajahnamara, I mentioned last week, the Thai forest tradition said, when we look back over evolutionary time, the ancestors who got to the edge of a really kind of steep, frightening cliff in prehistoric times, the ancestors that got to the edge of that cliff and felt warm, mushy, loving feelings at the edge of that cliff, just meta and just warmth and they're not our ancestors, right? And so here we are, these like slightly nervous monkeys, you know, and we can be grateful for a lot of those mechanisms. 
There are also times maybe that are more the anxiety family where, and the anxiety being a kind of much more sort of future, fear being a more present focus concerned to anxiety being much more future oriented, very much bound up with thinking, worry, kind of vigilance and obsessive thought and hyper arousal, the bodies and like it's idling at a much higher point. 
And there are times when I think that kind of anxiety can really, can serve us. 
Some people call it like true alarm anxiety. 
So to give an example of this, there was, when I was writing a thesis, there was a long period of procrastination about four years in. 
And this is fairly normal from what I understand from other students, but there was, now I was not purely wasting the time. 
I was doing a lot of meditation, but it was like meditation so that I did not have to write this freaking thesis. 
And that went on for many months, many months. 
And I would sit down at the computer and it would be like, maybe I could look at it one or two sentences. 
And then it was off to the internet or something. 
This kind of worked for a while. 
There was a little sense of concern, but not much. 
And then at some point over six months of doing this, there was like some anxiety. 
And it was the kind of anxiety that sort of alerts us to the fact that we need to take action. 
That we're actually, that anxiety is a wise counsel that we're being asked to move on something. 
We've let some kind of pain or confusion fester for too long, and it's now time to actually be decisive and act. 
And after all that time, it was that kind of anxiety that was actually very supportive in cutting through that habit of procrastination. 
But we are probably, we worry, we have a kind of redemptive hope in worrying. 
We have an allegiance to worrying. 
It feels like worrying gets a lot done for us. 
It feels like in that worrying, we're kind of almost rearranging the world with our thoughts, with our worries. 
Does that make sense? So this is from the onion. 
Do you know that? Oh, that's good. 
A lot of people laugh. 
That's good. 
It's hard for me to have a single conversation with a person without thinking about the onion at some point. 
It just, and it doesn't matter what we're talking about. 
I always have associations with this thing. 
Anyway, this was from today. 
I'll read the story. 
It's a short story. 
And it's the picture is this, you know, this young guy who's in bed and he's like throwing off the sheets and he's got a pad and a paper and he's writing in, you know, like at the edge of his bed. 
Quickly kicking off his sheets and reaching for a notepad on his nightstand, local 27-year-old Kyle Dowling reportedly sprang out of bed at 3 am  yesterday to jot down an idea for a brand new worry. 
Sometimes a quote, sometimes the best, most crippling new anxieties just come to you in the middle of the night. 
So it's always good to have a pen and paper nearby to record them, said Dowling, rapidly scribbling several shorthand notes about a new feeling of debilitating self-doubt and apprehension that had just spontaneously entered his mind. 
If I think of a new paralyzing fear relating to my personal or professional life and I don't immediately write it down, there's a good chance I'll totally forget about it by the time I fall asleep four hours later. 
Upon waking up and rereading his notes from the previous night, Dowling confirmed to reporters that the new worry was even greater than he first thought. 
Yeah. 
So that's the onion, but it's very closely paralleled. 
Why is that funny? Because it's very closely parallels what was written by a researcher at Penn State who's sort of like the guru of worrying research. 
Yeah. 
And he wrote a very personal piece a few years ago. 
He's clearly involved in mindfulness in some ways. 
As Thomas Borkovac says, when I'm worrying, I am mostly engaging in thought or talking to myself. 
This thinking triggered by an internal or external cue that signals danger, primarily concerns the future, and involves the anxious anticipation of and mental attempts to avoid the many negative events that I imagine might happen. 
The consequence of any perception of threat is the activation of basic fight or flight reactions, motivating attempts to escape or avoid. 
Quite naturally under those circumstances, I feel compelled to figure out how to prevent these bad things from happening or how to prepare myself for the worst. 
Worrying is a device that I believe can function to do this. 
Because I'm devoting large amounts of times to generating and attending to worrisome thoughts, much of my life is spent living in an illusion. 
So no doubt there's a place for some simulation that we imagine different scenarios, things that could unfold. 
And there's a lot of value for us in that. 
It's not an accident that we all have these brains, minds that, when we sit down to focus on the breath, does a lot of simulation of the future. 
That's not like a total evolutionary accident. 
We no doubt do too much of that, but it's not a total accident. 
And there's some real value in being able to simulate various futures. 
But it's like our allegiance to that is so strong. 
And we're kind of trying to avoid harms that can't be avoided, or can't be controlled, or we're worrying about the wrong things, or we're worrying too much about the right things. 
So it's become unbalanced. 
And in this process of worrying, one of the things that it's important to recognize is that we're not so good at predicting the future, and we're even less good probably at predicting how we're going to feel in the future. 
So there's a whole body of research around like affective forecasting, predicting our own states in the future, our own emotional kind of states. 
And one of the very interesting findings from that is that we consistently, we essentially underestimate our resilience. 
We underestimate our resilience. 
And we also let what's happening in the mind right now has like undue weight in how we think about the future. 
Totally undue weight. 
What's happening right now so strongly affects how we think about the future. 
And so it's good to be humble about what worry can actually do for us. 
A lot of times worry and anxiety comes when we feel like we've reached a kind of fork in the road. 
And it feels like we come to these forks again and again and again in life. 
But when we come to that fork and it's like it could go this way or it could go that way. 
It always feel it doesn't feel like a fork. 
It feels like the fork. 
It feels like this. 
This is it. 
Like my life has come to this decision or this point. 
And it can either go right or it can go wrong. 
And so we spend a lot of time kind of obsessionally trying to figure out which is right, which is wrong. 
But in that obsession in that worry, we've forgotten about all the forces that are propelling our life already. 
We sort of overestimate how different those, you know, frost said right there to like the came to two paths right and I took the one less road less travel. 
And that made all the difference, but that's often not true. 
You know, like did that path make all the difference? Did that did things unfolding this way make all the difference or that way? When I look back at my life, it's very hard to actually see true forks. 
You know, when you really look back at your life and I think about all the times or places that I was worried about with how many real forks were there. 
So many less than I thought, I would say. 
Now we can we can try to to plan and of course should. 
But our a lot of times our anxiety is a little bit like like an attempt to outsmart the first noble truth. 
Yeah, it's like there is difficulty, you know. 
And part of what really gets the mind going is this, the imagination that there is a duke free path. 
And if we just think hard enough and repetitively enough will actually figure out that yeah, going right, that's duke a free. 
Yeah, I do that, you know, that was especially when people are thinking about about, you know. 
They feel like they're at that fork in the road that whether it's a job or relationship or moving or, you know, medical decision. 
It feels like they're at that fork and it feels like we were looking the mind is really seeking that duke a free path. 
But part of what we're doing here in this practice and part of what makes us much less anxious is where we are like fully comprehending, which means opening the heart to the first noble truth. 
And that that's not that's not a depressing kind of heavy thing to do. 
In fact, Carol Wilson, the teacher, mostly at IMS, she said, if you're bummed out by the first noble truth, you're not really understanding it. 
So we're loosening the grip on on controlling things were loose. 
We to take the first noble truth into the heart is to know sometimes it's translated, you know, the truth of impermanence is translated as not as impermanence and Nietzsche, but as uncertainty. 
Don't know. 
Now that leaves us maybe feeling kind of vulnerable, but part of our practice is cultivating a kind of courage and sense that the heart can weather the various tides of conditions. 
That's part of what we're practicing on the in the on the cushion in the chair is is we're developing a confidence that we can actually bear with all of the different conditions that arise in life. 
This intolerance of uncertainty runs runs. 
It runs really so deeply. 
And I know in my in my life. 
I can see myself as kind of compulsively seeking ground, seeking a kind of place to stand some sort of haven, something outside of change. 
And in that is anxiety and a need to control and kind of braced against the tides of impermanence. 
But we're learning more and more to be to actually develop and taste a sense of safety amidst change. 
We open to change and it's terrifying and destabilizing. 
But we actually let go into groundlessness in a way that which actually creates a sense of safety and ease. 
Joseph Goldstein says that this is the first realization we we've sort of like jumped out of the plane with our parachute or we think with our parachute. 
And the first realization is we have no parachute. 
And then the second realization is there is no ground. 
And that is I love that that's we're like we're falling through life through space. 
I mean that is I sometimes almost have that visual image of just like falling through space. 
And like I try to hold on to this to this person to this identity to this, you know, home or money or this, you know, it's just like, and we're just falling through space. 
And of course, there's some like fear in that for a lot of people and there's some genuine relief when that complimentary insight, there is no ground. 
So we start to develop a confidence in the heart can can that it can weather the tides of impermanence. 
There's actually there's there's a lot of interest in the clinical world for around mindfulness for mental health generally but but anxiety specifically. 
A recent something was published in a very traditional well respected medical journal JAMA internal medicine just a couple weeks ago. 
They did a meta analysis. 
So they sort of aggregated all the findings from mindfulness meditation based studies, most of which I think was mindfulness based stress reduction. 
So an eight week program and looked at the its effect on anxiety and depression and their their conclusions. 
Clinicians should be aware that meditation programs can result in small to moderate reductions of multiple negative dimensions of psychological stress. 
Thus clinicians should be prepared to talk with their patients about the role that a meditation program could have in addressing psychological stress. 
I have a lot of hope for you and that's an eight weeks, you know, it's like who's been here for more than eight weeks. 
Yeah, who thinks they're done after eight weeks when I think about my meditation practice on day one and day 56. 
It was like Matthew's mind is a circus on day one. 
Matthew's mind is definitely a still a circus at day 56 right it's like we're just like just starting to scratch the surface. 
So it's remarkable to me when I see these studies actually find, you know, consistent literature emerging around eight week kind of programs. 
Whereas we know that is not adequate dosage, right. 
And so anyway, so I'm I'm quite enthusiastic about this with a with mindfulness for anxiety. 
And the basic mechanism is one of the main ways that anxiety gets treated psychotherapeutically is something, you know, like exposure therapy. 
That's a major component. 
And so just very briefly sketching, sketching this. 
The principle is that there's there's associations between particular object or stimulus and fear response. 
And the basic approach is to begin to separate the stimulus from the fear response. 
And so to use a very simple example of somebody has a is phobic of snakes. 
You would do you would you might do like a systematic desensitization whereby you would kind of first maybe have the person write the word in the in the clinical room you'd have them write the word snake on the paper. 
And, you know, and do some anxiety reducing strategies in that moment. 
Yeah. 
And to the point where it felt totally like that act of writing snake is felt like it, it was totally manageable, totally manageable. 
And the fear response didn't arise. 
And then you would sort of move up the hierarchy to maybe looking at a picture of a snake and then a video and then going to a zoo but not going in the snake exhibit. 
And then eventually you've got the boa constrictor wrapped around your neck and your eddies, you know, as you sort of successively master this. 
Yeah. 
And so this is this is called systematic desensitization and mindfulness in a lot of ways is like unsystematic desensitization. 
We don't have the hierarchy from writing snake to the boa constrictor, but we were we're being asked to make peace with everything. 
And if we sit enough, it all arises. 
It's just that's the logic of the Dharma. 
It all arises for us. 
Everything we need to make peace with will arise if we're open, honest. 
And so over time, we're, you know, and of course we're sitting, right? So we're sitting in the steadiness of the body, the ease of the breath, the openness of the heart, mind, and we're meeting all of the everything that could disrupt our peace with that stability. 
So all of the panicky thoughts or emotions or memories or it all gets integrated in this way. 
Now it's important to have, you know, to for the in this process as we kind of digest our anxiety. 
One of the important principles is for the level of distress not to be too high and not to be too low. 
Like in the therapeutic situation, you're the therapy doesn't work if you're doing things that don't cause any anxiety. 
So if you just kept writing snake on the paper, that's not going to do it. 
But if you come in on and on day two, the boas around the neck, and it's a full on meltdown, that's counter productive too. 
And in our practice, maybe we could maybe there's a parallel. 
We certainly don't want more than we can handle. 
We don't want more than we can handle. 
We want to be able to maintain some level of mindfulness with what's coming up with that anxious experience. 
And so we have to use our judgment. 
Like when do we just stay with it? When do we move to, you know, some other relaxed place in the body? When do we get up and take a walk? We have to use our judgment with that. 
We work on the deconstructing the actual experience of anxiety. 
And this is something that Shinzen Young, who's teaching Saturday, probably talk a fair amount about. 
But actually picking apart the different phenomena involved in anxiety or any experience. 
When it gets all tangled up, when the thinking and the thinking being talk and images gets tangled up with feeling in the body. 
And there's a kind of pinball effect between the anxious thought, the discomfort in the body. 
The images of the future, the dire ones or the Duke of Free ones or whatever, you know, when the attention starts to really pinball there between image, talk and feeling. 
This is can become overwhelming. 
When we can start to untangle the actual experience so that we're actually infusing mindfulness into those different components of experience, this dramatically decreases the kind of overwhelm. 
So a couple more things before we stop. 
Part of what a major source of anxiety in my experience is the kind of fear of being found out. 
We feel a lot of the time our cover can be broken. 
Somebody can find out more than we want them to know. 
And part of our practice is actually creating an integrated life where we feel like there's nothing to hide. 
We feel like we've made peace with all of our secret material and we feel like we can bring an authenticity to our interactions so that literally we can't be found out because we're not hiding anything anymore. 
We're not hiding from ourselves. 
We're not hiding from others. 
And so there's this peace around authenticity and making peace with our past and with all the different parts of ourselves and gathering that into a sense of wholeness that we're not ashamed of. 
And we may regret things. 
We may have really sensitive, tender zones in our life. 
We may be very private about certain things, but there's not that sense of I could be found out. 
And part of why I don't feel anxious teaching is because I know that I'm being really honest about my experience and I do care about this and this is my life. 
And so I may be wrong. 
No doubt I'm wrong about lots of stuff, but I've got nothing to hide. 
And this kind of leads to a sense of ease. 
Lastly, we become confident in the kind of trajectory of the heart that the way we care for the future is to take good care of the heart now. 
And when we really look at like, what are the seeds of our wellbeing? Where does happiness, where will happiness come from in the future? The best we can do is nourish the heart now to take good care of that. 
And we develop a kind of trust in that. 
And that's not an anxious process. 
We just do what we can to nourish the heart. 
And that has effects, that has effects. 
But that's how we care for our lives and that's how we do what we can to insulate ourselves from the ups and downs of life is to care well for the heart. 
And to care well is to learn letting go. 
I just said, not apart from relinquishing all, do I see any safety for living beings? I just said for a moment. 
May whatever goodness is here tonight together. 
May this be of benefit for all that we encounter. 
May whatever joy and freedom and ease as ours may this be of service in small or big ways. 
May it be a cause for the reduction of suffering, increase in peace and kindness. 
Thank you. 
Nice to be with you. 
Have a good night.
