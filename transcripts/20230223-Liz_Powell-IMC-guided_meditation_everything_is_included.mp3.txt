 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Just giving yourself time to settle in to what's actually here right now. Finding the posture that's comfortable for you and also awake. And noticing what's following you into this sitting or what's here right now in the body. Feelings. Any thinking. State of mind or mood. What's arising. What's arising. What's arising. What's arising. Allowing yourself to be aware and receive whatever is prominent in the body. And if possible, bringing ease to any areas of the body to which a little relaxation or softening can be brought. But always beginning that with allowing what is already here. And allowing it to be just exactly as it is. Recognizing it. What's most obvious in the awareness right now. Receiving anything and everything that comes into the field of awareness and is obvious. No need to search for anything or dig for anything. Simply receiving what floats into awareness. Sometimes we can allow ourselves a gentle quiet mental noting periodically. Not too often but just every once in a while perhaps saying now I'm aware of and noticing whatever is prominent. And this too. Everything is included in this receptive awareness practice. Leaving nothing out. Meaning there's no wrong experience or no preferred experience of meditation. We're simply being present for the flow of what arises and passes. Without preference. What arises might be pleasant. It might be unpleasant. It might be clear or foggy. Contracted, distracted, wide open. It might be something that you think isn't meditation practice. Might be something you prefer as meditation practice but leaving nothing out. As long as an experience is felt, received, enters awareness, is recognized and allowed to come and go at its own pace. It is all meditation practice. We're aware of this too. And now I'm aware of whatever is prominent. Continuing in silence. Gently returning to awareness and what am I aware of now from time to time including everything, excluding no experience that comes and is recognized and allowed. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
