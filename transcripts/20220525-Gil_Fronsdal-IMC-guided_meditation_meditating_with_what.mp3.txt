Thank you for watching. Good morning, everyone. Welcome. So today, the meditation is about knowing and not knowing. Part of the challenge of meditation is all the meaning we assign, the significance, the fantasies, delusions, the ideas that we add on top of our direct experience. One of the ways is assigning personal meaning or personal ideas about what it means for me. And some of that's okay, but some of it is extra. It can be delusion and fantasy. And one of the ways to meditate is to meditate with... Part of what we do is not know, not try to figure things out, not try to explain them, not try to assign meaning to them or ask why they're there or how to fix them. And so this can be practiced with a question, just a simple statement, what? What is this? But not trying to answer it. Almost like, what is what allows us to witness something and see it fresh and see it anew and really know, kind of see, let it appear, come to us. So to sit with a what and then see what without needing to know the answer. To just sit with what's there, not knowing what's there in a sense, but letting it show itself to us, but not asserting or projecting our ideas on top of it. And this is so helpful for the living in our life, always to begin with a question of what and let the experience speak to you rather than you claiming the experience for yourself. So what? So to begin by assuming a upright, balanced posture. And entering into this posture as if you're not coming with a long history of knowing exactly how you should sit, exactly what's your way, but to kind of discover what the posture can be as if it's the first time. And then to lower your gaze and perhaps close your eyes. And this what can begin right away. What is this experience of sitting here being present when there's no overlay of shoulds or expectations or ideas of where you're going, practice? Just what to this experience? A willingness to not explain, not even to know what it is, but just to feel and sense and allow it to be what it is. And to have this what for what's happening in your mind. Thoughts, the attitudes, the reactions. And this what is some deeper question almost like what is here? What is this mind about? What's happening here? But perhaps not looking for answers, just being open to feel and see and sense. And then perhaps taking a few long, slow, deep breaths to settle into your body, to settle into your place. Letting your breath return to normal. And then relaxing your body a bit. The face, the shoulders, the belly. And each time you relax, imagine that you ask the question, what is this? As if you're discovering this part of your body for the first time. What's happening as I relax? What is revealed? And then to let yourself settle into your breathing, the rhythm of breathing, with a beginner's mind. With the best you can without expectations or ideas of what should happen, what it's supposed to be like. Just what? What is this experience of sitting here breathing? With the question of what implies a relaxation of searching and looking. It's just what and being open to whatever is here. Open to breathing, to body, to mind. What a beginner's mind that brings a receptivity and a willingness to just be here with this. Not needing to make it into anything. Judge it by just the what. The question of what that takes you away from your discursive thinking, your fantasies. The what to what's happening now here, just now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. Sitting with an attitude of what? That it opens you, makes you curious to this experience now. While at the same time, not needing to know. Not needing to have it understood in words or just an open curiosity to this. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. When the mind wanders off in thought, what is this? What is the question of curiosity that quiets the mind in the process of this silent discovery? The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. The question of what's happening now. One of the benefits of developing a mindfulness practice can be a comfort level with not knowing. And not needing to have something to say, something to explain. Not needing to know what's supposed to do. Just present. Accompanying the experience. Allowing the experience to show itself more fully without the filter of our ideas and explanations and certainties. To ask the question of what, without looking for an answer, just looking for, looking, seeing more fully. And in this way, perhaps we can know people in a new way, fresh way, not see them through the old filters and ideas and histories and memories. Not see them through the roles and ideas. By not knowing who they are, we actually can get to know them more fully in some way. What is known when we don't try to know? Perhaps the quiet stillness of the mind, of mindfulness, can help us to have greater goodwill and respect for others. May it be that as we come out of meditation, whatever ability we have to be present without needing to know, needing to explain, generates greater care for the welfare and happiness of others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. Thank you.
