Connecting to your body here and now.
Just taking in how you are in this moment.
We could say that mindfulness practice is allowing or orienting
towards the body and mind being together at the same place at the same time.
Often our minds are off in some other world and disconnected from our present moment experience.
So connecting to our physical body is a good way in to being present, being mindful.
Being aware.
Just touching in on this simple experience of sitting, breathing, sensing.
And you can just take in what is most obvious right now.
Settling back and just receiving how you are in this moment.
How the body is, how the mind is.
Remembering that relaxation is such a helpful support for this connection in the present moment.
When the body and mind are not relaxed, they tend to be pulled into thoughts, ideas, worries, concerns.
And so the body can relax. It helps the mind to relax.
When the mind relaxes, it is quite naturally available to be present for what is here in the moment.
So relaxing the body.
You can, if it's helpful, scan through the body.
Notice where there may be tension and see if there can be conscious releasing of that tension.
Sometimes that's possible.
And sometimes it can be helpful.
I find relaxing the obvious musculature of the body really helpful.
And then checking in because sometimes there can be a deeper inner relaxation in the core of the body.
So perhaps you can relax.
Perhaps there can be a relaxation inside the throat.
Perhaps the heart.
The stomach can relax.
Maybe the intestines can relax.
Maybe too, the mind can soften and relax as the body relaxes. That becomes more possible.
Mental tension often comes with a contraction of worries, concerns, thoughts about the past or the future or even what's happening now.
Maybe that thinking can relax.
With this mind and body that are perhaps somewhat more relaxed than before, checking in again, how are you right now?
What's here in this moment?
Maybe it feels a little bit shifted from earlier. However it feels is fine. Just being aware.
This is how it is right now.
Receiving experience.
For some of you that receptive aspect of experience may be quite broad.
Opening up to whatever wants to be experienced in this moment, whatever is more obviously coming up.
For some of you it may feel more useful to choose an area of experience such as the breath or maybe hearing.
Maybe the sense of the whole body sitting here.
If you choose to pick a particular experience to orient to like the breath, it can be interesting to explore
that receptive quality of the mind even as you choose the area of experience.
So receiving the breath.
Settling back and letting the breath come to you or sound coming to you or body sensations coming to you.
And seeing if there can be curiosity and curious about the experience.
What is this experience of breathing or hearing?
How is it happening? How does it felt?
We are cultivating awareness, mindfulness.
And so however you are practicing in the moment, whether allowing an open or receptive non-directed awareness
or choosing directing attention.
Connection is that we are aware.
A cultivation moment after moment aware of what is here.
That mind that is aware of experience
may be colored by feelings or ideas.
So it can also be useful to from time to time be curious not only about what is happening in the present moment
but how the mind is in relationship to it.
So there is perhaps sound happening in the present moment.
Is the mind at ease with that sound happening?
Or is there resistance?
Not to, whatever that relationship is, either the ease or the resistance in this case can also be known
in this area of kind of being aware of the quality in the mind that knows experience.
Sometimes this is kind of not seen or it's hidden from us.
When it's not seen, it can have a powerful conditioning effect, especially those habits of greed, aversion, delusion.
And so in being aware of experience, knowing what's happening,
from time to time being curious about how you are in relationship to experience.
Is the mind wanting something to happen, wanting something to stop happening?
Maybe there's ideas or beliefs about something that should be happening.
Or maybe there is ease, peace, calm, which also sometimes can go unnoticed
and is a beautiful recognition.
And we can notice, oh yeah, this is what calm feels like.
This is what ease feels like.
So continuing cultivation of awareness, noticing what's here in this moment.
And maybe occasionally checking in, how am I in relationship to the experience.
There's not a lot to do if you notice a particular relationship just allowing that to be,
oh that too is happening right now.
There's hearing and there's resistance.
But there's body sensation and there's ease.
Just gently continuing the practice.
