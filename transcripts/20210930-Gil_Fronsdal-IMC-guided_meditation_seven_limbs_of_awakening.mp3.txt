 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good day everyone. Hello. I'm happy to be here. I might be a little bit, not quite myself today. I had the COVID booster shot yesterday and been going through chills and feeling very tired. And the moment I feel great. And so maybe it'll stay that way. But if I begin to sag, then that is why probably. So, the topic for today is, some people have said, is the crown jewels of Buddhism. It is a list called, usually called the seven factors of awakening. The word for factors can also mean limb. And occasionally you see seven limbs of awakening. And I like this that you have limbs. Factors just seems like a list. A list, but limbs seems like a part of a whole. It's like a body. And it's a little bit more associated to me to our own body. Our lived experience. And the seven factors of awakening are not abstractions, but they are lived experiences. That maybe you can understand them to be what happens when you get in the groove of meditation. Groove of mindfulness of the practice. That maybe you're just learning to ride a bike and it's awkward and difficult. But at some point you can jump on your bike and maybe you're going for a long distance and you get in the groove and it just feels like you're just moving along in a really wonderful way. Or many other things we do once we master them. In the groove it's just a delight to be absorbed in doing the activity. So these seven limbs of awakening are things that begin to arise when the hindrances abate and the distractions abate and the attachments abate. And we get into the groove of mindfulness. So what I'd like to do for this sitting is a little bit of a guided tour, guided meditation on the seven factors of awakening. And perhaps that's a nice way of being introduced to them or to be connected to them. Is if I'm able to kind of point to them or evoke them or give you a sense in your own experience how they work, how they are. So first I'll tell you what the seven are. They are mindfulness, investigation. Usually the next one is energy. I'd like to today call it strength. And then joy, tranquility, and concentration, samadhi, and equanimity. And we'll go through these again so you don't have to memorize them right now. So assuming a meditation posture that you can gently close your eyes. And it's a way of establishing yourself here, kind of definitively here. Taking a few long, slow, deep breaths, three quarters full. It's a big enough breath so that it becomes a predominant thing you're focusing on. Take some intentionality, long exhale so that you take some attention to this to do it. And begins this turning from the distracted mind to being present. And maybe deep breaths and as you exhale also to relax the body. Sometimes the deep in breath allows for kind of a deeper, even internal relaxation on the exhale. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And with the orientation to gather yourself here in this present moment, putting aside your distracted thoughts. As you exhale, relaxing the muscles of your face as if you're settling in with your face to be here. Face doesn't have to work or figure things out or reach forward, be outward directed. The face can settle back on itself, be at ease. On the exhale to soften the shoulders. Let go, relax. Release the holding contraction of the shoulders from busyness and fear. And on the exhale, softening the belly. And with the softening of the belly also kind of a settling of your weight into your lower torso. And then to settle in now on the experience of the body breathing. Accompanying the body as it breathes with your attention. The first factor of awakening is mindfulness. Awareness. And you might say, use the word here, H-E-R-E. Awareness is here, nowhere else. Here with awareness, here with a little bit of clarity, present, attentive to your experience. Here and now, breathing. Letting your awareness be here with breathing. Awareness accompanies breath as a companion for the body breathing. Breathing. Perhaps as you exhale to let go of your thoughts. So that the quieting absence of thinking makes more room for awareness to be here, to be open, to be clear. The second factor of investigation is investigation. The second factor of awakening is investigation. It's not analysis or probing, but rather very simple attunement to your experience that can be expressed through the word, what? Whatever you're aware of, just say, what? What is this? Not answering it with words, but rather let it register more fully as if you get closer to it or feel it more fully. Maybe giving a sensory awareness that you receive. So there's more clarity, distinction of what's here with the question, what? It's as if you get closer to the experience. Like putting a hand on a piece of wood and then you can feel it more carefully. The hand of awareness goes on the breathing and there's more richness and variety of sensations that you experience in breathing. The next factor of awakening is strength. Can you call upon a gentle strength so you inhabit in a strong way the simplicity of being here and present? Maybe a kind of inner strength in your body, not the same as muscular strength, but maybe a kind of strength of gentle determination. Yes, here. Engaged strength that supports awareness. Yes. The fourth factor of awakening is joy. The delight of being engaged fully in the experience, coursing in mindfulness in the present moment, appreciating the opportunity to be here. I associate joy with the word yes. Yes, to be with this experience. Yes, to feeling the breath in the body. And maybe even you can make a small half smile. It makes it easier to enjoy being present here with breathing. Yes. The next factor is tranquility. Perhaps there's a way of continuing to relax. Let things be calmer. The calming of your thinking mind, a deeper relaxation of the body. And whatever reference point you have for present moment tranquility, maybe that can be a magnet for awareness in the present moment. The next factor is samadhi. I think of it associate. I associate this with the word steady. Just steady oneself here now. Just steady oneself in the middle of our whole being. So all of us is here supporting present moment awareness. Awareness that flows or radiates from all of our life now here. Steadying oneself on the breathing. So. So. So. The last factor of awakening is equanimity. Maybe can be associated with the word okay. Not being in conflict with anything or troubled by anything. Just it's okay. So the mind is less reactive, more balanced to be here with the breathing in your body, strong, centered. Awareness not pushed around or caught up in what is happening. But staying balanced, equanimous, non-reactive. It's okay. So. So. So. So. So. And then I'll name each of the seven factors of awakening. As you listen to them, can you find a reference inside of yourself for each through a memory or place in your body or some feeling of each and within. You see them as a kind of strength that support you to be balanced and attentive, grounded in the middle of all the difficulties of life. Mindfulness. Investigation. Strength. Joy. Tranquility. Concentration. Equanimity. So. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, perhaps consider that each of these seven limbs of awakening are a support for gazing upon the world kindly, compassionately. They're a way of being available in a helpful way for others. Supported by the seven limbs of awakening, you're less likely get caught up in your reactivity and more likely to be present and see clearly. Respond to the world with something with something from a place of wholesomeness. Goodness. May through this practice, we strengthen a wholesome, caring way of being with the world. Certainly this world needs more people who bring kindness and compassion and care, friendliness. And maybe this practice we do does that for us so that we intentionally, consciously are attentive to making this world a better place for others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings everywhere be free.
