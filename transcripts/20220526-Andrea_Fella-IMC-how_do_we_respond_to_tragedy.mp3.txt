The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
What's on my mind this evening is the tragedies of this country these last few
weeks. And how do we respond, especially in the situation where they're
perpetuated by people, it can be a little more difficult. These recent shootings
in Buffalo and Vivaldi, really painful to feel, to be with. And so I thought to
just explore a little bit of what do the Buddhist teachings have to offer with
something like this. The first thing that came to my mind, the first teaching
that came to my mind when reflecting on this, was the quote from the Dhammapada.
Hatred never ceases through hatred. Through non-hatred alone does it end.
It's so easy to respond to hatred with hatred. You know, that's, it seems almost
like our natural kind of, we tend to mirror what's coming up. Somebody brings
hatred to us, we often respond with that anger, with anger. And so it's, it's so
easy to respond with hatred. And in a situation like these mass shootings,
it's really likely that a variety of emotions will arise, possibly including
hatred. Hatred perhaps for the perpetrators, hatred for perhaps people we
might feel or sense as participating in systems or structures that supported or
created, or encouraged those conditions.
And yet, and given this teaching, hatred never ends through hatred, we might think
that we're supposed to not feel hatred. But that's not, that's not usually what
happens. You know, we, we have these responses. And so the teachings, while
encouraging us to, I think that the, the teachings encourage us not to act on
hatred, but the teachings encourages us to open to what is here in this moment.
Like the, the friend, you know, the friend that I was speaking about in the
guided meditation, you know, a really good friend might be able to sit with you
while you're really angry, while you're really frustrated, while you're feeling
so much. And so the, the wisdom teachings of the Buddha point us to meeting our
experience, meeting the feelings that come up around situations like this. And we
might think, you know, this is not enough. And the Buddha's teachings don't
simply, that the teachings encourage us, encourage us to know what's happening in
our system, so that we can respond from a more skillful place instead of
reacting out of our habitual tendencies, or reacting out of the patterns of the
deep, deeply conditioned, habitual responses with hatred and hatred, hatred
responding to hatred, deeply conditioned, deeply patterned in many of us. And so the
teachings point us to really get to know what's happening in our system so that
we can respond, not so that we can just settle back and say, oh yes, things as
they are. Now that, that, that I think is an often mistaken understanding of the
teachings of what it means to really meet our experience as it is. And so in
meeting hatred internally, if we, if we feel this with these situations, if we
feel this kind of response of a constriction of a, of an anger, of a
rage, of a raging against, against the perpetrators, against those teenagers
really, in these two situations too, 18 year old, 18 year olds, it's tragic,
tragic for all of the victims, people in the market, in Buffalo, the children in
the school. And if we touch into the experience of hatred, or if that's if
we're feeling that, getting to know it, meeting it, we feel, we feel the, we feel
the suffering of it, ourselves. We feel the pain of feeling hatred. This actually
was a kind of a shock for me at one point. I was really, really angry with the
person who had really hurt me, you know, in a deep way. And I was exploring the
anger that was coming up with that person, and began to feel into how
painful it was, or felt how, how painful it was for me to feel it, but then also
felt the, the wanting to lash out, you know, wanting to, actually wanting to harm
the person, you know, wanting that person to suffer, feeling that, wanting that
person who had harmed me to feel bad themselves. And yet feeling the, the
anger myself, I mean, in this case, it was, was kind of obvious because I was
7,000 miles away from the person. I was in the Peace Corps on an island in the
remote South Pacific, and the person was in California. And he didn't even know
what I was feeling. He didn't know how angry I was. He didn't know all of what
was going on. And so it was really clear to me that these emotions were hurting
me, and they were doing nothing to him. And yet there was that, that feeling or
that sense of, yeah, I want this to hurt him. I want this to, to cause him some
kind of pain or suffering. And that was really humbling to see that, you know, to
actually see that anger leading to a wish for somebody else to suffer. And in
that, seeing that, I felt a real, there was an interesting kind of sense of
understanding the
impersonal nature of the, the kind of human nature of these emotions. And I had
the sense of the feeling of like, wow, you know, this feeling, this anger, this is
where wars start. It was humbling. But it was also, you know, really connecting
to recognize that what was happening inside of me was happening inside of
everyone. And so seeing that, you know, seeing that was really, really helpful.
It was, it was the wisdom, the wisdom of the mindfulness there really pointed
itself out to me. And I think in a situation like this, with these, these
shootings, we can look at our own responses and feel into how these
emotions are affecting us. And, you know, touching into that, when we really touch
into them seeing, yeah, this isn't just about me. This is about how the, how
humans react with each other, how humans relate to each other. And so we begin to
feel or we touch into, like, this is not a good place to act from. We get, we get
that. We have a sense of that.
It seems to work this touching in to the anger, you know, when I first started
practicing, I didn't really understand how it would work to turn my attention to
be with something like anger or hatred or any of these really difficult negative
emotions. I just thought it would make me more angry or feel more hatred. But it
seems to do something, the mindfulness, you know, it's like having that friend
with you, you know, give some space. My sense is it kind of disengages the gears
of the, the habit or pattern and allows there us to feel it without like
perpetuating it. And so we also learn the value of this kind of practice, this
kind of mindfulness to, to feel into it. We begin to trust that feeling into
these difficult emotions, these reactive emotions doesn't perpetuate them, but
actually begins to allow them to release to we learn about how they affect us, how
they affect the world, how they, they are not personal, that they're really the
way human beings tend to relate to each other. And so we, we gain some
understanding of how the, how this works, how it begins to let us let go and
also of the suffering that it causes us here and now to have these emotions, the
understanding that this is not a good place to. So that's one side of some of
the emotions we might feel that the anger side, the hatred side, the, you know, that
side of just wanting to annihilate that energy itself of, of anger is, it's the
same as what, as what's happening in those events, in those mass shootings.
It's a similar kind of energy. But then there's also the feelings that we have
about those who are harmed. The, there's a lot of different, as I felt through it,
you know, myself, there's, there's different responses. Fear, fear is one
kind of response, confusion is another kind of response, and a big one, a big
one is like a feeling of helplessness. Like what can I do? You know, how, how do I
engage? What, what, what do I do? I think these feelings, the feelings of fear, of
confusion, of helplessness, all kind of contribute to, or kind of underlying the,
the, the vulnerability that comes with the helplessness to the, you know, the kind
of a truth to that vulnerability. And there's no guarantee any one of us is
going to live to the end of the day. There's just this inherent vulnerability
of being human. And when we really meet this vulnerability, and it's kind of
brought into our consciousness as these events can do for us. I think anger kind
of arises from these places. Anger is almost like a response to the fear, to
the confusion, to the, to the helplessness. The hatred is a response to that,
feeling of helplessness. And, and, and perhaps if we can really land with these
feelings, the feeling of fear, the feeling of confusion, the feeling of
helplessness, again, with mindfulness. Mindfulness is an amazing teacher for us.
Meeting, and I think too, meeting our own fear, similarly to meeting our own anger,
you know, there's a way in which we feel or recognize, wow, this isn't just when
we really need it with, with that sense of, this is what a human being is who's
experiencing fear. This is what it feels like to be a human being who's
experiencing helplessness. We recognize that this is a human response. And it, my
experience is it really seems to open the heart to recognize humans respond this
way. Meeting our own fear, we kind of touch the fear of others. Meeting our own
confusion, we, we touch or understand maybe, we understand how others can be
confused. Meeting vulnerability, meeting helplessness in our, in ourselves, we
understand, wow, this, this, this is hard when people feel this way. It's really
hard. And so it begins to open us to the quality of compassion. To open to our
own feelings. The anger as well as all of the kind of perhaps deeper underlying
feelings that are under the anger. It, it seems to support an opening to
recognizing that this is a human condition. These are human feelings. And
human beings in this situation feel these things. It's not, it's not, it's not
directly about me. It's kind of more an expression of humanity. And that, that kind
of recognition that these feelings are not just happening to me. I mean, we can
recognize these feelings that I'm, I'm talking about it really shared by a lot
of us right now. Especially, especially the people who have been directly
touched by the deaths. So much, so much suffering, so much pain, so much heart
break. So the compassion side of things, you know, compassion comes, I think, with
some wisdom. Wisdom, I feel like the mindfulness practice is a wisdom
practice. It's asking us to really explore what is your human experience. And it
begins to help us to see experience not as just about me, but more as related to
causes and conditions. Not personal and seeing how causes and conditions affect
everyone. This opens our heart to this quality of heartbreak when we touch
suffering. The word, the compassion, the word sometimes is described, the feeling
is described as a quivering in the heart when suffering is not, not feeling. To me
it's like, kind of it's like a bowl of jello. It's not hard, it's not rigid. It's
like a bowl of jello that, like, if you bump into it, it's gonna shake. You know,
the least little touch of a bowl of jello is gonna make it quiver. And that's
kind of how the heart feels. It doesn't feel rigid, it doesn't feel constricted
when, when the world, the resonances of the world touch a heart that is not
constricted. It resonates in empathy, it resonates with. If there's suffering, it
resonates with compassion. If there's beautiful things happening, it resonates
with joy. So compassion has this quivering feeling, this quivering of the heart
and it also comes with a wish to engage, a wish to alleviate suffering, a wish to
act in some way. So compassion, when we touch into that feeling, it has a kind
of a call to action, a movement of the heart to want to do something. And this
may, this may be partly why the helpless quality comes, because we don't know
what to do sometimes, but we feel like we want to do something. And so, you know, I
think there's different expressions, there's different expressions of
compassion. There can be really individual expressions of compassion and, and
I would just like to encourage you to reflect on, you know, what, what feels
like an expression of compassion for you, maybe in, you know, in various
situations it's going to be different. In this situation with the shootings, for
some it may be a response with activism or political or social expression, for
some it may be more personal and supporting those who are suffering. For
some it may, they may feel called to, to look and understand more fully, deeply
inside of their own patterns and habits of, of hatred and anger. So the
teachings point us to look inside, and I feel like the looking inside allows us
to find our way to a heart that's less constricted and to be able to act. And
that action, you know, doesn't have to look any, any one way. We can really, I
think, honor what our, what our own personal expression of that compassion
might be. And I think it's, it's perhaps a little bit of,
maybe, maybe exploration to not pick up what others maybe think it should be for
us, but to really look in our own hearts, what is the movement or expression of
compassion from this being, because I think, I think we need a lot of different
expressions of compassion for the suffering in this world, not just certain
kinds. I mean, we don't know sometimes what, you know, what the responses or what
the ripples will be of, of our own expressions of compassion. The way we
might end up touching someone else who touches someone else who touches someone
else. So I think it's, it's worth really finding that, that resonance in us. What
is, what is this part, what is this being's expression of compassion in this
situation? There's some of my thoughts. I'm curious, curious what your, some of
your thoughts are, maybe in response to what I've offered or anything that's up
for you.
Sorry, if I think Barbara muted herself too. Oh, sorry, I didn't notice that,
Barbara. Please, you go first. Okay, okay. Hello, everybody. Yeah, I think just a
couple things. I think if I, I realize this is pretty hard, it's hard. Not just
one day hard, two days hard, but it's really just hard. I think I'm just
feeling into this deep grief and realizing that because I think after the
first day, I thought, okay, I'm just gonna rest. This is hard. I'm giving myself
chance to rest, rest, rest, because just there's a lot of hurt. And then there was
a lot of restlessness, not just this, but other parts of my life just felt just
really restless and dissatisfaction. And I realized there was a wanting to move
beyond this, but I'm not ready yet. I kind of still just, this is much just a
deep grief. And so when I realized that, it's sort of like what Andrea was saying,
the, the mindful, the awareness of that allows a sort of aligning with this is
hard. It's, this is really hard. So give myself, so be with it again. Don't be so
quick to wanna, I could like, okay, there's some kind of things like, oh, and once
that aligning happens with awareness, then there's a, it's still hard, but there's a
certain relaxation of the body. Like, this is where I need to be. That speaks to
kind of, to me, that resonates with what I brought in in the guided meditation,
neither tearing nor hurrying, you know, not rushing past something, you know, not
give it, not thinking like, you know, I should be done with this by now or
something, you know, it's like that would be rushing past. So it's, it's kind of an
interesting delicate balance between neither tearing or hurrying, not to like
wallow in it, but also to really give it its due, you know, to feel it, to, to let
the process of these emotions, you know, they, they have an expression and I
think, you know, it can take time. And there's a lot of other things. I mean, like,
you know, I was also reflecting on the whole underlying background of the
invasion of Ukraine. That is like, you know, that's a big thing too, you know, the
whole, the whole, that's kind of up seeing all of that. So, you know, it's like,
there's a, there's a lot happening right there. And I think to think we should be
able to get over it or to get on with it. Yeah, I think honoring, honoring is the
word that comes up for me. Honoring what we are feeling. If we can find our way to
some extent with the holding of the rage, you know, it's like the sinking into the
rage is, yeah, I mean, that, that's where that urge comes from, the annihilation
urge comes from. Entering into Buddhist practice means checking in, you know,
really opening fully to what is here in the human condition. It's not stepping
away from it, but it's opening fully to it in a completely different way. And it's
hard, it's hard to open to this kind of rage without getting sunk into it. And so
there's a, there's some, there's some skill to it. And if, you know, if we could
potentially, I do believe, I do believe that modeling that is valuable, you know,
that having people who can hold that possibility is valuable, that maybe that
too would be contagious, like anger and hatred are contagious, maybe the capacity
to hold it would also be to hold it and to understand from it and to, to
recognize that that's not a place to act from, that, that might also be
contagious. Thank you. Daniel commented, I'll just, is it, is it, I hope it's okay
Daniel, if I share your, your comment. Thank you. Yeah, I live in China, it's
1130 a.m. on Friday. My apartment overlooks a kindergarten. I can hear the
kids playing. I've never seen these kills do, kids do a drill for an active
shooter. Wow. That's, you know, that's something that has been happening here for
10, 10 years or more, you know, just the, the pain of that in this country. Okay,
Barbara. So my inquiry started just like you were talking in the, in the setting,
the, the early setting and the terror or, or hurry and what actually, what came up
that I even wanted to ask you earlier is I'm looking at the wall because that's
where I was sitting. That I was feeling sort of something like clear for a long
time and then all of a sudden, my consciousness just shifted and I realized
that, okay, here's another layer of consciousness and neither were good or
bad, but it, it was a different point of view. And it was like, it's so interesting
how we can think we're clear and balanced and then something even not even a
thought that you're aware of shifts and you're, what you thought was clear and
balanced is not, is something else. Or it's just that you have, you have so many
layers of consciousness or, or options of being human that any point of view is
actually a point of view. And that, I mean, talk about, in terms of the, the
shooting, my first thought was clearly it's, it's a mental illness thing and
that's what keeps happening. And to me, as a result of the bickering in politics,
it's just going to everything. So it's easier to think about that intellectually
or, or think that I could, I know what to do. But actually, when I noticed that my
own consciousness isn't as stable as I think it is, it's like, yeah, I mean, I
think it's really useful to look at views, to look at what we're holding as a
perspective. Not that, I mean, it's, it's not to just say everything is, is
relative. I mean, the Buddha pointed to, you know, that there are certain views
that are useful to hold and like, you know, ethical conduct is, is useful.
Non-harming is, is a useful perspective. And yet understanding that this is, you
know, and his perspective, basically, the right view of the path is basically what
will lead us to suffering and what will lead us to more ease and peace. And yet
it's, it's a view that we start with. And then, you know, the recognition of, yeah,
when I engage and we feel it too, when we feel into the experience, we feel that
acting from hatred, acting from anger harms us and creates harm externally. And
so we, we feel that that's not helpful. And so it's, it's, it's like the view
that we start with, and I mean, these aren't, these aren't views about politics
so much. This is more views about how the human mind works. But we start with a
kind of understanding there and then begin to understand in our direct
experience how that, that view actually supports us moving away from the, the
clinging, moving away from the suffering, moving towards more ease and peace in our
own hearts and in others, you know, the, the, the connection there that, you know,
the more we cultivate that reduction of greed, aversion and delusion in our own
hearts, the more it ripples out to, to support others. So there's, there are some,
I mean, I wouldn't say that all views are kind of, it's not, it's not that, that
holding views or having views is, is useless, you know, so, but I think it's
useful to recognize what perspective are we coming from and is that perspective
limiting us. The, I think the, the perspective of the Buddha there is, it's
really helping us to see, I mean, really the view, the view the Buddha is
pointing to is a view that helps us to understand that our perspectives limit
us. It's kind of an interesting, you know, a view that helps us to see the
limitation of views essentially. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you Barbara. I, I
appreciate Daniel what you brought in about your community and like, I mean, here
is, I think of China is being more rigid and yet these children are feeling much
more secure from what I'm understanding. Yeah. And Daniel, let me know his mic
isn't working so he can't unmute and talk with us. So, so yeah, yeah, I mean the
different perspectives, right? Different perspectives. So what is, can I ask, what
is safety in a time like this? Again, I'm speaking from a parent. I don't want to
miss sleep. It is on, right? That gets don't want to say, yeah, everything's okay. It's
not okay. It's not okay. Right. Yeah, it's not. And, and, and that's something, I mean,
this is an interesting kind of, to me, this comes back to this deep wish for our
safety, our well-being, our happiness, that's a meta wish. You know, that's a
wish of the heart. And it runs up against that deep wish runs up against the
unreliable nature of the world, the fact that we are really vulnerable as human
beings, that people do these things to each other. And, you know, so this is,
this is a truth that vulnerability, that unreliability of experience, the nature
of experience to, to be the, not the way we want it to be, you know, that there's a
truth there. And, and there's something of, you know, these two things, you know,
the deep wish for well-being and the truths, impermanent, unreliable,
uncontrollable, vulnerable. We don't understand quite how these can coexist.
You know, so they get tangled up. They get tangled up with hatred and anger and
fear and confusion and helplessness. And we feel like, sometimes we feel like,
well, you know, either these truths are true, you know, either there's this
vulnerability or, you know, this wish for well-being is, is valid, but these both
can't be true or valid. And so our minds, like, get those all tangled up. And it's
hard for us to understand that there is a perspective in which they're both
valid, you know, that the wish for safety is valid. That's a metawish. So, you know,
it's not what is safety. You know, I don't, I don't know that, I mean, the truth
of unreliability is, there's not an ultimate safety. You know, there's not,
I mean, we are all going to die. There's not an ultimate safety. And yet that
doesn't make the wish for safety and the actions that we can take to support
ourselves, to take care of ourselves. It doesn't make those invalid. So there's,
it's an interesting kind of paradox almost to explore the possibility that our
heart can hold both of these. And there's a way that mindfulness can help us to
navigate both the understanding of the vulnerability and the wish for safety and
not get tangled up, not get tied up in knots. But instead, like, you know, have
the knot untangled, you know, we think what we need to do is to take, you know,
cut the knot out, get rid of the knot and like take the scissors and cut the knot
out. But then we end up with a hole in the cloth. And what can happen with
mindfulness, it feels like to me that the mindfulness somehow untangles the
tango and leaves the threads woven so that there's a, you know, a stronger
place that we're from. And it's an exploration, you know, I don't really
have the answer except to say that I really trust the process of holding
both, not denying that wish for safety, you know, to not push that down, to
really connect with that, to feel into the meto wish for that, the compassion
wish for that. And recognize and it's an and situation, you know, and there is
vulnerability. When I hear the way you share the Dharma, the option, the
teaching of how to be more wholesome, it really, it feels a little bit more
easy to digest. And for this young mother, it seems like the teachings of the
Dharma is, is both the most responsible path. And it's very challenging. I
mean, it's many college courses. It's very challenging to come from this
perspective. The Buddha talked about swimming against the stream, you know,
the stream is, you know, carrying us in the direction of all the habitual
patterns that we, we tend to do. So, you know, the, the, this path is, it's
challenging. It's very challenging. And yet, and yet, you know, the, the taste
that you get of this path, early on, I mean, you know, really early on in my
practice, the taste that I got of, Oh, there's actually a path here. There's
this way feels like more ease and peace. You know, that the Dharma is
sometimes said to be good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in
the end. And I think we do get a taste pretty quickly that, yeah, that the
value of this path, even when it's hard, we feel it's a better way than
staying caught up in the way we had been engaging. So we feel that.
Yeah, I mean, I feel like two things that come up as you talk is the, the
reliability of truth, what's real here right now, just like I said earlier
right now, there's just this deep grief and to deny that to want to, because
it's painful and you know, I want to move, it doesn't, it can't move, you
can't move away from that truth. So similarly, like the truth of this
unreliability, things change, this is a fragility of being human, growing up
with this truth. It's really important to know that and understand and
perhaps as we grow, we develop the capacity to be with that and the
pains of that without annihilating, without running away from it, without
making anything other than what it is. So that's one real life, the truth
of things, how things are, it's really something really beautiful in
Buddhism that we can count on, right, the reality of things. And then the
other one is that's coming up just love, right, care, compassion, that that
doesn't go away because of how hard things are either. Like at the end of
it all, there is just this, you know, yeah, there is this love, this care,
like, this with things to be better, no matter how hard, yes, things to be, I
want people to be well and happy and that feeling is so nourishing. When we
connect it and really, really feel into it, it is so nourishing to connect
with that care. I think it's like some of the lubricant that helps us to get
through things.
