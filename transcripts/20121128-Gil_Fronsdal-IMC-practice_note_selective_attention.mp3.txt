Practice Note : Selective Attention

This morning it might be useful to consider the fact that 
most people , most of the time , have selective attention . 
There’s often an unconscious process by which we 
select what we’re going to focus on . There are hundreds 
of thousands of things you could focus on in the present 
moment, and even more if you are paying attention to 
things elsewhere – at other times and places . There’s a 
lot you can  notice, and somehow the mind has choices 
or priorities about what it will pay attention to, what’s 
important, what’s significant.  
 
For a variety of reasons , people will select different 
things out of the environment . Some of you , while sitting 
here,  might have been quite aware of the sound s of 
traffic , or of the rain , and that was selected . Some of 
you may hardly have been aware of t hat at all . Perhaps 
your inner dialogue was the most selected area of your 
experience , so your mind tended  to go that inner 
dialogue . For s ome of you , perhaps it was strong 
sensations in the body that seemed to say,  “Obviously I 
should pay attention there .” It’s interesting to watch .  
 
There’s pain in the knee , and your attention is drawn there . Occasionally I’ve had the experience of paying 
attention to something like the pain in my knee , and 
thinking, “This is hard. How can I manage any longer? ” 
Then after a while , I see that I haven’t noticed it for 
some time , because I’ve been involved in some really 
juicy thought . My mind was pulled into this thought , and 
it seemed so important , that I completely lost track of 
my pain until unfortunately , I woke up from my thinking , 
and noticed the pain  was still there.  
 
The point is we often select out of the environment. 
Some people select their bodily experiences because 
their body takes priority . For some people it’s their 
mental world . For others , it’s their emotional or 
interpersonal, interrelational world. W e’re sitting here in 
a group of people . But for some of you , when  you close 
your eyes , you completely forget that there  are other  
people here . Others of you close your eyes, and have a 
more heightened  awar eness  that there  is a group you 
are sitting with.  
 
We select out of the situation something to focus on, to 
pay attention to . To recognize and begin questioning 
that selection process is important : “Now I’m paying 
attention to this. Is this the best place  for my attention? 
Is this the obvious place where  I should be paying 
attention? If I am involved in consciously  choosing what 
to pay attention to, where would I like my attention to go 
in the present moment? Are there more  useful places to go to?” Perhaps there are. Maybe  there are  more 
meaningful or significant places to bring your attention  
to than where it goes by itself.  
 
It was raining today . For me, o ne effect the sound and 
the feeling of rain is that it helps me to feel more widely 
aware of my bod y. Maybe it’s the slightly different 
atmospheric pressure , or the sound . I don’t know 
exactly why I feel that way . When I ’m meditat ing and it 
rains , I find it helpful to drop in and open up to the 
experience of my body more than I usually would . It’s a 
global feeling . “What does it feel like here? ” I’m quite 
capable of having my attention go someplace else . But 
maybe those other places  are not as useful  as having a 
doorway to feel more connected to the present moment 
through my body . To relax and feel that global sense is 
nurturing, meaningful, and connecting.  
 
Is there something in the present moment  that is 
nurturing, meaningful, significant, or helpful that you can 
select out of your environment t o help you want  to be  
here in the present moment more fully ? For different 
people it’s different things . So, as you go through this 
day today , ask yourself that question.  
 
What are you selecting  on your own ? What is your mind 
selecting to focus on?  Is it required that you focus on 
what you happen to be focusing on? Are there more 
useful and meaningful things to select out of the environment? And are there things you can select that 
help put you more in the present moment  in ways that 
are nurturing, nourishing, meaningful, or supportive  – 
rather  than just letting  your mind go where it wants on 
its own? 
 
You might reflect on thi s in the walking meditatio n. How 
can I be here? What can you select out of this 
experience that would help you present and nourished 
by this , rather than struggl ing with it? How can you relax 
into in the present moment? What would help you relax, 
have ease, settle in here? What , in the wide range of 
experience , would help that?  
 
It’s not meant to deny what you are doing already , or 
push it away . I like to think of it as expanding  – realiz ing 
that there’s more going on than you thought . Perhaps 
you can take in part of that greater range in a way that’s 
useful for you . 
 
I hope you enjoy your morning.
