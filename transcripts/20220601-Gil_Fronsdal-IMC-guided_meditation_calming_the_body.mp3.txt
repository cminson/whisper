 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and welcome to our time together, 30 minute meditation. And the theme for today is tranquility, to sit with a tranquil body and mind. I think of it as an ability to sit quietly without being in conflict with anything, without being disturbed by anything. And it's a remarkable state to experience because it can feel like one of the most noteworthy, remarkable forms of spiritual health. Maybe even sometimes mental health, even physical health at times, to sit with the whole system at ease, undisturbed, but alert, clear. It involves learning not to be preoccupied with the little thoughts we have. The Buddha, in talking about his own practice, talked about not running after the little thoughts. I love this idea of little thoughts. They can seem so big, our thoughts, so huge and monumental and important. And maybe they're just little thoughts. Maybe thoughts by themselves are just floating ideas and memories and plans and projected fears into the future. So to sit quietly and tranquilly, to relax, all that can relax, while all that can be alert, can be present and clear. So not easy to accomplish, but the Buddha said that the nourishment, the food for tranquility is tranquility itself. So in other words, the ability to recognize is maybe at first just a hint of tranquility and then build on that. Feel the tranquility as an alternative to preoccupation, an alternative to being involved with the thoughts that are distressing or are still disturbing or reactive to what's happening here. So assuming a meditation posture, and maybe wiggling your body swaying back and forth a bit, swaying forward and back, straightening up and bending a little bit, until you find a posture that for you represents a balance of tranquility and alertness. Tranquility and attentiveness, an attentiveness, alertness that's embodied aware through the body. And then to lower your gaze and letting your eyes be cool, or feel any kind of coolness, quiet, that's possible in the eyes as they rest in their sockets, not looking at anything in particular. And then to gently close your eyes. And gently, maybe not a full deep breath, but a half deep breath, gently, tranquility, breathing in more fully. And you might try at the top of the in-breath to gently hold your breath for a moment or two, so that when you do begin the exhale, it can feel like a letting go, a releasing, letting go into a quiet state. And you might with a deeper, taking deeper breaths, pause for a moment or two at the end of the exhale, so that when you do inhale, it's a welcome attentiveness, welcoming the feeling of attentiveness, alertness, awareness of breathing. And here we have this wonderful alternation between releasing, relaxing on the exhale, and aware and alert on the inhale, letting your breathing return to normal. And on the exhale, soften the body, a global softening. On the inhale, as if the body expands, the whole body expands and gets larger, beyond the boundaries of the body even. And on the exhale, a softening, settling, releasing, softening the belly, softening in the chest, releasing the shoulders, releasing, relaxing the muscles of the face, and quieting, calming the energy of thinking, relaxing the thinking muscle. Now, see if you can find within your body, some place that there is a bit of calm or tranquility. Could be in the torso, the arms and hands and the legs, in the head, in the back, anywhere, where there's some feeling of tranquility, calmness. It doesn't have to be dramatic. It's a place in your body where it's most, where it's calmest. And then see if you can breathe through that area of calm, breathe with it. It's almost as if you're gently blowing on a small fire so that it grows. Adjusting your mind so the mind is calmer, quieter. Maybe even a stillness of mind as you're aware of whatever stillness, tranquility, peace, there might be in your body, in your heart. ethnic wants. It's freezing, dayf is not calm for you. See if you can let that recede to the background of awareness. Not to dismiss it or to ignore it entirely, but to give time to your capacity for being calm. That also, it's important for that also to exist for you in a strong way. And so to feel into calmness, tranquility. When you exhale letting go of your thoughts. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Letting go into the place within that is still quiet. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Relaxing the holdings in your body. Underneath your thinking. Maybe you'll find a place of calm and tranquility. Breathe with that place. Breathe through it. Breathe out of it. Let tranquility be the flavor of your meditation. Breathe out of it. Breathe out of it. Breathe out of it. Breathe out of it. Calm the feeling of it be at the center. Almost like that's who you are. If you're identified with your thinking, more as who you are. Switch to whatever degree of calm or tranquility, stillness you might have within. Let that be who you are. Let that be the center around which everything else orbits. Taking refuge in the calm. And see if you can let your eyes be calm and tranquil, cool, still. Either with your eyes closed or if it's most tranquil to open eyes gently. Maybe gazing down 45 degrees. Let the eyes open slightly. And with a calm gaze, relax gaze. Be aware of the world around you. The extended world out beyond where you are. People in your lives. People in your communities. People far away. People you don't know. Gaze upon it all calmly. Peacefully. For a few moments not disturbed, not in conflict. Just a calm regard. As if calmness, tranquility, is medicine for an agitated world. That your calmness is medicine for an agitated world. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may your tranquility be a way that you support the happiness, safety, peace, and freedom of others. May all beings be happy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
