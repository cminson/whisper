 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone. Welcome to our meditation together. And I very much appreciate the togetherness of this practice, that we never really walk this path, Dharma Path, alone. Even if we're meditating alone, it's not really alone. We're accompanied by generations of practitioners before us, and many practitioners who are practicing to this day, and then for all of us here, sharing this time together to meditate. Thank you. And as we begin, I want to... As we begin, I want to evoke a description of the school of Zen that I practiced in, the Soto Zen School, many years ago. And the way that they described themselves, at first they said they were claimed to be more the Zen of farmers. Other forms of Zen were more the Zen of the samurais. And I like this idea of farmers who are tilling their soil, and the kind of certain kind of humbleness of being with the soil and that life outdoors. But also they described that form of Zen as being... The description of it was, attention to detail. And there's something powerful about attending to the details of our life, as if they matter. And so one of the things that matter, it's a small detail, but it's the posture you assume when you meditate. And some people err in the side of being as comfortable as they can. And that can be fine, it can be appropriate. But in doing that, maybe you miss an opportunity. Because one of the details of a healthy life, a strong life, a life that's not swept this way and that way by the winds of life, by the tragedies of life, is a life that has some degree of confidence in it. Confidence is the ballast. Confidence is the way in which something is rooted, so it doesn't move so easily. And in terms of attention to detail, even if you don't feel much confidence, to assume a posture that expresses confidence. Put your body in a position that if someone saw you, or if you saw someone this way, you know that person's confident. And there's nothing insincere about placing the body in this posture, even if you feel a lack of confidence. But sometimes, if you lead with the body, the mind follows. If you lead with the body, there's a marvelous reference point to understand ourselves better. And maybe one of the reference points of a confident posture is that it's easier to see the lack of confidence that maybe we don't have to believe in. Maybe we can kind of sit strong, firm, rooted here, and not be pushed around so much by the winds of the mind. So assuming a meditation posture, that maybe if you're up for it, you feel expresses some confidence. Maybe a posture that allows the chest to be open a little bit, coming forward into the world, not puffed up, certainly. Confidence is not arrogance. And maybe one where the back is a little bit straighter, more self-supporting, a little bit more upright. And then take some time to feel a solid contact with whatever is holding up your body. If you're sitting in a chair, it can begin with the feet, maybe both soles of the feet firmly on the floor, some block you have to hold up the feet. If you're sitting cross-legged, take some time to feel the triangle of the knees and the butt, and maybe even rock back and forth, and feel the stability, the contact, your weight resting against the mat, your cushion, your floor. And there's an art to relaxing parts of the body, not so that you sink, but so that your spine is gently lifted up, up, straightened. Sometimes relaxing in the waist, relaxing the small of the back, relaxing the top of the thighs. There's a way of doing that that allows that sort of lifting up out of that to be spine, to be a little straighter. If your eyes are not closed, close them now, so you can better feel the solidity of your body, the weight, the substantiality of it, the three-dimensionality of your body sitting here. And is there some place in your body that you associate with confidence, or if not confident, some place where some kind of inner strength resides, however weak, however small. And put your attention in that place, breathe with it, and if it's there to feel the confidence, the strength, appreciate it. Confidence in the physicality, where the body knows it is here, the body knows, feels its vitality, its livingness. The body has no doubts of the time and place where it resides. Here and now. And then taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. And as you exhale, relaxing the mind. As you exhale, letting go of doubt, of any thought that diminishes your own value. As you exhale, letting go into a confident body. A body that supports breathing, makes room for breathing. A body that yields to the movements of breathing, no resistance, just yielding. And as we continue meditating, perhaps some of the body's confidence can gently, lovingly support you to be present here and now, with your breathing, with your body. Confidently letting go of any thoughts that you have. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. By having a posture which is confident, that confidence can be silent, no thoughts, no ideas, to have to go with it. In fact, it's a confidence that allows the thinking mind to rest. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then as we come to the end of the sitting, in the subtle ways, and as we come to the end, in subtle ways, can you sit up a little bit with more confidence, or evoke more confident way of being here in this meditation? Even if you just imagine yourself confident, certain inner strength, certain faith in one's own capacity to be present, to be able to face the challenges of life, a kind of confident that is pleasant, that you appreciate having it. And with this confidence, gaze out upon the world, looking upon all things kindly, with kind eyes, friendly eyes, the confidence supports your ability to remain with a kind regard for all things, a kind of confidence that supports goodwill, supports kindness. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And in directing this goodwill to all beings, we are directing it also to our fellow meditators. Each of them is part of this category of all beings. So I end this meditation with the wish that each of you be well and happy. May all of you be happy. May all of you be safe. May all of you be peaceful. And may all of you be free. Thank you.
