Greetings, everyone. Lovely to be with you this week,
practicing together around the theme of compassion, continuing the theme.
And as we just did a meditation together,
I asked you if you wanted to put a word or a phrase in chat about what's coming up for you.
And the theme of our practice, of course, was compassion for the body, for our own hearts, starting with the self.
A few words, tears, beautiful and helpful, gratitude, peace, compassion to myself for restlessness, yes, great.
Ease, tranquil, appreciation, courageous vulnerability.
Just reading a few words, thank you for bringing those into the space.
I needed that compassion this morning, yes.
That fast kindness, beautiful.
So many beautiful nuggets we're bringing back in to support each other.
Some compassion for this tired body, yes, yes, yes.
Kindness to disappointment. Beautiful. Thank you all. Thank you for being in there and greatly engaging with this practice.
Just so beautiful. I am so touched by this beautiful international sangha.
Engaging and supporting each other in this way, in this way.
So I feel nourished in this moment by both our practice as I'm in there leading you from these states myself, and it is nourishing.
It's really a beautiful strength of the heart to be with challenges instead of rushing through them, and it takes time, it takes patience.
So compassion, so much we can say about this and so much we can explore.
So what I'd like to turn into today is compassion for self, self-compassion.
Self-compassion as the basis for compassion to others, compassion to the world, etc., etc.
And maybe I'd like to take a step back first and offer a definition, maybe a couple of definitions of compassion just so that we're on the same page.
We have a sense of what compassion is, and many of you have been practicing for a long time.
And yet it helps to reconnect with, okay, what are we talking about? So it's not a fuzzy compassion, which is banty about this word.
So in the Theravada tradition, kindness or metta is the primary, is the first practice of the heart, kindness, loving kindness, goodwill.
And basically what kindness or goodwill is, is just the kindness of the heart, say, when you are walking around and you smile to a neighbor, or just the very simple sense of goodwill.
Just simple kindness, it's not complicated, we all have it.
Readily access it many, many times a day when you see someone you care about, oh, there's just a sense of simple care, goodwill.
Now this metta, M-E-T-T-A, or translated as kindness, loving kindness, love, goodwill, so many nuances.
It's basically kindness of the heart that meets a being who is in a neutral state, neither suffering nor happy, just kind of like kindness of the heart.
Now if you take the same kindness, same metta, and it meets suffering, it meets the suffering, either your own suffering or suffering of someone else, some other being, that metta, when it meets suffering, it holds suffering, becomes compassion.
So compassion is love, metta plus suffering.
In other words, it's also been said that compassion is the love child of love and suffering.
So there needs to be a challenge, so some kind of pain, suffering, difficulty, and it's met, and it is met with kindness.
So that is one way to consider compassion in Pali Karuna.
And of course, just to give you, if you have not heard this before, if the same kindness metta meets joy in the world, someone who's very happy or your own joy,
then it gets expressed as muddhita, vicarious joy, joy for the joy of others, or also if it's for ourselves, it gets expressed as gratitude,
which is the third brahma vihara, the third practice of the heart, metta being the first one, metta, karuna being the second, brahma vihara, muddhita being the third and the fourth one being equanimity, upekka.
And brahma vihara is being the practices of the heart, the heavenly abode's practices.
And many of you in the practice society, and if you've been coming to the happy hour in the evening, you've practiced with various dimensions of these practices.
So compassion is needing, needing suffering, needing suffering with kindness.
Now, there are aspects that are required for compassion.
We need to have an awareness of suffering.
We need to know that this is hard, this is painful, and really that first cognitive knowing that suffering is happening is the most important aspect,
because often we don't grok that, oh, this is suffering, this is pain, this is disappointment, this hurts.
That first ouch, that ouch, is the most important, is really the most important step first.
How many times have you been yourself suffering, having a challenge, and just bulldozing through it?
I know for me, many of you know that I've had a chronic illness for many years, and at the beginning when I was just trying to get my head around it,
I would be tired and aching, and I wouldn't grok it.
I wouldn't grok that actually I'm not feeling well.
I'd be like, okay, come on, let's get going.
You've got work to do.
You've got emails like, come on, let's going.
There would be judgment.
It took a while.
It realized, oh, sweetheart, wow, you are tired, you are in pain.
This is hard ouch, this is hard.
So that first recognition allowed a wise response, which was kindness, patience, the appropriate response to come in,
without that acknowledgement.
And also towards others too, like, oh, they're just being fussy, or they're just being this, or we label it with very sometimes unkind.
We miss that, oh, this person is struggling.
This person is having a hard time.
So that cognitive, taking a pause to have that cognitive awareness is very important.
And often if we are rushing through life, if we feel stressed ourselves, if we are internally stressed, externally stressed,
and not taking a moment to pause and realize, and that pause as you've been practicing,
you realize that that pause becomes more and more available the longer we practice.
And yet it is important to have this in the background of our minds to take a pause.
Oh, what is happening? How am I perceiving this situation?
Is it really what it is, or am I perceiving it through my eyes of rushing about?
And compassion for self, kindness for self really is the basis for kindness and compassion for others.
It's really the starting point, is the starting point.
We can't fill other people's cups if we haven't filled our own cup first.
We have to fill our own cup.
And self-compassion is not selfish, it's not self-regurantizing, it's not enabling.
And in fact, there are research studies that suggest that when we are self-compassionate,
we take more responsibility for our actions, not less.
We don't become enabling like, oh, whatever, but actually we take more responsibility.
And maybe I'll just take one minute to share one of these studies with you and many studies,
but one of them is the work of Mark Leary and colleagues.
And they found that when participants were instructed to be self-compassionate
when thinking about a past mistake, humiliation or failure,
they were more likely to accept personal responsibility for what happened instead of blaming outside things outside or events outside.
And that makes sense, right?
When we have a sense of kindness for ourselves, we can accept our own failings.
Like, oh, sweetheart, yes, that was unskillful, yeah, you screwed up, it's okay, I still love you, it's okay, we'll do better next time.
You see, it's more available, whereas if we don't have that, if we have self-judgment,
then we don't have the capacity to acknowledge that we screwed up.
It's like, oh, no, it wasn't me, no, no, it was their fault, we point finger everywhere because there's no capacity.
Because if we acknowledge that we screwed up, oh, ouch, there are going to be so many daggers.
So self-compassion allows us to actually take more responsibility for our actions in the world,
and it's the basis for compassion towards others.
So in this brief time, we talked about one definition of compassion.
There is more.
We talked about the importance of knowing, of that ouch, of acknowledging, of awareness, of suffering,
whether it's physical, emotional, internal, external, and self-compassion really being the basis for compassion for others.
There is a lot more to explore, and I'm delighted that we have the rest of this week to practice together.
So thank you so much, dear ones. May you be compassionate to yourself the rest of the day.
May you take time, pause if there is an ouch, physical, emotional disappointments to just acknowledge,
maybe just with a hand on your heart, or just saying ouch to practice with this for the rest of the day.
Thank you so much, be well, and looking forward to being with you tomorrow.
