 Am I speaking loud enough? And driving down your thinking about this today, I was thinking about how there was so much we should have covered or could have covered and talked about in particular, the whole kind of more involved discussion of the precepts. But you've all considered the precepts for yourselves before. And tonight, we're going to talk a little more about refuge in Sangha. And it's often said that in the West we often overlook the refuge, the jewel of the Sangha. And we give particularly preference to the Buddha and the Dharma. And community is something we don't, maybe some of us are ambivalent about, or we don't really see the direct connection between being in a spiritual community and our own personal practice. And there's often a sense, I think among many Western Dharma students, that practice and their engagement of the Buddha's way is something very personal or very individualistic. And we bring kind of individualistic slant to the practice. And so those tendencies kind of ignore the refuge of the Sangha itself and discount it in preference to the other two. And I feel myself fairly strong that the three are considered to be equal, equal in value. And not only equal in value, but they exist together. They enforce each other, they support each other, they interact with each other. And you can't really have one without the other. You can't really have the refuge of the Buddha without the Sangha and the refuge of Sangha without the Buddha or the Dharma. And we talked a little bit about going, what the word Sarana means, the refuge, going for refuge. But I looked it up in the Pali English Dictionary today to see what they say, about the definition of the word Sarana. And it means, one of the definitions is refuge, but it also means protection literally. But it also can mean an abode or a house, a place where you live. So it has those multiple meanings, refuge, a place you can go for protection, and also a place that we live or a home. And I like that very much because the idea of protection is, it seems a little bit, you know, I think we need protections. We need protections from ourselves and from the world we live in, in a sense. But we don't want that to be kind of a protection that cuts us off from the world, like your fortress walls. But it is some place where you're at home, and I like that a lot. The place we find our home. And so the Sangha is a place where we find our home. And I know in my own practice in life that the Sangha has been a very important protection, a very important refuge, and a very important support in my own practice in life. As I've said, I don't think I could have practiced the many years I practiced without the support of the Sanghas that I practiced with, the communities I practiced with, the teachers I practiced with. And during much of that time, I took it for granted. I just, there was, you know, there are other centers and they were fully developed, and there are monasteries you can go to, and they were already there, and teachers were already there, kind of, talking away, you know. And I just showed up, and they just kept talking away. So I just kind of took it off for granted. But I realized after some years that it wouldn't have been possible for me without the tremendous support that I received from the Sangha and the community. But it was more than just support for the practice, it was more than just a protected place for me to kind of engage in the practice and try to live from the point of view of practice. That the Sangha for me was also a mirror, a very important mirror. And I went specifically to kind of live at the San Francisco Zen Center, my first kind of Buddhist community I lived with, because the value I saw in having people having to mirror me. And I was, you know, kind of standard neurotic kid, you know, and full of all kinds of trips. And what I saw, what I found in the community, there was people who weren't going to buy into the games that I was used to playing, kind of unconsciously playing even. And as I was trying to find some way to live free of those games and live from kind of deeper authenticity, when I noticed when I went to the Zen Center, I tried to act out my trips, that there was no response. And in no response, you know, that kind of is a little bit jolting. So I saw that as a mirror, I kind of see myself, that kind of, what's going on, what am I doing here? And it was very valuable for me in the early years of Zen Center to have that, have the mirroring of people who weren't going to buy into what I was doing. And many of the teachers that I've had also, I felt, you know, had that quality for me, they weren't going to buy into what I was bringing. And sometimes they seem somewhat, you know, aloof in it, in their, in that role. And sometimes they were aloof in it, but, but even if they're aloof, aloofness often, you know, if you use it right, a good student, you know, always use a bad teaching, you know, in the right way. Yeah, this is very, you have to take this carefully, but there's a, there's a good student, will always find a useful way to take a bad teaching. We'll kind of get the best out of it, ring it towards best. And so, so, you know, I feel myself, you know, tremendously and deeply connected and very gratefully connected to this, this inter inter these communities and these interactive relationships I've had with communities and teachers and their teachers and the communities they practiced in. And it goes back, you know, I can kind of see it that goes back in time, that the teachers I studied with, they practice with their teachers and their teachers back and their communities, and it goes back and back and back. And in the Zen tradition, it's very clear, at least because they give you this lineage papers that trace the historical lineage of teachers going all the way back to Shakyamuni Buddha. I shouldn't say historical because it's pretty clear that some of it's mythological that they made it up, filled in the blanks kind of. But, but it goes back at least until the seventh century that it's pretty historic, very historical. And that's, that's a long time. And then you can just go back and see teacher to teacher. I can, you know, I have this lineage paper and I have my Zen teacher and you can find in this paper, it has his name and then his teacher's name and that person's name and that person's name, that person's name, that person's name going back and back and back at least until the seventh century. And that's phenomenal, I think. And the fact that, you know, in the Zen lineage, it's 90, about 90 teachers between me and the Buddha, about 90 generations. And we were more than 90 people sometimes in this room on Monday nights. And so it takes that many people, you know, to have a living, you know, back in time connection to the Buddha. You gather those people in this room here. And I'm kind of, I'm inspired by that. And I take it to a mythological, myths often point to something that are true. And I see that I'm pretty convinced that the teachings that we have received have overwhelmingly been transmitted by word of mouth, by contact with individual teacher to teacher. And people didn't read in the old days as much as we read. You know, they didn't go down to the corner store and buy a book on Buddhism and then sit down and practice. But there might have been a little bit of that, but very, very little compared to the direct contact of the living tradition, face-to-face meeting that happened. And we continue that to this day. And I think, to me, it's kind of inconceivable someone would really, not inconceivable, but I think extremely difficult for someone to have any serious encounter with the possibilities of practice and waking up, without meeting other people who are doing it, sharing in that attempt in their own life. So I see this historical lineage goes back, generation after generation. And it's just a living flame kind of that goes back to the historical Buddha. And I find that tremendously inspiring to be kind of part of that lineage. And it isn't just simply the fact that it's historically face-to-face transmission, but it's also many, many, many, many generations of people who have refined and honed and worked with and made mistakes and with trying to teach in their practice. And there's a kind of refinement, kind of development that's happened, I feel, over the 2500 years that we inherited. And we inherited many, many peoples. And I kind of like to think of it as a 2500 year refinement, but maybe that's a little bit mythological to see it that way. But at least you can see it even just in the last few centuries, those of you who can study the history and how the teachings have gotten to come to us here. There's a refinement of many people practicing and working. And we're part of this refinement. We're kind of playing it out and working it out in their own lives and in our own culture and making mistakes as we go and finding other ways that work. And we're contributing to the kind of collective wisdom of the tradition. So for me, taking refuge in the Sangha is also somehow taking refuge in the collective wisdom that's been carried for so long. And also the collective compassion and the collective intention, the collective metta, the collective generosity, that whatever the teachings, the opportunities to practice, they have survived down through the ages in Asia and here in this country only because people have felt moved to generously support it. And so it's been acts of generosity for all these years. And so where the receiving end of 2500 years of generous activity, of compassionate activity, people engaged in teaching out of compassion or practicing themselves out of compassion and loving kindness, saturated with loving kindness. So me personally, I'm deeply inspired by that and deeply moved and very grateful for that connection that I feel. Even though some of it I feel for myself is in part a mythological connection. It's what must have been. We don't know actually, year to year, generation to generation, actually what happened. So it's kind of conjecture. But I kind of believe it and I'm willing to cop up and maybe some of it's mythological. But that's okay with me. I don't mind. It's still, it's my faith. And I should be granted my faith. And I don't know how it is for any of you. So taking refuge in the Sangha is to recognize I think the great importance of having a community to practice with. And Sangha as many of you know, I think means different things in the means different things in Buddhism. There's a strict definition. The strict definition is, the strictest definition of Sangha is those human beings who have been witnesses to the truth, who have been witnesses to realization, to the real possibility of freedom. And not people who have practiced who haven't really somehow in their own life born witness to that aren't considered part of the strict Sangha, the narrow Sangha. A little wider definition of Sangha is than is the monastic Sangha. Monks and nuns are necessarily people who have witnessed the truth, but they're often considered to be the custodians of a way of life that most clearly perhaps points to that experience of realization or points to a way of living from that realization. Though it's not the only way of living, but it's kind of a clear, as clean as container for that. So a wider definition, which is still somewhat strict, is just the monastic community. A wider definition of what Sangha is is anybody who's practicing the Buddhist practice or anybody practicing in your particular tradition, kind of concentric circles going out. So anybody in your particular tradition, so if we have the Palo Alto Sangha, is our Sangha here, but then wider than that there's the Insight Meditation Sangha, the Vipassana Sangha in America, which is a much wider circle. And beyond that there's American Buddhist practitioners, you know, of all different Buddhist schools. And then beyond that is all the Buddhist Sangha all over the whole world, you know, that we're connected to. And then the definition goes beyond Buddhism, and it's anybody who's practicing freedom or the truth or the Dharma in whatever way they want to talk about it. And then it was very nice Ajahnamaro, who's just an Englishman who's a Theravadan monk, he's going to build a monastery up there near Yukaya now. And it's finalized, they got their property up there and they're on Saturday, they're moving in. And they just have a little bungalow up there right now, they're slowly going to build a monastery for all of us, we can all go visit. And it was very nice. So one of the neighbors, they thought it was very auspicious because one of the neighbors on one side, they went to visit the person and they had a Buddha image in living room. And it turns out that he's friends with the Thai monk in the Thai temple in Fremont. The neighbors on the other side are some kind of unusual Ukrainian, orthodox, Catholic monastery of forest monks, living out there kind of hermits. And so they went to pay their respects there to the abbot. And what he said was they brought an icon as a gift. And I took the icon to mean a Christian icon, because you don't use the word icon unless usually, especially for orthodox person, Eastern Orthodox. And it was really marvelous, this Buddhist monk who brought the Christian icon to the Christian monk as a gift. So who knows? So the wider Sangha, these are all people who practice freedom, non-clinging, awakening, truth, whatever. And then the widest definition of the Sangha, the least strict, is all living beings. And it has to do with our kinship, with everything, all of life. And so the whole world is our Sangha. Actually, then even in some schools of Buddhism, they even go beyond that, not just living beings, but even inanimate beings are part of the Sangha. And so all existence, all creation is a Sangha that we're connected to. So to take refuge in the Sangha, it depends on how you see it. And in my own life, in different contexts, different definitions are what's appropriate for me. I have tremendous reverence for the monastic community and quite content to call them the Sangha. And when I'm with the monks, kind of to bow to them and pay my respects. And I have tremendous reverence for, like the Palaihauta Sangha, what we have here. I think it's really remarkable what's happened here over the years. And I'm kind of amazed at the friendships and the connections that have happened here in the Sangha and the sense of how the Sangha has been so supportive for so many years, for so many people to come here and find something of value, and find perhaps a kind of a home. And I bow with respect to this Sangha also, I think it's really phenomenal what you all have brought here in your intention and practice and commitment. So to take refuge in the Sangha, to find value for oneself in the Sangha, to find a source of protection against the forces in life which pull us away from it, from practice, to find support. The Sangha I feel is a place for us to be ourselves, hopefully. The Buddhist tradition, the Theravānant tradition talks over and over again about things as they are, it's like refrain, things as they are. And after a while you get, that's what they mean. Things as they are, not how things should be, or how you wish they should be, or anything, but just how they are. That becomes a refuge, that becomes something very important. And that means us as we are, not us as we should be, you know, ideal and the same, you know, without just as we are, you know, and Sangha is a place where we really see and really observe and have deep respect for things as they are and us as they we are. And I would hope that Sangha is a place where it's safe to be who we are. It doesn't mean that people don't like that, it doesn't mean that people like that, but it's a place where it feels safe to have people even disagree, where it's okay, we feel like you can actually be who you are and you feel that people are not going to turn away from you. And that's one, for me, one of the key things of a Sangha is people are not going to turn away from each other, because they are, you know, acting a little bit funny or as way as you don't like, but there's a willingness to stay open for these people here, at least in this context. So it feels safe to come in here and be maybe a little bit funny or odd, which we all are funny and odd, I mean, I certainly am. And I assume that some of you are, at least, you know, at least some of you are at least as much as me. And then it's okay to do that. And it's okay to disagree and to, you know, even to argue sometimes, because we're not going to turn away from each other. That's something that I hold is very important, this idea of a Sangha. I don't think a Sangha has to be harmonious in a narrow sense of harmony, you know, but rather it's harmonious in the sense that we're willing to stay together and hang out and work it out and be honest with each other. And I took a lot of advantage of that in my times that I spent living in, like at the San Francisco Zen Center and in Asia and Sanghas there, where I even experimented, you know, as I was trying to find ways to express myself in new ways that came out of my practice and what I was feeling there. I didn't have, you know, necessarily models. I didn't actually know how I should do that and what form that would take. So I would experiment in different ways of being. There were times where I experimented with being silent a lot and not speaking much. And I just felt like it was a tremendously safe place to do that and not speak a lot and be silent. And I didn't have to be someone for someone and I could just kind of be there quietly and people left me alone. But I didn't feel like people were going to reject me because I was silent. They were there, and other times I experimented being much more talkative, experimenting with talking as much as I could. And everybody was willing to talk to me, I would talk to them, you know, just whatever. And there were other times I tried talking in particular ways with people or tried to interact in particular ways with people, seeing if I could find some way that was my own way, but taking some risks at that and feeling that the Sangha was a safe place to take risks, to experiment. So then, so Saturday we'll have the ceremony and later tonight I'll describe where and what and things like that. But I want to kind of underline what I said the first class is that the reason that I wanted to do this is that I felt that there were a lot of people in the Sangha here who have made a serious commitment in their life towards practicing. And I think people who come regularly on Mondays for a number of years, for example, there's a lot of people who have been here for many, many years, I'm really in awe and deeply respect that kind of commitment. It's not easy to have that, to come every Monday regularly over and over and over again through all the different pools people have in their lives and all the different things and working and being tired. And when it kind of dawned on me what was going on like that, a couple of years ago, I was kind of blown over with the... And I felt it would be nice to offer some way to acknowledge that fully and that level of commitment and engagement is serious, that people have towards their practice, that that could be acknowledged in a kind of formal way to kind of maybe solidify it, give it strength to encourage it, things like that. And so I wanted to offer the ceremonies, a way of doing that. But in offering it, it's not that what I want it to be, is that each of you reflect what it means to take refuge and what it means to take the precepts. And that it's really this ceremony is for each of you a place where you channel or you bring together your particular intention that you bring. And it isn't that I have some fixed idea of what's going for refugees and what taking the precepts are and what this is all about, but rather this is a chance for you. I mean, so we're all going to do the same kind of ritual, same form and say the same thing. But what the intention, the meaning that we invest into that form and into those words and that is really, what I'm trying to do is to honor what's already here in all of you, not kind of add anything to your life. Does that make sense? So really, so it's yours, even though it'll be kind of a standard thing and you all do the same thing, you'll find your way, right? And traditionally, also this, I mean, kind of the tradition where this kind of ceremony would kind of mark a person becoming a Buddhist. And I'm not particularly interested in creating Buddhists and that any of you feel like you're becoming Buddhist by doing this. If you want to do that, that's fine. That's nice. But if you don't want to do that, if you don't want to have that identity of the label, you don't have to do the ceremony with that intent. I think that if you sincerely feel there's a way in which going for refuge and taking the precepts means something for you and kind of represents your practice and your intention that you have here. And it's not necessarily for you, you know, a clearly Buddhist orientation. That's okay with me. So it's for you to decide how you, kind of for you to decide how would you make of this. For me and my part also, then it's also what I make it kind of, I also make something of it. I contribute to all this to some degree or other. So part of it is I'm trying to make a space where it's kind of acknowledging what's already here. But what I bring is what I feel is a very deep faith in something, you know, in faith. And maybe that's all I have to say. But I, for me, I feel quite comfortable after many years of not being comfortable with calling myself a Buddhist, with supporting Buddhism, helping Buddhism flourish. And so I've come, I'm going to go to the ceremony as a Buddhist very clearly, offering a Buddhist ceremony to people who then can use it in whatever way they want. But I'm not going to pretend that I'm not there as a Buddhist. That that's really, you know, what I'm bringing. And how you negotiate that is up to you. But that's what I bring in, but offering it in a way that hopefully is comfortable even beyond, for people even beyond a kind of Buddhist identity. So hopefully, you know, I bring reverence and respect and gratitude and many things towards a tradition that I feel like I'm representing and that I'm somehow also a carrier of since it's my role to sit in this seat and to teach and represent it. So maybe that's enough for me about that. Do you guys want to say something about Sangha? Or ask any questions? Or just say something? Or some of you. Q. What was that first definition that you said of Sangha? A. Oh, it's those people who have realized in a tangible way the possibility of freedom in kind of the traditional Buddhist meaning of it, you know, more or less. Q. So those people who are enlightened? A. The word enlightened doesn't really, it's not a Buddhist word except in English, in what's called hybrid Sanskrit, it's a hybrid Buddhist English. But those who have attained liberation or freedom or have had taste of nibbana. And so that's the narrowest meaning. Q. Most of us have tastes of nibbana. A. That would be great. So we have a big Sangha then. Could well be. Yes. Q. I have some sense of Sangha as the daily working out of something else than my life doing. A medicine man said a wonderful thing once. He said if your spirituality doesn't grow corn, I'm not interested. In other words, if your spiritual life does not bring forth life-life for you, in your connections with others and how you work out the results of your studies, it lessens its value. So this is a chance to increase the value, I think, of solitary meditation. And quicker people also, regardless, the friends, regarded it this way also, it's called corporate meditation. And it's seeing the Sangha as an enlarged or the group, the meeting as an enlarged body. A. And for me, my own sense, very strong sense, is that if there's a commitment to practice, to live free of greed, hate and delusion to be open, that openness connects us to others. And that connection to others connects our practice to others. And at some point, it doesn't make sense to even talk about practicing just for yourself. But the practice is corporate whatever, community, join the world. And so the Sangha and the Buddha and Dharma are coexist, are equals. To me, it's kind of obvious, you don't have a Buddha without a Sangha. You don't have a Sangha without a Buddha. And what that means for different people will vary, but there is an element where the fulfillment, one of the fulfillments of Buddhist practice is in community life. It's not in isolation. But what that community life means, it means different things for different people. And there are people for whom, who are by disposition, naturally more solitary, love solitude. And their form of fulfillment in community takes a much more solitary form than others. And there are other people whose disposition is much more social. And so it takes a much more social, engaged form. Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing being a teacher, because I actually don't like to speak that much. I always like to be quiet. All I do is talk. And I talk more and more the longer I teach. Occupational hazard. I just want to go over what it means to take refuge in the Buddha. Take refuge in you. Why do we say the Buddha? Well, the Buddha represents different things. And again, like Sangha has many definitions. So the Buddha can have different definitions also. And there's historical Buddha. And I have deep reverence for the historical Buddha. And I have a kind of a relationship. It means something for me. It's a living relationship for me, because it represents something symbolically. It's symbolic. So the historical Buddha represents something. But also the refuge in Buddha also represents for me the potential for freedom, for awakening. That's in each of us. And so it's not just embodied this one person, but it's found in all of us, in each of us. Or it's that capacity. So take refuge in the Buddha. It's take refuge in Bodhi. Bodhi is enlightenment, is awakening. And to the degree in which any of us have, takes the ability even if it's casual, and get a sense of that possibility or hint of it, it becomes a refuge, a place of protection, a place of inspiration, a place of motivation, because we understand what practice is about, what the possibilities of freedom are. So you can take refuge in that. You can find support, protection in that idea, in that sense, in that experience, that memory, in that... I wouldn't have chosen that word. But, you know, it's okay. Yes? I just read Ditnaat's book, Living Buddha and the Pink Crest, and first of all, it was really beautiful and wonderful. And I think it speaks to just what we're talking about. There's a particular chapter on taking refuge that's really good, and then this chapter on precepts said in a very positive and very open way so that they read and take on meaning. And the Sangha, really, is the larger Sangha. It's not just here the Buddhists and Christians, but... And just the time of living. Yeah, that's a good living Buddha. Where's living Buddha? And so, I mean, so this is the range of meanings, and there's a place, a context for each of them. And so the one thing I would change, what you said, was maybe just slightly myself, would be used the word really, because that implies the only. I could almost imply that, that really the Sangha is this wider connection. And I think the Sangha is the wider connection, but we don't want to limit to that definition only, because there's other definitions which, for me, are very inspiring. In certain contexts, I'm happy to let the Sangha be the monastic community. But I don't want to limit to that either. So, yeah, so anything's going on. For me, it's also very important that we have the sense that's the wider community. And I think Thich Nhat Hanh offers a lot in his very ecumenical open way. But sometimes if you're too open and ecumenical, you'll lose something as very definitive. And I think there's a place for the definitive anchoring also. So it's to be flexible and know that different contexts were different ways of definition of relationships, of involvements. That make sense? No? I'm just sure what I said. No, no. I didn't, it wasn't a criticism. I just said, I wouldn't have used the word really, because in my ears, the word really shades into only. And I wasn't implying that you said that, but that's just, I was just kind of doing, forgive me, a teaching, it wasn't really directed towards you. I just took the opportunity and jumping forward. I'm not entirely sure what you're saying. Can I try again? Briefly? So what I heard you say was that Thich Nhat Hanh was saying that the Sangha is really the connection to this wider living world of beings. And so I heard the word really, which is a fine word. But the fine thing to have said, so you don't have to defend yourself. But I just used it as a jumping board. And I should have maybe not have responded to you that way. But I just wanted to make this point that there are different definitions for what Sangha is, and that if we're too open with a definition, sometimes we can lose sight of particular definitions and their value. So if we only define the Sangha as being all beings, for example, it's easy then to overlook the value and inspiration and support that can come from, for example, the monastic Sangha. With the monastic Sangha, I find very inspiring and supportive of what they are. And that's a kind of narrower sense of community that the Buddhist tradition offers. And sometimes what happens when you make a really broad definition that makes everything the same, you lose track of the particular value of particulars, uniqueness of different things. And what I've seen, I'm not saying I saw it in you at all, but what I've seen in some people who want to do away with distinctions, that the values of particulars get lost. And sometimes people will discount the value of monastic life and say, well, that's silly, and there are all these people afraid of life, they're losers, and it seems like a misogynist tradition, and how could it be representing the like-men and all this stuff. And there are certainly odd things about the monastic community, but there's something about it that I've experienced which is also very wonderful. And so I guess I'm a little bit sensitive to the need to be very open and connected. And I'm sensitive that that sometimes we can lose track of the particulars in that context of doing that. Not limited to being only open. So that's something that's making a little more sense. It's almost as an individual person who is really quite truly themselves may have the widest ability to be sympathetic to other people. If the Sangha in this space are a community Sangha, and it is Buddhist in an inward way that defines itself. And truly itself as the Buddhist Sangha then, and the truly is important I think. But then I think the tolerance or sense of inclusiveness of the rest of the world will come of itself. But if the foundation is shaky it will be hard to include others. Wow. So, oh yes. One way I think about Sangha is in terms of spiritual friendship. And it's a way that I like to relate to people that I'm with that we're here to help each other on this adventure. Oh, beautiful. Paddy. Yeah, there's something that I'm thinking about that keeps coming up. I'm also very appreciative of this Sangha and with you as a teacher and part of this Sangha and your lineage and history. It's something that came to my well heart mind both as you were talking and talking about the 90 generations back and connections and feeling of richness of that and how did that, and just sort of trying to identify with that. And part of it I sort of noticed this thing about, and those were men, the generation of men. But when we're practicing with those, that language is a man passing through that. So it's just coming up. It came up for me while I was saying it. I don't know if you noticed, but I shifted from talking about his teacher beforehand. I switched to the teacher before the teacher because I started getting weird in my mouth. Sorry, I just bring up because through the discussion it just would keep coming from the feeling of having a ceremony and probably have a representation of the historical Buddha. And I don't know, it's just a feeling of wishing to be able to join that feeling of connection through the language and identify with that. The ceremony will be evoking women in tradition also, some of the women I've studied with and some of the women who I haven't studied with but I feel connected to. So the women in history won't be absent. I'm very sensitive to this. But also historically, history is sad, right? We don't want to deny the sad part of it. And voices of women have been silenced periodically in history of Buddhism. And women have often gotten second-class status, even the nuns. And it's not necessarily pretty history. So I don't want to deny that either. But they also don't want to deny and continue the silencing of women's voices. And there were some wonderful voices, wonderful teachers and practitioners in history that if you go digging you can find them. And they can be reclaimed and kind of be understood as part of our lineage. And I'm certain that the Zen lineage that I have, for me it's all men. But I feel, maybe it's mythology again, but I feel pretty confident that in the living tradition that I'm connected to besides the document, especially in the Theravada tradition where you don't have lineage papers, it's much more of a fluid environment. I'm convinced that periodically through those centuries, very strong women have been part of that lineage and supported what's happened now. Not just simply as support by maintenance support in the background of the monastery and cooking, but it really has practitioners and teachers. And it might have been minority history, but I think they're there. And just in the last hundred years, there was a great revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka about 120 years ago. And it lasted for about 20, 30 years. And after Buddhism was very much in decline, Buddhism suffered. It waxed and waned in Sri Lanka over the centuries. And it suffered terribly also under the English and the colonial rule. And so by the 1800s, it was pretty weak Buddhism in Sri Lanka. And then partly in response to the colonial powers, there was an upsurge of interest in Buddhism. There was a revival of Buddhism in the 1870s, 80s, 90s, during the century. And much of that was propelled by women. And the status of women teachers and nuns became much more elevated. There had been for centuries and centuries. Not nuns formerly because they lost the order, but women teachers and women who took religious vows. And we think the modern era is being kind of women asolishly making more inroads, being more equal, or having more voice in Buddhist traditions. But actually in Sri Lanka, they had a much stronger voice 100 years ago than they have now. So historically, things have waxed and waned. And so in Sri Lankan tradition, it's been part of the modern revival of Southeast Asian Buddhism that I feel connected to. And so I feel connected to those women who were part of that. So I'm conscious of it. And I try to make myself more conscious of it because of the great lopsided way that the people who wrote the histories wrote the histories. Yes. Thinking about the Sangha and what it means, when I was working with the monks, they said the Sangha was monks. And since that's mostly who were there, that seemed appropriate. I like your more fluid definition. But I think that this Sangha is, you know, the feminine element of the Sangha is a very strong element. And I think there's an openness and a sharing that goes on there that I don't think would happen in a more masculine oriented Sangha. And I, for one, appreciate it very much. And I think that this is one of the joys of the Sangha is we can come here and we can feel open to the extent that we want to. And we can hear. There was a beautiful silence as we're all sitting here. That felt like a Sangha to me. So does anybody have any... This is like in the last class, you know, we were going to discuss all this before we meet on Saturday. Does anybody have anything they want to ask or bring up or feels unresolved for them in terms of participating in the ceremony and looking at the precepts and the refuges for themselves? Would have been good if we could spend more weeks, maybe five weeks just on each precept. And maybe in the fall we'll do that. But... For me, something that's new is the chanting. I've done other places, but, you know, I haven't been chanting because I don't know the words and I keep forgetting to bring the paper. And I wondered maybe you could go over with that. How many of you don't know the chants? There are quite a few. Do you want to get a little chanting lesson tonight? Yeah. That would be interesting. Yeah? How many of you have to leave at seven? Okay. So I don't know whether it would make sense. But maybe it can be part of the ceremony, the chanting lesson. Let's see. Is there anything else that people want to... Anything else that seems to be unresolved? Yes, Bill? Well, in all of the reading and study that I've done, which I suppose is comparable to what people do, but since I've become, which I guess is a little more than three years ago, I've heard little or nothing that didn't make any sense to me at all seems to be... seems to be coming from a place that I understand next time. The only one thing that gives me a little misgivings is when I read about the... There are all these accounts in the Buddha's life where the one that comes to mind is he goes to a particular town. I don't remember the name of the town. And there are in this town three groups of ascetic monks, matted here ascetic monks. And he goes from one to the other and performs some miracle or the other to get their attention. And somehow that just doesn't happen. And because it's a sort of thing you would expect from the lightning flash, fingered, you know, God kind of situation. And what I see here and what I feel here and what is most important to me here in the greater Sangha is the sense that that's not what it's about. It's a quiet thing. It's a recognition of the reality and quietness and strength of the moment. And there's no miracle in it. All of those instances just kind of bother me. Every time I read about one another. That's weird. That's not what it's about. In the Zen tradition, they make a point that carrying water and chopping firewood are the great miracle powers, miracle things to do. That's just eating and shitting and working and walking and all those things. Those are miracles. And I say that because what we want to be very careful for is not to make a separation between a kind of silence and intimacy, which is possible, and action. And if you don't make a separation between them and includes action, then it might include in its own inappropriate ways maybe almost all kinds of action. And there's a place for maybe many different ways of acting. If psychic powers like the Buddha had, if he really had them, if it's not just the myth that was made up, maybe that's just another form of action. Maybe there are contexts where it is appropriate, it is called for. So I'm not defending it. But I guess the point for me that's very interesting is if you don't make a gap between silence and action, then where do you limit the action? As the world of appropriate action, how do you define that? That makes sense? I'm sure it's not satisfying in answer, but as long as it makes sense. Jean. I wasn't here in a second. We're still hoping to get the handout. But the other thing is, I guess that's when you introduced the green hatred and delusion. And to me, it's a big one of fear. I even said it, but I'm trying to save a list. And I don't understand why fear is not on that list. And that other model where there's only two emotions, what is fear? I guess the simple answer is that great hate and delusion are just kind of generic words that cover a lot, umbrella words that cover a lot of things. But other ways see that they're kind of the primary colors. And from that, we construct other kinds of mixtures of colors, and that fear is a variety of a particular kind of variety of aversion. And hate is kind of like aversion, greed aversion. So fear is a kind of an aversion. That's usually where it fits under the category of things. But maybe it's mixed with other ones, a kind of combination of many different things. But this is not careful scientific psychology, but rather just general categories. Just general categories are supposed to represent the unhealthy suffering causing tendencies we have. And if you want to start pigeon-holding, then they say, well, fear fits under the category of aversion. The great theologians. The great writers who wrote tomes and Buddhist psychology. So we don't have to listen to them. Because we're getting close to the time, what I need to do is I need to get everybody's name who's going to come to this ceremony. Written out, maybe printed so I can see it, so I can read all the letters clearly. And maybe I'll pass out two sheets so that... Which name is the one? Which name? I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure which name. When I was an actor, I'd write all of myself by my name. Whatever you want. I hate that I'm normally how you resolve. It doesn't matter so much. Whatever way that you feel the most intimate with yourself, whatever name seems most intimate. Four numbers I don't want. So if you can write. Can you say again when we're going to meet? Okay, so this is okay. So now we have the details. We're going to start at 6.30 on Saturday. And we're going to meet in Bonnie's home. So if you meet Xeroxes, everyone. So Bonnie has instructions how to get there. We're going to meet at 6.30. We're going to start with a pop look. Kind of dinner. And we'll do that for an hour or so. And then probably around 4 to 8, we'll then gather for a sitting. And we'll sit for a while. And then we'll probably take a little break. And then I'll give a little Dharma talk. And then at some point we'll start the actual ceremony itself with some chanting and whatever we do. And hopefully if we do it right, hopefully it starts getting dark on us. But it's getting light so late now. But I think it'll still be dark. It'll get dark on us. And then I don't know if the moon will cooperate fully. But we know that the moon is full. And then at some point we'll finish. I'm not sure how long it's going to take. And then at some point anybody who wants to can go to the all-night drumming at Stanford. But it's all night so you don't have to... There's an opening of a sculpture garden, a New Guinea sculpture garden. Anyway. So you'll get the Xerox. It's coming. They would... Now since it's a pot look, the suggestion is that we coordinate a little bit the meals. And how do we do that Bonnie? We put on 40 people. I don't know how many we are. So we just divided it up. Yeah, so maybe, I don't know, maybe, I don't know. I see there's about 35 people here. So maybe that's more like it. Yeah, there will be some people coming. Anybody who's not going to come, I need to know their name before they come. So they're not going to know... Anybody who's not here is not going to know where to go unless they talk to one of us. And if they talk to any of us, you have to tell them that they have to let me know what their name before the ceremony, before the day. You're right, okay? I put one person's name down on my way. I guess that's okay. Oh. So, also what we need to bring is, the sitting will happen on a soft, nice green lawn. But you might want to bring something to sit on, either a mat or a blanket or something softer. As part of the ceremony then, or part of it, you all should bring some gifts, some offerings. And what I'd like you to bring is, each person should bring one flower. And that would be an offering to the Buddha. And I think Bonnie has vases, so we'll kind of fit them all into the vases there. If you want to bring more, it's okay, but one flower is what I want you to offer, and one candle. And it should be a taper that's not too long. So, you know, maybe, I don't know, that's six, seven, eight inches long, maybe, or something? A taper. You know what a taper is, right? And you should bring a holder for it. But a holder shouldn't be too tall. You don't want to... It's okay, whatever you bring, but ideally it's relatively short one that keeps it low to the ground. And the taper is not you can take home with you. It's just you bring for the... You're not giving that. But what you do is you're bringing a flower and a candle as a gift to the Buddha. And then you're bringing a second candle, which would be a gift to me. So it's an offering to the Buddha and an offering to me as part of the ceremony. So bring two tapers and a flower. It doesn't matter what color? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. And then you should also bring something to sit on. And I don't know if there's... If you want to sit in a chair, which is fine, you're probably better off bringing your own, because it's not clear that there's enough chairs there for everybody. So if most of you, all of you, would sit in a chair for the sitting part, you should try to bring some kind of chair. That's difficult. It's probably okay not to bring it, because you probably... Spani has a few. But best if all of you think you should bring your own. And now, it'd be nice to kind of coordinate the meals. And so how... There's a few other things. Okay, okay. One more thing. We discussed what is the easiest way to work on this. So each person could bring their own plates and pencils. That was great. I mean, if you really want to get paper and this way, everybody just brings their own, takes it on home, and work. If you want hot water for tea, I don't have a big, you know, industrial size hot water thing. So if anybody has one of those, grab that. True. Great. And you're requesting this, the dripless candles. Oh, yes. Yes. The blanket part to sit on is when we eat, there'll be a certain amount of space where people sit down around with big, heavy-lunk stuff chairs, and then otherwise people can sit on the ground on blankets and stuff. So just either way, the blankets sit on where it really wants to be. A few people. A few people. So I would just add warm clothes, because unless the weather changes, seven of the next couple of days, we're going to be outside commercial. If you can carpool, that would be good too. There is room on the street for a lot of cars. So then the food. What can you do is go through just three categories again, and how many people are going to eat each one? Well, why don't you reduce it by one? Reduce the number by one for each category. Seven. Six. Oh, reduce the number by one. Yeah. So, okay. Okay, so, seven, six people. Seven. She'll keep you on the street. Seven, two, one. I'm not going to keep track of it, you know what you're going to do. So, we're only going to seven people, so one person take it back. Okay, so, everyone else? And so, if you just take the number, so that's like six people, and for like four, you keep it in the heat. So that's, I think that's six. Like six. The sound for six people. Yeah. Okay, the other one's going to be bread, drinks, entree, and desserts. Okay, so, bread's two people. And drinks, four people. Every single one of you will reduce by one? I think so. Okay, so, drinks, four people. Three. And entrees, 14 people. So, that's what I know of drinks. It's vegetable and entree, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and 12. Okay, so everybody needs to raise their hand. And so, I guess two of the people who are going to call somebody, whoever cares for them, I don't know how to word that, but I'm sure. They can bring whatever they want, you can expect to surprise us. Okay. I think there's going to be a way to keep pop from pop, or limited, limited, I mean, adverse, irregular, other. I think we should mostly think of this as being an outdoor picnic. Yeah. So it's a dessert's drawing. Nothing. One, two, three, four. Is that everybody's accounted for now? I'll bring one. Elizabeth will bring one. She's good to know. Okay. Okay. So, okay, everybody says close enough. Okay. Everything else can be kind of fluid. I think we just did all of it, right? Yeah. And then I'll just say a sense, and as I said, I'm very grateful to be a couple that owns that property, but it's all completely deserved. I'm glad you've been to join us for this dinner, part of the meeting. One of you is good. And so, I hope that... So I hope that... I don't know what I hope. Anyway, I look forward to seeing you all there. And if any of you feel you want to discuss something beforehand with me, I'll be home probably all day Friday. If there's some reason you want to discuss anything of this, I'm happy to do that. And then we'll get together and have a nice gathering and ceremony and things will never be the same. If anybody's interested, I can get copies of the precepts that are on a page like this from Zensener and Matthew and Saturday death will bring a copy. So we can see it. If the precepts stated negatively and then overwritten positively. Some of you probably saw them a year or so ago. Yeah, that's fine to do. But the caveat is that those are 10 and we'll do five. We'll do the first five. We're also at $5 and they've changed their policy so I have to know the count before I get them, which is why I don't have them with me. What accounts for these, you know, one with the five and one with the 10 and... Once again? What accounts for these two lives, a short life and a long life? The lineage and the tradition is ancient. You know, it's 2,500 years of people kind of sorting things out and coming up with ideas and playing around and, you know, in 200 years, you know, you can get different. So it's two different variations on the page? Yeah, there's actually many lists of precepts. There's the five and there's eight and there's ten and there's 220, 227 and... Yeah, we're good. We're good. Anyway, we can talk about it more, but people are beginning to go so I think we should end. Thank you. Thank you.
