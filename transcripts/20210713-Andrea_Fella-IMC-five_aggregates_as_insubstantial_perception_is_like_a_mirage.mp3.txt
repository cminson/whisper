 For the last few weeks we've been exploring some of the processes of our human experience, the natural processes of our human experience that kind of make up, that come together, that kind of work together to form the experiencing that we, that happens for us. These processes are described in a teaching the Buddha offered called the Five Aggregates. And he described our human experience as being comprised of physicality, body experience, form. He described our human experience in terms of mental experience. So there's the physical experience and the mental experience. The mental experience he divided up a little more thoroughly in terms of the processes of how we meet, how our experience happens. And I particularly appreciate this kind of deeper dive into how our minds work because it is within our minds where suffering happens. And while these processes, the processes that happen, these five processes, the physical processes, the mental processes, and I'll name the mental processes in a moment, these processes are natural. It's not like these processes stopped happening for the Buddha after he became awakened. They continued, but the relationship to them, the understanding about them as processes, that's part of my understanding of what happened in his awakening, that he understood these processes for what they are rather than for kind of confusing them or mistaking them to be what they're not, permanent, reliable self. So the four mental processes are feeling, recognizing experience, knowing experience is pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. Perception, the recognition of objects in the world. So one of the key ways of perception working is around the recognition in seeing, for instance, of objects. When you look around your room, wherever you are, you're seeing things. You're seeing trees or lamps or windows or couches or tables or chairs or walls. You're seeing those things and the experience of objects, the recognition of objects, is the work of perception. There's other ways that perception works too. It also helps us to recognize space, distance, that kind of thing. So not necessarily just objects, but for instance, as you're going upstairs or something, this is one of the places I've noticed it. There's kind of a way in which our mind and body, something about our kinesthetic experience, the seeing and the body, the whole experience of walking upstairs, you kind of know where and how much to raise your foot to put it down. So there's a kind of a spatial recognition of how far to raise your foot and where you're expecting your foot to hit the stair, something like that. And I notice this process when there's something unexpected that happens, like, for instance, at my parents' house, the top stair going from the basement upstairs, the top stair is like half an inch shorter than the other stairs. And every time it's a little surprise when my foot isn't landing when I think it's going to land. So that's the process of perception that's kind of helping us to navigate these things. So perception has multiple avenues. It's not just the recognition of objects. So perception, feeling, perception, mental formations, the kind of the intentional aspect of our mind. This includes all of our emotions, our thoughts, also a whole host of mind states that we don't necessarily think of as emotions, such as, well, mindfulness is a mental formation, concentration is a mental formation. These just functions of mind. And we'll talk about that next week. So today we're going to kind of focus on perception and then consciousness, this kind of bare recognition at a sense door. Six sense doors, six sense spaces, sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and the sense base of the mind. So consciousness at each sense base, that there's a kind of a recognition of when that sense base has been contacted with experience. And there's consciousness there that the knowing the recognition, there's a sight, there's a sound, there's a smell, there's a taste, there's a touch, there's something happening in the mind. We'll go into that in a couple more weeks, following my retreat. These processes work together in our experience, in a moment of experience, all five of these processes are coming together and supporting us and navigating the world. These are normal natural human processes. They serve us, they support us. They're not something we're trying to stop happening, but more what we're trying to do is to understand how they work and that they are processes. We tend to misunderstand or misconstrue our experience, something that it's not. Permanent, reliable self, and the weaving of these processes together is a part of how those misunderstandings, they get tangled up with those processes, the misunderstandings, permanent, reliable self, get tangled up with those processes happening. And so some understanding, and this is in the Satipatanasuta, the Buddha's instructions on mindfulness, he encourages us to get to know these processes as processes, to get to know what's happening through these avenues, and to see them, to see them as processes. It begins to undermine the way in which we kind of put it all together and make it me. So that's part of the part of the what supports us in being curious about these processes. So, seeing them each as a process, you know, we're talking about each one. We've talked about the physical processes, the feeling processes we talked about in the previous weeks. Today we're going to look more at perception. But just one thing to say about this is that it's not like we just look at perception. The other aggregates, the other parts of experience are necessary for us to know perception. So, you know, we're not going to know perception without the physicality of the I receiving sight and the consciousness, the knowing of a sight that's happened. We can recognize the process of perception as a thread or as a stream of what's happening in experience. But we're going to know that by having the other processes of feeling, knowing, mental formations and form of physicality kind of support our recognition of that. So each of the seeing of each of these depends on the others to help us to see it. And again, more generally, part of the encouragement with the mindfulness of the aggregates, mindfulness of these processes, is that we begin to see them not only as impermanent. So the instructions in the Satipatthana seem to emphasize noticing the impermanent nature. The first instruction is to recognize, I'll use perception today since that's what we're going to focus on, such as perception. This is the experience. This is how perception functions in the mind. This is the experience, the kind of the recognition of perception happening. So that's the first piece that we start to recognize is this is perception going on. And this is not something we often recognize. It's more under the surface. We just navigate our day seeing objects and moving around without really knowing perception is happening. So that's the first piece, such as perception. And then we're encouraged to notice this is the arising of perception and this is the passing away of perception. So noticing the impermanent nature of perception. And that's even more subtle. The other piece elsewhere in the suttas that we're encouraged to recognize is the not self nature of perception, the emptiness of perception, that it's not what we think it is. And so that's another piece that we'll explore today, particularly through the simile around perception, which is perception is like a mirage. So I'll just drop that in now and then talk a little bit about perception, recognizing it and then look at that analogy a little bit. So perception, the process of perception is how we recognize things in the world. It's related to memory. I mean, when we're born, we don't much know what the objects in the world are. And over the time as we as we live, you know, people start saying stuff to us and connecting it to things in the world. And we begin to kind of get this name association with experiences in the world, patterns that happen through sight, through sound, through smell, through taste, through touch. We begin to recognize it and we begin to make associations even through the different senses. So, you know, an orange, for example, you know, we might learn this round thing that has an orange color is an orange, the fruit. And then so we know something about it. We know it's round. We know that it's got a weight to it. So we touch into it with our physical senses, our sight, our touch. We there's a little bit of a smell to it like, you know, if you scratch the the surface of the orange with a thumbnail, they'll be the oil that you smell. So there's there's the various senses that come together and all of the senses, all of these things belong to this perception, you know, the recognition, how we recognize this as an orange versus a ball. You know, there's there's there's different. It's similar. It maybe is even round and orange and has a similar weight. But there's something different, perhaps about the texture that we feel or the smell, you know, that that that just little little differences that we can recognize this is an orange and this is a ball. And then there's the whole taste part of it, you know, that we we, you know, we taste it for the first time. We open it up. We see it's got sections in the middle. Put one of those sections in our mouth and it explodes in liquid and tartness and sweetness. And that becomes a part of our perception connected with orange. And so all of these, you know, the first time we we experience orange, you know, it's it's like there's nothing to to connect it to. But we experience it multiple times. We begin to create this kind of memory. It's like a file bank of of associations or memories. And and over time we begin to kind of identify, oh, that's an orange. So this this process of perception is actually it's a very helpful process. I think in some ways in terms of evolution, it really supports our brains to not have to do so much work every time they encounter something. You know, the whole process of recognizing something happens so fast when we have a kind of an association with it that we don't even notice that our minds are kind of doing this, you know, retrieving from the filing cabinet and saying, oh, that's what that is. We don't even notice that happens because it happens so quickly. We don't have to figure things out anymore. So perception is this this this recognition process kind of matching to memory and it's got various layers to it. So, you know, we we we might recognize something as an orange. After many, many times of seeing an orange. But the first few times we see it, you know, and actually what seems to happen, I've seen in my own practice when my mind gets really quiet, for instance, looking at one point, I looked at a I turned my head. I was sitting outdoors and I turned my head and my eyes landed on this shape that had a green color. The first thing my mind noticed about it was green and then it noticed a kind of the form of it, it kind of an oval shape that had jagged edges and the mind recognized jagged. And then it identified it as leaf. And identified it as a as a plant that was growing. So, you know, this like that the layer, the perception of the object of leaf was built upon seeing the color, seeing the form. And then it recognized it as leaf. Now that that level of seeing is not something that happens for me that often, you know, it was a particularly quiet mind, but just seeing that. Seeing that once really helped me to understand, wow, this this whole process of sight and the seeing what's happening in the world is built upon so many different processes. So we often will recognize form and color is a kind of a bare level of perception it through through the visual field through sight will recognize form and color. So that kind of the shape, square, straight, oval, round color, you know, the different colors, possibly shading, light, dark, that kind of thing will be coming in to the eye. And then the mind laying on top of that will start to recognize, based on memory history, what the what objects are. So, you know, and another another thing I've sometimes seen, again, when my mind is pretty quiet, is seeing how sometimes the mind will try on various perceptions for an object that the mind isn't immediately recognizing. So I walked into a room in one meditation retreat, and it was dim. So there wasn't a lot of light. And there was this kind of big vast form, kind of, in the room, a large kind of form in the room that the mind didn't immediately recognize. And the very first perception that the mind made just like I was watching, you know, just noticing what was going on in the mind. And the first thing the mind attempted as a as a recognition for this large object was, it's a deformed being. And then, you know, it's like, no, that's not right. And it tried like on two or three things before it, it actually recognized and kind of landed on. Oh, it's a vase of flowers. That's what it is. It's a vase of large vase with large flowers in it. So this the process of perception has some, you know, sometimes we can see the, the process at work, which helps us to understand that, that it first that it is a process, and that, you know, we are seeing our world through the mind, you know, through the processes of mind. So the experience of recognizing perception. Just briefly talk about this because this is this is like I've told talked a little bit about my experiences through sight. But the first ways that it became easier for me to recognize perception at work, you know, perception being this process of the mind saying, well, this is what's here. Perception happens through kind of mediated through various ways that we tend to perceive things. So, like the, it can be mediated through kind of the lens of seeing or hearing or even the other senses, or it can be be mediated through thought. So, we might for instance in hearing a sound of a bird, you know, so through hearing hearing has been the easiest kind of way for me to recognize different ways that perception is experienced. So, hearing the sound hearing the sound of a bird meditating sometimes you might notice this, if you're if you're meditating, and there's a sound that happens. What happens in the mind there's there can be a recognition of a sound. So, a sound of a bird, and then the mind may have it may say in its in itself it may say, that's a bird. So it might say it might recognize it through language, kind of tell us what it is through language. So the sound of the bird happens and we might, if the mind is quiet we might notice the mind saying to itself, bird, or if the mind has recognized a particular bird it might recognize it as crow, or it might recognize it as sparrow or something so you know there can be a little bit more detail there. So that's one way that we, we might recognize experience through the way thought works or language. We have a concept, apply the word to the perception. And this is this is not an uncommon way for perception to happen. Sometimes as people do meditation they interpret perception as thinking, and they think they're thinking all the time. But actually, this the process of perception is, it can be experienced as a subtle or as a subtle form of thought like bird, lawnmower, you know, just like our mind telling us what's happening. And so you know just to recognize oh that's perception, you know, that's the mind recognizing experience. It's not a problem, it's just how it works that the problem can come in when we kind of attribute a reality to that. You know that we we take our perception to be what is actually there. I'll get into that in a moment about how that can be a problem. So that's one way that perception can work. But another way that that we can see perception working is is so for instance when we hear that bird, the perception might happen through the visual field, you know, through a memory, a visual image of a bird appearing in our thoughts, appearing in our mind. So rather than it sounding like, you know, the thought of a bird, you know, the word, the bird, it, we recognize it as an image. So we might see an image of a bird sitting on the fence outside of our house, might see that image and that could be the recognition process. So there's the end this recognition process can come in pretty much through any of our sense modalities. I think for me, at least I've seen it most often through language, through thought and through the visual field. But I think whatever sense modalities are most natural for us, that's probably where we would tend to recognize experience. So someone who is not sighted, for instance, probably would recognize experience more through hearing or, you know, or through sound or possibly even through almost a feeling of of sense contact, you know, the sense of, you know, the recognition of how something feels. So, so perception can happen through any of these sense modalities. So, another thing that's useful to recognize or know about perception, it's while it's extremely useful and helps us to navigate the world. It is not a perfect process. It makes mistakes. I mentioned last week, this this kind of way, you know, in connection with feeling tone how we might, if we misperceive something, there might be radically different feeling tones independence on how we miss perceive it I talked about the the perception of a coiled rope as a snake. And so that that's the process of perception that recognizes whether it's a coiled rope or a snake. And the, the response to that. The response to that perception is very different, depending on what the perception is and what our associations is are with that perceptions with that perception. So the, the challenge or the, the some of the, the suffering and the struggle that arises independence on perception comes partly because we tend to conflate our perceptions with what is actually there. So the example of the snake in the rope, you know, this like this, if there is a rope there, and we interpret it as snake, you know that we perceive it as snake, then the whole host of ideas and beliefs and views about snake come in and have us having our experience about that thing that we've perceived to influence what happens and how we act and what we choose to do. So this happens a lot. You know how we perceive something, what we perceive then gets like bound up with all of our views and ideas and opinions about what we perceive. And instead of relating to the experience through what's actually happening, we start relating to the experience through the ideas, the views and the opinions. And so not seeing that that perception is a process that perception is something that our minds are creating we often will, you know, kind of attribute a reality to our perception and interpret it as this is what is happening. You know, one way this in real in in the in the world has life and death, major consequences is, is the, the perception that might happen around single eyewitness identification. And we can make mistakes about this, you know, we can make mistakes about who a person is and then, you know, the identification of that is the person who did this thing to me. And it's been shown over and over again how unreliable eyewitness is, especially when somebody is under stress, the stress of being, you know, attacked or something you know that the the eyewitness is is very unreliable that what we perceive is unreliable. So, we confuse our perceptions to be reality and you know there have been so many stories about people being absolutely certain, this is the person that that did this and DNA evidence years later proving no, it wasn't that person. So, you know, the, the, this has real world consequences real world suffering that perception tends to be a mistake that we tend to attribute, like, certainty to our perceptions. I'd say that's the biggest problem. We attend tend to attribute certainty to our perceptions. We think that we're receiving, you know, exactly what's out there, we are like cameras that are just recording what's out there. But that's not the way our minds work our minds are much more informed by history and ideas and views, what, what we believe what we, what we have experience in the past tend to shape how we perceive things. So perception for us is not like a camera. It's, it's got way more interpretation already embedded in it. It's it's it's a little bit dangerous you know our kind of belief that we are perceiving things accurately. So this is part of, you know what we can start to see as we begin to recognize perception is just how dynamic perception is like my seeing of like it's a deformed being you know it's like no that's not a deformed being let's try again, what let's let's hang out here and see what this is. So the, the, the process of perception when seen can help to undermine this kind of belief in the our our belief in the absolute validity or reliability of our perceptions. We will say it does a pretty good job perception does a really good job, helping us navigate the world. So it's not like we want to just discount it. But we also need to have some respect for perception being informed and influenced by views, ideas, opinions, beliefs. So, the example the the analogy that the Buddha offers around perception is that perception is like a mirage. And I think this is a useful analogy to unpack a little bit to explore kind of the deeper layers of it because I think it can help us to recognize some of the mistakes or some of the ways that we might make mistakes around perception. So, the Buddha just says perception is like a mirage, and then somebody looking at a mirage actually recognizing, is this, is this, is there any substance to this mirage. Well first you have to recognize that it is a mirage before you recognize that there's no substance to it. And so, you know, that's the piece that we don't tend to recognize that this is perception that's happening. We tend to attribute or take what we are perceiving to be what is there. So perception is like a mirage that the classic mirage is the mirage of water in the desert, you know, seeing the water in the desert and, and I actually looked this up at one point a few years ago when I was doing another talk about this and how does this mirage work going on there. And, you know, the, the heat waves are reflecting back up off the surface of the sand. And it creates a kind of the the ripple and the heat waves is creating almost like a mirror effect. And what is what that mirror is reflecting is the sky. The sky is reflected down onto the surface of the sand, and it looks like a blue lake. And it's very, some of the pictures I've seen of mirages are stunning in that you know the pictures of like a desert with mountains in the background, and the you know the mountains in the background are reflected in the, in the blue as well. And it's, it looks like the reflection of water it's it's quite, quite looks, it really looks like a lake, you know, on this, on this, on this desert. And so, seeing that, you know, seeing that mirage, the, the, the sadness of the traveler you know believing it to be water you know running towards it and then it vanishes so you know so there's the, the interpretation of it, of it, being there of it being water. But the other piece of this analogy, so, and the and the suffering that would come through taking that that perception or that mirage to be reality, the suffering that comes from that discovering that there's not water there. But the other piece of this analogy is that that I find to be useful to explore, is that the, the mirage is reflecting something that is there. It's reflecting the sky, and it's reflecting the, you know, the image of whatever the the mountains or whatever that are there. It's reflecting something that's there. And so it's not completely dissociated from reality. It is just being misinterpreted as being something that it's not. And that's, that's kind of the crux of the way that perception kind of leads to suffering, is that we in the perception in the process of perception. We see what's there you know we recognize what's there and it is a reflection of what is out there, at least, you know, again, it does a really good job of recognizing the world sometimes it does make these mistakes. You know of, of seeing something as a deformed being versus seeing or seeing something as a snake instead of a rope or seeing it as a rope instead of a snake a slightly more dangerous version of that, of that analogy. So, you know that that the perception of stop for a moment. I lost my where I was going with that so get back to that. All right, okay so the, the seeing what's there we take it to be reality. And so the, the, the, the clinging to the clinging. I'm gonna step back again. So, we, we see the world and it's a reflection of what's there. But it, but we are not experiencing what's there. We are experiencing our perception. And that, that's kind of, that's kind of mind blowing actually when we really touch into it, that, that what we are experiencing is not what's actually happening in the world it's what our mind is making of what is happening in the world, and it is a reflection of what is happening in the world. And yet the, the fact that our mind is making this means that it. Is very influenced by many other things like our views like our beliefs like our opinions. So for instance we might see somebody on the street might see, see a person walking down the street somebody we don't know, but their body type, their height, their coloring their, their profile. It's kind of reminiscent of somebody that we know. And we have all kinds of associations with that person that we know. We like them we don't like them, we're afraid of them, we're delighted to see them, and whatever those associations are those associations can be kind of attached to this person that we don't know. And that can happen really quickly. You know that that we see somebody we don't know and it's like oh I don't like that person. Or oh that person looks interesting, and some of that may be coming from our history and associations with the perception. And that you know so that's, that's a piece of, you know, just taking in it's like well that person's not trustworthy. It's like, how do you know that you know we don't have any relevant data necessarily it's it's just connected to our history. So the. So that's one piece of how our, you know, reliance on our experience, you know, absolute reliance on our experience can get us into into trouble and create struggle and stress and suffering for ourselves for others, but kind of a subtler and more, more, a deeper way that perception creates difficulty for us or stress for us, is that in in taking our, our perceptions to be what's happening. You know we we cling we may, we may. So we've reified some things like that is what is happening. That, that thing that experience, that is what is happening. And I like that. I don't like that. I want that I don't want that. And what we cling to, you know, so the process of, of suffering in, in the way the Buddha described it happens because we cling to something, something pleasant we like it we want to hold on to it something unpleasant we don't like it we want to push it away. And so there's that movement of that's a mental formation of, you know, ideas and views and beliefs about what we like what we want what we don't want. And then the clinging what we think we we think we're clinging to is, you know, something out in the world we think we're clinging to, oh I need that thing to be okay or be happy. But the way our minds actually work and this was, this is a kind of a surprising thing to see as well. When we see it is that we don't actually cling to what's out there because we don't experience what's out there we experience our perceptions. And so the clinging. What we like and what we don't like is our perceptions. It's not what's actually out there. So we cling to things that our mind has created. And those things that our mind has created is not just the simple bear material of what's in the world. It's things that our mind have created based on our history based on our ideas based on our beliefs and views. And so we cling to our perceptions. And actually what what what clinging works with. Clinging, we don't actually cling to, to things happening in the world, because we don't. That's that's not how our experiences mediated by these processes. So perception is what has how we know the world. And so perception is what we cling to. And when we can start to see the unreliability of our perceptions. And recognize that yeah it's like a mirage. It is like a mirage and that that mirage you know it is. It's not it's not even just that the mirages is in the case of a mirage it's like everybody can see it we can take pictures of it you know it's like that the mirage is something that we can agree yeah that's there it's not like somebody would see the mirage and somebody else can see it. But, but, you know, if three people are seeing the mirage and somebody says yeah let's go for that water and two other people say you know no it's actually not actually water. This is a mirage. You know, that that can help to to kind of mitigate the, the, the clinging to it as something that's actually there. So, starting to understand and see these processes as processes can help us to let go of the ways in which we cling and attach to our perceptions.
