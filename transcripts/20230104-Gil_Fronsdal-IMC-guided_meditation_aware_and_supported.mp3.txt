 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So good morning, good day everyone. Welcome to our meditation session. And we're also considering this week the topic of Dharma, Dhamma. And it's a common enough in the world of etymology to say that Dharma comes from a root word meaning to hold or to bear or to support something. Sometimes it's said to come from an even kind of earlier etymology of something that is in order and organized, coherent. So the idea of Dharma being what holds us up and what holds us up is maybe the how reality coordinates, cooperates with itself to create all that we have that makes it possible for us to be here. And kind of for us personally, the closest and clearest example of this support, this coordination, cooperation that supports us, allows us to be here is our own body. That's the closest at hand for us. And to allow the Dharma of the body to support us, the coordinated processes, the natural order of the body that we interfere with. If we are too actively fixing or changing or wanting it to be different than what it is. To some times where that's a fine thing to do, but there are times when we want to be supported and trust the support, suppress trust this coordinated cooperative support that this body gives, meaning that the body often knows how to move to homeostasis, move to health, move to healing. And a lot of the Dharma practice is being very present for our experience. And that's really key. Emphasize it, be very present, be aware here and getting out of the way, not interfering. And that can be counterintuitive for people who have a habit of always interfering, fixing, thinking it shouldn't be the way it is. And it's a remarkable thing to sit quietly in a meditative posture, being very present, not interfering. And watch, notice that unfold, even something as simple as sitting quietly and feeling the body begins to relax, to settle a little bit. The heart begins to become more settled and relaxed. Agitation dissipates. Maybe even the quality characteristic of your thinking changes, become slow or calmer, quieter. And this quieter way of being settled is both comes from a little bit of trusting that the body will support us and also comes with making space for the coordinated processes, the cooperative processes of our body to show themselves, to be themselves. So assuming a meditation posture, and I find a light and an idea that the body supports the body, all the different parts of the body support what's above it. Holds the weight, holds it together, gently closing the eyes. One of the functions of closing the eyes is to let the other senses we have, especially the sense of physical touch and physical sensations come into greater focus. Many people are eye focused, what they see, what they look at, and closing our eyes so we can be body focused. Feeling the body from the inside out. Beginning a process of trusting the body, trusting being present for it as it is. And gently, in a way that's gentling for you, relaxing for you, take some deeper breaths and as you exhale, relax into the support the body provides. Letting the breathing return to normal. On the inhale, let your attention fall or come to different places in your body where there's tension or tightness. On the exhale, soften, relax those parts of the body. Release it from the tension. Reaching. And then settling into your breathing. And then settling into your breathing. And sometimes in the breathing itself, we can sense and feel the support. And then we can feel the support. And then we can feel the support. And then we can feel the support. And sense and feel the support. The naturalness of breathing. And sometimes it's possible to see how we're controlling it. Or holding it, resisting, limiting it. With this awareness practice we do, be okay with all of it. Don't try to fix anything, even the control. Make room for it in your awareness. Non-interfering awareness and trust. Something will find its way. With non-interfering awareness, that stays aware, makes a room for what's here. As you breathe in and breathe out. And then you breathe in and breathe out. And then you breathe in and breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. A good percentage of our thinking probably could be understood as being supported by mistrust. Or supported by an absence of real trust and care, caring. For the Dharma here in us, the support. The coordinated, cooperative, amazing world of our body and mind operating here in this space of awareness. And then you breathe in and breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then you breathe out. And then coming to the end of the meditation, the Dharma of support, of coordinate, the meditation of the meditation, the Dharma of support, of coordination, cooperation, is not just with our body, but with, in a sense, the whole world, the earth, the plants and the animals of the earth, the oceans, the clouds, the air, other people. Our life depends on this wider world. Our life lives in support and in coordination with this wider world. And we live in relationship to this wider world. And it's possible for us to be supported by the wider world and at the same time to offer our support for it, to care for it, to cooperate and coordinate with the wider world. With attitudes, thoughts, words and actions of goodwill, of well-wishing, of support, supporting the best for everyone. May it be that this meditation supports us, supports the goodness of our heart to float to the surface. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And in that freedom that we offer, may we receive it in return. May we live in a cooperative universe, supporting each other, to be free. Thank you.
