The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Thank you very much.
It's a very simple truth.
This is what helps us to learn and not be trapped in suffering.
The third noble truth is that the end of suffering is possible.
This is the very good news.
The fourth, which we saw two weeks ago, is the path or the path we must take if we seek to free ourselves from suffering.
Now that it is quite difficult to know what this path is, in Buddhist teachings there is a path with eight parts.
And now we have to take the first step.
What is translated as correct or able vision or able understanding?
As you have noticed in Buddhist teachings, the metaphor is widely used.
For example, the river is used to describe what is transitory or temporal, the wheel to describe the cycle of life.
Let's start by investigating the word metaphor.
In Greek, the preposition met√° means more beyond.
And fora, which comes from the verb forene, means to take.
So a metaphor is to take beyond the meaning of a word towards another term or concept.
So what is this other term?
Let's see if the path is used as a metaphor in Buddhism.
What is this other term or concept that is pointing to?
I think the most clear and brief way to express it would be an internal process.
The path itself is an internal process that is carried out.
We are using something very specific, such as a path or path, to describe something abstract.
It is this development that is carried out within us.
The full attention is an essential basic element to develop this internal process.
Initially, when we start with Buddhist teachings, we believe that this path is outside of us.
We believe that we will find it in books, listening to other places or with other people.
But with time we realize that it doesn't matter where we go in the world, we will not find it.
The path is inside of us.
We are the path, we create the path and we discover it step by step.
Sometimes it is a little challenging because you feel that sometimes it is like this.
You are going to take the path and you don't know where you are going to take the path to the void.
You have to have the value.
Something inside that is much greater than our reason is pointing to us.
When we use full attention with meditation, we begin to learn to listen to this greater force than us,
which tells us how to follow this path.
Now, there are many paths and you have to know to discover which one is the correct one.
That is why Buddha offered the name Octuple path as a guide to follow.
Visionable is different from correct opinion.
Visionable is more like an understanding or correct orientation.
That is, it implies situating ourselves where we are at this moment in our life
and asking ourselves what is the correct path for me.
Because the correct path for me is not going to be the correct path for Leti nor for Francisco.
Here, having or developing visionable is an essential step to find the correct path.
Visionable is inseparable from what is the goal in Buddhist spiritual life
because, thanks to a visionable, we carry ourselves towards our goal.
Now, the most brief and clear way to explain or express what this goal is
would be the liberation of suffering.
It is often said that the most common and universal impulse of human beings is to be happy.
And although it takes many different forms, the idea of happiness is the motor.
It is the goal of all human beings.
It is because we are all here.
We all seek to be happy.
It is very simple.
If we use the metaphor of a palace as our goal, this palace is within us.
The palace means what we are potentially capable of.
And this is the palace of happiness, peace and well-being.
Now, vision or understanding has three parts, which is what we are going to investigate now.
The first would be to understand our behavior in terms of cause and effect.
When we are children, we learn through stories.
We interpret life in dualistic terms.
Very simple.
Someone who is good is very good and someone who is bad is very bad.
Everything is white or black.
He has his intelligence.
Why is that for children?
The goal is to simplify, contrast and separate.
He has his wisdom.
Children need that simplicity.
But when we mature, we begin to discover that life in reality is a range of graces.
And some of us understand, as the woman I mentioned two weeks ago said,
this wonderful woman of 108 years, Alice Hatsoma,
we all have the capacity to be cruel and to be merciless.
I think it is very wise that in Buddhist teachings we do not speak of someone who is bad or good,
but of someone who commits evil or inauspicious actions.
When we formulate it in this way, we leave the door open to change at any time.
All human beings can choose for an active behavior when they wish to.
It does not matter that it has been a criminal of the most funest.
Always, every moment in the present, we have the option to change.
To start again.
All of us.
As we have seen before, the way we use our language has a huge importance and influence on our well-being and others.
That is why I like so much to use the term of active behavior, because not only does not identify with anyone as a lost case,
but also that by saying active, this means active, which is suitable for something that promises something.
I like to think that it promises something towards the future. You are planting good seeds for the future.
And there comes the consequence, this is the cause.
This is the effect, this is the cause and then comes the effect.
The concept of the cause and the effect in our behavior is very simple.
If we act in a friendly way, we are planting good seeds.
If we act in a friendly way, we are planting seeds of happiness for the future.
The Buddha pointed out that the inalienable actions always harm us and others, although sometimes they can bring us temporal satisfaction.
For example, if we see it in the question of a country, if a country makes war on another to get its resources,
let's say oil, if the country is powerful, it will achieve it.
However, we know that the consequences will come sooner or later, although sometimes they take years,
but the consequences will be presented.
This phenomenon of cause and effect is called karma, some have heard this term.
Karma is not more than the consequences of all our thoughts, of all our words and of all our actions.
So, when we understand that it is inevitable that every thought, word and action is inalienable,
if it has a negative effect, then we hope that our behavior is able.
Leaving the inalienable actions and cultivating the inalienables guarantees our happiness.
Knowing this is very important because we not only take responsibility for our future, but it also helps us accept the consequences of past actions.
We accept that we made a mistake and we are not trapped there, but we continue.
In conclusion, in order to achieve an inalienable vision, we must understand that every thought, word and action creates karma or consequences.
It is of great importance to take care of the action from the thought to the action to build good consequences.
If you remember two weeks ago, Francisco made a question in itself quite confusing that we began to answer, and the question was how can we differentiate a correct action from an incorrect action.
So, as we saw, there are obviously very obvious actions, such as stealing, killing, lying, where it is very easy to differentiate.
But there are others where it is no longer so easy, if you remember the story of the almohada I told you about.
There is already a culture of attention, of mental clarity, where we are slowly refining this ability to differentiate more and more with more subtlety what is correct, what is able and what is inalienable.
In other words, the more calm and quiet the mind is, the faster it is.
Immediately, this will bring me suffering.
If I open my mouth right now, I know that I am going to say something that is not able.
And then you do not say it, but we have to have that inner quietness, because if not, the most likely thing is that we will react and then there is suffering.
So, in general, in Buddhism we say that if we act motivated by bondage, generosity and compassion towards all beings, the consequences and effects will be positive.
We will be well loved and we will be happy.
This conductable has two effects. One is the internal effect, that is, our mind will be in peace and we will enjoy well-being and tranquility, and then there is also the external effect.
And that is the effect that we have in other people. This, of course, when we benefit from other people, the most likely thing is that it is pleasant for us.
However, here it is necessary to add that we should not depend on the external effects, since these are not reliable, because we cannot control them.
We enjoy them when they are presented, but that is all. We do not cling to them and we wait for them to be there.
If we act under the code of hatred and confusion, we will see ourselves alone in conflict and, of course, bring us unhappiness.
Here, there are also the two effects, the internal and the external.
This is quite obvious, but nevertheless it is interesting that the Buddhist teachings are presented. There are so many lists. These lists are 10 actions that are always unhappiness and cause suffering.
There are three of the body, killing, stealing and sexual conduct, either towards ourselves or others. Four of the language, lying, using malicious words, using an aspiration language.
This is interesting, because sometimes some people, by habit, use an aspiration language.
The last language is also interesting, not to cultivate vain talks.
Talking is nothing more than speaking, which has no value. The cheese, of course.
The last three are the mind. It is to have envy, evil will and a wrong vision of reality.
To have a confused mind is fatal.
The correct vision shows us how these unhappiness actions always cause us harm.
These 10 actions are not commandments, as we have seen with other lists, but a set of principles to investigate our own experience.
If we observe with detainment, we soon discover that these 10 actions, unhappiness, cause us not only psychological pain, but also physical pain, towards us and others.
We will carry out one of these 10 actions only when we are under the influence of greed, hatred or confusion.
The Buddhist morality, we say, is that we distill it through the investigation of the principle of cause and effect.
By applying full attention to meditation and daily life, we achieve that our perception becomes more acute
and that we can clearly see the devastating consequences of immoral conduct.
Meditation allows us to experience vividly the painful effect of thoughts, words and unhappiness,
and we feel the urgent need to renounce them.
As we said before, with meditation we become more sensitive, and things that used to seem very insignificant to us, now give you much more.
Now let's go to part number 2 of the three parts that have a vision. The second part is the profound understanding of the Four Realities.
Understanding the Four Realities means applying them constantly in our lives, recognizing that dissatisfaction is integral to life and that there will always be dissatisfaction.
Now, according to Buddhist teachings, dissatisfaction or suffering in our lives is inevitable for, and now I read as it appears in the texts, in Buddhist scriptures,
because we are born, we age, we get sick and we die, because there is separation of what we love and association with what we hate,
because we do not achieve what we want and we obtain what we do not want. There it is, in summary, because we suffer.
Now dissatisfaction arises when we do not recognize that everything is transitory, therefore unsatisfactory,
and that the self, which we care so closely, is a mental construction and an illusion.
Now, these two last teachings of the transitory and the illusion of the self are the most difficult.
So, do not worry. One begins by intellectually absorbing them only. With time, if one practices with tenacity and constancy, one understands them directly with one's own experience.
And it has to happen gradually so as not to enter a crisis, because it is quite strong to realize that this self, in reality,
because of practical issues, if it exists, because I have to get to my house and know where I live,
and my license has my name, but in reality it is something that we are constantly reinforcing with our ideas, with our thoughts,
how we dress, how we speak, etc.
The third part of how to study the visionable is the relation of the visionable with the general scheme of Buddhist teachings.
The first step to find the path is the visionable. We need the visionable to find the right path.
By finding this path, we will understand that the end of suffering is possible if we follow this path.
It also implies understanding how we contribute to this suffering.
And we learn to have the vision of what is possible in relation to the liberation of this suffering.
Then, the correct vision implies having a vision, being a visionary of what is possible in our lives,
in terms of how much freedom, peace and compassion we can have, how much we can transform,
so that the best within us can arise.
Now, let's see how the visionable fits in relation to the four true nobles.
The fourth and last true noble is the omnipresent noble, right?
And the first step of the omnipresent noble is to understand the four true nobles.
And also to practice the complete path.
So, here we see that there is a complete circular system.
For me, it suggested the symbol of infinity.
Now, I'll show you, I made a little drawing here.
It's a little crooked, but don't look.
Here is the symbol of infinity.
Two circles.
The top circle is the four true nobles, the bottom circle is the eight steps of the omnipresent noble.
So, we see that here we have the principle of the eight steps of the omnipresent noble,
which is vision and understanding.
And also, this point is the fourth, which implies the path that frees us from suffering.
Now, if we remember that the four true nobles include the omnipresent noble,
and we know that this plus this is considered the core or essence of Buddhist teachings,
since it is said that it contains all the teachings.
If we then look at this symbol of infinity again,
this place where the two circles converge is the understanding of the four true nobles,
the eight steps of the omnipresent noble, and therefore of all Buddhist teachings.
So, I hope this helps the drawing.
And to finish, I want to read you a quote from the Buddhist scriptures called Dhammapada.
It says,
The best path is the path of the eight steps.
The best truths are the four true nobles.
The best of the virtues is the one of the free being of desires.
The best person is the one who has eyes to look at.
That is to say, it is the look to achieve vision or understanding of what we have just talked about.
And with that, I finish.
The talk was now a little condensed, but I hope it is clear if there are questions, I hope there are questions,
and so little we can deduce something, ideas.
When you mentioned the three.
I see the microphone, now I do need it.
When you mentioned in the script about the three elements that are built,
you mentioned confusion.
Does confusion refer to not understanding the four true nobles?
Confusion refers in general, but of course, since the four true nobles are like the pillar of Buddhist teachings,
I would say yes, but it also implies life in general.
When you have a mind that is confused or full of doubts, if you remember that it is one of the obstacles,
we cannot advance in practice.
So we could say that the path or the optical path or the practice would lead us to the clarity of that confusion.
The practice, the complete path, does not only lead to happiness, but you have a clear mind, anxious, quiet, awake.
The three elements, the three last elements in the optical path refer to the mind, are diligence, attention, and concentration.
For concentration and attention, you need mental clarity.
It is a lot of information, a lot of information, and some words seem to be the same as others.
I will try not to interrupt it, I did not ask you at the moment, but I will try to remember the doubts that I got.
Yes, I get a lot of attention when I say confusion, because how can we really know that we are confused?
Because the word confusion is too big, it can be personal confusion, confusion of ideas, confusion,
I mean, in what parameters can you understand confusion?
Sometimes in my personal case, I have that doubt that if I am doing the right thing, and once you mentioned it in other classes here,
that when you were with someone and you were going to say something, and then you regret not saying what you felt,
then at that moment you realize that it was not the right thing.
So for the confusion, and sometimes I wonder if I am doing the right thing,
and within me, it calms me down, I feel that calmness and I say, I think I am doing the right thing.
But I also get a doubt, but it could also be a lie from your mind that is telling you that you are doing the right thing,
maybe you are very far from the right thing.
But, well, I stop thinking about it at that moment, but I do feel that calmness.
So that came to me to make sure that that other question that came into my mind,
what I was doing, was provoking me, because I do feel happy,
and if I have experienced, sometimes during the day, a feeling of calmness,
and nothing has happened in particular, but I feel happy, I feel calm.
It does not happen to me very often, but that comes to me to make sure that if I am not correct,
that could be a little when you feel confused.
At the end of the list you said the wrong observation of reality, something like that,
what example could you give me for that?
Well, let's go first, the two things.
First I want to go back a little bit to the topic you are talking about, what confusion is.
In English the word used is the same as greed, hatred and delusion.
It is delusion that is used.
Translated in Spanish, I found it in a Buddhist book in Spanish as delirium.
Delirium seemed a little exaggerated, because delirium is already when you are not in your five senses.
In s√≠, delusion, a lo que se refiere es cuando t√∫ eres incapaz de ver con claridad.
Uno de mis primeros retiros recuerdo, todav√≠a ten√≠a muy poca experiencia,
sin embargo se me hizo interesante que la imagen que me vino a m√≠
cuando quise explicar en mi primera entrevista qu√© es a qu√© hab√≠a ido yo a ese retiro,
fue que ten√≠a yo la visi√≥n, no s√© si han visto las part√≠culas del polvo cuando lo ven contra el sol.
Qu√© dices, qu√© incre√≠ble que normalmente no las vemos, pero ah√≠ est√°n miles y miles de part√≠culas
que est√°n flotando constantemente alrededor de nosotros.
Lo que yo visualizaba es que quer√≠a lograr una tranquilidad suficiente para que esto se asentara,
o al igual que cuando le haces as√≠ a un lodo o un charquito, se pone todo lo doso y ya no ves con claridad.
Te esperas, se baja la tierra y ves con claridad.
La confusi√≥n es igual a una mente agitada.
Si en un momento se sienten confusos, les recomiendo encarecidamente sientense un momento a meditar,
en el momento en que hay, claro, si estamos muy muy agitados no va a ser cuesti√≥n de cinco minutos,
pero la calma, la visi√≥n clara viene cuando nosotros somos capaces de tener algo de quietude interna.
Ahora, la otra parte de lo que es el percibir la realidad en nuestro entorno o la realidad en una manera correcta.
Este es un tema bastante grande en budismo.
En realidad, lo que nos damos cuenta entre m√°s meditamos es que normalmente vemos todo tan velado
y a trav√©s de unos lentes que son diferentes colores y que te hacen ver las cosas seg√∫n tus deseos,
seg√∫n tus miedos, seg√∫n tus proyecciones, es de veras impresionante cuando te empiezas a dar cuenta.
Eso lo va uno descubriendo solamente poco a poco cuando observas tu mente a trav√©s de la pr√°ctica de muchos a√±os
y te vas dando cuenta c√≥mo nosotros le ponemos nuestra proyecci√≥n a la otra persona, as√≠ como un sombrero.
Rara vez vemos a la otra persona tal cual.
Lo bello de esta pr√°ctica es cuando aprendemos a mirar a la otra persona totalmente dentro de nuestra capacidad
en la manera m√°s abierta posible, con la mente abierta y el coraz√≥n abierta,
especialmente dif√≠cil a la gente que conocemos muy bien.
O sea, soy capaz de ver a alguien que conozco muy bien para ver si puede ser que la persona tuvo hace una semana
una experiencia que le cambi√≥ la vida y yo veo a la persona igual.
Entonces, es un regalo que nosotros podemos dar a los dem√°s.
Encontrar cada vez a alguien como a ver qui√©n eres, c√≥mo est√°s ahora.
Eso lo va uno logrando m√°s si esta pregunta te la haces vez tras vez cuando te sientas a meditar.
Si cada vez que te sientas a meditar con todo cari√±o y honestidad y genuinidad te dices,
¬øc√≥mo es que verdaderamente estoy ahora?
A veces no da gusto para nada ver c√≥mo est√° uno,
porque a veces est√° uno lleno de nojo, de celos, de deseos y cuesta trabajo estar con eso.
Pero si aprendemos es que no hay problema, es lo que es, lo acepto.
Y entre m√°s aceptaci√≥n traemos a estas emociones, estados dif√≠ciles,
y vamos a ser capaces de encontrar a las otras personas cada vez como si se tabula raza, como un papel en blanco.
Y es que le agregamos mucho a tu pregunta de dos semanas.
Nada m√°s una curiosidad hacer y para no movernos de la confusi√≥n estoy confundido por decirlo as√≠.
¬øQu√© es visi√≥n? En el budismo se podr√≠a entender lo que se llama visi√≥n en el √°mbito empresarial, por ejemplo ver el futuro, ver tu prop√≥sito.
Bueno, ¬øa qu√© te refieres cuando dices empresarial?
S√≠, por ejemplo, cuando las empresas crean su visi√≥n, su visi√≥n que ven de la empresa, se puede tomar lo mismo.
Bueno, en el sentido de que visi√≥n es tener la perspectiva de una situaci√≥n y la meta puede ser
c√≥mo le saco lo m√°ximo de dinero a la sociedad o c√≥mo vivo mi vida lo m√°s h√°bil posible para crear la mayor cantidad de felicidad para m√≠ y para todos los que me rodean.
O sea, ah√≠ la intenci√≥n es diametralmente opuesta, pero igual est√°s trabajando con visi√≥n. Entonces aqu√≠ lo que es clave es cu√°l es la intenci√≥n.
En ambos casos est√°s trabajando con visi√≥n. S√≠, para estos, para estos del mercado, de negocios, una visi√≥n h√°bil es descubrir el punto d√©bil de cada individuo para hacer ver c√≥mo les va a sacar el dinero.
Si queda contestado, es buena pregunta.
¬øAlguna otra pregunta?
Esta pr√°ctica fue una de las m√°s cortas pero una de las m√°s profundas tambi√©n y para m√≠. Entonces hay mucho, mucho, realmente disfrut√© mucho lo que estabas leyendo, pero creo que hay un espacio enorme para compenetrar.
Y s√© que mucho de esto viene a trav√©s de la pr√°ctica, se empieza a aclarar, pero hay mucha riqueza en lo que acabas de leer al grado que realmente mientras lo estabas leyendo estaba pensando y tratando de sentir.
Lo que pensaba y lo que mi cuerpo dec√≠a, a ver si estaban en congruencia, porque a veces no. Mi mente dec√≠a una cosa y mi cuerpo estaba tranquilo pero mi mente estaba agitada, como lo mencionaste.
All√≠ es donde yo estaba confundido, porque es esa confusi√≥n de si lo que estoy pensando es diferente de lo que estoy sintiendo, qui√©n tiene la raz√≥n.
Siempre es esa cuesti√≥n de traer, alinear la mente y el cuerpo, traer la mente a donde est√° el cuerpo. El cuerpo siempre est√° en donde est√°, es la mente en nuestro problema, es la mente en la que se nos va por otros lados.
Cuando le hago el terminar con el sufrimiento, como que llegara a sobreponer el sufrimiento, el hecho de ignorar o enfrentar a alguien para no tener conflicto y no perder su momento de felicidad,
es correcto o es incorrecto, el no confrontar a alguien para evitar un mal momento, un disgusto, evitar como el sufrimiento, eso es correcto o a lo mejor ya lo dijo y yo no me acuerdo.
Dime t√∫ primero, t√∫ que crees.
¬øTienes su parte que puede ser peligrosona, pero tambi√©n tiene otra parte?
Para no estar en ese conflicto, mejor evitar el confrontamiento, entonces para no sentirme, para que no me lleve a su lado, yo mejor lo ignoro, mejor lo evito,
el tener que cruzarme con esa persona o sabiendo de que va a ser un momento, que no me va a generar ninguna felicidad al contrario, entonces mejor me aparto.
Muchas veces esa es la reacci√≥n correcta, pero esto tiene que ver con el habla y uno de los pasos en el Nobel Octuple Sendero es el habla y ese es un tema incre√≠blemente interesante,
que le vamos a dedicar una sesi√≥n especial y lo que tenemos que mantener en mente es que si est√°s en una situaci√≥n delicada y est√°s dudando si hablar o no hablar
es importante preguntarse, es cierto, es constructivo, es buen momento, esas tres cosas.
Si puedes decir s√≠ a las tres cosas, adelante.
Me alegr√≠a, checa c√≥mo est√° tu cuerpo, si tu cuerpo est√° hecho un nudo, lo m√°s probable es que no salga h√°bil, entonces ayuda a cantidad esperarse a que el cuerpo se tranquilice,
simplemente checa c√≥mo est√°s respirando, puedes respirar profundo hasta ac√° abajo o no, si no puedes, esp√©rate un rato.
Pero a veces es importante enfrentar a alguien si est√° haciendo algo injusto, pero hay que saber c√≥mo hacerlo.
Es posible hacerlo en una manera no violenta, simplemente diciendo la verdad, yo veo esto, no veo qu√© es justo, vamos a hacer esto.
Ok, ya estaba yo apagando.
Para empezar, por ejemplo, quien inicia en la pr√°ctica, en el comienzo de la visi√≥n correcta c√≥mo hacer para, digamos, de cierta manera por decirlo, c√≥mo limpiar mis creencias para empezar con una visi√≥n correcta.
Hay alguno.
Muy bien Sonia, otra vez con el micr√≥fono porque eso estuvo muy bien.
No dec√≠a que lo primero es darse cuenta que creencias tiene uno porque muchas veces uno act√∫a sobre algo que ni siquiera se est√° dando cuenta de esa base.
Eso me ha pasado algunas veces de decir, claro, yo es que estoy presuponiendo, no s√© qu√© ejemplo, poner tal o cual cosa, pero ni siquiera me hab√≠a dado cuenta de que eso era lo que yo ten√≠a de fondo.
Ese ser√≠a el paso primero, ahora es lo segundo ya.
Es cierto que me dice Pablo, como me dar√≠a cuenta que es correcto, por los resultados si no estoy bien, es que algo estoy mal, mis creencias, lo que he venido haciendo no est√° del todo bien.
Mucho yo creo que tambi√©n puede ayudar c√≥mo es que te sientes despu√©s de haber hecho x o y.
Tomarte unos cuantos segunditos, no necesitas una hora, unos cuantos segundos de ver c√≥mo me siento.
Tranquilo, normalmente sabemos.
No queremos entrar a cuestiones de culpa ni nada de esas cosas, pero no, simplemente si bueno, a ver, siento que hice lo correcto o sientes ese gusanito que est√°s viendo, como que no estuvo muy bien, a lo mejor podr√≠a deber√≠a de haber.
Pero es algo que se desarrolla poco a poco y lo que vamos a ir viendo cuando ya tengamos todo es esto construido de las cuatro nobles verdades y el noble octuple sendero,
que en realidad todo no es lineal en nuestra experiencia, sino que de repente en una experiencia vamos a usar la concentraci√≥n correcta y luego el habla correcta y luego el medio de vida correcto y as√≠.
Vas usando en el momento lo que necesitas como si fueras a cocinar y estos son los diferentes ingredientes y usas lo que necesitas en el momento.
Pero s√≠, la cuesti√≥n es seguir practicando y recordando que el tomarse un rato a diario para meditar menor me ayuda, porque si no todo permanece intelectual.
Est√° bien que vengan y escuchan, pero se queda todo a nivel intelectual.
En el momento que t√∫ te sientas a meditar y que haces la conexi√≥n con lo que escuchaste y tu propia experiencia ya se dio, se dio la maravilla.
Ah√≠ est√° ya una experiencia, una vivencia, una ense√±anza tuya que t√∫ te la ganaste y esa se queda contigo para el resto de tu vida.
Pero esa conexi√≥n tiene que darse el concepto y tu experiencia propia.
