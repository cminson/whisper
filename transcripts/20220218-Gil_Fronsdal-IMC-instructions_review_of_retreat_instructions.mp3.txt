The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So hello everyone. Yep, here there. Thank you. So I'd like to do a kind of a
guided review of the instructions for this week and start with a kind of an
analogy when my son was quite young but old enough to go like play in a little
park or playground with other kids or at home or any place. There was a phase
where it seemed that he was ready to kind of explore and go out a little bit
away from his parents, a little bit out on his own. But he would look back, make
sure that we were seeing him and if he didn't see us he would be concerned. But
he also wanted to know that we were seeing him. So at some point we could
just sit quietly in the shade under a tree and something. And our job was to
keep an eye on him, not because he was in danger but because it was reassuring
for him that we were seeing him. And then he'd come back sometimes and sit in our
lap and kind of, I guess, rebalance or whatever kids do and their kids parents
lap, feel safe again or feel home again or something. And then he'd run off in
this direction, that direction, sometimes up on the play structure, sometimes on
the swing, sometimes the sandbox. And wherever he went, our job was to stay
quiet and peaceful and keep an eye on him. And as long as we did that he was very
contented and he felt safe. So in the same way we are given the wonderful
opportunity and practice to sit peacefully under a tree and shade and maybe
even kind of lean against the tree and just be at ease and relaxed. And we can
just stay there as long as we keep an eye on things, as long as we stay alert
and awake. And sometimes all we need to do is to stay there and attend to the
breathing. And maybe even our whole system just appreciates. There's a kind of
profundity about interconnection and inner harmony, inner coming into
balance that can happen around breathing. Breathing is like the nexus of so much
of our psychological, emotional, social, spiritual life that it's quite
something to kind of intimate there with the breathing. But then you know the
child runs off after some wonderful body sensation or difficult body sensation.
And so that's what's going on. And so you just all you have to do is stay there
and you don't have to go do anything. But you have to watch, you have to be
present, see it carefully. And then it goes up, runs after some emotion or some
emotion happens and and so then you can stay and just watch under the tree. But
you have to see it carefully and fully. And then you come back, then it comes
back and sits in your lap, whatever. And then it might be thoughts or it might be
sounds. The idea is the center is the place where you can stay relaxed. But the
role of their relaxed center is to have a certain certain kind of clarity and
openness and availability to see where the child runs off to. To see it clearly.
And that's kind of a description of this practice. If there's something
predominant that takes us away from the breathing, something more compelling than
than the breathing, then we bring our attention to that compelling thing. And
when it's no longer compelling, then if something else is compelling, we do the
next thing. But if nothing else is more compelling than the breathing, we come
back to the breathing. And there's a gentle rhythm, maybe gentle, there's this
kind of rhythm of being with the breathing, going and attending to what
else is happening that's more compelling and then coming back to the breathing.
This is the way I like to teach this mindfulness. Where breathing kind of is
at the center. Breathing maybe is the tree we sit under. Because breathing also
functions as a one, not only a place to develop mindfulness, it's also a place
to develop samadhi, concentration. And the two can be cultivated together as
partners. So, we'll do it. So, assume a posture where you get to be both under
the tree, but you're also, maybe you can become the tree. I don't know what trees
you have in New Zealand, but here in California, we had these redwood trees
that are strong, big, wide, tall, straight, regal.
So, maybe sit like a strong, established, rooted tree, feeling your posture, offering
care to yourself through your posture. And then, perhaps with a sense of care
and attentiveness to yourself, gently take some deeper breaths, feeling the
expansion of the rib cage as you breathe in, and some longer exhales, longer
exhales that you relax with, settle in more deeply into your body. And letting
your breathing return to normal, and continue for a few breaths. Maybe on the
inhale, feel where there's still some holding or tension in your body. And on
the exhale, see if you can relax more, calming the body.
And then maybe the same thing with the mind, with the thinking mind. As you
breathe in, gently feel any tension or pressure, contraction in the thinking
mind. And on the exhale, let there be a calming of the mind, relaxing of the mind.
And then to settle in to the body's experience of breathing, perhaps feeling
the rhythm in the body of breathing in, and breathing out.
Perhaps as you exhale, there's a small ways you could relax the exhales.
Especially at the end of the exhale, in such a way that the exhale continues a
teeny bit longer. Maybe to help you get more intimate
with breathing. For a little while, let there be a very short pause at the end of
the exhale before you inhale. Just long enough so you can feel the body's pull
to breathe in. And as soon as you feel that pull, allow it to happen. Allow the
inhale to move through your body.
And then as you exhale, let there be a very short pause at the end of the exhale.
And then as you exhale, let there be a very short pause at the end of the exhale.
And then as you exhale, let there be a very short pause at the end of the exhale.
And then take a break from noticing the breathing and staying relaxed, maybe
leaning against your tree. Become aware of the strongest sensation in your body.
Maybe nothing's needed from you except to be present for it, to see it.
Nothing needs to be fixed or judged or interpreted. Just an intimate feeling and
sensing, seeing of the body's sensation.
And maybe it's enough to acknowledge it this way and then return to the lap of
your breathing. Re-establishing yourself with body's experience of breathing.
And then as you exhale, let there be a very short pause at the end of the exhale.
And then in a relaxed way, let your attention again take in some sensation of
your body. Maybe without being troubled by it or just all it's needed is to know it, to see it.
Mindful of body sensations. Noticing how you're mindful, what attitudes come
along that might be extra.
And then coming back to the breathing.
And then as you exhale, let there be a very short pause at the end of the exhale.
And then looking out, notice whatever emotion or mood, state of mind,
that's present for you.
Note it. Allow it. Feel it.
If possible, let it be simple. Teasing apart the stories or ideas, judgments you might have.
So the emotion can just float there by itself. As if it has permission to be there.
Left alone while being seen.
And then coming back to the breathing. And if the mood, emotion, state is supportive,
of focusing on the breathing, bring it along. Maybe as if it's a nest or as a warm cuddle
or support. So you breathe with a supportive emotion, breathe through it, nestled by it.
And then as you exhale, let it be simple.
And then when it's time to be mindful of thinking.
Prepare yourself a little bit. Relax. Relax. And then with a little bit more relaxation.
Gaze upon the mind that's thinking. Not so much the content of your thoughts,
but the process and activity of thinking.
Gaze upon the mind.
And when thinking has been acknowledged enough, maybe it's time to begin again with your breathing.
Gaze upon the mind.
And as you're aware of your breathing, how are you aware? What attitudes come along?
Are there simple ways to help the awareness become simple?
Just aware. Just seeing without any efforts to try to make something happen, make something go away.
Just awareness is enough here.
Gaze upon the mind.
Gaze upon the mind.
Gaze upon the mind.
Gaze upon the mind.
Gaze upon the mind.
Gaze upon the mind.
Gaze upon the mind.
Gaze upon the mind.
Gaze upon the mind.
If you take a small, flat stone and drop it into a lake, it'll gradually settle to the bottom of the lake.
On the next exhale, imagine that a small, flat stone is dropped into your body and follow it to the quietest place within.
Deep inside, let that be the place from which you're aware, from which mindfulness arises.
Deep inside, let that be the place from which mindfulness arises.

As you go about your day today, you might notice what it's like to live in each of these worlds.
Notice, maybe after the fact, what it's like to live unaware, unmindful.
And notice how it's different when you're aware, mindful.
Especially if you can be mindful with the awareness that's like resting under the tree, just gazing, just aware.
Maybe it turns out that all our experiences benefit from being seen and known.
May those benefits be yours.
Thank you, and I hope you enjoy your practice.
