 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodorma.org. Welcome to our meditation time and welcome all of us together into this meditation community. Thank you for being here. And to offer thanks for all of us being here in a certain kind of way, I thank myself for being here. It can arise from a deep appreciation of each other, what we're here for, our potential, our goodness. It can be a very profound thing to be grateful. And gratefulness in the heart, at the heart of it, doesn't have to be something that is contrived or something that's obligated or something that we plan and intend to have. It's just a welling up that happens from deep inside, a deep appreciation, a deep valuing and thankfulness. And I say this because desire in Buddhism has often had a negative reputation. And the most extreme version is that desires that cause us suffering and we need to let go of all desires. And this is a misunderstanding of the Buddha's teaching. There are certain desires which are problematic, certain desires which cause a tremendous amount of suffering. And it tends to be the desires that have a lot of attachment, clinging to them, compulsion with them. So that's sometimes called craving, clinging, grasping. There are other kinds of desires that well up from deep inside, that have nothing to do with clinging, craving, grasping, nothing to do with obligation, nothing to do with logically kind of putting things together and constructing a desire to have. And one word for that that I like is aspiration. Partly I like the word aspiration because it's related to the English word respiration. And so to aspire, aspiration kind of means to breathe out. When the breathing is most easy, when we have an easeful breath, then what is the heart's deepest wish? What's the deepest source of desire? What do we most want when we're most quiet, when we're most contented, most satisfied? We're not afraid. We're taken care of, we're settled. There's no biological needs. There's maybe no social needs at the moment. And things are just settled and taken care of in a certain way or been put aside. What is the heart's deepest wish? The aspiration. And it's from that place that the dharma practice, the intention to practice dharma can be. It's that place where compassion can arise from. And that is to be respected, that is to be loved, can be loved, it is loved, it is delighted, it comes from some kind of profundity and beauty. And that supports meditation practice, that if you can sit quietly and calmly enough to hear the quiet voice or the quiet impulse of the heart's deepest kind of aspiration, free of clinging, free of need, free of compensation, and feel the heart's desire for freedom, the heart's desire for real presence, the heart's desire to be awake, to be aware, to be here. And let that be the motivation for practice. To let that be kind of the support that kind of parts the waters of distractions, parts the waters of preoccupation and fantasy and thoughts. So we stay on course, we stay right here, present. So assuming a meditation posture, and gently closing your eyes, and then taking a few deeper breaths, and as you breathe in to prepare yourself in the inhale, to let go on the exhale, to release and relax the body. And sometimes it's possible to relax more deeply if we hold our breath just for two, three seconds, maybe first hold it at the top of the inhale, top of the exhale, and then the end of the exhale. Hold the breath a little bit, and feel your body, and then this, like almost like a space has been created to let the body relax more. By holding your breath for two or three seconds, you might also feel the gentle wish of the body to breathe in, to breathe out, that you can give in to, allow to happen. And to let your breathing return to normal, and continue for a few moments to relax deeply, the face, the shoulders, the belly. And almost as if with your awareness you can reach inside to touch the deepest place inside of you that you know. To gently reach in, touch that depth, and let it relax, soften the deepest place within. And in whatever deepest place that's accessible to you, can you find there the aspiration, the wish that motivates your meditation practice? Maybe there's even a physical embodied association, sensation, with that wish, that motivation. And then having the impulse to be present, to be mindful, rooted, settled in your aspiration, arising from your aspiration, that keeps you steady, the breathing, the mindfulness, as if you're gently parting the waters of distraction and thought, anything that takes you away, is gently falls away, or evaporates away with the strength and warmth of your aspiration to practice. Silence. Mindfulness supported by a deep aspiration, a deep sense of importance and purpose.AMBHA Dear friend-in- school and me is the foundation, aspiration instead of distraction. This is the foundation, aspiration instead of distraction. This is the foundation, aspiration instead of distraction. And this is the foundation, aspiration instead of distraction. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, to relax deeply again, a few rounds of breathing and relaxing, and maybe there's a way of taking a breath in and out of the way. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, we're going to take a breath in and out of the way. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, a way of a deeper relaxation in the heart of your being. Relaxing any way you're bracing yourself or leaning ahead of yourself, and letting the attention drop deep inside. What is your deepest Dharma wish? What's your deepest wish related to meditation, to mindfulness, to Buddhist practice? And there might not be a conceptual answer. It might be, the answer might be more in a feeling or a sensation. Something that brings along a yes. Yes, this is right, this is good. And from whatever depth of aspiration that you know you can have, take in the suffering of the world, but take it in not as your own. Take it in as something that you will hold or care for, or not put it in your heart so that it hurts. But put it in the softness of your hands, of your awareness. Here, let me hold the suffering of the world for a little bit. Not taking it on, not having to do anything about it, to just welcome it here into the softness of a cup of tans or cup tans of awareness. And gazing upon the suffering of the world, is there that deep place of aspiration, of care, kindness? Is there that, is there kindness, care, compassion, a deep wish? May the suffering of the world be alleviated. May this suffering that I witness and know, may beings be free of it. And may I, in maybe my small way, may I contribute to that. So that together as a community, as a global community, the whole world, may all of us contribute to the welfare and happiness of each other. May all of us, may all of us hold each other tenderly, so there's space for the heart's deepest wish of care. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free. The hope of the world. Thank you.
