Hello, friends. Hello and welcome to...
Two wires being overlapped. Okay, here I... Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, whatever time zone you're in.
Lovely to be with you in this moment in time, in this day.
And as we bring this week of exploring karma together, this important, profound teaching of karma, not as something intellectual as something to be afraid of, something unknown, magical, weird, strange,
but something, a teaching that can empower us right here, right now in our lives.
The way we live, the way we show up, the way we serve, the way this being is in this world. So as an empowerment, karma as an empowerment.
So without further ado, let's sit together.
I have some reflections prepared, of course, for later, for the dharma.
So I'd like to invite you to land, to arrive in your posture.
Here, here.
This moment of intention.
Intending, gently intending, doesn't have to be heavy as a hammer.
Maybe a gentle turning towards peace, towards awareness, towards stillness, towards kindness.
Ah, the action of the body, mind, and heart to release, to release and let go.
To arrive here, wakefully.
To arrive here, wakefully.
To arrive here, wakefully.
And landing, the releasing, of the holding in the mind.
Releasing, you're releasing, landing here.
Releasing any tension in the body, any holdness in the body.
Inhabiting, this moment in time, fully, expansively.
With an expanse of heart.
Releasing any tension in the body, any holdness in the body.
Just here, trusting, trusting that if we are intending,
inclining our hearts or minds to awareness, the kindness in this moment and meeting whatever arises.
With awareness, kindness, peace, acceptance.
In the future moments, whatever they hold, future moments become present moments.
Trusting in this capacity to meet them too in the same way.
Releasing, sowing seeds of trust through this moment of awareness.
In the future moments, whatever they hold.
In the future moments, whatever they hold.
In the future moments, whatever they hold.
In the future moments, whatever they hold.
In the future moments, whatever they hold.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
Peace, inclining to peace, the body, releasing the mind, the heart releasing, letting go, inclining to peace.
Here, a knowing peace.
Tasting, even if for just one moment.
Letting go.
Tasting peace in this moment here.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
Your seeds are replanting in this moment, in this moment, right here.
Wake up.
What are you planting right now?
Becoming aware, choosing to plant wholesome seeds.
It's that simple.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
In the future moments.
If you find the mind lost in thoughts, or engaged in thoughts, emotions, contracted in ways that are not helpful.
Become aware, become kindly aware.
Not resistently, not grudgingly, but kindly aware.
Release, release.
What's not profitable in this life.
For you, for others, in this moment.
It was a thought of ill will perhaps, judgment towards yourself, towards others.
Maybe let there be a thought of kindness.
Planting a seed of kindness intentionally, with intention.
Kindness, forgiveness, generosity for yourself or others.
For the world.
Releasing, releasing, giving.
Planting wholesome karma, both in the way you become aware.
Not with aversion, but with kindness.
In the action of the mind.
That then follows into peace, into goodwill.
New awareness, presence here, here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And as we bring this sit to a close together,
let there be a moment of appreciation, planting the seed of gratitude, appreciation for yourself.
For the sangha, for the opportunity to come together and to practice whatever arose or did not arise in these 30 minutes.
You have showed up, you've done your best.
Let there be kindness.
Appreciation.
For the goodness that has been created, has been co-created.
With generosity offering, sharing, that merit, that goodness.
With all beings everywhere.
All that we do, our life, is not for us to keep any goodness of it.
It's an act of service, it's an act of goodness.
To be shared, others.
So offering this practice to this act of goodness, may it be a support for all beings everywhere.
And cultivating goodness, kindness, freedom for myself and all beings everywhere.
May all beings be free, including myself.
Thank you for your practice.
Thank you.
