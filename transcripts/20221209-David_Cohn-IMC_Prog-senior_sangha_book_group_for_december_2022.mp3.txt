So we're here to, this week, we're talking about presence or awareness.
And this is really central.
This is it.
This is the foundation of all of our practices.
It's appropriate that it comes toward the end of the book.
Awareness is with us all the time.
It's just that we don't recognize it.
That's the only, the only issue.
It's always here.
Like space, like if I say the word space, you recognize space.
If I say the word consciousness or awareness, you recognize awareness.
And this concept that everything is awareness is so vitally important.
It's such a vitally important point.
What we see, we couldn't see it without awareness.
Some kind of, I don't know what happens in sight, some kind of light or some vibrations
or something come into the eye consciousness.
And then it gets translated into a computer, a table, you.
But it's in awareness, hearing is in awareness, touch is in awareness, taste is in awareness,
thoughts rise and dissolve into awareness, emotions rise and dissolve into awareness.
Everything actually dissolves into awareness.
Whatever you were thinking a second ago has dissolved into awareness.
And that's such a key point that it dissolves.
What does it dissolve into?
Where did that sound go?
So the essence of awareness is this emptiness.
And the emptiness is always with us, is always such a support to just allow things to come
and go, everything that's happening.
This is particularly helpful with challenging emotions.
If we think of challenging emotions not going to go away, that it's me, that it's permanent,
that it's singular, that it's fixed, then it might take it a while.
It'll dissolve anyhow, but it might take it a while to dissolve.
But if we have confidence of this view that there is this awareness that includes, that
is everything and that it's empty and everything arises and dissolves into this awareness, then
we can, it's very freeing, very liberating, like a little block of salt water.
If it's put into a small cup, it stays very salty for a long time, but if that little
block of salt water is put into the ocean, you can hardly tell that it's there.
There's this center for healthy minds and they've identified awareness as one of the
four qualities of well-being.
And the other qualities are just mainly qualities of awareness.
Awareness is a foundational quality for well-being.
What grows out of awareness, what the qualities of awareness that emerge are this open compassion
and love and gratitude and generosity and wisdom and value.
All the pillars of well-being are founded in awareness, are awareness, they're such
well-being in this open expanse of just being.
So let's just try this for a few minutes and some meditation.
So relaxed into a comfortably upright posture.
And maybe take a deep breath or two and relax.
And as I've mentioned before, sometimes the clarity of awareness, the openness of awareness
is more visible at the end of the exhale.
So if you want to linger there for a moment or two at the end of the exhale, you may experience
some more naked awareness.
I'm going to put on my earphones because I think there's some background noise if you
write that.
So just being completely at ease, you don't have to do anything to be aware.
It's just here.
Being aware of the body, aware of the feet, the calves, the thighs.
This calms the mind, clarifies awareness, aware of the hips, the straightness of your
strong back, aware of the rise and fall of the breath, relaxing the shoulders and aware
of any tension in the shoulders, aware of the arms, upper arms, lower arms and hands,
aware of the throat, the back of the neck, the back of the head, the top of the head,
aware of the forehead, relaxing the forehead and the brain behind the forehead, relaxing
all the muscles in the face, the jaw and letting awareness expand without any effort, just
letting it be in its own vast, spacious nature, aware of space all around us, 360 degrees,
unlimited space, and recognizing all of these sensations
are in awareness, rising into awareness and dissolving into awareness.
We don't feel one sensation very long.
Feeling with sounds, the momentary nature of sounds, in awareness, whatever you're feeling,
maybe it seems like a feeling remains for a while, but a small, intimate permutations
of that feeling, change, there is no self here.
There's just awareness, awareness of images, thoughts, words in the mind that aren't me,
so we don't have to really do anything.
We don't really have to focus, just keep returning, gently returning to awareness.
We don't even have to meditate, just don't get lost, and if you're lost, you're already
back because you've become aware that you're lost, it's so simple that we don't believe
it, too simple, too easy that we don't see it, and it's so profound.
We can't really, we can't grasp the profundity, it's so profound, it's everything, and it's
so good, it's so full of love and compassion, wisdom, every sensory perception, everything
that we can't accept it, so relax and just, without any effort at all, the mind will wander
off, and you're already back when you see that, and that's our practice, returning to
awareness, this skill that we learn as meditators, this skill to bring us back to well-being,
back to wholeness, back to unity, back to freedom.
Maybe we don't have to do something to become enlightened, we don't have to work hard for
some enlightenment in the future.
Allowing everything to dissolve, it'll dissolve anyhow, just recognizing that.
It's freedom.
It's freedom.
When the mind wanders off, it's still an awareness, it's just not recognizing it.
Those thoughts are just part of awareness, manifestations like waves in the ocean, rippling
waves, tsunamis, or all water, all returning to water, coming from water.
Arising from the vastness.
Arising into the vastness.
Okay, thank you.
When you slowly open your eyes, and look around with some kind of warmth, maybe a window, look
out your window with some warmth, like it's for the first time, some freedom, some appreciation
for what's here.
So presence, awareness is always here, we just need to recognize it.
And some of the questions that I entered are about this recognition.
But first of all, we want to hear what you have written down or what you have underlined.
We want to discuss what your insights and inspirations were from the chapter.
And also, I entered some questions as backups for discussion, but I don't think you can
see them.
Can you in the chat?
Can anybody see those?
No.
Okay.
Well, I think people, enough of you have them written down, you can use them if it's needed.
So how about we just go into some breakout rooms?
Let's see, there are four, 17 of us, groups of three or four, maybe five groups would
be nice, tell you what, I'm going to break you into, I've got a set up for six rooms,
so I'll break you up into six rooms and then I might jiggle things around a little bit.
So if you get, if you suddenly vanish from one room and pop into another room, don't
be alarmed.
Okay, so let's see, I'm a little screwed up here, I hope I don't mess this up, I'm not
a pro at these things.
If I lose you all, can you just come back right away, just come back, all right, see
what happens here.
Okay, didn't, that's okay, good.
Okay, I think this is working out pretty well, one of your groups does not have, you know,
one of our traditional leaders, so that will be Helena and Joyce and Mike, so if you could
maybe run it yourself, figure it out.
Okay, okay, here we go, have a good time, have a good talk.
Hello.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So there's one other group.
Eve or Gabrielle, do you want to.
We were talking about this being present coming into the presence that it is in all religions.
And, and then what I was thinking about what actually when I was younger kept me away from it was too much dogma, like in churches.
It was like, there was too much preaching and rules that I didn't really notice that one can go into presence and, and that that's really the main point of our religions to experience the presence and so.
And I also became also to me like, maybe also the times in which we live right now there is more available of this higher consciousness of that there are a lot of teachers that were not around in like 2030 40 years ago.
And one can find also more over the internet these days like we meet now too.
So a shift in consciousness, I think on, on maybe this whole word plane that we are on has occurred somehow it is more available to go into presence than it used to be like let's say 40 years ago.
So, in a way that is a real gift that it is like you were saying in the beginning David said it is simple.
Yeah, but the mind will say that it is too, too simple to drop into presence, drop back into the breath into really being here.
We distract ourselves and go over the stories in the mind, rather than allowing ourselves to just drop into it.
There's an analogy.
It's a land of gold and there are no rocks in the land of gold.
I didn't do that very well, but something like that and he reminded me when you said that this land of gold is always here.
This treasure is always here. Just have to recognize it.
How is that for you recognizing awareness? Is that something that seems pretty, you know, that you do that?
Anybody have us, anybody not have a sense of being aware?
I think we all have that.
You know, cognitively having this view, knowing this view that everything is awareness, even if we don't experience that, even if that's not part of what we experience.
Just cognitively taking that in and believing that's true just through your rational mind is great.
It's just a big step forward and then gradually it can become more and more part of our experience, particularly in meditation.
And then in meditation, we can experience that. You're just coming back to that, coming back to that.
Not being, you know, coming out of distraction in our stories and returning.
Just returning over and over. That's why they call it in this healthy mind's innovations, this center for healthy minds.
Actually started with the Dalai Lama. They call this a skill. It's actually a skill of well-being, a skill that can be developed.
Our brains, our plastic, our brains, even at our age can really grow, can really shift, can develop.
Okay, well, let's have a break and maybe come back at about, say, well, maybe 12, 15.
And then we'll hear some beautiful words from our heart of awareness, Fiona.
Thank you.
I'll be for a few minutes and sense our bodies being back in our chair or bed or wherever you are, floor, cushion.
Sense the warmth and contact of this living, breathing body back in our space together.
Relaxing the mind, relaxing the stimulation from our break or past conversation.
Thoughts that arose in response to conversations just.
Deep sigh out, let it go. Relax.
Very simple, just sensing, resting, acknowledging awareness right here.
Maybe one deeper breath.
Sort of say yes, breath in and out and we can be back together.
Open your eyes and just see, yes, we're here.
I'm reading the chapter this time and someone else in the sharing.
I can't remember now if it was in our small group or in the larger group.
So Gil's teaching this week on the seven o'clock, meditations and dharmats, so beautifully meshed with this chapter for me too.
Gil used this beautiful, a new set of teachings I hadn't heard that put together of gladness, joy, tranquility, happiness and samadhi.
Underlying these beautiful qualities is encouraging in our practice to relax and open and even lower the bar of expectation around all of these beautiful qualities because it allows us to just open to the present moment, however it is.
However we are showing up.
And this chapter with the author talking about being present as opposed to being lost in thought, ruminations, story.
And I felt with Gil's teaching too, there's this choice.
There's a sense of confidence that beneath the story there is some deeper truth and clarity and deep peace to keep choosing to turn our attention to that.
At the same time to hold what is arising in our small group, there was this quote in the book.
I'm going to just so I don't misquote her where we place our attention literally creates the world in which we live and our experience of existence.
Lost in pain, we live in the universe of suffering.
Witnessing pain, we live in the universe permeated by compassion.
Witnessing I read as awareness as opposed to just lost and not being aware or being aware of awareness.
Not maybe as we go back into our groups and share to go to these two prompts that David basically is how to practice being aware of awareness and what is outside of our story of the cushion.
How can we cultivate make this choice to really be open to this presence or awareness in our life?
How can we encourage that and also what hijacks us and to be aware of that as well so that we can make choices.
So we don't get lost.
So that's my encouragement for our time together and we can have a good 25 minutes together maybe.
And then when I got older, all that has changed some of it by choice and some of it by circumstance.
And so the kind of busy work trance that I spent decades fully embracing and thinking that was the real stuff.
Life has seen fit to kind of toss me out of the canoe into the cold water.
So it's interesting to me that I don't know that I'm doing these kind of graceful Greg Luganas strokes or something in the water.
It's kind of more of a frantic dog paddling.
At least I feel like I'm awake and realize that I've got an opportunity to learn in this whole new environment which life is kind of a blessing that's been provided even if it isn't always particularly comfortable.
Thank you. That's beautiful, Greg.
That's an example of someone who's not a facilitator stepping forward and saying it, speaking from the heart, which is oftentimes difficult to condense other people's sharing.
And so I encourage others of us to, when so moved, to just share with a large group.
It takes a little bit of the heat off the facilitators and also it's really wonderful to hear individuals speak their own words.
So thank you. Thanks, Greg.
Thank you. Thank you, MR, for saying this too.
Does anyone else wish to share?
Well, I don't recall where I came across this just recently, the last few days.
But it was something in regards to aging, but it was the great gift and blessing of aging.
Now, how to hold that in the cold water and not with a beautiful stroke but dog paddling, but seeing it as the blessing, you know, the blessing that we are here.
I thought maybe it just as an ending, I received a poem today from another senior group.
And I think it fits in with our discussion about, you know, this life and being present for and making a choice to be present.
So the poem is called Allow and it's by, the poet is Donna Fault.
There is no controlling life, try corralling a lightning bolt containing a tornado, dam a stream and it will create a new channel, resist and the tide will sweep you off your feet.
Allow and grace will carry you to higher ground.
The only safety lies in letting it all in.
The wild and the weak, fear, fantasies, failures and success.
When loss rips off the doors of the heart, or sadness fails your vision with despair, practice becomes simply bearing the truth.
In the choice to let go of your known way of being, the whole world is revealed to your new eyes.
Let's just be quiet for a few minutes.
So thank you all for your presence here, for however your practice is on the cushion at the grocery store, wherever.
Just thank you.
And here will be David.
Thank you.
It may just end with this opening our compassionate hearts and sharing the benefit of our group, the benefit of our practice with all beings everywhere.
This heart of compassion is a quality, a blossoming of awareness, awareness that we're connected to everyone.
So may all beings everywhere be happy. May all beings everywhere be free to suffering and abide in a joy that knows no sorrow.
May all beings everywhere live in an equanimity that is not grasping at or aversive to, just poised in awareness.
Thank you all.
Thanks all for coming.
Thanks for your participation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
