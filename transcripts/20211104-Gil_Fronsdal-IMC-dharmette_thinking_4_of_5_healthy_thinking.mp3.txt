 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So we continue with the topic of mindfulness of thinking. Today the topic is restoration. What I mean by that is the restoring of a healthy way of being. That the ways that clinging and attachment and fear and the resistance inhibit the natural healthy functioning of our psychophysical being. So, as we kind of no longer are carrying the burden of our attachments, carrying the burden of our responsibilities, we can still have response abilities, but to be weighed down by them. To be able to shed a lot of the attachments that we have in preoccupations is a way to allow a healthy functioning. And so meditation operates, for some people, a little bit like a, you know, if you're dirty, you take a shower and you're clean. And so meditation is a way of cleansing the mind, the spirit, the heart. So how does this relate to thinking? There can be a restoration of healthy thinking, or thinking which is beneficial, thinking which is light, clear, easy. And so one of the steps towards that is, as I've talked about, is to respect thinking. But here's a way of looking at it, is that everything that we are is made up of parts. And so thinking is made up of parts. It's part emotions, part physical tensions, part motivations, part memories and our associations. And sometimes thoughts are motivational, they're trying to get something done. Sometimes they're simply very relaxed memories or relaxed, pleasant anticipations. So all kinds of, there's relaxed reflections. As we begin respecting the different component parts of the complex of thinking, it's possible to recognize there's tension, there's heaviness, there's tightness, contraction. And that's our contribution to it. There's a way in which we're involved or identified or present some attachment we have. Independent of whether it's appropriate to be thinking of whatever you're thinking about, the weight, the contraction, the tightness is not necessary. In fact, we usually think much better, more creatively, more efficiently, if there is no tension, if there is no tightness and heaviness and preoccupation. And so to begin letting go and allowing thinking to be free of our reactivity to them, our caughtness in them, allows the thinking to operate, to be restored to a kind of healthiness, to think without fear, to think without hate, to think without desire, wanting something. It's maybe unimaginable because those are so much part and parcel of our thinking. To have thinking occur but not have it glued to our sense of self, me, myself and mine, my opinions, my stories. It's really remarkable how much thinking from some of us that we're somehow a central character in our thoughts, one way or the other. And as we become lighter and freer with thinking, the thoughts don't have us at the center of them anymore. And so thoughts just float up. And one of the remarkable things that can happen in meditation, if you meditate long enough or deep enough, is that with time, thinking is not so heavy and thick. It's not so solid. Sometimes when we're really caught up in something, thinking can be the most solid thing in the universe. So dense, so serious, so important, so much energy behind it. And when the content of the thoughts are negative, negative about ourselves, negative about the world, the heaviness and the contraction around the thoughts can be quite debilitating. They say that one of the leading causes of depression is rumination, just kind of churning away with the same kind of thoughts over and over again that are negative, negative self-talk. So to begin to put that to rest, to not identify with them, not be involved in it. And there might still be unfortunate kinds of thinking going on. But because we're not locked, latched onto it or reactive to it or taking it so seriously, we're just sitting on the boulder in the river and just laying the water right run by, not identifying with it. Over time, the thinking becomes thinner and thinner, lighter and lighter. And it's a remarkable process by which thinking has its lightness to it. It's like a thin, thin veil maybe, or it's like clouds drifting across an open sky. Clouds have no weight, almost. Thoughts have no weight. In of themselves, they're very, very light. They don't interfere with anything like a cloud, kind of doesn't interfere with anything. You just put your hand in a cloud and your hand goes right through. So the thoughts feel like they're getting thinner and thinner, lighter and lighter, more and more relaxed. And there's kind of a feeling of them floating through, floating by. And at this point, some people find that their thinking becomes creative. I certainly found that when I meditate a fair amount, generally outside of meditation, my thinking is very easy and relaxed and creative and more likely to write poetry when I have this kind of very light, thin thinking going on. I'm also more likely to think about things more clearly. I often will find that after I've meditated in the morning, that I go back to some thing I'm trying to figure out or do, or write or something, and there's much more clarity and ease, I think, that's coming out. It's almost like the forcefulness, the trying really hard to think or do something, interferes with this natural creativity, intelligence that exists within us. So one of the possibilities with mindfulness of thinking is to understand the territory of thinking, the ecology of thinking, to recognize the different component parts of it and understand which parts we don't have to be involved in, which parts we can let go of. It might not be letting go of thoughts themselves. It might be letting go of all the tension associated with them. Or it might be that maybe there's certain motivations connected to those thoughts, which are not something, if you realize what the motivations are, you say, I don't need that. You can let go of the motivations, what you're trying to do with the thoughts. Or it could be that there's a lot of physical tension connected to thinking, and so you let go of that, you relax that. And maybe the emotions that are connected need real attention. That's what needs your love and your care and your presence. So by recognizing the component parts, then we start separating that away. It becomes easier to look at thinking right in the eye and just see it. And it's fascinating to do that. Sometimes when we do that, thinking just fades away, partly because thinking continues through time by our feeding it. And if we're just watching it, then we're not feeding it, and then it kind of dissipates. But then what's interesting is when it dissipates and we're relaxed, at some point, maybe after meditation, if you stay relaxed, don't rush back into the thoughts and concerns of the day, that there's this restoration of a healthy way of thinking. And healthy, wholesome, useful. There's a way of being deeply relaxed and at peace. We have a reference point for what health is, what being healthy is. And it's not healthy to start getting preoccupied again, or to get caught again in the preoccupation concerns of the day. We do have concerns. We do have things to take care of. But the wonderful thing to discover is we take care of them better. If we're not tight, if we're not rushing, if we're not pushing, we're not barreling ahead. We can get up out of meditation, some of us, and be like, okay, got to get to work. And that attitude, then, is it kind of leaning then into thinking, leaning, getting involved in thinking, or the thinking itself gets revved up. And maybe it's not necessary. Maybe there's a way of trusting that healthy way of being with thoughts, where they're light and soft and gentle maybe, or just kind of not weighty and not pushing us. That we have a sense, oh, that's healthy. That's what's useful. So here restoration means restoration of kind of a healthy thinking. And to have the ability to know what that is. And the more at ease, the more peaceful, the more relaxed you can become in meditation, the more you'll discover this reference point of a peaceful, a healthy way to be with the world of thinking. We don't have to only let go of thoughts. There are times when it's completely appropriate to be thinking, and even wonderful to be thinking. Thinking can be a gift. You can be friends with your thoughts. But you can be friends relating to the thoughts in a very healthy way. The thoughts themselves can just feel healthy. It's actually possible to have thoughts which feel nourishing, that feel supportive, that feel onward leading to greater peace. So, thank you. We have one more day on thinking. And then tomorrow I'll talk a little bit about the plan for next week and kind of how to continue the series. So, may you today discover something new about healthy thinking. Thank you.
