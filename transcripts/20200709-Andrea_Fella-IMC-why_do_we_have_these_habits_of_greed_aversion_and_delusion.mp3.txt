Question comes out of kind of when we start to see through mindfulness, through our practice, we start to see how painful greed, aversion, and delusion are, and how they affect our own experience and affect our relationships with others. 
The question came up in one of my meetings, well, why do we have these habits of greed, aversion, and delusion in the first place? Why would we evolve this way? What's going on there? The short answer to this question, the one word answer to this question, is delusion is what's going on. 
But I'm going to expand a little bit on that. 
It does make sense as we start to see with mindfulness, as we start to look at our experience and recognize that when greed arises it's painful, when aversion arises it's painful, and that the whole patterning there is kind of just reinforcing those. 
It makes sense to question their value. 
And that's part of how mindfulness works, actually. 
We see the pain of these experiences and start to question their values, start to look at are there other ways to relate, but as to where they come from in the first place. 
Partly I'll start with how or why they continue, and it's because we're not seeing that they're painful. 
The kind of conditioning that we get where these patterns have come from in the first place has been our conditioning. 
It's been our conditioning of our own life, the ways that we've been, our own experience in life, that when we get something that we want, we get a little bit of like it feels good. 
When we get rid of something that we don't want, that we don't want in our lives, or that's painful, something that's creating stress when we get rid of that, there's a moment that it feels good. 
And so we get that learning experience, and it conditions that's the way to be happy. 
That's how I can feel okay if I control my environment to get what I want and get rid of what I don't want. 
And so our own experience teaches us this, but our own experience is a little bit short-sighted because the kind of happiness that we get from that, it's pretty fleeting. 
It lasts for a little while. 
If we're lucky, it lasts as long as a few days or a week or so, or periodically for every now and then for a couple months maybe, but mostly it's pretty fleeting. 
It's not a reliable place of happiness that we get what we want or get rid of what we don't want. 
Because ultimately that just puts us onto the path of trying to get rid of more things or get more things in order to find happiness, which would again still be a fleeting kind of happiness. 
And yet our own experience doesn't really point out anything other than the kind of happiness that we get from getting what we want or getting what we don't want. 
It took really the Buddha, the Buddha's mind, the kind of the exploration of like, well, is this it? Is there a way to get out of this cycle or this trap of being caught in this pattern of going after things and then being disappointed when they end or they vanish? The Buddha recognizing the impermanent nature of experience, which is part of the reason why this strategy is not very helpful and it's not a very satisfying strategy. 
It's not a very reliable strategy because of the impermanent nature of experience. 
We get what we want for a moment. 
We have that happiness for a few moments. 
We have that sense of, I've got this thing. 
I've controlled experience. 
I know how to control experience. 
I'm okay. 
And then impermanence takes its course and we become separated from that thing or something else happens and we lose interest in it or whatever. 
I mean, there's many different ways that we see or learn that that strategy is not reliable in terms of a lasting happiness. 
But there's not much else that is shown to us in terms of what a reliable happiness would be. 
And so we kind of just keep doing that because it gives us some measure of happiness. 
It gives us a little bit of a sense of okayness. 
And so we're taught by our own experience and not only that by the conditioning of our culture, of our families that this is the way to happiness. 
Getting what I want, getting rid of what I don't want. 
We get this message not only from our own experience but from our families, our friends, the advertisements on the internet. 
We get it from everywhere because it takes a rare mind to understand that there actually may be a different way towards happiness. 
So all of these factors, all these conditioning factors of our own life and how we've experienced things and how we've been trained by our family, by advertisements, by our friends, by our culture. 
All of these forces together are strong and moving us in the direction of not seeing that this strategy is not a very reliable one. 
And so that's one level of why we have these patterns in the first place. 
And yet at a deeper level, we have these patterns too because we're human beings and we've evolved from animals and single-celled organisms all the way up through animals and the evolutionary nature of our biology also seems to give us this movement towards things that we like and away from things that we don't like. 
Even a single-celled creature will move towards nourishment and away from a noxious environment, towards pleasant and away from unpleasant. 
As systems evolve in our system, as we evolved, my understanding is that the way that humans are, we still have that kind of tension or that kind of movement towards getting what we want, getting what we don't want, partly to support and nourish our bodies to protect our bodies from harm. 
So that's evolutionarily advantageous to do that. 
I'm not an evolutionary biologist and this is really hand-waving in many ways. 
But there is that kind of movement in our system. 
But as I understand it, even though in evolution, like the single-celled creature doesn't have a lot of choice about its conditioning, it's not going to look at something and think, that situation looks a little dangerous, but if I go through that dangerous situation, then on the other side of it, there will be or maybe something that I can flourish in. 
That's the kind of thing that our human minds can do. 
We can make trade-offs and look at a variety of conditions because we have a kind of a modeling system in our minds. 
We can model the outcome of our choices. 
We can look at what's happening in our experience, learn from our past experience and model what might happen in the future. 
And so while we do have this evolutionary kind of penchant towards moving in the direction of pleasant and moving away from unpleasant, we seem to have a kind of a modeling system in between us and the pleasant and unpleasant. 
Unlike the amoeba, which is just kind of right in the soup of it and is going to move towards pleasant and away from unpleasant. 
So we have this modeling system between us and the pleasant and unpleasant that can look at the situation and make determinations about it, make decisions about it. 
So the moment of that kind of modeling system happens in the present moment. 
And that's where we can start to see where there may be a different choice, a different opportunity. 
So our evolutionary biology gives us this proclivity towards this moving towards unpleasant, moving away from what's unpleasant. 
But there's a moment in our experience in the present moment that mindfulness gives us access to and we have evolved mindfulness as well as this penchant towards what's pleasant and unpleasant. 
We've evolved this capacity to look at what's going on in the present moment to actually see this modeling taking place. 
This is what happens in our minds when we look at a situation and think, I know that kind of experience. 
This is the kind of thing that would happen if I'd act this way or this is the kind of thing that would happen if I'd act this way. 
We can see that happening in our minds. 
And so in the present moment, there's this like small window of a place where we can see consequences. 
We can see what's going to unfold. 
So much of the time, I'd say, we simply follow our conditioning. 
Many animals don't have much choice in this. 
They follow their conditioning. 
These habits of greed, aversion, and delusion are very deeply conditioned into us, not only through our culture but also through our evolution, very deeply conditioned in us. 
And if we are not aware in the present moment, that conditioning is going to unfold and we're just going to perpetuate that cycle. 
And there's a way in which we kind of know it's not so satisfying. 
You know, at least as we get to certain times in life, some of us like, maybe this is what the midlife crisis is about, kind of realizing that, yeah, I've spent my life getting what I want, getting rid of what I don't want, and is this all there is? Is this what there is to life? So there's a way in which we can kind of see that the strategy that we've been working with, you know, I hit this at about 35 or so, you know, it's like, this just is not working. 
What am I doing wrong in life? And I wasn't doing anything, you know, particularly really wrong. 
It was that I didn't know. 
It's like delusion was running the show, the habits, the patterns, the ways that I'd been trained, the conditioning that I had been given, was what I was living, what I was living out. 
And I didn't really have a way to see anything else until I met the teachings of Buddhism, until I met the teachings around mindfulness and beginning to look at my present moment experience. 
So fortunately, as I said a minute ago, human evolution has also given us mindfulness, which what happens when we bring our mindful attention to the present moment, and we see greed arising, and we see aversion arising. 
The very first time I saw anger arising. 
I mean, it wasn't really that surprising, but it was kind of like it really just hit me over the head. 
It's like, wow, this hurts. 
You know, I thought somehow, you know, it's like in that very first moment, there was some wisdom that came that there was this deluded belief that somehow this anger was doing something for me when actually what it was doing was making me feel pain. 
So the mindfulness begins to give us the, in that small window, mindfulness begins to give us this education about what the actual experience is in the moment when greed is arising in the mind, when aversion is arising in the mind. 
And to bring delusion into it, mostly been talking about greed and aversion, you know, right within greed and aversion, the delusion embedded in those is that acting on this greed, or acting on this aversion, will lead to happiness. 
That it's, you know, and not just a fleeting happiness. 
That's not what greed and aversion believe. 
The delusion and greed and aversion believe that they are the way to a lasting happiness. 
If you look in your mind when greed is operating, that is what it's telling you. 
You have to follow me, otherwise you're not going to be okay. 
Likewise with aversion, it's telling you that. 
It's got this deluded view inside of it. 
There are deeper ways that a delusion manifests too, not necessarily as greed or aversion, and one of the big ones is not self. 
So we'll get into that in the coming weeks. 
So human evolution has given us mindfulness, and we can see as these states arise that they are painful. 
We feel when anger is arising, when even irritation or annoyance is arising. 
We feel the tension of it. 
We feel the constriction in this moment. 
And so the very moment of experiencing the rising of aversion or greed, there's a quality of painfulness. 
And then the consequences of that often are also painful. 
So acting out on anger, for instance. 
How many of us have acted out on that, said something out of anger, and then regretted it, hurting our actions, hurting someone else. 
And so we see that not only is this anger or the greed and the aversion painful internally, it can lead to consequences that are painful externally for ourselves and for others. 
So that's part of the learning. 
And it's actually a great thing that mindfulness shows this. 
It's not a mistake that we feel the pain of greed and aversion when we become mindful of it. 
It's not our fault that it feels painful. 
It's the mind giving itself an education. 
It's learning that this strategy is not helpful. 
And so what happens then? I talked about this modeling that happens in the present moment as we start a situation, you know, move into something and we make choices. 
Many of those choices that we make, the choices that we make are motivated by something. 
They're motivated often. 
If we're not mindful in the moment, they're motivated by our prior conditioning, which means often that they're motivated by greed, aversion and delusion. 
Sometimes after we've been practicing for a while, we're lucky. 
And even when we're not mindful, our actions are motivated out of kindness and generosity because we've been conditioning those or wisdom. 
So it's not just that this conditioning takes us in the direction of the unwholesome. 
If the mind is conditioned in the direction of the wholesome, that conditioning can also play out. 
So as we see, with mindfulness in the present moment, we see what's happening, the choices that we're making, and we've got, as I said, we have this modeling kind of capacity in our mind. 
This happens. 
We don't have to do this. 
This is part of how we are as human beings, that as we make a situation arises, our mind looks at it, looks at the past experience that we've had, and then weighs the options of choices that are available, models possible outcomes of that. 
We do this consciously sometimes, but this is also happening just very quickly in our system. 
Ways these outcomes, and based on past experiences, decides which would be the most favorable outcome for us. 
Having had the experience of the arising of aversion, the arising of greed being painful, through mindfulness, as we see these choices play out, we have mindfulness in this moment, this like small window I talked about. 
We have a small window of opportunity to make a different, choose a different direction than our conditioning is leading us in. 
So in that window of opportunity, when we have experienced the arising of aversion or the arising of greed as painful, that information becomes available and becomes part of this modeling process. 
It becomes part of how and why we choose to do what we do. 
And in that moment when the mind understands that the choice to act out of greed or aversion will lead to painful consequences, it supports the mind starting to abandon that direction. 
It doesn't necessarily happen immediately. 
Sometimes we have to see it multiple times. 
It's like our minds have to say, well, it didn't work in that situation, but maybe it will in this one. 
Maybe this situation, the greed will really work this time. 
Or maybe this time the greed won't lead to that tension. 
It's like we have to get to know it multiple times, many times sometimes. 
But it doesn't actually take as long as it might seem. 
I've seen in my own experience within a few weeks of observing something how a pattern can dramatically shift. 
Just because it's seen in the present moment and just because the mind sees the kind of the choice, kind of the movement in the direction of like, yeah, let's get angry at that person. 
And the mind going, oh no, we know we're that way. 
I don't think so. 
Just choosing something else. 
So these habits of greed, aversion and delusion are deeply, deeply conditioned. 
Evolution has made those very strong in us. 
Our conditioning within our own lives have made that strong. 
But fortunately, we also have mindfulness and we have had the benefit of hearing the teachings of the Buddha, who has pointed out this power of the present moment awareness. 
And what starts feeling like this little tiny window of a place to look at something and make a different choice, we realize that that little tiny window is the entirety of our experience. 
This is the only place we're living in the present moment. 
And when we live there, it's vast. 
The present moment is vast. 
It no longer seems like this little tiny thing that we have to look really closely at. 
But that does take some momentum of mindfulness to move us into having more continuity, more capacity to be present moment after moment after moment. 
That too is also deeply conditioned that we are not habitually in the present moment. 
But it is possible because not only does the learning point out to us the pain of the greed and aversion when we start to see what's happening in the present moment, that learning also points out to us the benefit of mindfulness and how when we see something with mindfulness, I was like a shock to me that the first few times I could see, oh, there's anger rising and I'm seeing it and there was joy. 
So we also start to see the skillful. 
The learning also takes us in the direction of cultivating and supporting and relying on being more confident in states that are not based in greed, aversion and delusion, but states that are based in generosity and love and wisdom, kindness, patience, mindfulness. 
So we have a couple minutes. 
It's not a lot of time for comments or questions. 
But if anybody has any thoughts, I'd be happy to hear them. 
And you're welcome to unmute yourselves. 
Let's see. 
I don't see an unmute. 
I muted a couple of you earlier because your things were. 
But let's try to unmute. 
You can try to unmute yourselves. 
I have unmute yourselves on if you'd like to speak. 
You can type into the chat box.
