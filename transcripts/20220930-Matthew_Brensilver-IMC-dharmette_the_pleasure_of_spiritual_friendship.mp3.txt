 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDharma.org. Okay. So, Dharma, Dharma Pleasures. We could have chose from many, many, but began with the pleasure of having a path, the pleasure of sourcing motivation from love, purification, the pleasure of purification, the pleasure of tranquility, of turning the dial down. And today, the pleasure of friendship. The colleague of mine, Giselle Jones, who's a couple, who does a lot of couples therapy. She's a clinical social worker. She defines intimacy, and then she comes as a guest speaker in this UCLA undergraduate class for for mindfulness practice of science of mindfulness, and comes in each each quarter, and to give a lecture to the undergrads and and defines intimacy in that context as the willingness and the ability to see and be seen. The willingness and the ability to see and be seen. And I, I believe that we, we need to be seen at our best and our worst. We need to be seen at our best and our worst. If we're only known in our strength, we might become arrogant or defensive. And if we're only known in our pain, we might become deflated. So, it feels important to be seen clearly, lovingly in both our strength and, and our desperation. There are, there are primary relationships, mostly family kind of relationships where, where my defilements are known with such exquisite detail, you know, you know those relationships. So there are, there are several people in my life who could give a topographically precise map of my imperfection. Very precise. And it actually feels great to be known in that way. Yeah. Like if you aren't, it feels like you're hiding that hurts. And so to be known in one's imperfection feels vital. But we also need to be known in our beauty. And sometimes loved ones do this, of course, but sometimes they're too close to see, or sometimes they may not know exactly what to look for. And so we have Kali Anamita, spiritual friends. And spiritual friends have, have many roles in our life, but one of them, one of them is to see the most beautiful parts in us. That's part of the role of Sangha. We say Sangha, this community of spiritual friends. Now that does not mean that a spiritual friend is ignorant about our neurosis, but their attention, their attention is directed to goodness. Their attention is directed to goodness and there's, there's much pleasure in abiding with others in goodness. The poet, Kunal said, sometimes it's necessary to reteach a thing, it's loveliness. And that's part of the function of spiritual friends. To illuminate goodness, we become sensitized to goodness, we start to see it everywhere. And, and our goodness is recognized. The intimacy of the ability, willingness to see and be seen. We, we need good friends because we're so, we're so porous, you know, and we're way more suggestible than we think we have this sense of like, come kind of an island and or something like that even if we think of ourselves as very relational. Now we think these are my views. I'm Matthew, Eric, Brent Silver and this is what I believe, you know, this is why I believe that. Please, who knows who knows where our ideas come from all the places that shape the view, shape the nature of the fabrication, shape the way the confabulation of our life. We, we just take on the tone of what's around us. And so I walk into a fancy store, and I start believing in wealth. I walk into a party with fancy people, and I start believing in power. And we need places where we believe in wisdom, and love. We, in other words, must be continually reminded of our goodness. And this, all this Dharma stuff sometimes seems so self evident to us in a moment of peace or clarity, so self evident. It's very inside baseball. Yeah, it's very peculiar and idiosyncratic and against the stream and fringe. I was driving through California from the Bay Area down down through Southern California through Bakersfield and into to retreat at Big Bear in the mountains, and so many cities and towns and landscape so particular and it was intense you know I felt like, just in seeing, seeing, it felt like I could kind of infer something about the mind states based on the geography and the buildings and everything. And I did not see the Dharma in many places it looked like it would be very hard to sustain Dharma attention. And that's not that person's that place is fault, but it's intense. Yeah. And so maybe we have conditions that remind us of Dharma that reconnect us to the necessity of wisdom of love. And we need our friends to keep reminding us of the urgency of that project. And our, our practice is, you know, Dharma practice sometimes talk about is like okay it's making our heart into something like art. And, you know, I don't know much about art, an art connoisseur, like, sees something sees a painting say, and they know so much about it. They see they literally see more than I do. But we're connoisseurs of goodness. Yeah, that's what we're training in, and start to see a lot of beauty and others. Yeah, they see beauty in us. And it's, it's a delight to revere the same thing, something in the heart is quenched. As we come to revere the same things. And teaching, teaching this week, teaching, anytime teaching is, is entirely about your goodness resonating with my sense of, of mutual recognition. And sense of, of a kind of abiding, abiding. And I don't want to, you know, in the practice of teaching, I don't, don't care about being loved but I do care about being seen. And to the extent that we, we, we see and are seen together, that is a beautiful thing. And come to abide in the kind of the goodness of our intention here to practice. And that's, that's a very nourishing. That's good. Dharma, pleasure, soul's wholesome pleasure. We're doing it right now. So, yeah, thank you. Thank you all. Appreciate. Appreciate your, your wholehearted participation this week. Thank you for being. Yeah, being patient with me. And, yeah, it's been been lovely to be with you. So I, I wish, I wish you all, all well.
