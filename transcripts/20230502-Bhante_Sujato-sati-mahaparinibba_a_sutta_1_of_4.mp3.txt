 The following talk was given at the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at sati.org. Thank you so much for that very kind introduction Rob and I'm coming to you here from Harris Park which is on the land of the Barramaritical people of the Darug Nation in eastern Sydney and so as is the custom in Australia we pay respects to the elders past present and emerging and we acknowledge their unseeded custodianship of the land upon which I sit and just for a bit of background for those of you who are not aware that Australia is one of the few colonized countries where there is no treaty or arrangement with indigenous people whatsoever and they're not acknowledged in our Constitution. We are trying to change that and there is a movement this year called the Uluru Statement from the Heart which is intended to provide acknowledgement for Aboriginal people Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people within our Constitution and to give them an advisory voice in our federal government and so if you're interested to do to look at that just google the Uluru Statement from the Heart and I've been one of the Buddhist representatives who have been supporting that movement. Wonderful to be here and just glancing and some of our old friends older than ever in fact Ayatollah Kha, Venables from the Aranyabodhi, Susan Pembroke, how you going Susan, Wegin and a number of others who've crossed paths within this strange journey along the Dhamma Highway. Oh and some closer to home as well Ayasuvira, good to see you here and okay. Is there anyone here who does not have any familiarity with the suttas and if this is your initiation into the suttas if you were if you are as it were sort of virgins then please put a notify or put your hand up on zoom or something like that just so I can double check because I don't want to leave anyone behind okay so I'm just checking we can leave a comment in the chat okay it looks like most people have some kind of background good so for the next four weeks we're going to be discussing the Maha Parinibhana Sutta and Maha Parinibhana Sutta is of course the narrative of the end of the Buddha's life his final journey towards his his Parinibhana. We are right now in the month of May which is the month of Wesak which is celebrated by the Buddhist community as the birth awakening and death of the Buddha. I come here as a historical scholar to harsh your buzz and to let you know that unfortunately the Buddha didn't actually die in May and the evidence of the Maha Parinibhana Sutta suggests rather that he died probably in December or January so sorry about that but in any case as we know we celebrate it as a symbolic day. I'm going to be reading from my translation of the Maha Parinibhana Sutta which is available on Suddha Central. Let me just pop the link into the chat if anyone doesn't have it and that link I just sent you has the notes available so these will give you some annotations which I've recently started doing as a project for the suttas to sort of explain my translations and hopefully give some clarity and some historical background to what's going on with the suttas. I'll also be reading from this. Nice isn't it? So this is a book and sort of Central has you remember these things don't you? It's like from the before there were like fax machines and so on all the gray hairs here you'll remember what a book was so this is paper and on paper we use ink and we print words just like on a screen it's amazing and so Suddha Central has recently started publishing Translations as Books. We'll be rolling this feature out gradually over time and so you can order these from Suddha Central website and they're nice and I always think and I think many studies support that that for if you want to read meaningfully and you want to read in depth then paper is always the best medium and screens are great for looking something up or doing a bit of research or something but if you want to really sit with a Suddha contemplatively then nothing beats paper so so that's that. All right let's begin. So I'm going to start by beginning a short part reading a short passage from the Suddha and then we can discuss that and see how far we go. So I have heard at one time the Buddha was staying near Rajagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain. Now at that time King Ajatasattu where there he put a Magadha wanted to have invade the vajis he declared I shall wipe out these vajis so mighty and powerful I shall destroy them and lay ruin and devastation upon them and then King Ajatasattu addressed Vasakara the Brahman minister of Magadha please Brahman go to the Buddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably and then say sir King Ajatasattu where there he put a of Magadha wants to invade the vajis he says I shall wipe out these vajis so mighty and powerful I shall destroy them and lay ruin and devastation upon them remember well how the Buddha answers and tell it to me so that realized ones say nothing that is not so alright so this is the introduction to the Maha Parin Nipana Sutta now quite dramatic alright it's a pretty dramatic opening now compared to most sorta openings you know at one time the Buddha was staying in Savatthi and then he spoke to the monks pretty pretty mundane stuff here we begin with this highly charged opening and a lot of assumed knowledge and assumed historical knowledge and context behind that open so this already lets us know a number of the features of the Maha Parin Nipana Sutta one feature is that it was composed by a very careful and intelligent literary mind alright this is how this is how you engage someone in a narrative you begin with something dramatic something something that creates attention that requires a resolution of course there's attention here in the historical sense what did a jata sattu do did he in fact made the vajis but there's also a narrative tension in it raises the question how is Buddha going to respond to this kind of thing so immediately we're propelled into a narrative in a way that is very unusual in Buddhist early Buddhist literature most suttas don't propel you into a narrative like that at all some do but it's fairly rare and so this immediately prompts the question what's going on why is it formed like this who is behind it and what significance does this have for the wider themes of the Maha Parin Nipana Sutta now Maha Parin Nipana Sutta is obviously very long it's about as long as a short novel and I won't even attempt to read or discuss all of the teachings in there what I will try to do in this short series of talks is to introduce a few perspectives highlight a few passages and try to give some kind of richness to a background and a context to help to understand what's going on a bit with a bit more depth and a bit more color now we can look at Maha Parin Nipana Sutta from a number of perspectives we can look at it purely as a piece of history as a journalistic account a diary if you will of the Buddha's last days he went to this place did this and went to that place and did that and so on leading up to the time of his death we can also see it as a compilation of Dhamma teachings because within that at different places the Buddha was giving different kinds of teachings and so it tell it first of all gives us a summary of those teachings but it also suggests what were the things that were most important for the Buddha to convey in his final days and so this is giving us some doctrinal content to the teaching now in addition to that we also can look at this from a literary perspective and as I already suggested the sutta has quite a sophisticated literary hand behind it there is somebody who's guiding for example the sequence of events what we call the gutty of events what comes after another and what is that propels the narrative which then leads us to the next perspective which we have which is a very interesting and I think possibly unique really perspective within the early suttas which is the the subtext the authorial subtext within this entire narrative the Buddha is accompanied by Venerable Ananda and we know from Buddhist tradition that Venerable Ananda was the leading monk who helped to assemble the scriptures after the Buddha died put them together organize them and set the Sanghara to continue the legacy of the Buddha but at the same time Ananda is a character in the narrative I think the authorial hand here the person who decided for example let's begin the narrative of the end of the Buddha's life with this incredibly dramatic statement by King Ajatasattu the person who made those kinds of decisions and put it together in this kind of way I believe was Venerable Ananda and I think that in the days after the passing of his great master he devoted himself to creating this narrative as a way of ensuring the legacy and long-lasting of his master that is of course not to say that every detail in the sutta was you know exactly historical it's not to say that every detail was composed by an Ananda personally there are significant differences between the different versions and the the multiple you know versions and intertextuality of Maha Paani Bala Sutta is actually incredibly complex I won't delve into it very much so clearly it was under development for a period of time but I think primary text was put together by Venerable Ananda and so that means that when we see him he's telling his own story together with his own vulnerabilities and own fears which are encoded in the narrative in ways either quite subtly or quite in some cases quite openly all right so so these are some perspectives that we can bring to the text another perspective that we can bring to the text is the vast intertextuality of this particular narrative there is a whole cycle of suttas which I call the Maha Paani Bala cycle that draws on this sutta that tells related events sometimes is extracted from this sutta and expanded and which relates to this particular text in all kinds of ways and one of the things that that means is that there's actually like a huge chunk of Buddhist literature early Buddhist literature that stems from these last days of the Buddha's life not just the Maha Paani Bala but many other suttas often themselves quite complex and significant again I won't I won't delve too much into this but just to sort of remark in passing that we are dealing with this complex intertextual situation all right so to come back to the opening passage a dasattu of magadha wants to attack the vajis what's going on here well let me introduce you the characters that we've heard about so far so if we've heard of King Ajnata Sattu son of Bingvi Sara one of the great kings of that era he had been previously corrupted by Devadatta seduced into killing his own father and the narrative of his confession of that crime is told in the second sutta of the Dighanikaya the Samanaya Palasutta here must be sometime after the Samanaya Palasutta not that long after a few years maybe and it seems that even though he had repented from the cry his crime of patricide well he was still a bit of a character and his conversion to Buddhism was perhaps not as complete as we might have liked it to be so he wants to invade the vajians why does he want to invade the vajians well sutta doesn't tell us the commentary tells us that it originated from a trade dispute about controlling the the trade on the Ganges River so magadha had a sattu's empire bounded the Ganges on the north while the vajis bounded the Ganges the Ganges bounded them on the south side so that they shared some ports and some transit points and it seems that it was a dispute over one of those that led to a jata sattu wanting to invade the vajis regardless of the details of that specific thing the general idea is surely true that a jata sattu and the magadan empire wanted to control the Ganges and to control the trade routes along the Ganges I don't know if any of you saw in the news recently the last few days a few people have been reporting finding a Buddha image in Egypt did anybody see that come up in the news few people know anyway so they found a Buddha image in Egypt dated from about maybe third century or so and what we're seeing in Mahabharani bhana sutta is the beginnings of the expansionism that about a hundred years later resulted in the great Marian Empire of Chandragupta who met with and formed an alliance with ultimately Alexander and then opened up the trade routes through to Rome and through to the west so there's a there's a connection between the events we're seeing here in the Mahabharani bhana sutta and that Buddha image which was found in Egypt all those stemming from all those hundreds of years later why was a jata sattu thanks for sharing the link and why was a jata sattu asking for the Buddha's advice interesting question the text doesn't really tell us except it says that the realized ones that are targetters don't say anything that isn't so hmm remember that in the jata sattu's previous encounter with the Buddha he confessed his crime of murdering his father now this is a very kind of touchy moment I mean when a king confesses something to you especially when confesses a violent crime like that I mean it's it's dodgy right what do you exactly say it's not exactly you have to be very careful about the words that you choose and when that happened the Buddha was very straightforward with a jata sattu he agreed with him yes you did this it was a great crime and he didn't try to sort of negate it he didn't try to say oh yes yes yes well you were the great king or he didn't try to butter him up or anything like that he was very straightforward and he acknowledged yes this is the crime that you did and now let us try to move on and I believe that it is a jata sattu's experience of that time that showed him that the Buddha was somebody that he could rely on to give him honest feedback that that's what he says to targetters don't say anything that is not true we know that it is one of the great traps for a king or a dictator or an autocrat or really any leader when they stop listening to people and when they think when their advisors or the people around them are too scared to give them honest advice and I think that a jata sattu for all his flaws was aware of this and was aware that perhaps his own advisors would not be giving him honest advice and so he wanted to seek some feedback from the Buddha that's my reading on that anyway now this is the story that initiates the journey towards the end of the Buddha's life but there is something more to it as well because in a wider sense it's not just the end of the Buddha it's the end of the world that the Buddha had known and in this period of time we see around you know say a decade before or after this we see conflict erupting between the Vajjians and the Magadins as we see here a little bit earlier there'd been a war between the Co salons and the Magadins there's a war between the Co salons and the Sakyans there's another war between the Sakyans and the Kholians there's a war between the Malians and the Co salons it's probably quicker to list the people who weren't fighting each other than it is to list all the people who were fighting each other so during the most of the Buddha's lifetime there was a fair it was fairly peaceful during that during that fairly stable during that in that region of northern India and clearly that piece was breaking down and there were economic and social factors which were underlying this and so that that all that entire world that we see depicted in the suttas and if you read the suttas you see all the Buddha was in Co salons who was at Sarvati and he traveled to here and all of those all of those different nations and different peoples were gone and when we when we go through the Mahaparin Ibanasutta and we see of the Vajian Republic we see the Madhian Republic we see the different people and all of those things all of those different republics were gone within a few decades of the Buddha's passing away everything was changed and the entirety of the northern India became dominated by a single empire what that means for the Buddhists of that time is that they were faced with this great gaping abyss of uncertainty not just the uncertainty of the Buddha's passing away but the uncertainty of what is life going to be like is this the ending of the world I mean when you see the dissolution of a particular social order it is not at all assured that there's going to be another social order that comes afterwards sometimes the social order disappears and nothing comes everything falls apart into chaos madness that can happen and we know from our perspective that the Buddhist community not only survived but thrived and received the patronage of King Ashoka and others but they didn't and so this undled current of fear about what's going to happen to them what's going to happen to the Buddhist community what's going to happen to the Dhamma this informs the entire through line of the narrative of the Mahaparin Ibanasutta all right very good well I should mention by the way that if you anyone who has some questions we'll have time for some questions a bit later but meanwhile if you do want to pop questions into the chat I have the chat open here so if you have questions as we go along please do pop them into there all right all right continued yes service Kara aunt replied he had the finest carriages harnessed then he mounted a fine carriage along with other fine carriages set up from Rajagaha for the vultures peak mountain he went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached the Buddha on foot and exchanged greetings with him when the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha master gotama King Ajatasattu where there he put her magadha bows with his head to your feet he asks if you're healthy and nimble strong and living comfortably master gotama King Ajatasattu wants to invade the vajis he has declared I shall wipe out these vajis and so mighty and powerful I shall destroy them and they ruin and devastation upon them just a quick note here on the form of a dress when was a car refers to addresses the Buddha he refers to him as ascetic as master gotama Boho gotama which is a respectful but not reverential term of address and I think that was a car was kind of a follower of the Buddha at the time but not necessarily a really committed follower just yet also just to mention there's been some question incentives discussion about the word gotama which is a bit of an unusual term of address because it's a brother the Buddha was a kshatriya an aristocrat and gotama is the name of a Brahmanical lineage and there's been a degree of speculation and discussion about why the Buddha is referred to with a Brahmanical clan name and it seems that the reason why that is so is because it was the custom that when a ruler from an aristocratic clan was anointed that they took the name of their Brahmanical family chaplain the perojita and during the ceremony of anointing the their status as a katiya was suspended and they temporarily became a Brahman in the lineage of their perojita and then afterwards they would continue to be referred to by that name so the Sakyans had a family priest the lineage of the family priest was in that gotama clan we'll see later on that some of the other katiya clans were likewise referred to by a Brahmanical names like Agyvesana or Vaseta so that's just a little by the by bit of historical context there right moving along now that time Venerable Ananda was standing behind the Buddha fanning him and the Buddha said to him Ananda have you heard that the vajis meet frequently and have many meetings all right so I'm sure most of you are familiar with Venerable Ananda he was the younger cousin of the Buddha and yes IIT puts in there that the Buddha's likewise referred to as Angirasa another Brahmanical name and Angirasa as well as Okaka refer to the the King the royal lineage and the solar lineage Angirasa is a is a is a kind of a solar name it evokes the the radiance of the Sun but it's interesting but what one of the reasons that's interesting is because the time of the Buddha was also the time of the Brahmanis a form of that part of India so most of northern India had been Brahminized and we can see in this sutta that a jata satu has a Brahman minister who's advising him it seems that Sakyans also had that Brahmanical ministers who are advising them but the process of Brahmanization was still ongoing especially towards the south yeah that's correct the Angirasa was one of the seven rishis yeah if you're interested IIT or others have a look at the notes that I did on D and 14 where I go into some of those backgrounds to some detail anyway moving on right so Ananda was the Buddha's cousin younger cousin probably about 20 or 30 years younger than him and he went forth some years after the Buddha had already gone forth and then from the time that he went forth he rapidly became the Buddha's primary attendant and carer as we see in the Mahapayani Bhana sutta others also as we see in Mahapayani Buddha did play that role as well and under wasn't exclusively but Ananda was certainly the closest one to the Buddha Melanie I love your friend Wow very good doggo okay excellent moving along so Ananda was a complex character because he had this kind of gentleness and devotion to the Buddha so he exemplified this kind of more kind of vulnerable emotional character who nonetheless had a highly acute intellect and so he he was often the one who would like like be be bringing people together or had that kind of voice or that way of communicating that was reconciling and bringing communities together again as we see in the sutta itself anyway so Ananda says have you heard that the bhaji meet frequently and have many meetings I have heard that sir as long as the veggies meet frequently and have many meetings they can expect growth not decline have you heard that the budget meet in harmony live in harmony and carry on their business in harmony I have heard that serve as long as they do so they can expect to growth and not decline have you heard that the budget don't make new decrees or abolish existing decrees but proceed having undertaken the traditional Vajjian principles as they have been decreed. I have heard that, sir, as long as they don't make new decrees or abolish existing decrees but proceed having undertaken the traditional Vajjian principles, they can expect growth. Have you heard that the Vajjis honour, respect, esteem and venerate Vajjian elders and think them worth listening to? I have heard that, sir. As long as they researchers and theCHagen force them to live with them they can expect growth. not decline. Have you heard that the Vadgians honour, respect, esteem and venerate the Vadgians shrines, whether in or out, not neglecting the proper spirit offerings that were given and made in the past? I have heard that as long as they do so they can expect growth and not decline. Have you heard that the Vadgis organised proper protection, shelter and security for perfected ones so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort? I have heard that as long as they organise proper shelter, protection and security, then they can expect growth, not decline. Then the Buddha said to Vasakara, Brahman, this one time I was staying near Vasali at the Sarandada woodland shrine. There I taught the Vadgis these seven principles that prevent decline. As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the Vadgis and as long as the Vadgis are seen following them, they can expect growth, not decline. When the Buddha had spoken, Vasakara said to him, Master Gautama, if the Vadgis follow even a single one of these principles, they can expect growth and not decline. How much more so are all seven? Actually, I'm just going to check the online translation because I think I've changed the next bit. If even a single one of these principles say can expect growth and not decline, how much more so are all seven? King Ajatasattu cannot defeat the Vadgis in war unless by bribery or by sowing dissension. Well now, Master Gautama, I must go. I have many duties and much to do. Please, Brahman, go at your convenience. Then Vasakara, the Brahman, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left. All right, so these are the seven principles of non-decline. The Buddha then goes on to teach seven similar principles of non-decline for the monks, which I will go on to in just a minute. But first of all, let me just go back over those seven and briefly discuss what is going on here. First thing is that the Vadgians were what you might describe as an aristocratic republic. So they were governed by the councils of the leading clans within the republic. It wasn't a full democracy in the sense of having universal enfranchisement, but the leading clans would elect a raja, a ruler, or a council of rulers for a period of time. So it was a kind of a semi-democratic system. And so this is what it refers to when it talks about meeting frequently. And in fact, we'll encounter some examples of that as we go along. Now, these meetings that the Buddha is referring to here were basically town hall meetings. And I know that there's still a strong culture of that in the US as there is in Australia. That part of the life of a democracy is that people should get together and talk about things. And if we're going to be making decisions as a community, then we need a level of commitment and involvement from the people who are part of that community who are going to sacrifice some of their time to go and have boring meetings where nobody really likes going and having meetings. But it is a part of what makes a country or a spiritual community possible. And I think that's really important for all of us to bear in mind, whether it's in terms of our local neighborhood or if it's in terms of our spiritual community and our local temples, local Buddhist centers, retreat centers, meditation centers, to show up and to be a voice and to help to support that process. And it doesn't have to be that you only show up when you want something. It can be just you show up because you want to support the process and you think it's better that we live in a place where this happens than to live in a place where it doesn't happen. And of course, in terms of government, like local state government and so on as well, to be able to participate in this process. We have a number of kind of accounts of what happens in those meetings, and they would discuss various kinds of business and so on and so forth. And so this was very much a major feature of the life, especially of the aristocratic republics in those days. But an important part of the meeting is not just that the meetings happen, but also that the meetings were carried out in harmony. And I'm sure, as we're all aware, that that is always the case. And sometimes you go to these meetings and everyone just yells at each other and everyone's like you've got that you come here with your and all of your anger and all of your hate. And you have to like blur it out of people. And so this is not really productive. And when this happens so often, then it makes us feel disenfranchised, makes us feel disenchanted with even the thought of taking part in a meeting like that. And so if we want good people to come to these kinds of meetings and to actually play a role in their civic society, it's critical that those that civic society be carried out in a manner that is civil and kind and polite and which honors and respects the voices of the people who have come to attend. This thing is also very important. So this is why I say that, you know, it's not even so important that, you know, you're advocating for a certain position to come to a meeting, you know, it's even more valuable in some cases to come along and not know what your position is, but just to be able to listen and to just be a quiet presence there. Okay, so the next one is an interesting one. It says that the Vajayas shouldn't make new decrees or abolish existing decrees. Now the word for decree here, the Pali word is panyata, what has been laid down. And how we interpret this, it's not more obvious. I mean, does it mean that the Vajayans can't make new laws? Right? Seems a bit weird, right? I mean, why do you meet if you can't legislate? I mean, they're a government, they should be able to make new laws. Like what does it actually mean by these decrees? What I think it means is that the decrees are something a bit like a constitution. Elsewhere in the suttas, it talks about the ancient principles or the ancient rules of the Brahmins would have with the idea that there were a set of principles and ideals upon which that life should be led. Now the Vajyan republic had been founded some centuries earlier, not a huge amount of time, maybe one or two centuries before the time of the Buddha, as a union of smaller republics of different clans in the area. And so you had to unite these different families and these different clans with these different ideals, different values, different traditions, and to be able to somehow get everybody to work together on a common process for a common outcome. And it was pretty successful in doing that. It became a very, very important thing. It became highly economically prosperous and lasted for quite a few hundred years. So it was very successful at doing that. And what I think that these Vajyan principles it's referring to is the underlying principles upon which the republic was formed, namely such principles as getting together and having meetings and the various other principles that's referred to in these in these lists. So it doesn't mean that the Vajyans couldn't make new laws or couldn't respond to new kinds of situations, but it did mean that they didn't arbitrarily abandon those principles which informed the creation of their republic. And so I think that's something which is good and that's something which most nations today still respect, that we respect our constitutions and we don't sort of arbitrarily sort of throw it out and change it on a whim. In Australia, as I said, we are looking towards a fairly rare constitutional amendment later in the year. In Australia, the way it works is to make a constitutional amendment. You have to have a majority of people in a majority of states plus a majority of states plus a majority in both houses of parliament, something like that. It's a bit complicated, but the point is that you need to be sort of very careful before you can make this kind of change. Okay, so that's what I think. And of course, this is a regarded as analogy with what happens with the Sangha. Okay, moving on. Have you heard the Vajyans honour, respect, esteem and venerate the Vajyans elders and think them words listening to? Another interesting one, one word that is not found there is obey or follow their orders. It's that they should listen to them, listen to what the elders say and they should treat elders with respect. I think this also is quite interesting, isn't it? There's quite a fine line here between, yes, elders should be listened to, they should be respected, but our elders, should we always have to obey elders? Should we always have to do what they tell us? Not so obvious. And that kind of fine line also we find in the monastic veneer as well, that the senior monastics like myself or like IIT, regarded as people who in a meeting of the Sangha group is a Sangha. You know, we've been around for a while, we've seen some things, some things that you people wouldn't believe happening. And so our advice is regarded as something which should be listened to, but at the same time within the Sangha itself, we don't like have a power of decree, we don't have a power to, you know, command the Sangha or whatever, and if the Sangha decides a decision that goes against what we want, then that's okay, that's just how it goes sometimes. All right, so again, the next one, I think I've changed my translation a little bit, but the idea is basically the same, that the vajuins don't forcibly abduct the women or girls of the clans and make them live with them. So here, obviously, is an explicit injunction against sexual violence and for the protection of women. And I think it's really remarkable that the Buddha regarded the protection for women against violence as being one of the foundational principles of the establishment of a republic, and one of the foundational principles that allowed that republic to continue. And of course, we know that today, women are still subject to violence in many and harrowing ways. And that one of the signs of what we would really consider to be a civilized government is that it provides for adequate protection and consideration for the rights of women, and for the protection of women against domestic violence. And this, of course, is still violence, domestic violence and other forms of violence as well. And this is still an ongoing situation. And we have seen many changes in our own lifetimes for good or for bad. I think that we have sometimes a sense of conceit in our modern world that we think that we've made progress or we're more aware of these issues. And that in the past, people often say, you know, if there's news about somebody, you know, some bloke who's, you know, groped a woman or done something inappropriate, and then they're like, oh, yeah, that was the 80s, that was a different time. Or, you know, I don't know, I mean, I was a student in the 80s, and I can tell you that that was not okay then. And these kinds of excuses as if it's only in the last 10 years that we've suddenly realized that women are subject to violence and need to be the protection and need to be listened to. We can see in the Buddhist scriptures that this was very much the case, even two and a half thousand years ago. There is a rule in the vinaya for the monks called the Anayata rule. And the Anayata rule essentially says that if a trustworthy laywoman makes an accusation of sexual misconduct against a monk, that the monk should be investigated, and that they should be treated according to the accusation by the woman herself. And so this is an explicit and very clear injunction in the original vinaya that women should be listened to and women should be believed. And it's the only case in the vinaya where the voice of somebody else can outweigh the voice of the monk himself. So again, as we know that these things are still very much current issues, and of course there's a rape trial going on at the moment where the former president is being very credibly accused of rape. And these questions are still so important for us. So I think one thing to bear in mind with the suttas, excuse me, my road's coming off, with the suttas is that we can't expect, you know, two and a half thousand year old texts to answer all our problems for us. And we can't expect them to, you know, deal with all of the issues that we're going to be facing today. Obviously it was a different time, but we can look for principles, for precedents and for ideas. And when we see something like this, then we have to acknowledge that it is very significant. Okay, okay, very good. So I.T. has commented here that in one of the old Pali text chronicles from Sri Lanka, it was said that as one of the characteristics of the early Buddhist tradition, that a woman could walk alone from one end of the island to another without fear or danger. Yeah, very nice. Thanks. I wasn't aware of that. Which chronicle was that in? Do you know, was that the Deepa Wankasa? Because they think the Deepa Wankasa was written by Bhikkhunis, right? It seems to be the consensus. Seems like it. Yeah, it seems like. Okay, anyway, thank you so much for that. All right. Moving on just a little bit. Okay. You're right. So the vajyans were steaming the vajin shrines. Another interesting one, right? Making the proper spirit offerings. It's an interesting, interesting addition here. Now, you know, the Buddha, of course, wasn't an animist. He didn't believe that by making offerings to shrines, that therefore, whatever, you're going to go to heaven or what, you know, something like that. At the same time, though, the Buddha always endorsed and practiced a positive relationship with the spirits, or even with the beliefs and the customs and religious practices that were around him at the time. And he didn't have that kind of like acidic reductionism that we see today in some kinds of secularist and modernist approaches, whether it's like, oh, that's all just rubbish. I'll just throw all that away. I think the Buddha cultivated a positive and healthy relationship with the different kinds of spirituality that were happening at the time. Not, however, an uncritical relationship. Obviously, if we're talking about animal sacrifice, human sacrifice, and practices that were extreme or harmful, then the Buddha rejected those things. But if it was a matter of offering a bit of rice to a tree shrine or something like that, then the Buddha didn't see any harm with that. And if you believe in the spirits and in, I'm looking at the great redwood trees behind Ayatthaya Loka. I'm not sure if they're real ones or they're just a background. But if you believe that those trees have a power to them and that there are beings who live in those trees, then probably a good idea to be on the good side of those beings. But on another level, what this is talking about is about maintaining connections with the world around us, whether it's people's beliefs, people's customs, with nature, with the trees, and all of those things. In the Buddha's time or the, I'm sorry, in some later Indian treaties about how society was to be organized, they said that each village should be associated with three forests. So you should have the wilderness forest, primeval. You should have the Paribhogavana, the extractive forest, where you went for your timber or hunting or whatever. And then you have the Tapoana, the spiritual grove, where you would have the different wandering ascetics and so on would stay. And that sounds, I don't know, that sounds pretty good, right? If all of our villages and towns today had three forests attached to them, I think the world would be a much nicer place. And so this idea that we live in this mutual connective relationship with the environment around us and where the maintenance and care for natural places was a part of our spiritual duty. So the Buddha, when wandering, the Buddha wasn't entirely unselfinterested in making this rule, because when the Buddha and other monks and nuns would wander across India, they would very frequently stay at these woodland shrines. And we see that happening a number of times in the Mahaparni Bhānusutta itself. The Buddha was enlightened at one of these shrines and stayed at them very often. So these would have been places outside the village a little bit. Maybe you find a particularly impressive tree or a particularly impressive grove, and then the villagers would clear some of the ground around that, make it a nice place to visit. They would set up maybe a small shrine there, come offer some ghee, some rice. And often there would be a deity who would be associated with that place, who would be regarded as the protected deity for that realm. And so we see one class of deities in the suttas, deities of place. So this is the, and this of course still happens in Buddhist countries today. If you go to Thailand, you see the little spirit houses outside the front of all the houses, and people will still make those kinds of offerings. So it's IIT says, that is a genuine Arunyabodhi redwood. Nice. The view of the back deck of the freedom kuti. Oh, sorry, that is the photo backdrop. Okay, fine. Okay. So we're seeing the photo backdrop of the real thing. Okay, very good. Well, this is the genuine inside of the Lokanta vihara here that you're getting here. No photo backdrops. All right, very good. So moving along. Okay. And then okay, so that the the vajjins would organize proper protection and shelter for the perfected ones for the Arahants, so that they can come and live in the realm. So again, this is this is referring to the idea that in in that ancient Indian civilization, like the idea of Arahants is a little bit, how do I say this a bit? I mean, we associate that with Buddhism. But generally speaking, I think that it's more, it's meant to be more broad here that they were, they were providing shelter for spiritual seekers, wanderers and practitioners. And so this is regarded as being part of the obligations of civil society in those days. And of course, it still is today here I live in Harris Park. And Harris Park is known as Little India in Sydney. And so when I go for arms round, which I just did just before we did this talk, then we have the all people from different backgrounds in India, the Nepalese and Gujaratis, we have the Sikhs, we have the Muslims, everyone, and they will all give arms. And so I'll take my bowl, I severe as here, she would also take a bowl into Harris Park and go to the different restaurants and so on. And people will give some food. We came down here one day with a friend of ours, who's when I was with a Venerable Akaliko, and one of Akaliko's former buddies came with us. And he'd never seen arms round before. And when he saw that, he saw, you know, he came with us and he saw that all of these different people like were giving and you know, it's like the Hindus would go give and the Muslim greengrocer would give. And he said, he said to us, aren't they aren't they aren't they your competition? Why are they helping you? And we're like, well, we don't really we don't really think of it like that. And so that that's that custom. And it's one of the really lovely things about being here in Harris Park, that I get to be a part of this community. So yes, so King Ajatasattu, Vasukara then remarked that King Ajatasattu cannot beat the virgins in war unless by bribery, or by sowing dissension, mitu bedha. The word the first word there by bribery is a somewhat difficult, a difficult word to translate up a lopana. And the basic meaning of the word sounds like it should mean upa is close lopana is to speak. So sounds like it should be like whispering things in people's ears or sowing dissension, which is how a lot of people have translated it. But in fact, upa lopana is used throughout the suttas in the sense of giving someone something in order to get something that you want from them. In other words, bribery. So that's why I've changed my translation of that term. We know that following this time that the Vajjhian Republic did in fact fall. And we know that Magadha, the empire of King Ajatasattu did in fact swallow them up, as well as swallowing up all of the other, ultimately all of the other places that we read about in the early suttas. That doesn't mean that the Vajjhian model was a failure. And as I said, it lasted for hundreds of years, lasted longer than the Magadhan empire did, at least under the very large scale Magadhan empire. And it was very economically prosperous. And it has set, I think, a model, one of the early models for how democracy can work in running a country. The Buddha didn't openly endorse any particular political model. He worked with both those aristocratic republics, as well as with the absolute monarchies of Khosla and Magadha. But rather than endorsing a particular political model, he tried to encourage whoever was running those different models to do so in line with Dhamma, and do so in line with principle, with the truth, with fairness and with justice. However, even though we don't have an explicit endorsement of a political model by the Buddha, the Buddha then goes on in the next part of this sutta to talk about how to run the Sangha and run the monastic community. And there he's clearly using similar principles that he taught to the Vajjhians. And not to forget that these are also similar principles that he would have learned as a Sakhyan, because the Gita is a very similar Sakhyan, because the government models of the Vajjhians and the Sakhyans were similar. So this was how he was brought up in this republican context. We can also see that what the Buddha does right away after this is he basically picks up his bags and walks north out of the Magadhan kingdom and to the Vajjhian Republic. And I think that this also is a kind of a comment about where the Buddha's sympathies lie. Ultimately, he was to walk through the Vajjhian Republic and to die in the neighbouring Mullin Republic. I wonder, and this is just purely a speculation on my part, but if you go from Magadha to Vajji and from Vajji to Mullah, if you were to keep walking for, I don't know, a few more weeks, you'd end up in the Sakhyan Republic. I can't help but wonder if he was walking home and then didn't quite make it. Anyway, like I said, that's just my speculation. Let's have a look at the Buddha's response to how he adapted those Vajjhian rules for the Buddhist Sangha. And then I'll take some questions if anyone has any more questions. All right, principles that prevent decline among mendicants. So go and under gather all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of Rajagaha together in the assembly hall. Now in that region of Rajagaha, the capital of Magadha, there are a number of different monasteries and a number of different monastic residences. So he's wanting to bring them all together. When they assembled, he taught the seven principles for the Sangha. The Sangha should meet frequently and have many meetings. So this is referring specifically to the upholsteter meeting of the fortnightly recitation of the monastic rules. They should carry on their business in harmony, just like the Vajjhis. And there are a number of different examples of this and a number of rules and procedures, which are aimed at maintaining that harmony and ensuring that even though divisive issues might be talked about in the meeting of the Sangha, that should be done in a spirit of goodwill and good faith. And we should ensure that the issues are resolved satisfactorily before the meeting is finished. Again, the mendicants shouldn't make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but undertake and follow the training rules if they have been decreed. And then they can expect growth and not decline. Obviously similar to the rule for the Vajjhins. But there's even something more significant here, is that this is in a way launching the whole narrative arc of not just the Maha Parni Vāṇasūta, but of the connected narratives of first and the second councils, which follow the Maha Parni Vāṇasūta. So here the Buddha refers to the kāpada, the training rules, which are the padimoka rules for the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. Now how this works is that when you have a naughty monk or a naughty nun and they do something that they shouldn't, then basically somebody goes to the Buddha, complains about it, and the Buddha calls them to him and says, is this true? Did you do this? And if they say it is true, then the Buddha says, okay, you shouldn't do that. Let's make a rule saying that we shouldn't do that after that. These padimoka rules evolve gradually because of actual incidents that happen. Now when, as not infrequently happens, a new case arises that is somewhat different, the Buddha would modify that original rule, sometimes expanding the scope, sometimes restricting the scope of the rule. So the Buddha was quite happy to make those changes to the rules himself. However, the Buddha did not allow the Sangha to make the changes to those rules. And it seems from what's happening here is that those rules would be essentially frozen at the time of the Buddha's death. Now the fact that the letter of the rules is frozen doesn't mean that the vinya, as a text and a practice, was frozen. We know that the vinya pitaka, that is the collection of monastic discipline, evolved and was developed over quite some time after the death of the Buddha, probably two or three hundred years. And if we compare the different vinyas from different traditions, what we see is that overwhelmingly the vinya rules, the sicapada, which is what the Buddha is talking about here, are the same. But the explanations and interpretations of those rules are often different. I mean there are some differences in the rules themselves between the traditions, but they tend to be fairly minor. But the differences in the explanations of those rules, the analysis of them, and all the kind of the detailed applications in different cases and so on, those things tend to be more different. So we can see that what the Buddhist tradition did from the earliest days was that they accepted the text of those rules. But they then within the community that they would have to interpret them and apply them according to different conditions. And so it doesn't mean that there's a rigidity in terms of how you practice and understand the vinya, but it does mean that that practice and understanding happens within the scope of the text as it is passed down or the rules as they are passed down. So these days there's still some discussion on these kinds of things. And people think, oh, should we abolish certain rules or this or that? But that's not really how the tradition works. The tradition works not by changing the rules, but by changing the interpretation and practice of the rules. The next one that the mendicants should honor and esteem the senior mendicants and they think them worth listening to. Again, not necessarily worth obeying, but at least worth listening to. Not too bad as a senior monk. If you get anyone to listen to you, you're not doing too badly. And so then they shouldn't fall under the sway of a risen craving for future lives. All right. So that basically means you're corrupted by worldly desires or these kinds of things. And they should also take care to live in wilderness lodgings. So this is something that the Buddha was very strong about. He strongly believed that the monks and nuns should live in forest and that they should live in seclusion. And he saw a great danger in living in the city. Somebody asked me the other day, are you a forest monk? You come from a forest tradition, but you're living in the city. And I'm like, I guess I'm a temporarily suspended forest monk or I'm a forest monk who got lost on my way to the city or something. I'm not sure. But I'm spending some time here in Sydney and in the back of my mind, you know, I've been a monk for many years now, in the back of my mind, I'm always looking at those redwood trees behind IIT and feeling that sense of longing about getting back to the forest, which I'm sure I'll do at some point. Anyway. Okay. So these are the seven principles of non-decline for the Sangha. There are a number of similar principles. The Buddha goes on to give a number of different sets of seven principles, which I won't go through all in detail. You can read them in the text. Finally, the Buddha wraps up this whole section by giving a at Vulture's Peak, a Dhamma talk to the mendicants. And this teaching is found eight times throughout the Maha-pandubhana Sutta itself, such as ethics, sealer, such is immersion, samadhi, such is wisdom, bhanya. When immersion is imbued with ethics, it's very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is imbued with immersion, it's very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind is imbued with wisdom, it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn and ignorance. When the Buddha had stayed in Rajagaha, as long as he pleased, he addressed Vannanda, Kamannanda. Let's go to Ambalaktika. All right. So I'm going to leave off the reading at that point. And here with this short discourse, we can see the Buddha is summarizing the essential principles of the Dhamma, sealer, samadhi, panya. That exact way of framing that teaching is not found outside of the Maha-pandubhana Sutta, but the basic idea is there. And one of the fundamental things that's being emphasized here is that it's not just the fact that it's sealer, samadhi, panya, ethics, some immersion and wisdom, but that it's these things are imbued with each other, and that these things come together as a great whole. And that is when they're a great fruit and great benefit. These days, there is sometimes a tendency that people will not really want to do that. And people saying, Oh, do you have to keep your precepts before you want to meditate? Right. So you can just take, you know, I can get my meditation app, I can just do a bit of meditation. And, you know, we think of meditation or people think of meditation or mindfulness as a mind hack or something like that, rather than being part of a spiritual and psychological growth. And so people say, Well, you know, can you can you meditate without having sealer? Well, of course you can if you want to, you know, but the Buddha didn't say that is a great fruit and great benefit. Doesn't mean it's not of any fruit and benefit, right, can still be helpful. But the it can be problematic. One one reason it can be problematic is because it can act as a kind of a placebo. It can give you know, give you short term relief for things without addressing the real problems. And by doing so, it can, it can make you ultimately can make people lose faith in the idea of meditation, because they're like, you know, they're doing all of these things that are creating stress or anxiety. And without really looking at the causes for those things, they then go and do some meditation and helps for a little while. But then they come back and they think, oh, meditation is not that good. And so you give it up. And it's not that the meditation doesn't work, it's that it's not being undertaken in that way, that will lead to being very fruitful. And so personally, I think that I think it's okay to cherry pick bits of the Dhamma and to practice bits here and there. The Buddha never said, you know, the Buddha was never absolutist about these things, he always encouraged people to, you know, if you can only practice a little bit of Dhamma, then that's good. And if you want to do a few minutes meditation, or a lot of meditation, without doing other things, that's fine, it's still good to do that meditation. But let's see that as a first step. And then let's say, well, if that's useful, and that's helpful for you, what else might there be in the Dhamma that's also going to be supportive for those things. So that's how I would tend to tend to approach that. All right, very good. Thanks, I, I, I said, come and visit us in the Redwood. Okay, I will, I will bear that in mind. Yeah. I think it's more, it's a bit more civilized now than it was the last time I was there. Is that would that be correct to say that? No. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. But when I went to say to run your body, that was the toughest monastery that I've ever been in. That was hardcore. So, all right, so we have, I think, a little bit of time left. So Rob left a bit open ended when we're going to finish. I do have another event I have to get to this afternoon. So I can't stay on for too long. So but please, if anyone has any questions, please feel free to unmute yourself. I think we can unmute ourselves and speak. Or else I'll just have a look at a couple of questions that are in that are in the in the in the chat. So Dave has asked, I doesn't understand what's meant here by immersion. So immersion is my translation of the Pali word Samadhi. So Samadhi, of course, you'll usually see translated as concentration, which I don't really like as a translation because it suggests a kind of effortfulness. Usually, to me, what concentration means is, you know, you sit at, you're sitting in your class and the teacher yells at you and says, concentrate, which means that you have to sort of make yourself pay attention to something that is inherently boring. Nobody says to you if you're like playing a video game, or if you're watching a great movie, no one says to you, concentrate, right, because you're naturally immersed in that experience, it draws you into that experience. And so you're not being told to concentrate on it. So the idea is that an immersion to be immersed in Samadhi is to be drawn into that experience. So think about, say, you're sitting at home, and you're reading a really good book, and you're, you're immersed in that book, and then, you know, your partner comes home, and they open the door, and you don't even hear them. And they say, oh, hello, and you're startled. Oh, I didn't hear you, because you're so immersed in what you're doing. And so this is where I think this is where I drew that idea of immersion from for Samadhi. Also, because the word Samadhi in Pali is very similar in application to the word Jhana, which we usually translate as absorption. And so immersion and absorption are also kind of along a similar sort of semantic spectrum. Interestingly, both of the words Samadhi and the word Jhana have a dual meaning. And that dual meaning, in both cases, has on the one hand a psychological sense of being concentrated and focused on something. So to Samadhi, in that sense, is to gather or to withdraw, like a tortoise that will gather and draw its limbs inside its shell, so that it's not being attacked by the, by a jackal who's trying to get at it. So that's a Samadhi, as in gathering in. But Samadhi also has a dual meaning, where it means to ignite a flame. And so to kindle a flame is also to Samadhi. And so Jhana also has those two meanings. It means both absorption, focus, concentration, but also the blazing or illumination of a flame. So if we translate, or I translate them as immersion and absorption, but we could also translate them as incandescence and illumination. Those two meanings are both present. Anyway. Good. So just seeing if there are any other questions there. Doesn't look like we've got any questions. Anyone want to drop any more questions in the chat or online? So we have one from Victoria. Victoria, how's it going, Victoria? Yes, hello. I'm very new to everything, so I hope you won't take this question amiss if it may be a sign of my ignorance. I was wondering with this kind of ceremonial greeting, because it seemed to me it could be almost like meta phrases, the nimble and living comfortably. Does that make any sense? It seems like when I've learned meta from people, it's eyes going fours. There's eyes for conditions or whatever, save, protected, well, et cetera. So it struck me with this in these greetings, hoping that you're nimble and whereas it healthy and well, nimble, strong and living comfortably. It sounded very meta-esque to me, so I was curious. Yeah. No, that's a very interesting question. Please never feel shy to ask questions. The dumbest questions are the most interesting ones. I had not thought of that, but you may be onto something. Let me see, upper bhadham. So I'll just, for the party of these words, so healthy is upper bhadha, literally of few afflictions. Appatanka is of a similar kind of meaning. La hutana. It's an interesting one. I've translated that as nimble, probably after previous translators, but la hutana, literally it means standing lightly, something like that, standing lightly. Interesting, right? Yeah. Balang is strong. Pasuvihara, and it means living comfortably or living at ease, living happily. So yeah, just a sort of polite phrases, but yeah, clearly these are some of the niceties of the time. Is there any particular significance in these sets of four? I believe this one's five, isn't it? Appabhadham, Appatanka. Well, I don't know in the Pali. I can't read Pali. Healthy and well are two separate ones. So healthy, well- Oh, they're separate. Okay. Okay. I took that as the same. Okay. Yeah. So five in this case. Okay. So I don't think there's a direct correlation with the teachings of metta, no, but there is some, you know, it's obviously a, you know, that kindly introduction. I wonder what la hutana really means. Nimble seems good enough, but it seems a bit curious, doesn't it? Might have to go and do another afternoon's research on that one and figure out what exactly. Yeah. Thanks. IIT has popped in, popped in a essay I did a little while ago on samadhi's, both the gathering and the fire. And for those who are interested in these kinds of issues and from time to time on our sort of central forum, I will just write a little article discussing different points in Pali and translation and interpretation and sometimes come across some interesting things there. Dheerayupa has comments that in the Thai language, the word samadhi means concentrate our attention. Okay. Which introduces an interesting point, like the question was raised about translating immersion. And as a translator, people often ask, so why do you translate this like this or translate that like that? And when you sort of negotiate some of the complexities of that, they often say, oh, why don't you just leave it in the Pali? And so you can just leave samadhi in the Pali. And there are plenty of words that you can do like that. You can leave bodhisattva in the Pali, you can leave bhikkhu. So bhikkhu bodhi leaves bhikkhu in the Pali and deva and various other kinds of things. The problem is with that is, I mean, I'm kind of exaggerating a little bit, but you can end up with a sentence that goes something like, you know, the bhikkhu was sitting samadhi when a deva came to him. And then you realize that actually the entire substance of the sentence is just in Pali with some grammatical grease to stick it together. And to me, it's important if you're going to translate to actually translate things. And the word samadhi is a good example of that, because if you look at people would say leave it in the Pali, it makes the meaning clear. But in fact, the word Pali has many different meanings, especially in the later different traditions. And so it really depends on what your background is. So in Thai languages, as Duryupa mentioned there, it means concentrate your attention. It can also just be used in the sense to meditate. Right. So if you're going to meditate right. So if you know, you just say, I'm going to go and sit samadhi just means I'm going to go and do some meditation. In India, in Hindu culture, samadhi is often used in the sense of the similar to what we would use for pañibhana, the final immersion or connection of the soul of a saint with the cosmic Brahman is called the samadhi. In the Vipassana traditions, they use samadhi to refer to what they call Kanika samadhi, which is a kind of momentary moment to moment mindfulness, which again is a different kind of sense, and so on and so forth. So if we use samadhi, then somebody from Thailand and somebody from India and somebody from maybe Myanmar and somebody from the United States might all read this word samadhi and actually read four different, quite different meanings from them. So this is why the idea of leaving things in the original language doesn't solve that problem of ambiguity or difficulty of translation. So samadhi is one of being one of the hardest words to translate. A number of years ago, when I came back from doing all my translation work, I've been on an island, T-may off the coast of Taiwan for three years, just translating pañibhana every day, and this was one of the most difficult ones to do. And when I came out of that, I went to a conference and at the conference I met this Aboriginal woman called Susan Boylan-Kurms, and we were just chatting and talking about language and things like that, and she mentioned, oh yeah, there are these words in, there are these words you find in Aboriginal languages that you don't have in English. And I will admit, I was kind of skeptical because I'm like, well, you could really translate anything if you put your mind to it. And she said, for example, we have a word kabra nanga, which means a state of mind that is still and peaceful and clear. And I'm like, oh yeah, you're right, we don't have a word like that in English, but there is a word in Pali for that. And so this is one case where it would have been really easy to, if I was translating it into an Aboriginal dialect, but not into English. Incidentally, I started this talk talking about the Uluru statement from the heart and the Uluru voice, one of the events I went for this, I was talking with a Torres Strait Islander woman who's running an orphanage for girls. So these are basically Aboriginal girls who are, you know, come from a background of broken homes or domestic violence or something, and they come to an orphanage and they're being looked after and educated. And she said when they started this, that it was really difficult and they had all of these behavioral problems. All the kids were acting out, you know, they'd never really had good role models, they'd never learned to live together, they'd never learned any kind of emotional regulation or anything like that. And she said they're really kind of despairing for quite a while. And now after a while they heard about this traditional Aboriginal practice of Kabra Nanga or Didiri is another word that they use for a similar practice, which is basically a kind of meditation or mindfulness practice. So they introduced the Didiri practice with the girls. And she said that originally they kind of resisted and it was really hard, but they persevered. And after six months or a year, they really started loving it and they learned how to emotionally regulate, not to act out. And she said that now all of those behavioral problems have gone away. They just don't have them anymore. And the girls are all work together and live together fine through that practice of Didiri. So to me, that was a really beautiful example of that practical application of meditation. Okay. Okay, we should probably wrap up about there. I think it's been about 90 minutes. I want to thank everybody for your attention. And I want to encourage you all to reflect about the Sari Bataanasuta, sorry, about the Mahaparni Bana Suta as we go forward. There is such a lot of richness in this text. As I mentioned briefly at the beginning, I won't be reading all of it. So next week, I'm not going to be necessarily picking up from the point I left off. So I do encourage you to read the Suta for next week, if you haven't already. And please, if you've got any questions that come up in your reading or during the talks, please do let me know. And to me, one of the things that becomes most apparent is that this sort of really is a journey. And it leads us from one place to another. You know, and we've started in one place with this with this declaration of war, and with these principles of organizing communities and all of these things. But the Suta then moves and moves into deeper and deeper waters, sometimes into literal waters. And so as we go through for the next few weeks, we're going to be going on that journey towards the deeper and deeper reaches of the Dhamma. And I hope that you'll stay with me for that journey. Thank you so much, everybody. Thanks to Rob and the Sati Centre for putting this on. And I look forward to seeing you all again next week. Saar, saar, saar.
