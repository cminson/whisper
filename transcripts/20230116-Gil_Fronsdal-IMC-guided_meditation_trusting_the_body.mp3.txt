 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and welcome to this Monday. It's a holiday here in the United States celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. and I think it's one of my favorite holidays for all the tremendous good that represents the values that Martin Luther King stood for. And I wish we could have more celebrations of such values. So these weeks, the focus on these 7 a.m. is how to practice with challenges and we're still laying down the foundation for doing so. And today for the meditation I'd like to suggest that one of the very important foundations for living with challenges, dealing with challenges, is our physical body. And well I shouldn't say physical body, I should maybe say the body that we experience, the experienced body. I say that because the way we experience the body is a cooperative enterprise of the mind and the body. They participate in our sense, the way we experience our body is not separate from how the mind processes it and registers it. And this experienced body that we can feel and sense and know is not static, it's not just a lump of flesh, it's something that's dynamic and wise. And it's not just the recipient of challenges, like a victim of challenges. It's instinct, it's nature is to respond and process and work with whatever is coming. And there's a tremendous movement in this body to homeostasis, to healing, to wholeness, if we allow it. And so when there's challenges it's quite powerful to, especially like in meditation, to keep coming back and how's the body experiencing this? And not only experiencing it, but how's the body processing it? I like the expression composting it. How to feel what the challenge feels like in the body, but trust the body. Don't just be the recipient and just the person who's the burden by whatever's happening. Allow the body to trust the body, trust how the body, make room for the body, feel it in the body. And there's a number of things that can happen. One is that they can be very grounding. It's very easy to get ungrounded, uncentered, disoriented by being in our thoughts and stories and ideas and spinning around. And being in the body is an alternative for being repetitively glossed and caught up in the spinning mind. So being in the body is grounding. Being in the body gives us a more sensitivity to what's really happening there. If that sensitivity, what's happening there is too much for our degree of sensitivity, then it's useful to move the body. Let the body's movements allow things to be easier to be with. And for people doing mindfulness practice, the two meditation practices, their eight practices is sitting meditation, where we really feel it's all here, but if it's too much, then to stand up and do a walking meditation and let the walking be the movement that holds it all, perhaps. There's more to be said like this, but this is the basic ones. But keep referring back to the body. Refer back to the body. Let the body be the center and don't ignore everything else, but see if the body, if you trust the body, if the body can somehow make space, make room for the challenges you're feeling within. So the training is a huge training in mindfulness, a training in mindfulness of the body, awareness embodied awareness. So that's what we'll do today. So taking a meditation posture, and this posture we take is such an important resource, support for how we can be with challenges. To take a posture that expresses confidence, expresses a kind of, I can do this, dignity, value, confidence in the posture. Even if you don't feel confident, it's possible to assume a confident posture, and that makes a difference. And then to gently close your eyes and to begin inhabiting the body, discovering the body, to take long, slow, deep breaths. Feeling the rib cage stretch and expand as you breathe in deeply, maybe expanding of the belly, maybe lifting an expansion of the back rib cage. And as you inhale, all as you inhale, then as you exhale, let it all relax. Letting your breathing return to normal. And continue to relax the body and the exhale. And as you relax it, let that be an occasion for sensing and feeling more fully the area that relaxes. Feeling it and sensing it with a silent mind on the exhale, relaxing muscles of the face. Feeling the shoulders. Feeling the belly. Relaxing your legs, eyes, calves, so that you're not fighting gravity You're going along with gravity, so your legs, feet feel more grounded on the surface that supports them. And gently become aware of the body breathing. Imagine the sensations of breathing in the body is the center of all things. And you stay close to that center. Feeling close to breathing around the edges of that center through your body. How are you? Feel your way into how you are right now while being centered breathing in and breathing out. And whatever way you are, feel it how it is in your body to be this way. With breathing being a gentle massage or a gentle stroking, touching how you are in the body. But staying primarily with the breathing so you don't get lost in concerns about how you are.asping for awareness and And if anything takes you away from your breathing, that concern or preoccupation, is there any correlation, any way that has shifted how you feel in your body? No, the distracted mind physically. Know your emotions as they appear physically. Trust the body, feel how it is in the body, whatever is happening, a sound outside, what's happened in the body? Feeling the body, while continuing to breathe in the room, mindfully, mindfully. Trust that the most important thing now is to experience your life as felt by your body. And perhaps that's a protection from spinning out in thoughts, even a protection from fear, becoming too strong. Fear, becoming too strong. And if there is fear or distress in the body, feel it as long as it's comfortable to do so. Or feel elsewhere in your body places of stability, spaciousness, calm, that can support you with a challenge. So forget it today. Or you can talk to someonesusp protagonist whose curiosity is in your mind. Imagine for the last five minutes of the meditation that your body has a tremendous confidence to be present for itself, to feel its embodied existence in all the sensations and emotions and activities. Your body can sit still and quiet, process it all, allow it all to be, allow it all to move. Sit with this embodied confidence, with the mind starting to become more quiet and still. Aega. We're going to take a look at the The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The And as we come to the end of this meditation, to bring your attention in your body to where there might be a tenderness or a gentleness, maybe where there is love or care, good will. And how does that live in you? How do you feel this in your body? Is there some way that you can, for a minute or two here, make a room for kindness and good will towards others? And embodied sense of kindness, gentleness, attentiveness. And to wish, to well have well wishes for others, no matter who they are or where they are, it would be nice if they could be safe and happy. Even our enemies might be nicer to everyone if they were safe and happy and peaceful. May we share this human life together, offering our good will, sharing it with everyone. Perhaps we never know, we might be planting seeds of good will and kindness all over wherever we go. Who knows how they will sprout after we're gone. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings everywhere be free. Thank you.
