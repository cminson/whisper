 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, settling into a hospitable meditation posture, the balance of relaxation and alertness. Whether sitting, standing, or lying down, it's most important to focus on a sense of alignment. The head aligned with the spine, the body and heart and mind aligned in the moment. It can be helpful in starting a period of meditation to intentionally take one or two breaths, perhaps a bit longer or slower than usual, exhaling the tension in the out breath. Then, noticing the body exactly as it is, the whole body. And dropping in the wish, the invitation, may this body relax. Inviting relaxation of the scalp and the face, the temples and the jaw, the neck and throat. Inviting the shoulders to soften, or softening around any tension that doesn't want to release. Allowing the chest and side ribs to soften. The upper back, the area between the shoulder blades, to let go and relax. The whole rib cage, solar plexus, softening, all the little muscles in there, the big ones too. And inviting all the tissue muscles, organs within the rib cage, solar plexus to soften. Relaxing the belly, the waist. Inviting the mid-back and lumbar spine to relax. Softening the hips and buttocks and groin and thighs. The whole upper leg. Allowing the shins and calves, knees and ankles to soften. And relaxing the area where the ankles flow into the feet. Allowing the feet and the toes to soften. Acknowledging whatever's there. And inviting ease. Noticing the whole body grounded. Here and now. And in the space of any relaxation, allowing awareness to suffuse through this body. The way fogs effuses through and wettens a field. No effort, but filling gently. And turning the awareness, expanding the awareness to include the heart and mind, the chitta. Noticing whatever attitude or relationship to experience is there. Just noticing. Noticing and inviting the heart, the mind, all mental activity to soften and relax. May this heart and mind relax. Allowing awareness to encompass the quality of awareness itself. Obscacious or focused. Scattered or collected. Peaceful. Or active. Allowing. Noticing to the specific kinds of awareness. Whatever might be seen through closed eyes, variegated textures, or light, or dark. Where consciousness is aware of with hearing. Sensing. Smelling or tasting. Feeling or knowing. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Resting in awareness from time to time. Refreshing the interest in what is arising in any of the senses, in the body, and the mind part. What's this all about? Thank you. Thank you.
