For this week, we'll do seven days of this 7 am  morning sitting and go through Saturday and Sunday as well because on this weekend, starting Thursday evening, we're reaching a retreat and so just fold in this 7 am  sitting into the retreat, the retreat into this sitting. 
So there's a kind of a multi-faceted theme for this week. 
And so I'll introduce it this way, that the meditation practice that we do, the core of it is called Insight Meditation. 
And that's a translation of vipassana. 
Insight is a translation. 
And vipassana means to see clearly or to see with emphasis. 
And in the ancient texts, vipassana is not a meditation practice, but rather it's a result of meditation practice in the form of insight. 
As we develop and cultivate meditation, then at some point there is a revelation that happens. 
And I use the word revelation because we don't have the sense that we're probing or doing the analysis, which is just seeing what's there and allowing what's there to show itself in a deep way. 
And there are three insights. 
And those are deep insight into impermanence or inconstancy, a deep insight into suffering, a deep insight into not-self. 
So that's kind of one piece of a larger process of practice. 
And the idea is to get there to have these deep insights. 
To get to those insights, meditation practice is to cultivate ourselves, develop ourselves in meditation in such a way that we can have those insights. 
And so we don't do the insights. 
The insights just happen as we are well stable, focused and clear. 
And so how do we cultivate ourselves? Well, maybe a little bit paradoxically, we cultivate the opposite of the three characteristics. 
We cultivate stability and stillness so that we can see impermanence and change and inconstancy really well. 
We cultivate happiness and well-being, as we talked about last week, so that we can have the capacity to really have deep insight, the capacity to really be able to look at suffering, be with suffering in a very deep way without it being a negative experience. 
And then we cultivate something that can be called in English, something like self-confidence, efficacy, and the sense of strong confidence, self-confidence, that allows us to see what is called not-self. 
So that's what we cultivate. 
Now, why do we cultivate these days? We cultivate these to have the insights. 
And why do we cultivate the insights? We have the insights in order to bring the mind to a place, to a time where the mind has no fixations. 
It's not fixating on wanting something or resisting anything or fixating on desires or versions, fixated on delusions and ideas and fears. 
And often the mind is fixated. 
It's kind of focused about something and really is stuck there once that or is that, in ways that we don't really begin to see until we start calming and settling the mind deeper and deeper and deeper. 
Then at some point we'll notice that the mind keeps being preoccupied. 
There's a tension, a momentum, a holding pattern in the mind. 
And some of this is really almost below the level of thinking and the very kind of attachment or fixation to being alive or being a self. 
Even things like being safe or having opinions or holding onto stories. 
And there's nothing necessarily wrong with those things, but there's no freedom with the mind fixated. 
So the purpose of seeing these deep insights into inconstancy, suffering and not self is so the mind can release its fixations. 
And to do that very deeply brings the mind to something that the Buddhist tradition calls the three doors of liberation. 
And those three doors are the doors that lead to the mind letting go in a deep way, letting go of its deepest fixations, so liberation, awakening. 
And those three doors are the doors, and I'll explain this, the doors of the signless, the door of the wishless and the door of emptiness. 
So the signless is the door where we no longer fixate on any of the projections we have on reality around us. 
And certainly the more abstract or complicated projections we have about people and bias and prejudice and judgments we have. 
But also the simplest projections, even the projection on something like a door that it's a door or a chair that it's a chair. 
In the way chairs function in our society, it's a completely appropriate and some degree accurate idea that we apply to this piece of furniture that we call a chair. 
But if you brought that to people 50,000 years ago on this planet, those people maybe wouldn't know it was a chair. 
They wouldn't be unsure of what it was. 
Maybe they thought it was a stepping stool to get up to the fruit and the tree. 
They wouldn't occur to them maybe that it was a chair. 
But we see it that way. 
So even the simplest forms of attributing concepts to things can be a fixation. 
And so when the mind is no longer projecting anything, that's called the signless, and they get the mind to the point where it's relaxed and still enough, open enough, safe enough, peaceful enough, that it's not making any projections on anything at all, then something can release. 
And there's something about seeing in constancy, in permanence, that we realize that the more we see things constantly changing, the more we see they don't fit. 
The projections don't quite work. 
And so the projecting mind can finally release or relax. 
The wishless is when we experience suffering. 
We see that the unsatisfactory nature, the degree of stress or tension that somehow inherent in so many things, even the smallest movements of the mind, surprisingly, to really see that and see that from a place of happiness, but to really see it. 
Then the ways in which we get fixated on the pursuit of happiness or fixated on our suffering releases. 
And then something very deep can let go. 
And then to really see something about how things are not self, the not-self characteristic of phenomena, and I'll talk more about that later. 
But that is the, I think it's fair, and most people understand how much fixation human beings have on themselves, on self. 
There starts to have a lot of self-confidence to cultivate that, so that there's enough health confidence one can begin to let go of the fixation on self. 
And when that is, the mind stops that fixation for some people, that's the door they step through for deeper liberation. 
And so that's liberation, so there's what we cultivate, there's what we see, and there's the doors to freedom. 
And then that's followed, but then how we live in the world. 
And each of these three doors can open to a different benefit for living in a good, wonderful way in the world. 
But for now, I want to say that there are these, so there's four different kind of steps in this larger process. 
And that could be summarized in a little ditty, a little kind of saying. 
First you be, then you see, next you free, finally you are we. 
So first you be, you become someone who's stable, has sense of well-being, and confidence. 
First you be, then you see, you see the three insights of inconstancy, suffering, and not-self. 
Then you free, you step through the doors of liberation, the mind saddles very deeply, the doors of sinless, wishless, and emptiness, and then you're we. 
Then the solid barrier, solid walls between self and other dissolve, and the concern and care and love for the whole world becomes much more natural and part of an expression of that freedom that comes. 
Because how could there be freedom without that freedom opening us up to care about the world around us? So that's the kind of overarching overview of what, some of what will happen this week. 
And then I will, and some of this will happen at the retreat, and I'll arrange to have those talks also posted together with this series. 
So that those of you who want to have easy access to the whole thing, or some of these retreat talks will happen, not during the 7 am  sitting. 
And so if you want the whole package, it'll be easily accessible for you in other ways. 
And I'll talk more about that later. 
So I hope that this is nice for you. 
And in these first days of this week, I will talk mostly about the three doors of liberation. 
So in a sense, we're starting with the advanced teaching as the background, as the direction we're going in practice. 
And then for the retreat, I'm going to talk about the cultivation, the being, what we develop, and the insights. 
So, oh, somebody asked a question, sinless or sightless? Sinless, no signs. 
So no projections of concepts, ideas is what the sinless is. 
So I look forward to continuing this theme over the next days. 
Thank you.
