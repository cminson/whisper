 So I'm doing this year-long course on what's called the paramis or the perfections, the paramitas, and there's ten of them and these are considered very important qualities of character, qualities of personal inner strength that can support Dharma practice, Buddhist practice. They have a mythological origin in that there's a myth that the man who became the Buddha spent many many lifetimes developing himself so that he could develop those perfections, those qualities of beings that would take to become a Buddha. And there are stories about, they're called, kind of like some of them are like Aesop fables, various stories about how he developed himself over the many many lifetimes that he practiced. And some of these stories have to do with, many of them have to do with the development of these ten qualities called the ten perfections or the ten paramis. And as the Buddhist tradition developed, especially in Southeast Asia, these ten qualities were also understood to be very supportive of anybody who wanted to practice the Buddhist practice. People who are not set on becoming a Buddha don't have to develop them to the level of perfection that a Buddha does, but still are very important qualities. And you find in Asia sometimes when people reach a wall in the practice, the practicing and practicing and the meditation practice is going along and then they reach a wall or plateau and they don't seem to go any further, sometimes teachers will say, oh now it's time for you to develop your character or develop these personal qualities. And once those qualities of character are present, then perhaps you can begin again and go further with your meditation practice, with your spiritual practice. So these ten qualities are, the first one is generosity, the second is integrity, the third is renunciation or letting go, the fourth is wisdom, and the fifth is bigger or effort or energy. And then after that comes patience, which is the theme for this month. And then after patience comes truth, truthfulness, dedication to truth, being honest. And then comes determination or resolve, having a strong resolve for what you want to do. And then comes loving kindness and then equanimity. That's a list of ten in the Theravadan tradition. And some of these are developed naturally or as a byproduct of dedicated mindfulness practice. It's as if you've tried to be mindful, which is another way of saying being honest, really honest, show up, be present, and really honest with what's happening here. And learn to do that in a way that's non-reactive. That simple practice, maybe it's not that simple, but that practice is a magnet for developing other personal qualities or developing your character. And some people prefer not to do anything about developing their character aside from just developing the mindfulness practice, showing up being present, being here. Some people find it's very useful to develop themselves, develop their character, because as they become more developed, it becomes much more supportive to do the mindfulness practice. So for example, integrity, maybe an obvious one, that if a person lacks personal integrity, it's actually very hard to go very deep or very far in meditation practice, because the two go diametrically opposed to each other. If you want to practice a practice which focuses on being honest, you've got to be honest. And if you don't have that integrity, those two clash and one is going to win out. So if you cultivate your integrity and develop it and think it's an important quality to have, then that becomes a soil or a bed or a foundation in which meditation practice can advance a lot easier and sometimes a lot faster. The tradition says the same thing about generosity. If you develop the ability to give and have a generous heart, it turns out it's a lot easier to develop a mindfulness practice, develop concentration and mindfulness. If you develop your capacity to let go appropriately, that also helps develop meditation practice. Now patience, the theme for this month, is one of those things which is for many people the first lesson they have to learn if they begin a meditation practice. And for some people it's also the last lesson. I think most people when they sit down to meditate will have to cultivate a certain degree of patience with the speed of the practice and with what they have to encounter in themselves or in their environment when they sit down to try to be still, quiet, relaxed and calm. And if you don't develop patience, if that's not a quality you somehow come upon, you're probably going to suffer. Because if you don't develop some kind of patience, some kind of broad acceptance or broad spaciousness around some of the things that you discover about yourself in your practice, then your expectations, your agendas, your demands, your ideals, your impatience, your aversions, your fears will get the upper hand. And if they get the upper hand then you get swept away by them. You get caught by them, you get entangled in their web, their sticky webs. One of the ways that I developed patience through my Buddhist practice was when I practiced Zen practice in my early years of meditation practice. And in doing Zen practice I wasn't told to do much. It was part of the beauty and sometimes the irritation of Zen practice. And you're not told anything except show up and be there, be present for what's there. The way I understood that was to practice uncompromising acceptance of what was present now. And as I did that I found that often there was impulses inside of me that didn't want to be present. Wanted to be in the future, in the past, or wanted to kind of react to what was there. It wasn't accepting what's there but was reactive pushing it away or wanting to hold on to certain things. But the Zen training was a training of complete acceptance of what is here. One way that translated in doing Zen meditation was physically and mentally to sit still with whatever arose, whatever was there. So an impulse would arise to itch. Now here in our tradition we don't say anything about that so not so uncommon to see people itch themselves, scratch themselves, but not in Zen. You know you have to sit still and if you have an itch you can't move. So you can't move your body. So that's ground rule. You sit there with your itch. You know the Zen of the Zen of itching, you know attaining oneness with your itch. And so you sit there with your itch but then you notice that your mind moves. Even though you keep your body still the mind moves. And so the mind is irritated. The mind is angry, is impatient. The mind begins thinking about this must be skin cancer. The mind starts being afraid. The mind starts getting agitated and spinning out. And it can get quite wild in the mind if you don't get to scratch that itch. To my knowledge no one has ever died in meditation from an itch. So it's a relatively safe phenomena to sit still with. And so the mind moves. But the Zazen practice I did was in a sense not to let the mind move or not to pick up the movements of the mind, not to get involved in them. So it's as if there's some capacity of the mind to have an impulse and to leave it alone. So it's like the container of the mind stays still even though there's popcorn happening inside of it. Or another very different kind of approach analogy would be that it's that it's like you have a very calm center and you don't leave that calm center even though around the center there's agitation in the mind. So you learn to stay there. You don't pick something up. You don't go towards something. You don't go away from something. And so in Zen practice that's sitting still physically and mentally with all the mental and physical stuff that might happen day after day after day, month after month, year after year, develops patience, develops the capacity not to pick up, not to get involved in the reactions of the mind. And that's my definition of patience this week at least. Is the ability to not get caught by the reactive impulses of the mind. And there's a wide range of them. The reactive impulses to wonderful things happening. Someone comes along and praises you. To have patience is to not get caught or get aroused or get excited or get carried away. Don't let go to your head by that phrase. If someone criticizes you, that ability to be patient is the ability not to get caught up in the web of thoughts or reactions that might appear when you're being criticized. Oh maybe you don't like it, maybe you're afraid with the criticism, but the fear arises and there's a place of stillness, a place in the mind that doesn't move for or against that. Unless you think an unmoving mind is a boring mind, it's one of the most beautiful things in the human psyche is that place where the mind doesn't move. It's luminous, it's all encompassing, it's soft, it's beautiful. So the word for patience is Kanti in Pali. In Sanskrit it's Shanti. And the way that it often works when you translate between different languages, there's not a one-to-one correspondence between English and these Indian words. And that's the case with Kanti. And patience is the most common translation, but it misses a lot. And perhaps we can understand patience to have different aspects or different ways that patience manifests itself. In different circumstances, patience takes different forms. And so sometimes it's appropriate to translate this word other ways besides patience. One of the meanings of patience, of Kanti, is perseverance. And that is when you're doing something that's worthwhile doing, this Kanti, this patience, this perseverance, is not giving up, not getting, well you can get discouraged, that can be a reaction to the mind. You can't necessarily prevent your mind from getting discouraged, but with patience or this perseverance, you don't pick up the discouragement. You don't get entangled with it. You don't get caught by it. So the story I've often told when I was writing my dissertation, I think most people when they write dissertation sooner or later are visited by discouragement, by this is impossible. Why did I do this? I can't do this. It's kind of the nature of dissertation. Anybody done a dissertation? Anybody not had that and done a dissertation? And but because I attributed to my Buddhist practice that when I was, you know, plugging away and had those kinds of thoughts, I treated them like pesky little flies flying around the back of my head, kind of, and I just ignored them. I can't do this. This is impossible. It's gonna take too long. And I just would focus my attention on doing the next footnote. We know the next word, the next sentence. And so patience had the form of perseverance, where I didn't get entangled in those impulses that would distract me from continuing the direction I was going. Another form of patience is endurance. And sometimes it's translated as forbearance, endurance. And in the Asian Buddhism, forbearance or endurance is considered a very important quality. Here in the West, we talk a lot about loving kindness has been very important. And sometimes I get a sense that in Asia, they actually put forbearance or endurance at a, they talk about it more than they talk about loving kindness. We almost never talked about it here in the West. But endurance has the meaning in some people, they have endurance, even patients itself, but endurance often has kind of negative connotations. And patients can have that it's kind of like being a being passive. It's maybe being kind of accepting things which shouldn't be accepted, or it's kind of putting a limitation on us. And we don't want to be limited. And endurance can have that feeling also. But the most common example given for endurance is endurance under insult. If someone insults you. And this is something that schoolchildren try to teach each other or try to tease each other with, you know, sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can never touch me. And usually it's done a little bit tauntingly, right? I think, but when they're trying to learn, you know, the insult doesn't have to affect me. And I can endure it without getting caught, either with my reactions, or I can endure it without having reactions arise at all. So to endure insult, why would a person want to endure insult? Or why would a person want to endure certain kinds of challenges or difficulties that might arise today? Or maybe it's not a good example, so I'll maybe bring it up back later. But one of the reasons I think is very interesting, and that is that one of the most precious treasures or resources that any individual has is their own integrity or is their own peace of mind. And why sacrifice that? Because you've been insulted. The Buddha said that if you sacrifice, paraphrase him, if you sacrifice your peace of mind, you sacrifice your own integrity by getting angry at the person who's insulted you or insulting back. You're doing your enemy a favor and you're doing a harm to yourself that your enemy can never do directly. And so you're actually doing them a favor because you kind of picked it up and you've kind of lashed back and that you don't have to lash back. You can endure or stay peaceful or stay kind of more non-reactive, stay spacious about what's happening, what's going on. It might be helpful to see that the Buddha came from a particular caste in India. There were various caste societies where people belong to different castes. And he came from a warrior class, warrior caste. And a warrior is especially someone who has some nobility like the Buddha was a son of a prince or a king. Sometimes put a lot of value in traditional culture, at least a lot of value on their honor, on their integrity, on their purity of heart, on their cleanliness of their intentions and behavior. And that reputation is something that sometimes classic knights and samurais in different places put so much value on that they'll even sacrifice their life in order to maintain that honor. So I think that for the Buddha there was something tremendously precious about personal integrity that had so much higher value than the value we might get back from lashing out in anger or lashing out in insult to other people, even if it might seem we have a good cause. Or even if in the short term it might seem like a good idea. Because if I could just lash out at that guy, he'll just leave me alone finally. So it really works. I lashed out at him, he left me alone, and it worked. Isn't that great? Proof that it works. Proof it was right. Maybe it was right in this kind of funny way, but it's right at a tremendous cost to yourself. And maybe there's a different way of getting what you need besides lashing out. So last night we had a parents discussion group here. And it was a great story of one of the parents here who has three children. Two of them are, one's in college and one's maybe almost in college and one's eight years old. And she said that all three of her children had trouble at school with bullying, being bullied. And the older ones, they were trying to figure out what to do about it, and the school administrators didn't seem to help much. I guess she never was really satisfied how they handled it with these two older ones. But the younger one, the eight year old, when he was being bullied by this particular kid at school, what she figured out to do was she invited that bully home to her house for a special meal and then took this kid out to some special event with her family. And the bullying stopped. And not only that, but her son and this kid became best friends. So someone could have lashed out at that boy, the bully. Someone could have gotten that paddle and paddled him really well. And he probably never, maybe never would have bullied again. But is that good? Is that useful? Just to get them to stop their behavior? I don't know that's good. I know a father who kind of said once, when my son was three or four years old, only once did I ever spank him. And from that time on, we never had any problems with him. Now, was that good? Did that straighten out the kid once and for all? Or was the kid so afraid or so intimidated that some life force in him was held in check from that experience? I don't know. So what is being sacrificed? What's lost? What opportunities are lost? What potential of our own is lost when we get swept up in our reactive behavior? And it's patience or endurance or perseverance is one of those qualities, very important qualities, that it preserves or helps us not to get caught up by our reactivity. It's really an essential quality, I think, for civilized human life, for sane, kind, productive human life is to have that. And I suspect everyone who's alive has some degree of patience. It can take effort. Sometimes the effort of perseverance, hanging in there, making the effort is continuing. And meditation practice requires a lot of perseverance. Sometimes meditation practice is not good news. Self-knowledge is seldom good news, they say. So in mindfulness practice, where you're seeing yourself. Or sometimes things don't go according to plan in meditation. So often, in fact, that good meditators usually give up planning for their meditation. But people who don't have enough experience, they're trying, okay, am I concentrated yet? It's not happening. And it's best not to be on some kind of timeline. Spiritual life, the inner life, the spiritual life of the psyche, really has its own time. I think it has rhyme and reason to that time. But it's not usually the time that is the agenda or small mind, or the timeframe of our society, which is ever going faster and faster. And there's a story once of the Dalai Lama giving teaching to a big audience of people. And I believe he was talking about the Bodhisattva Path. And someone asked him a question in the hall, and asked him what the fastest way was to becoming enlightened or becoming a Buddha. And as the story has been told to me, the Dalai Lama stopped for a long time. It just was really silent. And then apparently, tears went down his cheek. And then at some point he said something about how sad it was, this drive, this ambitious greed to get results as fast as possible. I think the inner, the heart, is shy. The heart is slow. This is a nice story also. I don't know who it is anymore, but some story about someone who said, every day I meditate for half an hour. When I'm really busy, I meditate for an hour. The last meaning of kanti or kshanti is forgiveness. So it's kind of interesting that the word for patience and forgiveness are kind of conflated in this one word, akshanti, kanti. And one of the meanings of forgiveness is simply to not hold a grudge, not hold resentment, not be a person who is unsafe for another person. If you're holding resentment, you're kind of unsafe for that other person. I like that very simple definition because it's a lower bar to cross than to say forgiveness is to open your heart and welcome them back into your home or to welcome them lovingly. I love you and everything's forgiven. To say, no, I'm not going to harm you anymore. I'm not going to hold a grudge against you. That's a lower bar, I think. However, the Buddhist tradition does put a lot of emphasis on developing loving kindness. But I see it as two different steps. And if the two steps are tied together, letting go of a resentment and loving, it's maybe kind of too much to handle all at once. But if we can simply focus on letting go of a resentment, because if there is no resentment, there's no need for forgiveness. So if we can let go of our resentment, then that's the first step. And then later we can work on opening our hearts to them or having a love for them. So there are lots of opportunities for cultivating patience, for cultivating perseverance or endurance or forbearance or forgiveness. I was here meditating peacefully, happily, at the center until 4.30. And between 4.30 and coming back here, I actually came late. 7.40 or something. I was surprised how many occasions for patience I had. I had to kind of, you know, oh. And normally I wouldn't have thought about it. There was patience that I was doing. I was practicing patience, but because I was going to talk about it, I thought, oh, yeah, that's patience operating. And, you know, they go from here, home, because at 5 o'clock my son had little league practice. So I got there on time, but it took a while to realize we were in the wrong field, the wrong park. Mostly they meet in one place, but once in a while they meet someplace else. I hadn't been told. It was a good thing because there was another parent there. So I was all good, so I could help her. She didn't know, so I could tell her, oh, we have to go to the other place. But the other place was on the other side of Redwood City, and it's 5 o'clock, the traffic in El Camino. And I could feel myself starting to get a little bit impatient for getting there and a little bit irritated. And I did a little bit of reflections, and why in the world is this worth getting irritated about? For what reason? I was trying to go through the list of reasons. Why should I get irritated at this? Because someone told me to go to the wrong field. I called it a grudge. That didn't make any sense. Because it was life threatening to my son if he didn't get there on time to Little League. He was really relaxed. He didn't seem to care. He was happy to go, but this is what was happening. Life was happening this way. He just was going along with the flow. So he was okay with it. The coaches, I was concerned about the coaches and what they would think. I went through all the reasons I could think about, and none of them held any water. None of them had it to make any sense. I think that if I hadn't done that reflection, some of those voices would have operated in the background, and I wouldn't have questioned them. But I took the time. I was very curious. What are the reasons? I couldn't find any. And why would I bother to get impatient around this? And in fact, nothing dire was going to happen. Nothing wrong was going to happen. Everything was cool and fine, as far as I could tell. There was no reason to pick up getting late for Little League practice as a cause of sacrificing my peace. In all these perfections, including patience, are seen as being strengths. And as they develop as strengths, it's appropriate to call them powers. They become personal powers that we carry with us. So there can be a power of patience. So now to think again that patience is something passive or something like an absence of something, they can be a very powerful form of inner strength that we carry with us into different situations. And a little bit, I had a little bit extra strength in that department this afternoon, because I'd spent a little bit of time this afternoon meditating here. A little bit calmer, more centered, or had a little more ability to stay present and to question what was going on and look at it. So certainly meditating or being careful with how we live our life, so we don't get, we meditate a little bit or do something that calms us or relax us or create some space in the mind is very helpful. Another step that's helpful for developing patience is reframing the situation. So it's one thing to question the authority of how we are framing it, but in other ways to reframe the situation in different ways. And one of the ones, it's somewhat classic in Buddhism, is sometimes formulated with the idea, see everybody, see everybody in the world except for one person is a Buddha, is fully enlightened, and they're all here to teach that one person is not. And who's that one person? You. So no matter what the circumstances are happening, they're there to teach you something. And there's a story, a famous story of Gurdjieff, having a little ashram or colony or kind of community outside of Paris, and spiritual community. And there was a really difficult person who lived there. And everyone else in the community didn't like him. And they made it kind of hard for him to be there, apparently. And so one day he left, he packed up and left. So Gurdjieff went to Paris and found him and said, can you please come back? And no one wants me there. No one likes me. Oh, please come back. I'll pay you to come back. And okay, I'll come back. And so he came back. And then everyone looked at Gurdjieff, what? We finally got rid of this difficult person. And Gurdjieff said, you need him. Because you need someone if everything's smooth and easy, you're not developing something, not being challenged. So to see every see even difficult people as your teachers. So in the Theravana tradition, this reframing is said this way. A difficult person is a benefactor for he or she is the basis for developing patients. If there were no wrongdoers, how could I accomplish the perfection of patients? So look for those opportunities. I mean, don't go too far out of the way. When they come looking for you, then use those opportunities. See what it takes. Understand yourself. And if you simply understand, this is an opportunity to develop myself, to cultivate myself, to discover where is my integrity, to look at the authority of your beliefs, look at the authority of the ways you've understood the situation, to look at how you relate to your impulses, your reactions, your feelings. And use the opportunity to have some strength, some power of staying still, not moving. Not moving. If you have very strong impulses, like if you're an addict, and Buddhism says everybody's an addict, we're all recovering humans. Because if we're not addicted to substances, we're addicted to our thoughts or to our ego. But if you find a very strong impulse, say you have an addiction like cigarettes or alcohol or food or something, or you have a very strong impulse towards being angry, some very strong impulses arises in you. Look for one. Look for one to arise. Don't make one happen. Don't manufacture it. But look for the opportunity when a really strong thing happens. And if you have a partner or a good friend, if you dare, you can enlist their help. And they can say, this is the time. So now's when you should do this practice that Gil recommends. And the practice is, wait it out. Ride it out. Ride out the wave. Wait it out. So you feel this tremendous urge. And with addiction, it can be extremely compelling. All the lawyers in the mind come out and give all the reasons. And all this very strong concepts compelling feelings in the body can arise. So compelling. The physical feelings have so much authority that how could anybody in their right mind not listen to it? Wait it out. Don't act on it. Stay still. Find a nice chair and just don't move. Wait it out until you find yourself on the back side of the wave. Sooner or later, it will dissipate. I guarantee it. You'll get your Donna back if it doesn't. Sooner or later. It might be later. But sooner or later, it'll pass. And it's very empowering, very encouraging, and very instructing, very strength producing to have waited it out. And sometimes it can feel like you're in the rodeo, even if you're sitting still to do that. And I've known people who've been addicts, who've done that practice of waiting things out and felt like it was like a revelation. I can do it. I don't have to give in to these impulses. So I recommend that you find an impulse. Don't go make one up, but find a good one. And if the next day or later in the day, even better one arises, then do it again. And then if the better one arises later, even the strong one says, oh, I guess I chose the wrong one. And then do that one. And then explore patience, explore endurance, explore perseverance, explore forgiveness, explore holding the mind still. And if the mind is still, the body will be still. Because the hold of mind still is not to give in to those impulses. I'm very fond of the idea that patience as a parami is sandwiched between vigor, energy, and truth, which is next month. It's after having developed capacity for engagement, for practice, for energy and practice, that this list talks about patience. So patience is not a giving up of effort. In a sense, it's perfecting the effort. And then patience is followed by truth, honesty. And in some way or other, truthfulness is said to perfect patience. I'm not sure how that is, but maybe I'll know, figure it out, or discover it between now and then next month. So, what do you think of that? And I hope it's been inspiring a little bit. Does anyone want to say anything? We have a couple of minutes before the end. Please use the mic. It's a good topic for me because last weekend, my friend asked me to come over to his house in the East Bay and help him with a construction project with a few other friends. And I'm on public transportation, so it can take three hours for me to get over there. And I was already running late, and I was getting to the art station. And there are a few people in front of me, and there was a train already there. And I was like, oh, I get this train, I might get there in half an hour. And there are just three people in front of me getting the ticket, and I'm sitting there, and it's taking longer and longer and longer. And the train's waiting for me right there. And it finally gets to the one person right before me. And I can tell they really don't know how to use the machine, and I'm just going crazy, saying to them, come on, come on, come on. And of course the train leaves right then. And I'm like, you know, I'm getting so angry and I'm focusing all my frustration on this person. Like, oh my god, you know, why did it have to be you standing there? And of course, I make it, it's fine, it doesn't matter. I'm a little late. These are my friends. They're lazy, they don't care. And you know, I'm hearing you say this, and it occurred to me, you know, I missed out on an opportunity. I should have helped this person. You know, they've probably not from around here. They don't know how to use this machine. And I've been using it all my life. I could have helped this person get their ticket and get to where they're going. And they're probably frustrated too. And if I had just been a little more patient, not getting caught up in my rush to go nowhere. So the idea that patience follows the perfection of effort. In my mind, I'm associated with the idea that we engage in life the best we can, with the best effort we can, without having too much at stake. So we try to do the best job we can. But we don't invest it with our ego. And you know, we don't have nothing at stake in our hearts. And doing it, we do it as best we can. And then we is what it is. And if it doesn't work out, then we haven't sacrificed the quality of our hearts. So I hope that all of you are ... I hope all of you cherish your hearts, the good quality of your heart, the good qualities there. And if you don't know that they're there, then maybe you could take my word for it. And I'll tell you, it is there. Good qualities are in every heart. And it's something to be safeguarded, taken care of. And it's something to be discovered and developed. May the goodness of your heart benefit others. Thank you.
