During the meditation this morning, we'll be starting with the first foundation, contemplation
of the body, and then including the second foundation, contemplation of feeling-tone,
Vedana, and then the third foundation will introduce which you can welcome to play with
off and on today as you would like, which is the contemplation of mind, states, or contemplation
of thoughts.
So settling in to your position that allows you to be both relaxed and alert, sometimes
helpful to take a few deep breaths, inviting the body to settle, checking in with the body
and noticing any places that you may be holding extra tension, inviting a softening of the
body and allowing the body to be as it is, inviting a gentle kind awareness.
As you invite in the relaxation, at the same time bringing in this non-judgmental awareness
that allows the body to be just as it is, meeting the body where it is, loving awareness.
As we bring our mindfulness into the body, you may begin to notice the rhythm of the
breath, the breathing body, the body being breathed, the inhalation, the pause, the exhalation,
the pause, the changing nature of the breath, the sensations of aliveness in the body, the
way that we know the body is being breathed, the expansion and the contraction with each
breath, noticing the changing conditions of the body.
The body is made of a river of sensations, an ever-changing flow, nothing solid, nothing
permanent, nothing to hold on to.
The body is a manifestation of the changing nature of life itself.
Then allowing your attention, your loving awareness to settle and whatever you've been
using to anchor your meditation, whatever comes easiest, allowing your attention to connect
there with the body, with the breath, or perhaps with sounds, wherever is easiest for you to
connect with the body, stabilizing your mindfulness with this connection, not too tight and not
too loose, cultivating a kind, loving awareness.
Thank you.
You
You
You
As we practice with the foundations of mindfulness
You're welcome to
Stay with the focus on the body
Wherever it feels easiest for you to connect with
And you're also welcome as I offer instructions
For the second and third foundation
To return to the body
And you'll see that it becomes part of the whole picture
And the other ones as well
Whatever feels right for you at this time
Your connection with loving awareness
With the second foundation or the second contemplation
We invite awareness
Of what's called vadana or feeling tone
The accompanying valence of each moment
Pleasant
Unpleasant
Or neither unpleasant or pleasant
What we often call neutral
The invitation is to know the feeling tone
What is happening in the heart, mind, body
In each moment of experience
Is it pleasant?
Unpleasant?
Neutral
Inviting in this perspective, this way of holding our mindfulness
Can support in non-identification with experience
This is pleasant
This is unpleasant
Not me or mine
The changing conditions
Of the river of our life
And as we know something is unpleasant
We can bring our awareness to the body sensations
That accompany that feeling tone
What does pleasant feel like in the body in this moment?
Am I noticing it in the belly, the shoulders, hands?
What's the temperature?
What's the texture?
And as that moment passes and perhaps an unpleasant feeling tone arises
What does that feel like in the body?
What is the experience in the body of that unpleasant feeling?
Is it occurring in the heart, in the neck, shoulders?
Is there expansion or contraction?
Change in temperature, change in vibration or energy in that area
And as that moment changes to the next, not needing to hold on or concretize
And at any point you're invited to rest your awareness with your anchor in the body, the breath
If it feels like it's too busy, too complicated
Just a possibility of a way of attending mindfulness, of feeling tone
And as that moment passes and you're invited to rest your awareness with your anchor in the body
And as that moment passes and you're invited to rest your awareness with your anchor in the body
And as that moment passes and you're invited to rest your awareness with your anchor in the body
And as that moment passes and you're invited to rest your awareness with your anchor in the body
As we become settled in our meditation practice, the continuity over the days has deepened
You may find that at times the awareness goes to another experience naturally
Something happens in the body, heart, mind and the awareness is drawn to that experience
At that moment you may choose to either remain with the body or allow your attention to go to that experience
This is the practice that includes the third foundation, the mindfulness of mind
So when the experience arises, you can bring your attention to that experience
And we can practice with giving our attention to mind states, to moods, to thoughts and emotions
We may experience these as more complex, including aspects of the body, the heart and the mind
So at any point you can return to bringing your loving attention to the body if it feels confusing, complicated
For a few minutes of practice this morning you're invited to open your awareness to mental states
To what is most predominant in the mind
And as was mentioned last night, you can also note the presence or absence of mental states
Not actively searching them out, but just noting that they are present or absent
Sometimes when you're meditating, a thought will arise and then you'll notice with that thought that emotions will arise
And then you'll notice maybe perhaps some accompanying sensations in the body, certain feeling tones
So sometimes the thoughts will bring about the emotions, other times an emotion will arise
And that will bring about a thought or a story
As we open to thoughts, the invitation is to allow the changing nature of the thoughts to be the focus and not the stories themselves
To begin to notice the arising and the passing away of thoughts, stories, emotions, their impermanent nature
You don't need to search or to make the changes happen, just bringing our awareness to our mind, to whatever is in the foreground
At times it may be hard to see or experience what's in the mind, some mind states are more subtle, like non-reactivity, equanimity or calm
One way to support is to gently invite curiosity into your practice and dropping in the question, how is it now?
What is the predominant attitude or flavor in the mind?
Sometimes we may find our attention drawn to a body sensation that we might experience as unpleasant, perhaps pain in the knee or the back
And then we might notice the accompanying stories that propel us into the future, what that pain means, what will happen
Imagining from a sensation that's happening in the body in this moment
We're reaching into the past from a sensation that's arising right now
Oh, I know, three years ago this happened and now this is happening, allowing those stories to arise and pass away
And also inviting one needed to shift the position of the body with as much mindfulness as possible, inviting kindness into your meditation
When you ask the question, how is it now?
And then you pause and allow the sensation to come to the foreground, you might notice some craving, some wanting, a desire for a certain temperature in the room, desire to change your posture, desire for the meditation to be over
A wondering about lunch
You can notice wanting the presence of craving, the presence of sensual desire
Not suppressing it and not indulging it, you can note the storyline
Notice how it is in the body, with a caring, tender attitude
Perhaps when you drop in the question, how is it now?
You can feel some contraction in the body or else a thought that feels like anger or ill will
Whether the foreground is a sensation or thought
You can see how the mind and the body and the heart condition each other
Noticing the presence or their absence of anger, the presence or the absence of ill will
Can we be gentle and tender with these minds that have been conditioned in countless ways to think and plan and remember
There's not a fixed sequence to the practice, whatever tools seem beneficial for you, you can engage and explore
Noting that at times we'll get lost in the stories and that's okay
And that the moment of realizing that we've been lost is a moment of awakening, a moment of being present
Something that happens to all of us during meditation is an experience that the Buddha has called Papancha
Which is one word in Pali that describes the tendency of mind to spread out and elaborate on experience in a repetitive and obsessive kind of way
You may have some of these frequent flyers during this retreat, a thought that arises and circles and spins into a story, passes away
Only to arise again at a later time in a different configuration around a certain theme of something that's happening in your life
Something that may be happening now or in the past or in the future
This word Papancha refers to this proliferation of thought
This repetitive illusion of reality and the Buddha says that it's common to get caught in these loops that play over and over in the mind
You don't need to take it personally
You can bring our awareness to the body, to the changing nature, the river of experiences
An image that can be helpful with these repetitive patterns is that of thinking of our mindfulness as if we are on the platform at a train station
There are many trains coming and going as we stand on the platform at the train station
Occasionally the mind will jump on a train, be taken for a ride, and then we'll realize, awaken to that mind state, come back, return to the present moment
Allowing our mind, knowing that this tendency happens, don't have to personalize it, judge ourselves
Can we be mindful of the mind?
Begin to know the nature of this heart, mind, body
Invite ourselves into acceptance, with kindness and loving awareness

How is it now?
As we bring our awareness, our loving attention to the mind states
Sometimes we can begin to loosen the identification with the stories or the emotions
Instead of feeling that I am angry, I am sad
Solidifying the concept of a self who is angry
Identifying perhaps as an angry person, a sad person
Instead we can note an angry mind state is present
Or this is what anger feels like
This is what sadness feels like right now
Or perhaps contentment
This is a content mind state
A content mind state is present
This is what contentment feels like
As we bring our awareness to the weather patterns
This heart, mind, body
We can begin to see an experience in the body and the heart, the mind
What is happening in each moment with clarity
One of the benefits of bringing our mindfulness to the mind
Is we begin to see how our mind states, our thoughts, our emotions shape our perceptions
And in turn can color or shape our reality
We can see what happens when we believe the stories, when we let go of the stories
We can recognize for ourselves what it's like when we lessen the grip of these stories
And open to the heart of awareness
I'd like to end this meditation with a poem
Many of you may have heard before
It's such a potent poem by the Persian mystic poet, philosopher Rumi
It's called The Guest House
This being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor
Welcome and entertain them all
Even if they're a crowd of sorrows
Who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture
Still treat each guest honorably
Be clearing you out for some new delight
The thought, the shame, the malice
Meet them at the door laughing and invite them in
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide from beyond
So meeting each moment on unexpected visitor
Treating each guest, each visitor honorably
They may be clearing us out for some new delight
Some growth
Some unexpected beauty
Thank you for your practice
So there's some announcements before we have some times for questions
So announcements for today's
We're continuing with practice meetings
So please show up for those
There are a couple of spaces left in mine, three spots
So if you're a newer meditator and you're feeling as if you would really be supportive of your practice
To have a practice meeting today, you've already had one
For those newer people, you could see there's only three spots
And so this would just be for people who really feel like it might be needed for them
You could sign up for one of my practice meetings for today
I also wanted to mention that we've been practicing for a few days now
And there may be some pain that's arising in the body
Because we're in this practice that we may not be doing for this many hours and other days of our life
So you may want to change your posture, position, try meditating standing up
Or if you've been sitting on the floor, sitting in a chair
If you're sitting in a certain chair, you may want to, especially if you're leaning back
You may want to try putting a cushion behind your back
Just really being mindful that the body may not be accustomed to sitting or being in that particular position
And it would be good to try some other positions during the day
Of course, trying to settle during each meditation period in a way that supports your meditation is very, very helpful
There was a question about where are the poems located
So I wanted to refer to that
Okay, and I have a message here
So if somebody would like to sign up for the group
They need to email the managers because the sign up function is actually closed
Thank you so much, managers, for helping us with that
So don't actually sign up, but if you'd like to, let the managers know
Then they'll help navigate that
So you can email the managers on the link on the page
Thank you so much for that
So as I mentioned, there's only three, so it's just for people who would really need it and would really be supportive for you
The location of the poems, I know that all of you have been navigating the bulletin board as it were
And the poems can be found at the bottom of the announcements, which are actually higher up
So right at the very top, after you go through the announcements at the bottom of that section, it says these are poems
And so if you're interested in some of the poems or quotes that have been shared, that's where you will find them
I also want to notice that today is Saturday
And so if you're kind of trying to remember where we're at, today is Saturday
And we have a beautiful full day of practice today
And one of the other beautiful things about this retreat is that we have a full day of practice tomorrow
The retreat ends tomorrow at 4 p.m.
Now if you have a mind that is involved with wanting and thinking into the future at all, you may already know this
And have begun to think about that time after the retreat
And so a couple things that you can practice with with that
Is to know that that's sometimes what happens and you could gently drop in the phrase that some meditation teachers suggest of
Not now
You think about something in the next week and you say not now
And really honor the preciousness of this moment of practice that we're in
Really allowing what you've been practicing with to deepen today during this time period
One of the things that I sometimes say to myself
All the time in the world
Like just right now, like I think, oh my gosh, I gotta, this is gonna happen
All the time in the world
It's just a thought, but sometimes it helps
So just remembering and also that the retreat does go tomorrow till 4 p.m.
So that's a really wonderful thing
So don't end the retreat before the end of the retreat
Be with this practice that you're in
Be here now as we've heard said by Ram Das
Okay, the others, are there any other announcements that I miss?
Okay
So the other thing that I wanted to mention was that
There were a couple questions that people had after the meditation last night
And I wanted to say that this time in the morning is the time that we have for Q&A
And that is how to help preserve the container of the retreat
So that we can have silence for people who are meditating
And so we have this time right now for questions about your practice, about the talk
About the meditation instructions
And so I wanted to invite that right now
And I know there were some people who had them last night
Or invited to ask a question right now using the mechanical blue hand
Kumi, thank you
Hi, JD
Thank you
I wanted to know the hindrances
I found that I had a doubt and it was based on fear
And I was wondering if all the hindrances were based on fear
Is that just a question, I mean big question
Right, right, so that is a, I'm going to invite that to you as a koan
So a koan would be a question that you just hold lightly
All of the hindrances involve a kind of contraction of the mind
And you might find in your experience that the label that accompanies that is fear
So fear may be predominant for you in that
So you may find that when you sense agitation that you go be with it and underneath it it's fear
But it may be different for other people
So I would say that there's a contraction of the body, heart, mind
And that fear might be what's prevalent for you in there
But I would also just hold it lightly because it may not be so
It may be that that just happens to be one of the weather patterns that you know
Frequently arises based on the conditions of your life
Because it could be that sometimes it's grief or despair or something else under there
So there, it's, I think
What I would say is that there's a way that you can drop those questions in
Not in a way to like use the thinking mind to figure it out
Because now we're at a place where we're kind of settled into our practice and we have continuity
And we don't want to get into the analytical mind where we start trying to figure it out
We want to allow the insight, the wisdom to emerge
Does that make sense?
Yeah, it does, it does
And I will do that and also work it as a coin to explore, investigate
Answer for myself
Another question, can love and fear exist at the same time?
Well, I'm not a mother, but I have heard that from many parents that it is true
And so like for example, there's a fierce compassion that parents often have
And other people have for human beings and this passion to protect and love
And so in the Buddha's understanding, they probably are happening one after the other
But so quickly that our human minds are feeling as if they're co-arising
So they may be like fear, love, fear, love, fear, love, but it actually may feel more like this
So I wouldn't say that I'm able to discern that in every moment like that
But beautiful questions and you're, you know
Just wondering
Seeing what happens for you, you know, like what does it feel like if you're feeling, oh, the sensation of fear can be actually made up of many things
So what is actually happening when that arises?
Thank you for those questions, beautiful
Thank you
And Sharon, see Sharon has hand raised
Yes, hi, thank you Jay-Z, thank you so much for your instruction yesterday and this morning
It's been so helpful
The question I have is about Vedana and yeah, feeling tones
That sometimes I have a feeling that I can't really say
I don't know if it's, I don't know which one it is
So like in one case, I was thinking about my sister and how she had needed me
Or she had needed some support and I hadn't been available, she's autistic
And we didn't used to be close because she used to scare me but now we're very, very close
So when I thought about her wishing that she could get a hold of me and me not being available and how much I wish I was available
I felt this sadness but it was this sweetness because I used to just be horrified that she needed me and that I didn't know how to help her
But now I love that she needs me and that I'm available
So I didn't have any aversion when I thought about it
And another case is where I was thinking in a story that I was judging someone and really self-righteous but it felt great because I was right
So yeah, sometimes I'm confused about which state it is or which feeling tone it is
There's no one right feeling tone that accompanies a moment and part of this investigation is recognizing the changing nature
Like, I mean, just to use something more simple than that relationship with your sister which just sounds like it's been a beautiful area of growth and understanding in your life
Just like, you know, taking a bite of something delicious, you know, there's a point where in your mouth it's no longer delicious, it's just mush
And I'm not wanting to use that as a relationship with your sister but just the sense of the changing nature
And that also sometimes things that we think are going to be unpleasant can actually end up being pleasant
So that this intimacy that develops with someone which may be really hard and crunchy can blossom into something that's actually pleasant at times
And so seeing the Vedana, seeing clearly this moment by moment changing nature, pleasant and unpleasant, that it may not be the same at all times
And there may be times based on the causes and conditions that you're tired and something that you generally like is unpleasant
Does that make sense? Sharon?
Yes, it does. Sorry, I had to hit the mute button. It does. So it's part of what you're saying that it can happen so fast that it might seem like it's two things at once
But maybe it's actually just going really quickly from one thing to another to another
And I think the focus is more important to notice the changing than actually be like, did I get it? Did I nail it?
Because it is changing, it might be like, huh, and so that I can begin to know for myself that it's not actually about me, that this is the nature of phenomena, the summer pleasant at each moment
Okay, thank you so much. That's really helpful
All right, thank you
All right, nice to see you, Bud. Andres, you want to unmute?
This is Bud.
Speaking about hindrances, I liked your interpretation of coverings last night
And previously I've listened to many Dharma talks and hindrances were something to get rid of
Something to relieve somehow to get them out of the way
And what I got from your talk last night was that there's a value in just staying with the hindrances for a while and exploring it without having to run away from it
Yeah, thank you. And I'm also noticing the time, so I'm going to be brief here
Yeah, I think that the term hindrance, we just like, I got to get rid of this and so just even just like shifting that perspective to be, because like the, you know, when we talk about the first noble truth, the truth of suffering is the suffering is to be understood
And then there's another place on this is to be abandoned, but we don't want to just abandon it without understanding it
And so getting, you know, that understanding of, you know, what does it mean to be in that hindrance?
Like you're saying with the practice of it. So yeah, that's, yeah, I'd say don't be, you know, like there might be a little bit of like aversion to practicing with the hindrances
But I'd say they're very fruitful. We'll have more for that today. Thank you. Thank you.
So thank you all for your questions. And someone asked me again to restate about the poems and so the poems are there's a section at the top of the, that says announcements and that the bottom line of the announcements is says this is where you can find the poems and so
You should check that out. So I invite you today to continue with this practice of saying with the body, the body
Oops. Yeah, so I made a mistake and we're supposed to be in practice discussions which people have been trying to tell me in the chat here and I am, I went over, I apologize.
I was thinking it was 1115 and now I'm realizing that you were all trying to tell me something. Thank you for my delusion, my ignorance.
Good. Okay, pause poems announcements. So at the bottom of the top part of this where it says announcements, then that's where that's where the poems are there's a line that says link to the poems.
So we'll be starting the practice discussions a little bit late. So take a short break and get there as soon as you can. So we'll have a few minutes of a bio break and start them in about five minutes so it'll be 111110 probably my
My apologies to everybody for my lengthy time this morning. Thank you.
