The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Tonight, I'm just going to reflect briefly on life cycles, gratitude for cycles, life.
This is maybe another way to say it is gratitude for the emerging renewal of life in this spring, the season.
Now we have people from different parts of the country, even different parts of the world.
Whatever season it is, noticing, noticing the cyclic nature of the changes that we experienced.
And here in the Bay Area, it's impossible not to notice the budding and blooming and greening and warming and all these tiny, tiny wildflowers coming out after those great rains, the atmospheric rivers that surged over California.
And many, many, many different tiny little floral faces just emerging along the sides of sidewalks and hiking trails and all over fields, starting to hear different birds singing.
And maybe less visibly life emerging from eggs and cocoons and facilias and seeds everywhere, transforming all of it, all of it, part of the tilt of this planet, just a few degrees to or from the sun, generates all of these changes.
Amazing.
The sort of broader, broader changes, not just of the season cycle, but the phases of the moon.
The ebb and flow of the tide to the ocean.
The sunrise and sunset.
The planetary placement, constellations of placement, all of these cycles and then we look just a little deeper.
The cycles of life and death and even how death in the natural world leads to decay and compost and new life all over again.
Seamlessly intertwining and moving and shifting.
So just to take a moment to appreciate that, appreciate whatever place you are in your cycle, as a human, as a being, as a spiritual person.
This poem is by Joy Hardim called Eagle Poem.
To pray you open your whole self to sky, to earth, to sun, to moon.
The one whole voice that is you.
And know there's more that you can't see, can't hear, can't know, except in moments steadily growing and in languages that aren't always sound,
but other circles of motion.
Like eagle that Sunday morning over Salt River, circled in blue sky and wind,
set our hearts clean with sacred wings.
We see you, see ourselves and know that we must take the utmost care and kindness with all things.
Breathe in, knowing we are made of all this.
And breathe, knowing we are truly blessed because we were born and die soon within a true circle of motion.
Like eagle rounding out the morning inside us.
We pray that it will be done in beauty.
In beauty.
So, Mehta, gratitude is perhaps the closest thing in this tradition to prayer.
Not prayer to a divine being outside of us necessarily,
but an offering.
An offering and a listening, kindness, love, gratitude, appreciation.
So friends, the invitation now is to settle into a meditative posture.
Comfortable one with some alertness that will allow you to be present with yourself.
With the cycles within you and around you, the cycle of breathing for the next half hour or so.
If you haven't already, softening and closing the eyes.
And provide him that feels okay to bring a smile to your lips.
Maybe a smile to your heart.
Centering the attention on this body.
The weight of your body on the chair or cushion.
Rooted by gravity to this earth.
Feeling of warmth, vibrancy, aliveness.
Coolness perhaps, your skin.
Motion, vibration, tingling or pulsing.
And attuning to the motion in particular of your life spread.
A gentle cycle, rhythmic, up and down the belly or chest.
Subtle feeling of pleasure or maybe soothing or neutrality.
The air moving in and out the nostrils.
Inviting.
Inviting air to become breath, breath to become air.
Breathing.
Resting, resting in the moment.
And allowing the attention to collect.
Collect on the action, the rhythm, the cycle of breathing.
And noticing too, any gratitude, appreciation in your heart.
Your mind for the aliveness that's here now.
It feels right perhaps to do your hand on the heart or the belly.
Appreciating chin breath.
Offering gratitude, kindness on each other.
Knowing that sense of offering to radiate through this dying.
Through all of the aliveness.
You find thoughts, thinking. Mental activity is present.
Breathing with it.
And offering kindness to the thoughts.
Appreciation to the spaces between them.
Appreciating life's action in this body, in this moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And then we're bringing to mind perhaps hearing, imagining.
A creature, a person, a creature.
That signify for you the beauty of emerging, renewing, transforming life.
Could be a young child, an animal or different kinds then.
It's some kind of being or beings that inspire joy.
And I know it's kind.
And broadcasting, offering, radiating, good wishes to them.
Perhaps imagining them at different stages of birth, growth, allowing.
Wishing them better appreciation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm told to focus your wishes with words or phrases.
You may use these or any others that resonate more for you in your own language and rhythm.
Be safe, happy, healthy.
Be peaceful, useful, free.
Happy, healthy, peaceful, useful, free.
Words are not allowing the rhythm of these wishes to include and unfold these other ones.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're now expanding the circle of these wishes
to other creatures or beings on the edges of your life.
Words you might not think of or encounter as often.
Casual acquaintance, neighbor dog, faraway creatures, seldom seen, underfoot creatures, where they thought about.
Imagining one of them in different cycles of their birth, growth, development.
And wishing them well.
Turning to any sensations.
Come along with these wishes, any feelings of appreciation, care and kindness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Perhaps if it feels right.
Expanding the circle of kindness to the green and growing things in your life.
Proceeds to seedlings, plants and something.
Trees and cacti and forests and blossoms.
And folding them too.
Perhaps choosing one and imagining.
Bursting into life.
Offering it like that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're tuning now also to our nearest, most beloved and dear in your life.
Including them in the circle.
Purifying outwards about kindness, goodwill throughout their life cycle.
Perhaps imagining them in the past at different stages.
For example.
Save.
Happy.
Peaceful.
Be useful.
Be happy.
Turning to the wish of kindness.
And appreciation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Opening the circle.
Perhaps shining like a star.
Or as gentle as morning fog.
Allowing all beings, all living things.
To receive.
Intentioned kindness.
Including the being and mercy.
Same.
Happy.
Peaceful.
Be useful.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Then the last remaining moment or two of this meditation.
The invitation is to let God visualization.
Intention.
Words.
Just breathe with.
Receiving its present.
Whatever is flowing through right now.
With kindness.
Asking for being with.
Justice.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for the sincerity of your practice.
While we're still a little bit quiet in meditative space.
If it feels right for you.
The invitation is to take a moment to send a little pulse of meta.
Kindness to your neighbors in the Zoom room.
If you feel comfortable showing your video you can.
Leave yourself behind your tile with sending kindness.
And trusting that as you send these good wishes you're also.
Receiving them from others in this moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We have a moment or two if anyone has questions, comments, reflections they'd like to make.
You can.
We'll sit on one screen so you can probably just wave your hand or unmute yourself.
Also welcome to the things in the chat if you prefer to do it that way.
I have a question for you. What was it like to try to wish me to.
I wish I could do things at different stages of their lives.
You're muted.
You're still muted.
Such a computer illiterates.
Such a lovely meditation and.
Feel really connected to this Zoom room and beyond.
Thank you again.
Thank you for sharing.
Thank you.
So the time has come for what.
For many people is their favorite part of happy hour.
Is the optional moving into breakout group.
So know that it's optional you can decline and stay in the room main room and quietly meditate for the next seven minutes.
But encourage you encourage you to join.
You're welcome to talk about anything related to the practice, but just to offer a prompt.
Consider talking about what it's like.
To offer kindness offer friendliness appreciation.
To those that.
You included in your practice across the phases of their changes.
To those who are just more generally met for those who are transforming and being born in the spring.
So I'm going to check and make sure.
Yes, you'll have six minutes and then a 60 second warning.
I'll see you on the other side.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I hope you enjoyed the connection time.
And I'm always very curious how it went.
Anyone has anything they'd like to share.
That they realized or something helpful that they heard in the conversation.
It was a great time to share it. And if you don't want to share a whole phrase.
I would love if people would just go around and share a word or two about how you're feeling right now.
Either time and silence or time and action.
Yes.
Good evening. This is Michael.
So I feel super grateful.
Thank you, Michael.
Anybody else?
Yes.
Did I pronounce it right? Yeah, yeah.
Rose by any name is Rose. So don't worry about it.
This is my first time with you and really like that.
Late little bit.
But you know, this breakout rooms are awesome.
Even though we, you know, we just share what we think of health or dead.
Just gives us a little window into somebody else's life.
And it just gives so, you know, it nourishes us to think in a different dimension.
So I really like it. Yeah. Thank you.
Wonderful time. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Diane.
Pat who's put something in the chat calm, so restful. I just found myself drifting off.
And I so appreciate what we did this evening. Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Calm and dressless.
And someone wrote privately, thank you for the optional time to remain in the zoom room at the end of the day.
I often feel like extending the silence.
Much gratitude. Yeah.
I noticed for myself and attending these sometimes I would drop off during the breakout rooms if I didn't want to talk.
Always when I'm teaching, it's an option just to sit.
It's okay too.
Any other thoughts Ali? Yeah, hi.
Yeah, hi. Nice to be here. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Just being in this space. I mean, calm. I mean, my word is also calm, but I just get calm just even if I don't repeat the phrases just like coming and being in this space.
I don't know what it is. Just sitting here, even though sometimes I mean my mind is, you know, going different places and all that but just being here and calms me down after when I get up.
I don't know what it is.
Wonderful.
I'm happy. And it's an interesting our minds can keep going and we can calm down.
Those things can be true.
Any others.
Maybe I'll just close with reading the poem again if that's all right.
This again is equal one.
To pray you open your whole self to sky, earth, to sun to moon, to one whole voice that is you.
You know there's more that you can't see, can't hear, can't know, except in moments, steadily growing, and in languages that aren't always sound, but other circles of motion.
Like eagle, that Sunday morning over Salt River, circled in blue sky and wind, swept our hearts clean with sacred wings.
We see you, see ourselves and know that we must take the utmost care and kindness in all things.
Breathe in knowing we are made of all this and breathe knowing we are truly blessed because we were born and die soon within a true circle of motion.
Like eagle, rounding up the morning inside us.
We pray that it will all be done in beauty.
So thank you all very much for your kind attention, for your practice, for your sincerity for this community, and to authenticate the merit.
May our practice here together be cause and condition for greater peace, calm, gratitude and appreciation in our lives and in all the lives we touch directly and indirectly.
May all beings everywhere be happy, be safe, be healthy, be peaceful and free.
Thank you very much, feel free to unmute and say goodbye to your fellow Sangha mates.
Goodbye, thank you.
Thank you all, good night, thanks for coming.
