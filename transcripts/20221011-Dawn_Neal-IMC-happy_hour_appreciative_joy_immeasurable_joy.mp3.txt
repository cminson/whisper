 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay. So welcome again to Happy Hour. And tonight I want to talk about one of the four immeasurable heart qualities called brahma biharas sometimes. And I'm not sure how recently you've heard about this one. It is mudita. Mudita, together with metta, karuna, and upeka, or loving kindness, compassion, and equanimity, is one of the four core heart practices, expressions of Buddhist love in the early Buddhist tradition and the not too early Buddhist tradition. The term in Pali is often translated, perhaps even most commonly translated, as sympathetic joy or empathetic joy. But there are other translations. I just want to list some of them and maybe feel into your heart and feel what they feel like. It's all have different resonances. Unselfish joy. Altruistic joy. Appreciative joy. So it just gives you a flavor, right? The path of purification, one of the main commentaries in the Buddhist discourses, has a little phrase used to translate mudita, which is the joy or gladdening of the heart and mind that is produced by others' good fortune. The gladdening produced by others' good fortune. And while I'm on the kind of wonky poly kick, mudita is past participle of the verb mudati, which means to rejoice, to enjoy yourself, to be satisfied. So, real life example, I just got back from the wedding of two very good friends, dear friends, and there was just this celebratory joy in the air. I could feel it. There were about 90 people there and it was just palpable. And that joy was in my heart. It was easy to feel joy for their joy, to feel appreciation for their good fortune. Perhaps you can think of an event recently or an instance of someone dear to you. Something good happened and it just makes you feel good. My first discovery of mudita was actually kind of by accident. It was before I had been really educated in all four of the immeasurables. I'd had sort of a glancing introduction, but I went to Burma for a two-month intensive metta retreat and was following very classic instructions, very simple instructions for that. And one of the preparatory practices for loving kindness is actually to consider the virtues, the good qualities of whoever you're directing the loving kindness to. And I would get so into this with my objects of metta that I would be considering the good qualities and the good things they've done and I had this kind of you-go attitude in my mind. And it got very bubbly and very happy. It was a great launching point for loving kindness practice. I didn't realize until years later that it was actually shading into mudita. It shades in. Edward Kansay, a scholar, talks about this as does the very famous translator monk, Nyanapanaka. He was Bekubodi, the translator of much of the polycanon. Nyanapanaka was his mentor and they translated the middle-length discourses together. So this celebratory, kind of bubbly happiness. So classically, mudita is considered to be an antidote for envy and jealousy. This is also from the commentaries. And its far enemies, the opposites during the practice itself, are actually considered to be aversion and boredom. But some people do have envy come up too, of course. The near enemy, the thing that can disguise itself as metta, or I'm sorry, mudita, but isn't quite mudita, is a smugness or a preoccupation with one's own worldly game. So kind of a self-satisfied, like I did it myself. But this preoccupation with one's own good fortune in a way that is not just about gratitude, but about something a little bit more self-congratulatory and smart. And that said, feeling pleased, feeling grateful for the blessings each of us have in our lives, appreciative of what's been received and how it's been received and the other contributors to it, appreciative of our own virtues or good qualities. All of those are very wholesome and very homor leading and could even be considered, and this is my gloss on it, a form of mudita for self, a form of appreciative joy for ourselves. So you can see the difference, right? So mudita for self again overlaps with that preparatory practice for metta, for loving kindness, just like I talked about on that long retreat. So, while appreciative joy isn't always accessible, it's well worth cultivating. It has this ease, this happiness, this joyfulness, this bubbliness as a part of it when it's fully in bloom. And even when it's not, it's a way of conditioning the heart and the mind to be more receptive to gladness, happiness, joy, contentment in our lives. In part because, as to paraphrase Dalai Lama, being happy for others increases your odds of happiness by millions to one, right? So movement of the mind can be really helpful. So all that said, are you ready to do some practice? Awesome. Let's do some thumbs up. So what I'm going to do right now is take off the ability to unmute yourselves. And this is just so that if people join us on phones or other devices mid meditation, they don't accidentally create a bunch of static. If you need to chat me about volume, chat me, I open my eyes occasionally. And my voice will get a little bit softer than this, but it should be. So, please find a comfortable posture, balance of ease, relaxation, and alertness. And in any of these heart quality meditations, it's really nice to emphasize the ease part a little bit more. So, find a way that your back is comfortable, your body is comfortable, your heart and mind are comfortable. If it helps to turn away from the screen, please feel free. And softening the eyes, closing them, that's comfortable for you. And finding a place of stillness. Taking a moment to take stock of this body, this heart, this mind, just exactly as they are. Sensations, sounds in the room perhaps. The general tone, attitude, mood of your heart and mind right now. Just allowing that. Noticing what's obvious. And I'm going to give instructions for settling the heart and mind by using the breath. If you have another anchor of attention that works better for you, please feel free to tune me out and use that. And scanning through the body. Noticing any tension or relaxation in the forehead and scalp and softening. Noticing the cheeks, the jaw, lips and tongue. And softening around any tension there. Perhaps allowing an out breath, repressed lips. There's a way of inviting the lips, the jaw, the throat to relax. Saffusing awareness through the occiput, the back of the skull where it meets the neck. Allowing those muscles there to soften. Perhaps even allowing the neck, shoulders, upper spine to soften as well. If it's helpful you can shrug your shoulders up towards your ears and allow them to drop down and relax. Noticing any movement, warmth, relaxation in the chest, the side ribs, the mid-back and the belly. As your life's breath moves in and out. If it feels comfortable, allowing one or two slightly deeper or longer or slower breaths. Releasing breakfast tension in the exhale. Allowing the attention to rest and the body breathing while still also acknowledging the hips, the buttocks and legs, thighs, calves, ankles, feet. And grounding, grounding yourself in this moment here. Allowing the whole body to be known all at once and settling in on the sensations of aliveness of the breath and the body. Allowing the attention to rest and the belly. If other thoughts, emotions or anything else come in and move this heart and mind away from the moment. See how graciously, kindly, they can be acknowledged. As this too, happening now. And perhaps disengaging or allowing them to fade. Allowing the breathing in the body to be the center of attention, the forefront. Allowing the attention to rest and the belly. Allowing the attention to rest and the belly. And now attuning to the breathing, bringing the bulk of your attention to your heart center. It can be the area around your physical heart or all the sensations of breathing in the center of your chest and solar plexus. And allowing the sense of appreciation for your life's breath as it presents in the heart. Noticing the sensations there. Maybe even imagining breathing in and out directly from the heart center if that works for you. And if not, just noticing the sensations there. And while maintaining a sense of contact with this breathing, calling to mind a person or a being who's simple, easy to appreciate, easy to feel joy for. Be the visualization of an image of them. Maybe a felt sense of them as if they're in the room with you. Or even just the idea, concept of this other one. And imagining or recalling a sense of their goodness, their virtues, and any good fortune or happiness they may have in their lives. It can be an event. It can be an ongoing situation. It can be something intrinsic to who they are and how they show up. Breathing out a sense of this appreciation. Offering as if with a gesture. Breathing in, maybe just noticing exactly whatever sensations or feelings are in this heart, this body, this mind related to this other one. Some people imagine a soft light emanating from them towards this other one. Or a fog-like mist. Or just the offering itself. Be a chin breath, appreciating these good intentions. If this feels resonant for you, please feel free to continue wordlessly offering. Appreciate joy, appreciation, unselfish gladness to this other person or being. And if it's helpful, it's also possible to use words or phrases to hone your intention. We'll offer a few. Please feel free to use them or shorten them to build concentration. Or to use words entirely of your own in your own language. May your joy and good fortune increase. May your success continue. I appreciate you and your goodness. I'm happy you're happy. Repeating one or more of these phrases. If it feels right, or phrases of your own, while imagining this other one, receiving them, resonating with them. Perhaps a change in the energy in the room, or the expression in their face or in their eyes. May your joy increase. May your good fortune continue. I appreciate you and your goodness. I'm happy you're happy. Thank you. Thank you. From time to time, checking in, how it feels to be offering appreciative joy, empathy, appreciation, feeling that feeling of generosity in your heart. Whatever else might be there. Allowing everything. And now, tuning into that other one for a moment, and imagining them offering this same appreciation to you. If it's easier, you can simply wordlessly exchange appreciation, joy, happiness, or whatever kind of offering of good wishes are appropriate for you to receive from them. It can also be helpful to imagine, seeing, or wishing these things together. For you together. Something like this. May our joy and good fortune increase. May our good qualities increase and become abundant. We're happy to be happy. Allowing these wishes and pensions to radiate through your whole body, like that soft light. The moisture of a beautiful foggy morning. We're like the light of a star touching every cell. Every organ, every part of the body, heart, and mind. Joyful. Appreciative. Happy. Drinking in these good wishes from this other one, and offering in a cycle. What? Allowing this appreciative joy. Unselfish joy to radiate out. Perhaps from the two of you, or just from this heart, this mind, this body. Wishing anyone in its path. May your joy and virtue and goodness increase. Allowing those wishes to land wherever it feels right. Radiating outwards like a star, or perhaps just suffusing outwards gently. Like fog on the morning breeze, misture the mountains as far or as near as feels right to you. May your goodness and virtue increase. Thank you. May happiness and joy in the world increase. Thank you. Thank you. In the last couple of moments or so of this meditation, letting go of particular broadcasting, of mudita, good feelings, letting go of any images, and turning the lens of attention back to this body, this heart, this mind. Appreciating, appreciating the generosity of heart, appreciating the intentions, regenerating unselfish joy, and settling into the moment just allowing whatever is flowing through. To be accepted, acknowledged, allowed to flow through, unimpeded. Breathing with it. Thank you. Thank you all for the sincerity of your practice. So before we transition to the more vocal part of the evening, I'd like to invite you to do something that's kind of become a little bit of a custom, the nights I teach here, which is to take a moment. And whether seen or unseen, whether here or past participants or future listeners, to send kindness, appreciation to the other people that are part of this global heart qualities Sangha. If you want, you can scroll through and look at their tiles. If you want to turn on your video, you can, you don't have to. But sending this appreciation, this nectar to others, and knowing that as you're doing it, you're receiving it from every other person on this call. You can scroll through as well. Each of you are in my method. My heart. So I've now changed the security settings where you can unmute yourself. And since we've got a healthy number of folks tonight. If you have a meditation, please use your Zoom hand and offer that you can also put it in the chat. If you're a little bit shy to talk in the group or don't want to be on the recording, I will share chats anonymously during this time. Any thoughts or nightstands? Questions and answer for me. Yes, Greg, please. Yeah, this is a question. So, I guess, both extension of what loving kindness to folks that you close easily to and, and of course, just spans the whole range over to folks where it's difficult. I mean, I've been experimenting with this, but let's just say you're sort of dealing with sort of a wellspring of animosity towards somebody who's particularly provocative. Or at least you consider them provocative. You're interpreting it that way. Any guidance or ideas on taming the fiery dragon inside. That's a great image. Thank you. Yes, the fiery dragon inside towards the person we experience as difficult, provocative. So, a couple of thoughts. First is just a name and you may be well aware of this, Greg, but metapractice. And it's related from avijaras, including the one that we did tonight, Modita. There are also purification practices so it's kind of like using a magnet to pull up metal from sand, like metal filings from sand, it will draw up not just the beautiful qualities but their opposites. It is not uncommon for any and any of these practices for some people, even most people some of the time to experience their opposites that's why I talked tonight about the far enemy. Because it's just part of it, it is in there from millennia ago that this will come up for some people, most people at some point in their practice. At that point, allowing mindfulness to come to bear and observing it and observing how unpleasant it is. Right. For most of us, there might be a short burst, a positive hit of energy at the beginning of anger or resentment but the longer it stays around the worse it feels right. The, the, the discourses talk about it being the equivalent of picking up a hot coal to throw it someone else. Who gets burned first right so that that's the first notion, and then the second one is actually technique, and this comes was inspired by Sharon Salzberg but I think at this point I've adapted the language to where it's more my own. She suggests, when dealing with the difficult people or people we find difficult that, and this includes people who are truly harmful, I often get sort of the hip or question, if you will, to modify the phases a little bit. For example, may you experience loving kindness and its benefits, such as wisdom and non harming. Or when I used tonight when we went to radiating appreciative joy or altruistic joy out just generally. May your goodness and virtue increase. Those are causes of happiness. And they're also invitations to whoever is receiving them to become less harmful or provocative or difficult to be around. Those are some thoughts that hit the mark, or am I missing something. I think you're in the right, right area, the idea of wishing them to become a little more aware about things is something I can probably probably manage. So, yeah. Cool. Thank you. You're welcome. Someone writes during this it. I was thinking about the mood detail I feel towards dogs when I see them happily wagging their tail and it brings me great joy and warmth to recall. I am right there with you. Dogs are teachers of moody tech. I think, like, just their happy wagging bodies and they're often friendly faces. It's not an accident that many people find dogs a really helpful meditation object. So, we have come to the part of happy hour that many people find their favorite part, which is the invitation to gather into small breakout groups and talk about this practice. So, before you run off and log off, just want to say it's optional, you can refrain from joining a group I will rebalance them, if some people don't join, and just hang out here and meditate until the breakout group ends, and then rejoin the rest of us for the very end. So, getting a sense here. A prompt, maybe just what is most easy to generate joy for others about what situations are easiest for you. And what situations are easiest to feel joy for yourself. And if you don't like that prompt, feel free just to discuss how the practice was or related practices. So, I will set these for five minutes. We have a countdown of 30 seconds after that. And I'll see you on the other side. Everybody welcome back. Welcome, welcome back. So we have just a few minutes left. Just want to open the floor if anyone has comments about how that was I'd love to hear. Anyone that came up for you or that you heard that was meaningful to you. Yeah, Nancy, please. It seemed really short tonight, I don't know. It just, but yeah, I think we were all appreciating a lot about just getting started in the day. What you start your day with and trying to start with something joyful and connecting with other people. Lovely, beautiful. Yeah, and it seemed short because it was one minute shorter than usual, perhaps I am neglected to shift the breakouts. So that was not your imagination. It was a big minute. Thank you. Welcome any other thoughts, themes that might be helpful to share with the group. Benefits other people to. I have a question. So, you used, I think I used the phrase on selfish joy as a possible than a number of some similar definition from another person's experience. I don't know maybe you can speak to that a little bit what you see the difference between the two and I think the main difference there is that moody to has embedded in it. The relationship. So, with moody to it's always about relationship, even if it's moody to herself, in quotes here and air quotes. It's in the relational realm. And so there are shades right like it's possible to experience PT or pamodra other forms of joy. During moody to practice in fact I'd say it's not uncommon on retreat, especially. But the way it narrows it down to moody to is that it's about beings, as opposed to just, wow, right, just radiating and just experiencing. Does that helpful at all. Great. We have come to the top of the hour, friends. So, thank you for your practice. I want to dedicate the benefits of the practice. So may the time, the energy, the beautiful intentions of our practice here together, regardless of outcome, radiate out to benefit, not just ourselves, but every life we touch and every life they touch, and so on and so on. And circles, ever widening through the world and all the beings in it. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be healthy as much as possible. May all beings know the highest joy of awakening and liberation. Thank you for your practice you're welcome to unmute and say goodbye to each other if you like. Thank you, Dawn. Thank you, Dawn. Thank you, Dawn. I'd like to say that closing prayer you just offered was really excellent. Thank you so much, Greg. I don't know why but it really just grabbed me I've got to go look at the recording of this but thank you for that I've got to add that to my little list of quotes so thank you so much. Thank you so much. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
