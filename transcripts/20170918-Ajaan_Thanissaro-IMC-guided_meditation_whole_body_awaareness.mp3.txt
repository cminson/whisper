For the meditation this evening, I'd like to offer a few ideas. 
So if you're happy with the meditation that you normally do, go ahead and do that. 
If you'd like to try something new, try this. 
Start with thoughts of goodwill. 
A wish for your own happiness, your own true happiness, and a wish for the true happiness of others. 
Because true happiness comes from within, there's no conflict between the two. 
The more you can develop your inner resources, the more you have to offer to others. 
Remember, the true happiness has to come from your actions. 
So when you're wishing true happiness for yourself, you're basically saying, may I understand the causes for true happiness and be able to act on them. 
When you extend the same thought to others, you're basically saying, may they understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on them. 
And that's a thought you can have for anyone without hypocrisy. 
So start with thoughts of goodwill for yourself. 
Tell yourself, may I be truly happy. 
And then spread the same thought to others. 
Start with people who are close to your heart, your family, very close friends. 
May they find true happiness too. 
And then spread those thoughts out, never widening circles. 
People you know well and like. 
People you like even though you don't know them so well. 
People you're more neutral about. 
And people you don't like. 
Remember, the world would be a much better place if everyone could find true happiness within. 
Spread thoughts of goodwill to people you don't even know. 
And not just people, living beings of all kinds. 
East, west, north, south. 
Above and below, out to infinity. 
May we all find true happiness in our hearts. 
Then bring your attention to the breath. 
Take a couple of good long deep in and out breaths and notice how the breathing feels and where you feel it most prominently in the body. 
It's the movement of energy in the body that we'll be focusing on. 
The movement that allows the air to come in and out of the lungs. 
Which is one of many layers of energy that you can detect when the mind gets really still. 
Focus on where you feel the energy move most blatantly. 
And ask yourself, does long breathing feel good? If it does, keep it up. 
If not, you can change. 
Make it shorter or shallow, heavier, lighter, faster, slower. 
You can either systematically experiment with different kinds of breathing or you can just pose a question of the mind each time you breathe in. 
What kind of breathing would feel good now? And see how the body responds. 
If your thoughts wander off to something else not related to the breath, you don't have to follow them. 
Just drop them and you'll be back at the breath. 
If you find yourself following them again, drop them again. 
Each time you come back to the breath, reward yourself with a breath that feels especially rewarding and gratifying. 
So it'll be more and more inclined to want to come back. 
And as for any pains there may be in the body, you don't have to pay them any attention right yet. 
Focus on the areas of the body that you can make comfortable with the breathing. 
Now as the breathing gets comfortable, there is a tendency to lose focus, in other words, to drop your focus on the breath and focus more on the sense of comfort. 
Which means you're leaving your foundation. 
So to counteract that tendency, the next step is to breathe in and out aware of the entire body. 
And a good way to build up to that is to go through the body first section by section to familiarize yourself with how the breathing process feels in the different parts of the body. 
So you can allow all those parts to connect. 
Start down around the navel. 
Look at that part of the body in your awareness and watch it for a while as you breathe and breathe out. 
See what kind of breathing feels good there. 
If you notice any tension in that part of the body, allow it to relax. 
If there's any sense of blockage, think of it dissolving away. 
See that no new tension builds up as you breathe in and you're not holding on to any tension as you breathe out. 
Now move your attention up to the solar plexus, the area right in front of the stomach. 
And follow the same three steps there. 
In other words, one, locate that part of the body in your awareness. 
Two, watch it for a while as you breathe in and breathe out to see what kind of breathing feels good there. 
And three, if there's any sense of tension, tightness or blockage, think of it dissolving away. 
Now move your attention up to the solar plexus, the area right in front of the stomach. 
Now move your attention up to the solar plexus, the area right in front of the stomach. 
Now move your attention up to the middle of the chest. 
And follow the same steps there. 
Now move your attention up to the solar plexus, the area right in front of the stomach. 
Now move your attention up to the solar plexus, the area right in front of the stomach. 
Now move your attention up to the solar plexus, the area right in front of the stomach. 
Now move your attention to the base of the throat and follow the same steps there. 
Now move your attention to the base of the throat and follow the same steps there. 
Now move your attention to the base of the throat and follow the same steps there. 
Now move your attention to the base of the throat and follow the same steps there. 
And now come to the middle of the head. 
As you breathe in, think of the breath energy coming in, not only through the nose but also through the eyes and the ears. 
In from the back of the head down from the top of the head, going deep into the brain. 
As you breathe out, think of it radiating out from the head in all directions, dissolving away any patterns of tension you may feel, say, around the eyes, the jaws, the back of the neck. 
Working through those patterns of tension and dissolving them away. 
Now move your attention to the base of the throat and follow the same steps there. 
Now move your attention to the base of the throat and follow the same steps there. 
Now move your attention to the base of the throat and follow the same steps there. 
Now focus your attention at the back of the neck or at the base of the skull. 
As you breathe in, think of the breath energy entering there and then going down the neck, the shoulders, the arms out to the tips of the fingers. 
As you breathe out, think of it radiating out from all those parts of the body into the air. 
And as you get more sensitive to these parts of the body, if you notice that you're holding more tension at one side than the other, allow that side to relax, to bring things into balance. 
And see if you can keep it relaxed all the way through the breath, all the way through the out. 
Now move your attention to the base of the throat and follow the same steps there. 
Now keep your attention focused at the back of the neck. 
As you breathe in, think of the breath energy entering there and then going down both sides of the spine down to the tailbone. 
As you breathe out, think of it radiating out from the entire spine into the air. 
And as you get more sensitive to the back, if you notice you're holding more tension at one side than the other, allow that side to relax. 
And see if you can keep it relaxed as you breathe in, as you breathe out. 
And as you breathe in, think of it radiating out from the entire spine into the air. 
And as you breathe in, think of it radiating out from the entire spine into the air. 
And as you breathe in, think of it radiating out from the entire spine. 
And as you breathe out, think of it radiating out from all those parts of the body into the air. 
And again, if you find that you're holding more tension at one leg than the other, see if you can let that side relax. 
And allow it to stay relaxed all the way through the in-breath, all the way through the out. 
And as you breathe in, think of it radiating out from the entire spine into the air. 
And as you breathe in, think of it radiating out from the entire spine into the air. 
And as you breathe in, think of it radiating out from the entire spine into the air. 
And as you breathe in, think of it radiating out from the entire spine into the air. 
And as you breathe in, think of it radiating out from the entire spine into the air. 
The range of your awareness may have a tendency to shrink, especially in the out-breath. 
So each time you breathe in, think whole body. 
Each time you breathe out, think whole body. 
And allow the breath to find whatever rhythm or texture feels best in the context of this full body of awareness. 
If you find that your focus is beginning to blur, go back to the survey of the body, otherwise stay right here. 
You're not radiating this center-broad awareness like a candle in an otherwise dark room. 
The flame of the candle is at one spot, but its light illumines the entire room. 
This sort of awareness is healing for the body, healing for the mind. 
It's still and all around. 
It provides a good foundation for inside to show rise. 
So make sure that this foundation is strong. 
So that when the insides do come, they'll be more reliable. 
So, that's a good foundation. 
And that's a great foundation for the body. 
So make sure that your focus is beginning to blur.
