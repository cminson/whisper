Practice Note: Heightened Awareness

Using the breath – the breathing – as a stabilizing focal 
point for mindfulness  sometimes work s nicely. T he mind 
wanders off ; you come back to the breath. There are a 
lot of sounds, and your mind goes to the sounds; then 
you come back to the breath .  
 
But some times this sets up tension with  something  else 
that’s  actively happening , which is different from the  
breathing . In those circumsta nces it’s  sometimes useful  
not to focus on the breath , but to bring the attention to 
what is happening with you . Or to say it in a different 
way, and this is what I want  to emph asize  this morning , 
one way of doing mindfulness is  to bring your attention 
– a more heightened attention – to where your mind 
wants to go on its own. Rather than controlling your 
mind , or directing your mind to the breath or something 
else, you can give a certain  freedom to your mind to 
have the experienc e to do what it’s doing . And then 
notice w hat the mind is doing.  Notice w hat is the most 
active thing happening for you, but n ot just in your mind. 
What might be most active are sensations in your body. 
What might be most active  in your field of perce ption  
are the sounds outside. What might be most active are certain emotions. W hat might be most acti ve is the 
thinking mind going  a hundred miles an hour . The point 
is not to engage as if any of that is wrong or is 
supposed to be different , but rather  to bring a 
heightened attention to what is  already happening.  
 
What’s acti ve for you? What’s up for you as you’re here, 
sitting , or walking? And then  for whatever is up , can you 
bring a heigh tened awareness to that? T he heighten ed 
awareness is mindfulness . The heightened awareness 
is not meant to be thinking about it further. I t’s not to 
engage in the content  of what you’re thinking about. I t’s 
not to engage in the meaning or in the interpretation of 
what’s happening.  
 
But stay very simple . What is up for  me? How can I just 
step back? Heightened awareness means  to have an 
overview of it , or an under -view of it , or an inner view of 
it – some  way of being connected to it without being 
entangled  – without thinking more about it , or wondering 
about it , or fantasizing about it .  
 
I think the approach I’m trying to emphasize i s a very 
beautiful one because it means you are not  in conflict 
with anything . There’s no conflict going . Rather your 
effort is to try to bring a heightened at tention to it. Some 
people find that the language of intimacy is nice for 
heightened awareness . Others  prefer stepping back and 
observing from a distance .   
You might see if you can practice this way  today . Notice  
what’s up for you . Instead of letting go o f what’s up  – 
instead of turning away from it and focusing back  on the 
breath  – turn towards it in a calm, fuller way , and see 
how that unfolds for you. Thank you.
