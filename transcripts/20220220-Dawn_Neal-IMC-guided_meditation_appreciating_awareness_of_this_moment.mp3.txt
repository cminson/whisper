 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me okay? Is volume alright? Okay. If this is a little bit soft, if one of you could turn up Gil's microphone at tiny hair, up on the board, all the way to your left. Yeah. Okay. Is this a little bit too loud? This is good. Okay. So, welcome. Welcome, everyone, and welcome anyone online watching. Very happy to be here today. My name is Dawn Neal, and I'm a long-time practitioner in this Sangha. I've been teaching for about 10 years, and we're just going to sit together. So, the invitation is to settle back into a comfortable yet alert posture. It can be helpful to start with two or three intentional breaths, perhaps a bit deeper than normal. Allowing any excess tension to flow outwards on the out breath. Letting go on the out breath. And allowing the breathing to return to normal, whatever that is for you today. Taking a moment to establish awareness, establish mindfulness in this body. Noticing the details of your posture. Noticing sensations. Warmth or cool. Tension or relaxation. Perhaps allowing acknowledgments of sound. And acknowledging any energy left over from what it took to get to your meditation spot. And allowing the heart, the mind to rest, to settle into whatever meditation anchor, primary object, feels most hospitable. Perhaps the sensations of the body, especially the sensations of breathing. Allowing thoughts of then or there to feed to the periphery. And settling into here, into this, this moment. Allowing your awareness to become intimate with the felt sense of this moment. Allowing sounds to come and go. Sensations to come and go. Greeting, each arising. What's this breath like? This moment. Greeting. Inviting awareness to suffuse through the entire body. Inviting the body to soften, relax. If a sensation or sound or thought pulls the attention away, the suggestion is to gently, kindly acknowledge it. And allow the attention to settle back. Riding waves of breath for sensation. Or the general felt sense of being here. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. From time to time, refreshing the awareness. Noticing mindfulness, perhaps re-emerging, or perhaps continuous and steady. Either way, appreciating the awareness of this moment. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now.
