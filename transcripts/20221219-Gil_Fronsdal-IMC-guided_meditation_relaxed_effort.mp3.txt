Hello everyone.
Welcome to this beginning of the week meditation.
And I want to begin with a little saying, cliche that I like to say,
but to say it for the purpose of this meditation.
And that is, Buddhist practice, mindfulness practice, does not work if you don't do it.
And this simple idea that we have to do it is actually at the heart of what's necessary to engage in, to think about, to be involved in.
But what I'd like to propose today is as you're meditating from time to time, you'll notice you're not practicing.
You're lost in thought or you've drifted away or something falling asleep.
And when that happens, then you can not just kind of then gear up and tighten up and really do the practice,
but rather to appreciate that recognizing that you weren't doing it, recognizing you're not doing it, that is mindfulness.
That's that. You're actually doing it when you're recognizing you're not doing it.
And why that is, why that's useful to see it this way is that that simple recognition, hopefully relaxed the first initial, see, oh, I'm not doing it.
That is kind of clear, but relaxed.
It's not forceful. There's no strain. There's no tension, hopefully, in that simple recognition.
Oh, I'm not doing it. And rather than then buckling up, gearing up to do the practice, build on that.
Continue in that kind of ease, that kind of simplicity to begin again with your breathing, maybe inviting your breath back in.
And there's something about this relaxed but then diligent attention.
And diligent doesn't mean straining, but it means that we keep doing it.
So relaxed awareness of the present where the effort is made to keep that relaxed awareness as continuous as possible.
And we know it's not possible to really stay continuously continuous.
The continuity has been interrupted.
You'll have an opportunity again to recognize, oh, I'm not doing the practice.
And so it begins again.
So establishing yourself in a meditation posture that supports both alertness and relaxation.
Gently closing your eyes.
And to relax your body.
Take a few long, slow, deep breaths, feeling whatever tension there is in the body as you inhale.
Relaxing whatever can be relaxed in the body as you exhale.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
And with a normal breath on the inhale, feel your thinking mind.
And on the exhale, see if you can calm the thinking mind.
Let it settle.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
And then settling into your breathing.
Noticing if there's any ways in which your breathing is tense or held through resistance to either breathing in or breathing out.
And if there is, can you lighten up, ease up any tension associated with breathing?
And then settling into mindfulness or breathing as if you're going to do it for the long haul.
Each breath is a breath to be aware of in a relaxed, diligent way.
And if your mind wanders off and you're not doing the practice, when you eventually realize that, appreciate the simplicity of that realization, the earliest inklings of it.
And if it's relaxed, let that be the basis for relaxed awareness that begins again with the breathing.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
How are you doing the practice?
Or might you be doing the practice half-heartedly with your attention divided between kind of being present for the breathing, but mostly involved in thinking?
And if there's a kind of aware breathing, appreciate that and then put more attention into that focus on breathing.

I appreciate how wonderful it would be if people were safe and happy.
Their lives could be peaceful, safe, free, unburdened, with no oppression.
And wishing that, extending that, wishing that your life can contribute to a better world.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.
Thank you.
