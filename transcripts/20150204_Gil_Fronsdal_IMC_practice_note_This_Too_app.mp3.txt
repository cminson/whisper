Practice Note : This Too

Sometimes, there are little phrases used in our practice 
that can point to some particular aspect of  how to be 
mindful of  what’ s going on. Today, I would like to offer 
you the phrase , “This too.” This too  has to be included.  
 
Often , when we are sitting, we can be so absorbed in 
something that we don’t really notice the bigger picture  
of what’s going on . We could be focusing on one thing,  
and trying to avoid something else. We could be fighting  
or resisting something. There are all ki nds of things we 
can do that make our attention partial  or preferential, by 
cutting something else out.  
 
Part of the freedom  that comes with mindfulness  is 
when the awareness is ab le to hold everything in it. 
So ”this too ” has to be included.   
 
As you  practice today, what is it that you have to include 
in order to be more at peace? What is it that you have to 
be aware of , so that you are not fighting, not resisting, 
or not accepting what’s happening here in the present 
moment? “This too ” I have to be present for.  What do I 
have to open my attent ion to , as part of the practice  – as opposed to keeping something at bay, at a distance?   
 
Here at IMC we have a lot of tr ain sounds and traffic 
sounds. It could be that sounds like that are not fa miliar 
to you . It may seem like a lot of nois e. You coul d sit 
here and complain , saying, “What did these people do, 
getting a meditation center right next to a busy 
intersection and train tracks?  They should have known 
better.”  That’ s one way to go. Anothe r way  to go is, 
“This too has to be included. The sounds of the traffic 
have to be included.” This too . Can you find your peace 
in this phrase, “This too” ?  
 
I hope you enjoy this too. Thank you.
