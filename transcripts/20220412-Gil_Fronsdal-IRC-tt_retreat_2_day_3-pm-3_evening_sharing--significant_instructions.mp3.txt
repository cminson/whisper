You're soon and I'm like, yeah, it's really easy, but we didn't designate.
So, that's jazz for you.
One time performance.
That's right. That's right. I had to be there.
That's right.
I'm just sad about that because the feedback is so excellent.
Yeah, I'm sad about that too. I forgot to rewrite you.
So, I want to share the marvel I have and the sense of wonder and appreciation and kind of amazement that...
I walked up these steps to Xen Center in 1975 with a little backpack and pink pants.
And hair down to here.
And now I'm sitting here with all of you who I have a lot of confidence for.
And it's amazing that you guys have the skill and the ability and the heart and the dedication to do what we've done so far.
We can find parts of what you did and kind of, you know, when you're all close in to the details,
we can point out details about how it should be different or one way or the other,
but it's just like mind-blowing that this should even exist, that this is possible,
that we're doing this kind of thing and teaching meditation and interested in it and want to do it.
It's just like it's kind of an amazing thing that that kid, you know, 1975 would have been in awe of all of you,
you know, sneaked into and watched and seen what was going on.
And so I have a lot of confidence in all of you.
I also have a lot of confidence in what I'm seeing evolving here during this retreat,
the way that we're all talking with each other and the way the feedback is going and the discussions about what's happening.
And this gives me a lot of confidence that if this can keep going, that you will all grow,
our whole scene will grow and develop.
You will grow and develop as individuals.
And also I think we'll get closer to each other, I hope.
So it was really, really satisfying for me to see how you guys are also kind of talking about all this
and sharing and responding.
So I just want to share that. It was really great to see it.
And so we have just an open session now for an open discussion.
And I'm not trying for the fireside chat thing again.
You were there. What I tried to do.
I missed last night, but when I tried to do, that was the problem, right, trying to do it.
So anyway, this is an open discussion for you to bring up anything,
anything at all that you want to bring up about what we've done so far,
about the teacher training or the Dharma.
Andre and I are available now for the doors open, like for anything.
And it could be for us, it could be that it's a discussion the whole group has.
But I thought we just wanted to have an open session and see what came out, came up.
Partly I'm the inspiration or the request for this kind of session,
because it felt like it could have been useful and we have a couple planned in this retreat.
But, you know, if this one is like, you know, a silence for 30 minutes,
then we'll probably get rid of the other ones.
So make use of this one. If you, if you think this will be useful, make use of it.
Thank you.
Turn it on.
Wow, it's on.
I wanted to say something kind of in relation to the last session,
which also applies to yesterday afternoon session,
which is that two o'clock in the afternoon is a time in my circadian rhythm
when I'm beginning to fade, and actually three o'clock is kind of a bad time for me,
but I'm doing okay right now.
And so I think, you know, like what I said about Dawn's introduction,
and then it was, I was actually reminded of it by what Andrea said,
which was, you know, she had the same sense it was quite meditative,
but she was able to stay with it.
I wasn't. That, that has to do with this.
And then that, what that makes me think of is often on the short retreats,
you know, the four day retreats that we do here in the afternoon at two o'clock,
we give instruction.
And often it seems to me like, maybe it's not the best time.
No, so I just, something for us to think about, you know,
in terms of when we're in that, in that position of organizing that kind of retreat.
Or change how the instruction is done.
Yeah.
It could be energetically, maybe it's not a meditation,
and maybe, you know, I'm just talking spontaneously, wildly.
It could be that you have everyone stand,
and then talk, do standing meditation and talk about mindfulness of something.
And then sit down.
And you talk, and teacher talks with a more energetic voice,
and keeps people entertained even.
And then at some point sits down.
Yeah, that's a possibility.
And usually what happens is it's about, on the second day,
it will be about thinking.
You know, there'll be mindfulness of thinking at that period.
And people are, kind of, they're more dreaming than thinking.
So it's kind of...
Who was...
Yeah, there was a bunch of them up there.
So we could both...
Why don't you ask about the circle?
I'm dueling mics.
Ta-da!
Okay, you can sing, you know, harmony, or ta-da!
Woo!
So, I wanted to say, I am so sad that I missed Don and David and Kirsten,
because I had to be in a meeting, a Zoom meeting about a retreat
that's coming up as I didn't get recorded.
So my apologies to you.
And I'd love to hear it another time in another form.
And then just to share, you know, so much of this,
Tanya and I were just discussing,
we're getting to know each other still about, you know,
the process of feedback, the process of putting this together as a team.
And everything is contextual, like Shelley's saying,
at two o'clock or three o'clock she's fading.
You know, I came into this retreat feeling very burned out in a lot of ways.
And I'm aware that when I received my feedback yesterday,
for 25 minutes it was fine.
And then between 25 and 35 minutes it was no longer fine.
It was very difficult for me to metabolize that piece.
And then I learned that for me, maybe, you know,
I'll be honest, I was left thinking,
I don't belong teaching at all, I should leave.
And some of it is just, it was the burnout.
But it was also that it was so helpful to me later
when a couple of people made a comment like,
well, you know, this was useful to me, like about your tone of voice
or this was useful.
That, you know, knowing some specifics,
so I shared with Tanya when she said, you know,
your voice was coming from about here up,
I was like, wow, that's not my experience.
I felt grounded, I felt relaxed.
So I don't know what that is.
I don't know whether there is something I need to learn about my voice
or, you know, whether, so I would have, you know,
I'm not sure she can give me more than that,
but that kind of thing, I'm learning about myself,
I want more detail, or Francisco when Andrea said
that instruction of relax and, you know,
see what comes up wouldn't have worked for you.
That was so short for me.
I just felt like it just wouldn't work for me.
And I needed more detail about what would have worked for you.
But that's why we're, I mean, this is nice
to be able to have further dialogue with one another about this
and also for myself to have time to metabolize
what I have difficulty, you know, where I hit a hindrance.
So thank you.
Can I respond?
Sure.
Just, because it's in part in response
directly to what you've said,
but what I wanted to talk about as well,
which is this process of responding to each other.
And I said in the hall, I feel like it creates
a lot of vulnerability for me personally.
And those thoughts that you had after getting the feedback,
I had after giving the feedback, right?
So witnessing kind of the internal system's response
to taking these risks,
I think it's important for me to be able to kind of, you know,
circle back around with each other.
And I also, for me, I think one of the things that is,
I would want to invite in terms of permission is that we offer,
like, it didn't work for you at all,
but we offer, you know, for me, it was like,
I don't know if this is me or you, Liz,
when I said I feel your voice, like, here.
Like, I don't know if that's me or you.
So, like, and I think that's how we find each other,
maybe in a way, or when something resonates,
it's helpful, and when it doesn't,
it's like, okay, that can just be me, for me.
But having those kinds of being able to do this,
right, with each other, and come back around is really,
for me, really precious.
So, I had already been in the queue.
I guess you can hold it.
I really, really appreciate the exchange that just happened,
and also, Shelley, what you're saying,
and it points to me to the real value in building this community
and this cohort around honesty and authenticity
and vulnerability and learning how each other,
how we're able to show up for each other
and give each other what we need in order to build
the capacity for this kind of communication.
This seems so critical.
So, I'm grateful for the open session.
I'm very grateful.
A little bit along the lines, David,
if I may share a little bit of something you said,
he said he'd never sat a beginner's retreat
when he and Kirsten and I debriefed briefly on the back deck,
and I realized that until Shelley said what she said
just now in the circle about the second session,
I thought that was artificially compressed.
I thought we were actually representing different days
with those sessions.
I thought we were on day four,
because I've never sat a retreat that short, ever,
or taught one, or assisted one, or anything.
So, my assumption in my entire way of being
was that everybody was already in it.
So, I guess that's another learning for me,
is not to assume some of the forms introduced in the training
are just artificial forms,
that there are dimensions of this teaching on the edge
I just don't know.
Yes, I don't thank you for naming that.
I also was a little surprised when Shelley mentioned
it was, you know, morning and afternoon.
I didn't realize that also.
But I want to go back to what Liz was saying.
Maybe this is a question posted to all of us,
or maybe the teachers who had more experience in teaching.
I find myself navigating through the waves
of being wary of teaching.
There are different conditions for it.
Maybe this is really hard.
It could be that so much is going on.
I don't know what I'm doing.
And it could also be...
I guess that's just one example that came to my mind.
And I am aware that that comes and goes.
It's not that it's there all the time,
but I welcome any reflections, perspectives
about navigating this journey of teaching.
Thanks for putting that into the mix about navigating
because I am struggling with that.
Yes, sometimes it's amazing when the teaching is happening
because it all comes together.
That's what all of this work and study and practice
has been about.
So the navigating is a place I'm crossing right now,
how to keep navigating,
and I think I'm making some big decisions about it around it.
And it boils down to the less is more.
I think less is more for me at this point.
I don't know how Gil does it.
For me, I think it's going to have to be less is more
for a little while because I have a deeper new interest
in really long practice.
And I feel that's what's really calling me big time.
And to you, Liz, I'm so sorry.
I thought that it was...
I thought it was writing a wave of comments
and I thought it was understood
because I was referring to my own trauma
and the relax doesn't work.
And that it's a historical comment
way beyond just you making the comment
that whenever I heard even Gil for years,
say relax your shoulders like shut up.
Sorry.
It wasn't personal to you.
Because that's what would happen.
That's what would happen.
Whenever I tried to relax, I would tense up anywhere,
anytime for a long, long time.
So I thought I was in reference to other comments in the room
but thank you for letting me know
because it's good to give details.
It's helpful.
It's always helpful to give details anyway.
That's all I wanted to say.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And we wouldn't...
I wouldn't know it until that time.
And like I said, it was like a...
I just hit the point of I was so burned out
that I was like, okay, 25 minutes of input,
I can take 26?
Not so much.
And you know, same with Tanya's comment.
Like, I'm still willing to store that away
and go, okay, does my voice come from...
Where does it come from and does it need deepening?
So I'm...
I can both take those in
and also hit a hindrance
and go, ouch.
And David's been waiting forever.
Very patiently.
Patient, perhaps.
Really, I had a completely different kind of
set of things to go off into
given an open session.
So I don't want to, you know,
shorten or curtail this.
I just want to respond a little bit to this thread.
Oh.
Sorry.
Sorry, David.
You have the mic.
Keep away.
Thank you so much for your graciousness.
I just want to explicitly open to the group
given what the topic of conversation has been
that we consider taking the last part of the feedback session
to do just a little bit of this metabolizing
and consider making that a form.
And this is a question, a suggestion.
It's by no means fiat.
But, for example, by the time the feedback session was over
yesterday with Liz and Francisco and Lianchi,
I had already realized there were very positive things
I'd wanted to say that I didn't have a chance to say
and it felt awkward or impossible to even bring those in.
And I lived with regret for almost 24 hours
before I was able to circle back to everyone.
So just to plant that seed as a possibility.
It's all the same topic.
Testing your patience, David.
On this theme of feedback, something that's coming up for me
is my ideal of the perfect Dharma teacher
and how the perfect Dharma teacher receives feedback
and then how I actually feel,
which doesn't always match my ideal of what the perfect Dharma teacher would do.
And so, in my set of values,
receiving feedback is strongly valued.
And I know it's a great thing.
And when I'm really well resourced and balanced
and feel a sense of confidence,
feedback can come in and I can be like,
yeah, that's awesome.
I'm so glad you told me that you don't like X, Y, or Z about me.
That's really great information.
And then I can think of times where somebody at Zen Center
gave me some feedback and I said,
thank you and then I closed the door and I cried.
And so what actually arises is not always aligned
with what my ideal is.
And I bring this up because I so appreciate your share, Liz,
because everybody's doing such a beautiful job
of receiving feedback non-defensively.
And it doesn't always mean it feels good when it lands.
So I appreciate you making room for a fuller spectrum of response
to that rather than just like, hey, thanks.
Awesome.
High five.
And so another feedback-related comment.
Oh, let's see.
Might have just floated off.
I think it'll come back.
Oh, it's just these sessions of the, you know,
we're giving feedback on how to lead these guided meditations
and give a little Dharma and answer questions.
And so we're, yeah, we're practicing how to teach the Dharma,
but we're, of course, also practicing giving and receiving feedback.
And that's such an incredibly valuable thing to do.
And I had used the term non-defensively.
And I think that's something I really wanted to highlight
from all of the sessions so far is how graciously
each team has received feedback at the end.
After some very direct comments that I don't tend to hear
in Dharma scenes very often, Dharma people tend to be nice.
And they don't always say, offer anything critical.
And so for, especially for a group of people
who will all be in power roles,
it's even more important to be able to,
for somebody in a down power role to give somebody
an up power role feedback is inherently risky,
because often the person in the up power role
has some ability to affect the life of the student.
You know, if it's a teacher and a student in a school system,
that teacher can fail the student
if they didn't like the feedback they got, for example.
So it makes it that much more important as people
in up power roles that we're able to receive the feedback
in a way that doesn't compromise the students
that we can receive it in a way that's gracious,
non-defensive, really taking it in.
And then also that really applies in DEIA issues also.
If somebody, if we're white bodied
and a BIPOC person gives us feedback
to be able to respond non-defensively,
or an able bodied person receiving feedback
from somebody who has disabilities
to be able to receive that non-defensively.
So I just wanted to bring in that,
just that last half hour of these sessions
is such a tremendous practice in and of itself
and that it's really growing what I think
are incredibly important tools for Dharma teachers
to be able to exercise.
Thanks.
David, you ready?
You know, I don't want to take a U turn
or a left turn or a right turn
if it's not the right place.
I mentioned this yesterday
or the day before, I can't remember,
just that I had a question that I've had for a long time
and I haven't wanted to bother Andre and Gil.
You know, an open session hasn't arisen,
and here it is.
But it's related to,
and I don't want it to be a question just to Gil and Andre,
actually, there may be others who know more about this.
But I, Curiosity's been there about
the working with emotions,
instructions or, you know,
constellation of techniques.
I'm just curious where they come from.
You know, I'm just not aware of sort of,
I mean, they, within our, the classic texts,
we rely on the Satipattana Sutra,
or within classic sort of, you know, teaching frames
of dependent arising or five aggregates or what have you.
There aren't, there isn't sort of,
so I assume it's kind of oral tradition
and it's a teaching thing,
like craft or rain or ronney, you know,
those kinds of approaches come from
from working with emotions or working with thoughts or,
you know, there are a lot of others that come up
in that kind of space between body and mind.
And, you know, I'm not sure,
and that's one of the reasons I hesitate to ask it is,
I'm interested, I don't know if it makes us better teachers to know.
I'm just kind of curious when those enter the scene
and sort of whence they came and, you know,
therapy, this is where like Liz or Tanya might have some
insights or do they, you know, do they just kind of,
anyway, and I named a couple.
There's probably a bunch more.
I named raft or rain,
the various acronyms for that same kind of approach or...
Tanya has an answer for you for some of it.
About raft.
Yeah, because I thought you were very instructive
if you would say, if you know about that.
Yeah.
Well, yes, very ancient tradition.
Why is elders?
Yes.
Well, there's been more than one rendition of raft
as far as my experience with rafting goes.
But, so, you know...
I might say what it is.
I'm not sure everybody here knows the acronym.
Okay.
Well, I was going to first mention rain,
which is an acronym that stands for recognize.
So it's a practice for working with emotions in particular,
right?
To walk, help somebody walk through.
And who's, there is,
Tara Brock has really used it,
but it's Michelle McDonald who started it.
That's what I was looking for.
Well, that's her name because I know it from Tara.
But, oh, she's still popularizing it.
Yes, really.
Yeah.
So recognize, accept, and allow.
Investigate is the I.
And it used to be initially not self was the N,
not non-identification.
That must be Michelle's version.
And then Tara's became nurtures,
her current version,
the I investigation has been investigate with intimacy is added.
So, and so when I was practicing with that,
as a person working with emotions in my early days of practice,
which I no longer have emotions.
I just didn't, it didn't feel,
it didn't fully work for me.
And there was just, it was so conceptual,
the non-identification and it didn't feel like my experience
of the whole practice, right?
So I, I spent a lot of time thinking and thinking
and came up with raft to recognize, accept,
and allow, find, and feel, and trust.
Because for me, I ended my practice always when it was
in a good space ended in a sense of this trust,
like the sense of openness.
So, I, you know, I had shared it.
Shelly took a copy and used it in her song.
Liz used it.
I think it was you, Liz, at some point in the Hindrance's class.
Diana.
And, but then, but at some point,
so, and I had written it on my website or whatever,
but at some point, Kill introduced,
which I did, I did tell him about my practice.
I, I, I brought my folder with all my notes
and all the, like, factors that were being activated
and the different, you know,
but Kill came up with this fantastic version of raft,
which was recognize more of the accept than the allow,
emphasizing that it's not always easy to,
or more the allow than the accept,
because it's easier to allow than necessarily accept.
And it feels like an endorsement.
The feeling, so feeling the emotions in the body
and then the teasing apart.
So, which is so great, right?
Teasing the emotion apart from the thoughts.
And to me, actually, I think you can just really,
you can do a lot of teasing apart, untangling.
So sometimes I say it's raft, double T.
Yeah.
So that's the history of raft.
And so I don't know.
My version was probably 10 years ago.
And Gills was maybe eight, maybe, maybe less.
So.
So if we use raft, who do we give credit to?
No.
Yeah.
This actually came up at lunchtime with May,
kind of, we were talking about the instructions on emotions.
And how did it come up, May?
I mean, you said something like, do you remember?
Yeah.
I had a similar question to David is,
I shared that it's new for me.
I hadn't really put together the dots
that in our westernized mahasi, specifically,
westernized mahasi instruction,
that emotion isn't really part of the original,
and that's the western add-on.
And I asked, where did that western add-on come from?
And what, because, for example, in, excuse me,
in Guy's westernized mahasi instructions,
he mentions that emotions,
if you have enough time in a retreat,
you might do the five hindrances one day,
other emotions another day.
Wholesome states.
Wholesome states, right, exactly,
maybe the awakening factors.
And I thought, well, you know,
the hindrances are certainly part of the teachings.
That's, you know, part of the fourth foundation.
So what part is the western part,
and where did it come from?
And in thinking about that, I thought,
well, it's really kind of the piece I highlighted
or landed on is,
when you're having an emotion, feel it in your body.
That's like, that is not in the text,
as far as I know, you know, that piece.
And I don't know where that came from.
I don't know who first, like, said that,
or, I mean, but it is so much a part of our tradition.
We think it's in the polycanon.
So, you know, but what's in the polycanon
around hindrances is often, you know,
recognizing them, the Satipatana, you know,
recognize them.
So just that, like noted, like Mahasi says,
I mean, Mahasi's instructions around the hindrances is,
you know, sense desires arising, you know,
sense desires, sense desires,
but not the instruction to how does it feel in the body.
So, you know, there's that simple piece,
and then there's also with hindrances
working with the antidotes,
but, you know, not so much the support
for being with the hindrance by turning to the body.
And maybe, Gil, you know where this started.
Do you have any idea?
Not more than what I suggested at the beginning,
that it might have come from something like
Gestalt Therapy.
I think that there were some of the humanistic
psychology movements that were very body-focused
and still are, and that Jack was studying those
and very much involved with them.
And Jack recognized how much he was out of touch
with his body, so he was definitely doing all kinds
of body practices to get into his body.
And in Robert Hall, Robert Hall started a whole school
of body-based psychotherapy.
One of the first books that Jack told me to read
when I started teacher training was a book
on using the body in psychotherapy.
So, I think that, I think my guess is very much
influenced by Western psychotherapy.
You know, there's this woman who wrote this book,
this article, what's her name?
Glick.
And Glick.
And Glick.
And she came up with this term, Tantric Vipassana,
which is kind of West Coast,
Spirit Rock kind of Vipassana.
And I think it's, what?
And Glick.
And I think maybe it was very unfortunate
to use the word Tantra, but I think it's probably
even more accurate to call it Gestalt Vipassana.
Because there's a lot of the same principles
of going into the material, going into it through the body,
stepping towards something rather than stepping away
and just being kind of distantly mindful.
And I think that's a, and then,
Gestalt has a lot of other practices than that.
But I suspect that the, that Gestalt had the big influence
on this.
And I hear so many people saying things like
the Buddha taught being in your body.
And the first foundation is that,
but if you look at those instructions,
it's not what we mean.
Because I think what we mean by feeling the body
is very much touching into the mind-state body interweaving.
And that, the feeling in the body connected
to how the mind is.
And I think, inside of Upandita says,
watch your mind, it's in your chest.
He's talking about feeling it in the body,
but he's talking about watching the mind.
So I think that's just an interesting reflection.
I feel like this is related to the question about emotion
moving into our scene.
Another thread that I see is
Peter and Andrea Levine's work on forgiveness.
And, you know, they're fairly early generation as well.
So, Jewish, Buddhist, hospice volunteers and workers
who, and early teachers who
apparently brought that practice in,
as far as I can tell, as far as anyone I know of can tell.
So, not so much the somatic piece,
but the idea of incorporating something like grief.
So, yeah, Stephen Levine, in some degree his wife, Andrea,
but Stephen Levine had a big influence in the 1970s.
And Jack once explained to me that the emphasis on loving kindness
in our Vipassana scene came from Stephen Levine.
He was the one who really introduced it.
He was teaching with Jack and Joseph a little bit in the 70s.
And so that was his big contribution to our scene.
And, yeah, I don't know what other things he was introducing,
but going into grief and feeling it deeply.
I wouldn't be surprised if he had a big impact.
He also had a big impact.
And the thing about forgiveness is I suspect it for a long time.
I don't know if you have proof,
but you heard me theorize about it before.
I heard you theorize, but I've also seen threads of certain hurt.
But there's a, that the way that we do forgiveness meditation
or forgiveness practice in our scene,
I went to Yusselinanda once, it's Burmese Monk,
and I said, you know, we do this forgiveness thing.
And he said, oh, yeah, I do it too.
And I said, great, now I'm going to find out where the source is.
Where is it from?
Oh, I learned it from the Western teachers.
And I suspect it came from Stephen Levine,
who got it from Judaism.
I think there's a Jewish forgiveness kind of things that are similar.
And so it works very well for the Western psyche,
the Western cultural psyche because of the forgiveness thing.
But the whole forgiveness thing is a little bit foreign to Asian Buddhism.
Do the monastics do that thing at the end?
Well, what Ajahn Chah, English-speaking monks do, I'm not sure.
But the monastics do a confession ceremony.
And they asked to be acknowledged or they asked,
there's not really a asking for forgiveness.
Forgiveness is kind of a foreign idea.
Thinking of, I heard a story, I think it was from Sharon,
who said at the end of the retreat with Upandita in 1984 at IMS,
that they did this kind of thing that seemed to be a monastic ritual
of just like if there's anything that we've done that's harmed you.
It may be, I don't know, what exactly it was.
It might not have been asking for forgiveness,
but just something like acknowledging that and can we move on.
Or I don't know, but there was something that she mentioned about.
And so Lian Chi, you've seen this kind of thing?
Yes, in the monastic way, in every Monday,
everybody starts to do the confession like Gil said.
And then in the end of the confession,
it is asking for forgiveness and just like you just said.
So there is? Yes.
But then the whole community, the whole Sangha,
will make the decision like if it's forgiven, based on the sutra,
this is how you can forgive based on the sutra.
And there's four of them that is unforgivable,
and they will ask you to leave.
That sutra is in Bhikkhu Bodhi's compilation on social and communal harmony.
So there is reference for that easily available.
I don't remember the reference in the module.
And then there's one time I heard,
but I don't know how it was in one of the Dhamma talks,
that in Buddha's time, the seven years old monk,
correctly the Buddha right handed,
I mean the second disciple of Buddha,
that your rope is not even,
and he fixed it and then asking for forgiveness.
So it does.
I just wanted to briefly mention that
your question is a little bit more, a lot more subtle and complex
than it might appear on the surface.
A little bit of a topic for me in graduate school in Buddhist studies
was Buddhist modernism, global Buddhist modernism.
And as this conversation suggests, the fluctuations back and forth,
and Andhra talked about this,
I can't remember if it was Andhra or Gil now in Sri Lanka,
that it's like the practices got exported in certain waves
and then got re-imported from the west or from other Asian traditions.
I've talked to Chan monks who practiced in the Goenka
and Paok traditions in the Chan monasteries.
It's all flowing in all directions right now,
so some of these might just end up being unknowable.
But I like knowing that there is this flow.
It's like to poke the idea,
which we've been coming back to repeatedly,
that there's no right thing that is Buddhism.
Hearing this, what do you think?
And I've seen Kodo as something to add, so I don't know yet.
But no, this is very interesting,
and I hope it's not just a sort of intellectual curiosity.
I've struck again that lots of people know this,
and I just never sort of really come across it.
It's a familiar pattern, but it's just kind of useful to know.
I'm actually familiar with Levine's work a little bit,
but I hadn't kind of recognized some of that thread.
For me, I think it is useful to kind of know that
in crafting responses, crafting approaches.
So all good so far, Kodo.
This was a comment for earlier.
But in response, generally, I think to me it's useful
to know what the sources of the ideas are,
because then I can sort of trace the development
and contextualize the ideas or contextualize practices,
and then I can be responsible for them.
I was going to mention before about the focus on the body
and emotions in the body.
I wonder about the influence of Goenka,
because that was certainly part of his teaching,
and Jack and Joseph and James all did a fair amount of Goenka practice.
It's in his Dharma talks.
I've worked with a bunch of people
coming out of Goenka, coming to Spirit Rock,
and they do not know how to work with emotions.
They know how to be the body, but they don't connect those two.
Are we at a time?
You were looking?
Oh, okay, great.
This is another U-turn,
only because you guys brought up the refrain and the definition,
and it's just an ongoing nagging thing for me,
that the death contemplation,
the refrain happens the most of all in the whole Satipatana
around the death contemplation,
which is, to me, such as emphasis on how important that is,
yet we don't teach that.
How could we approach that?
Why don't we teach that?
I mean, I know I don't want to teach that,
why we don't teach that,
but why has that not come in,
except in small little doses?
Gil.
I think there's a context where it's useful to do that.
I've done workshops, or death-and-dying workshops that I've taught,
where I've done things like this,
and it was very useful for people in those workshops,
for people who came for that purpose.
But to bring that up here at a seven-day retreat,
for example, a lot of beginners,
they're not coming for that.
Some of them would be deeply troubled.
We don't know.
They just might have left their loved one who just died,
and they're grieving,
and to have that brought up might be very disturbing for them.
There are all kinds of reasons.
And it kind of brings in a whole conceptual level.
It involves using the imagination.
So it's hard enough to get people to stop thinking,
and to settle down and get a little bit more concentrated.
So to bring that into the retreat on top of it
makes it much more complicated.
There's something very clean and nice about this,
a simple kind of process of practice we stay kind of close to.
Do you want to add something?
Thank you.
Yeah, I think those particular practices,
the reflective practices,
I also look at the 32 body parts as a reflective practice.
The death contemplations as reflective practice.
And again, it's kind of like again in our scene,
and what has become the mindfulness,
the western mindfulness tradition,
the Vipassana tradition,
we emphasize, as Gil was pointing to,
we emphasize being with experience in the present moment
and not using thoughts so much as the meditation.
I think there's a place for it in our wider community
to teach reflection, to teach reflective practice.
And I do that, not necessarily around 32 parts of the body,
but bringing in how to connect the content of our thoughts
with how we are, you know,
so really bringing in what happens with thought
and how we are.
So I kind of bridge those two a little bit,
the reflective practice and the here and now practice.
And I find it's incredibly useful
to talk about reflective practice
because people tend to think,
meditation means I stop thinking,
thinking is outside of the realm of the picture,
and the Buddha clearly brought in reflection
in the Satipa Tanasuta.
And in various places, it's, you know,
like even the instruction,
one sees things as impermanent, as unreliable,
you know, we see experience as not me, not mine,
not who I am, those are in quotes.
They're like, use it as a reflection,
bring in those wisdom thoughts.
Not always is it talked about as an insight,
but it's also talked about to bring it actually in as a thought.
And so we don't talk about that too much,
you know, the use of thoughts as a part of the practice.
I do that a little bit more in the Tasjaniya style practice
because Sayada talks about using wisdom reflections
and asking questions as investigations.
So it brings in more of the reflective component
and then more in the daily life realm.
I bring in reflection and talk more about the Buddha's use of reflection.
But it's kind of like what Gil was saying,
the expectation of the retreat setting,
you know, what we have constructed, what we've built,
it doesn't quite seem to fit in that container.
Unless, as like Bhante Buddha Rikita sometimes does,
he'll teach a Maranasati retreat.
Or Bob Stoll will teach the 32 parts of the body retreat
and then people know coming in that that's kind of what they're getting.
This is topical to the question.
Probably a year and a half ago, actually it was just prior to COVID,
I taught a small, loving kindness retreat for a community,
mostly Jewish but Buddhist crossover community.
And in practice discussion with one of these people,
a spiritual director in her own right, I might add,
she expressed to me very deep anger
because she had gone to an insight meditation event
with her, I think it was like nephew or something,
that was unannounced.
And then it was a Maranasati Dharma talk and guided meditation.
And her nephew was suicidal.
And it was a problem in the family.
He did not kill himself, but it did not do good things for him.
So I would suggest that that might be another reason,
there's caution around how and when we offer these practices
because we just don't know how it's going to land
given a person's current mental state.
Yeah, there's that great story in the suttas, right,
of the Buddha giving the instructions on,
it was either the foulness of the body,
the 32 parts of the body contemplation,
and he goes off into retreat and comes out of retreat
and half the people have killed themselves.
And Ananda's response is,
Venerable Sir, might it be useful to teach them mindfulness of breathing?
So there's even that story in the suttas,
which I love that that's in the suttas
because it really helps me to understand,
it gives me some confidence that what was been transmitted
is actually maybe some things that happened.
So I have two things I want to say.
One is that in following up on David's question about emotions,
we've divided up our human experience here in the West with emotions
as being a central piece.
And one of the interesting ways of looking at the sattipatana
is that it's dividing up to all our human experiences included.
Nothing's being excluded,
but it just divides it up in a different way.
So it looks at it from a different perspective
and maybe just as valid.
But it sometimes is even more interesting
because it breaks the hegemony of the way we're looking at it now,
which is, we don't realize how much it's culturally conditioned,
all kinds of things that we think are innate to our human life.
And then the other thing,
I've been waiting for a chance to respond or say more about what Elizabeth brought up before,
about feeling that you should give up teaching and that she's not cut out for it.
And that is that this is the ideal place for you to have those feelings here.
Because a lot of teachers, including me, get really vulnerable.
Even teachers who've been teaching for a long time
get really vulnerable giving Dharma talks.
And some of them leave with those feelings.
And it takes a couple of days for some of them to recover even
though I failed and this was terrible or whatever.
And it's a very vulnerable producing place to be in giving these talks.
I still sometimes leave Dharma talks feeling very open and vulnerable.
And so the feeling of failing is common enough thing to do.
But if you're teaching, it's very hard to have anyone to talk to about it.
And it's harder to feel like it was okay.
But if you're going to fail, please fail here.
And I hope this is the safe place to fail.
And what you did was perfect to bring it up and talk about it.
That was modeling something fantastic for all of us that you just explained it.
And maybe one of the best things happened here so far that you did that.
And learning to do that, and this is really fantastic.
And sometimes when people come, I don't know if I've done it for any of you,
but I've done it for other people when they come to IRC to teach.
I tell them this is a safe place to fail for Dharma teachers to fail.
And it's maybe even safer if we say it explicitly.
But I would like this to be a place which is safe to bomb.
Because we put so much at stake at these talks.
This is like the be all and end all.
And one of the things I learned at Zen Center, a talk is just a ritual.
All these practices we do, and someone gets tapped and it's your turn to do the ritual.
And so they do it.
But the whole Zen Center and people's stuff doesn't all depend on that Dharma talk.
It just goes on and on in the practice.
So do not put too much emphasis on how important these Dharma talks are.
And to be willing to fail and learn from that.
And hopefully you're teaching with people who are willing to make space for that.
And I think sharing feelings like that is probably healthy.
Though maybe not all teachers can handle it if you tell them that I know.
They might not be wise about it.
But I'm hoping that we can include it.
And it was perfect earlier today.
Was it David or Kim whose group said, come on.
People are not riding and falling on our Dharma talks.
There's a whole thing going on in them that they may not even hear a lot of your Dharma talk.
So thank you to whichever group came up with that.
I also wanted to acknowledge to just recognize and see that Ying had asked a question that didn't really get met.
And it feels a little bit like this touches back into that question.
And I just wanted to say I think that's something that the question was around navigating this process of being in teacher training.
And I sent some emotion in there in the question and how hard it can be to navigate this process.
And I find maybe May and Francisco might have a little bit of this feeling and Dawn also too having just set the month long.
I find often when you're in that assistant role, it really comes up this sense of how am I in here?
How do I navigate this?
Or being on a long retreat for the first time after you've come into the teacher training?
Oh my gosh, that was my experience too.
Something about being a new teacher in teacher training and being on retreat again,
I feel like I'm being judged and evaluated by the teachers or something.
So there's so much that goes on.
And I just want to name that because we do have to stop here and just point to this is part of the process
of going through this teacher training to navigate that.
And this is talk to your fellow teachers about it.
Don't keep it quiet.
That's what I did.
I went for so many walks with Greg during the teacher training around.
Oh my God, this is awful.
So use each other.
And I just want to normalize it a little bit.
And this can be another topic that we meet because I think it's a useful topic.
And I just wanted to touch back into your question.
And now we are at time.
As a few days ago, I think it was supposed to rain a little bit on Wednesday, potentially.
I haven't seen the weather since then, but maybe we should put the chairs way nicely.
And we'll meet back up in the hall at seven.
We should definitely take everything in anyway for overnight.
But say something about the seven o'clock session.
Oh yeah, so we have what?
Yeah, seven o'clock in the vacation hall.
