 if you can hear me. Thank you. Feel free to continue to sit where you are. And I'll just offer a few words as we close the evening tonight for today for those who are in different time zones. Maybe sitting in the temple of this body. Imagine in the temple of this body, right in the center, where is an altar, where your heart is at. The altar has the heart qualities that you've been cultivating. Care, compassion, metta, loving kindness. You are sitting in this sacred place with the beautiful qualities that you've been cultivating in this whole week. I invite each of you taking a deep bow to this being sitting right here in front of you. You yourself is worthy of respect, reverence, such goodness. What a blessing to engage in this wholesome practice all around. Even when it feels difficult, challenging, offer deep gratitude to each of us, to ourselves, and then to each other as an inspiration. I want to share an awakening poem from the Teregata, the elder nouns of the Buddhist disciples. Nikki talked about paticara, the statue inside of the IRC meditation hall. This particular poem is an expression of awakening of the paticara. So may this be an inspiration. Ploughing fields with ploughs, sowing seeds in the ground, caring for children and wife, young men being well. Why is it that I thorough in virtuous conduct, doing the Buddha's instruction, not lazy or proud, have not attained release? Having washed my feet, I watch the water, the foot washing water, flow from high ground to low. With this, the mind concentrated like a thoroughbred horse. Taking an oil lamp, I entered my hut. Looking over the bed, I sat down on the bed, taking a needle. I poured out the wick. As the flame went out, the mind was free. As you get up, go to your pet room to rest for tonight. Enjoy the simplicity of the steps, the sitting there, the lying down, the turning off of the light. May you taste a moment of freedom. May all beings be free. Thank you everyone for your practice. And for those who wish to continue, you can sit with the Kachara in the IRC meditation hall. And those who go to rest, sleep well. We'll see you tomorrow.
