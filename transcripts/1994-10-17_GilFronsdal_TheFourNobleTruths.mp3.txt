 So, in part, to continue the introductory course that ended a few weeks ago, I wanted today to give a talk on what's known as the Four Noble Truths. The Four Noble Truths are the core central teachings of Buddhism. They're very much at the heart of what the Buddhist notion of mindfulness practice is trying to address. It's kind of the central theme of Buddhist spirituality. And the Four Noble Truths, as a teaching, have a phenomenal profundity to them. And when a person understands them deeply, it leads to a kind of certainty, a certainty about life, a certainty about how to be in life, which is said to make a person fearless. It's said that, on one hand, the Four Noble Truths are very easy to understand in a superficial way. I can explain to you in two minutes, and you can go home and tell someone else what they were. But it's said that only someone who is fully enlightened understands them fully. And my own experiences of them is that, over the years of practice, my appreciation and understanding of them has deepened and deepened and deepened. So it continues to this day, and I imagine it will continue for quite a while still. The placing our spiritual life in the context of the Four Noble Truths makes spiritual life a lot easier than maybe it can be. For one thing, part of the brilliance of what the Buddha had to offer was he put the foundation of the spiritual practice he offered on something that was quite understandable in everyday life. And it didn't depend on some kind of faith or belief in something which we could have no ultimate certainty about whether it really exists or not. There's no metaphysical speculation or metaphysical entity or belief, reality, that the Buddha is positing. But he's about positing and talking about something that's very practical. So the Four Noble Truths are stated traditionally very succinctly, very briefly. The First Noble Truth is the Noble Truth of suffering. That's all it says, the nobility of suffering, if you'd like. The Second Noble Truth is the truth of the cause of suffering. The Third Noble Truth is the truth of the cessation of suffering. And the Fourth Noble Truth is a truth of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering. And what the Buddha did when he formulated these four steps was he was borrowing from the ancient Indian medical model, how ancient Indian doctors diagnosed an illness. In the ancient Indian system, they would recognize the illness, which is recognizing the suffering. They would recognize the cause of the illness. They'd recognize the possibility of a cure. And they would know what the steps were to get that cure. So the Buddha borrowed from this medical model to formulate a spiritual understanding. We all suffer. It's part of everyone's life. And we have to see that very clearly and very honestly. The First Noble Truth is a call for us to take our suffering very seriously, to look at it very honestly. It's all too common for many people, we know, to turn away from the suffering, to avoid it, to deny it, to numb out from it. We probably all know people who do it through alcohol, who do it through drugs, who do it through working too much over work, who do it through food, who do it through sex, who do it through television. All kinds of ways in which people would rather not be present for their life as it is because it's so difficult and painful. And so they numb out. They turn away. So the First Noble Truth is a call to be really honest, to face honestly and squarely our suffering as it occurs. The Second Noble Truth then is the cause of suffering. And the cause is the Buddha defined as our drivenness. Actually he didn't use that word, it's my word. But the word that he used was thirst. And sometimes in English that's translated as the word desire. And that raises a lot of problems for people. But his word was thirst. And thirst has a sense of a kind of craving, a kind of drivenness. If you're out in the desert and really thirsty, you're kind of like, we'll claw your way to water, push everyone else out of your way. There's kind of a drivenness, maybe the English word addiction is a good word, except we tend to reserve that word for kind of strong addictions. We're all addicted in various kinds of... The Buddha said everyone's an addict unless you're liberated. And it's going to be very, very subtle, the forms of our addiction. But I call it our drivenness, our compulsion, our drivenness, our driven attachments, our things we need to have or things we absolutely say we don't want to have, things we avoid. We put up walls of resistance and walls of wanting, walls of not wanting, which are very brittle walls. And as the winds of life hit those brittle walls, they crack and they fall and they hurt. So part of the task of Buddhist practice is to dismantle the walls that are interfering with the wind passing freely. And so we have to understand the nature of those walls. And the Buddha said the nature of those walls is to be built by our thirst, by our drivenness, our compulsion, by our attachment, our craving, our resistance. And then it's possible to live a life, it's possible to discover a way of being in life, where the mind or the heart is in no way driven, it's no way acting on compulsion, it's no way acting on automatic habit, it's no way acting on automatic resistance and aversion. It's not thirsty for anything, but rather feels satisfied and content, it feels satiated, it feels at ease and at peace with itself. And the Buddha said that it's not so easy to do this. This first four steps of the Noble Truth sound very simplistic. We have suffering, there's a cause of suffering and there's a possibility to end suffering. And some people might think it's a real disservice, and if it is a disservice to some people, to state it so simply, that their suffering is, you know, we describe in such a brief way, my suffering is so huge. But the Buddha recognized that, and because he recognized that it's quite complicated, our situation, our life, that there has to be a whole strategy, a whole prescription, a whole path that supports us and makes it easier for us to relax and let go of our compulsion, our thirst. And he called it the Eightfold Path. Eight different steps are useful to kind of look at in your life and organize your life around these points of view. So the beauty of this is that there's nothing stated about a divine being or divine reality, ultimate reality, in this statement, in this Four Noble Truth. It's like a medical model, and everyone's experience falls into it. Now you might still protest and say this is too simplistic. It's not profound enough. It's not grand enough. It's much more interesting to have some great, wonderful, rich theology where you can, you know, all-powerful deity. You know, it's kind of, you know, it's kind of, you know, I'm not knocking it exactly, but it's very, very, you know, it's quite beautiful, you know, to have a great beautiful theology to kind of, and Buddhism is kind of theologically poor. So you say, well, this is kind of simplistic to have this whole spiritual life, you know, based on this poor, simple statement seems a bit simplistic. But let me offer you a couple of models, a couple of analogies that might help you understand how it can be so useful. The first analogy is that of, is an ancient story of long, long, long, long, long, long ago. There was a king, or queen, and this king was out walking around his kingdom, and one day, one day stubbed his toe against some rock, and really, or he stepped on a sharp rock, and he kind of hurt his foot. He broke it, kind of cut the foot a little bit in the sharp rock. So he called together all his ministers and said, you know, this is, this has to, this can't be. And what I want you to do is to carpet the kingdom with leather, because then it'd be safe for me to walk, I won't have to hurt myself anymore in the sharp rocks. And one of the ministers said, I have a better idea. And then instead of carpeting the whole kingdom, let's just make shoes for everyone. Let's just put leather underneath everyone's soles, under feet. And that saved a lot of time and expense for the, for the kingdom. And, and so it's like that in our spiritual life. It's, if we try to take care of everything, and put, you know, put leather, or put some kind of safety devices, or protection over everything, it's kind of impossible. But if you can just take care of the place where you actually touch the reality, we actually meet reality, the place of real contact with reality, in that place have some protection, then you can take it with you everywhere you go. And it's a lot easier, a lot cheaper. And this teaching of the Four Noble Truths is a teaching that focuses on the place where we actually meet reality, where there's actually contact with reality. Each moment we meet reality and you hear my voice, you're looking at me perhaps, there's a feelings of your body, there's sensations in your shoulders, there's the thoughts that you have. In the present moment, you have contact with something in your own direct experience, to actually have some shoe to wear. When you meet reality directly, that's the place where you can find the opportunity to step off the clinging or the thirst of the addiction that you have. So I don't know if that made sense, but I'll continue. And then another analogy is that of, if you're a nature photographer, and you go to the great deserts or the great savannas of Africa, and you want to take photographs with all the wild animals there, you would exhaust yourself running around the savanna with a camera, kind of chasing all the animals, trying to catch them all and finding them on all that. It's kind of a silly way of doing it perhaps. But if you simply place yourself at the watering hole and wait, all the animals will come to you. So the Four Noble Truths are like the watering hole. That if you begin studying, understanding your life from the point of view of Four Noble Truths, all the different issues that are important, really important, and really practically important, and real issues of your life will all come to you to be addressed and to be taken care of. And you don't have to go and get a PhD in Buddhist studies to understand all, you know, everything about Buddhism and life and reality and psychology and everything, you know, all the profundity that exists out there to be discovered. All that you need will come to you if you sit there at the watering hole of the Four Noble Truths. Isn't that great? So that seems like a good plug. So the first Noble Truth, to go over this again then, a little bit in another time, the Truth of Suffering. We all suffer. Human beings, by the kind of nature of our limitations, having a relatively short lifespan, by having bodies that don't, you know, are not robotic, they get old, they get hurt, they get injured, they get sick. Things happen to our mind, our brain, there's something that are out of our control. We stub our toe. It's very satisfying and relieving to me to be reminded that the Buddha, you see in the wonderful statues and paintings of this great radiant being, you know, you never see him in statues an old man, but he was. You see him in the peak of youth and radiant and shining and just all the right skin tone and just the right little smile on his face and no wrinkles, and he just seems really great, right? So, you know, I think that's a good point. It's a great idea to live up to. The Buddha had a bad back. Isn't that nice to know? The Buddha had a bad back. There were times where he couldn't teach because he had to lay down and he had, one of his senior students teach for his instead of him because of his bad back. So the Buddha had a bad back. Some of us had bad backs. I had a bad back. The Buddha also experienced sorrow when there was a massacre in his home kingdom. Things normal when there's a loss like that to feel sorrow and sorrow is a kind of suffering. In looking at some, so part of, so, there is suffering in this world and I've known a lot of people when they first hear these kinds of teachings in Buddha circles, some people are appalled. Any kind of emphasis on suffering and they get angry, but there are some people who find it such a huge relief to come into a setting where someone is for the first time perhaps really saying, look, there's really suffering in this world and it's okay to look at it. It's okay to admit it. We don't have to think of ourselves as failing or as a personal failure. The fact there is suffering in our life, it's built into being a human being. So as I like to say sometimes, maybe this is not a nice thing to say, but when two people marry each other, because I do marriages very occasionally, very occasionally, it's a wonderful and joyous time, but built into the marriage is the idea that one of the ways that marriage is usually supposed to last a lifetime traditional sense. Built into that is the notion that one of them is going to die before the other. That's built into the system and that's a kind of suffering. It's unfortunate, but you're marrying into that kind of system. You're marrying into an imperfect system where someone's going to die first. So we know that. So that's part of life. And if it isn't a traditional kind of marriage, then more likely there's a different kind of suffering when it ends. So it's a kind of suffering. It's part of it. Even though it's a lot of joy, it's a wonderful thing to do. So to call it for what it is, a member of Joseph Goldstein told me he doesn't like to do weddings at all as a teacher. But he said that I guess the first time, maybe the only time, maybe, he ever performed a wedding, he gave a Dharma talk as part of the ceremony and he gave a Dharma talk on death. I don't want to make light of these things. I don't want to make light of the suffering of life. Buddhism is not meant to make light of it. It takes it very seriously. And what it's saying is there's some real peace and real relief, some real wisdom and maturity that comes with seeing it and looking at it directly as it is. When we look at suffering directly, we see two kinds of suffering. And this is a very important point to understand what Buddhism has to teach. There is what can be called inevitable suffering and maybe optional suffering. Inevitable suffering is things that just come with being a human being. Bad backs, stubbing our toes against sharp rocks, having loved ones that we know die. There's all kinds of things that just come with life. And some of this stuff is out of our control. We don't know when the next earthquake is going to hit the Bay Area. And that's going to cause a lot of suffering. We don't know all kinds of things. Yesterday I was driving up 84th, where I live, up in the mountains. And there'd just been an accident before I got there. And the only car that was on the scene was upside down and the roof of the car was completely crashed like a pancake. And these things happen. They come out of the blue for many of us. And we can't control life. We can't say that life has to be always a certain way. Part of a mature human life is to recognize the inevitable aspects of things that happen to us which are not our doing, not our responsibility. So there's inevitable suffering. But then there's also the optional suffering. And Buddhism is primarily addressing the optional suffering. And the optional suffering is intimately related for many of us to the inevitable suffering. And I'll explain that in a few minutes. The optional suffering is a suffering that arises out of the way that we react and respond to what happens in life. Our reactions, our choices, the choices in ways we respond are much more choice than most of us realize. If I, to make a really simplistic, simple example, if I am driving my wonderful car that I have, and it's very important for me to see, for you that people see me in my wonderful car because you see that I'm a kind of really, I'm a really good person. It's a kind of status that comes with my car. And people can look up to me and I kind of fit into a local scene. I kind of, one notch up maybe from everyone else. And it's kind of nice and kind of makes me feel good. To be able to be in a really good car. And then one day my car is in the shop and the shop gives me this really old beat up teeny little Honda Civic from 1982 to drive around. And I suffer. Why do I suffer? One of the reasons could be because it's a tremendously important self-image that I've cultivated with the kind of car I drive is no longer being upheld. One of you might see me in this old Honda Civic. And then you say, Oh, he's a Honda Civic kind of guy. And suddenly my status has dropped. And you know, my way, what I think my status is. And so my suffering and that kind of silly example arises out of the way in which I've chosen to hold onto a self-image and how to protect it and worried about how people see me. And that's optional. It's optional to have a self-image like that. If you're running late and you're driving some place and you're running late and you end up in kind of some kind of traffic jam and you're going to be even lighter. Most people will feel frustrated or impatient or angry. It's fairly common in this world. But is it necessary to feel those things? Is it built into the nature of the universe? Are we genetically programmed that traffic jam means frustration? I remember one delightful day driving home with driving across the Golden Gate Bridge on a Friday afternoon at five, six, no Saturday at anyway, with Ajahn Amaro and a couple of other, another monk. And I think I was driving and there was great backup in the traffic. And we took forever to get across the bridge and get... These monks couldn't care less. They couldn't care less if it took 10 days to get across the Golden Gate Bridge. They were just there. This is what was happening. They weren't frustrated. They had to get somewhere, but they chose not to buy in or get caught up or get frustrated. They chose not to let their compulsions and their thirst, their drivenness affect the state of their mind, the state of their heart. It's possible in Russia or traffic to let go and just be there, enjoy the sky, enjoy the other drivers maybe if they're smiling enough or not, or to have compassion for them and look around, do loving kindness practice. There's all kinds of ways to be. It's optional to get all worked up and tense. Maybe the example of a traffic jam is simple enough. You can kind of, oh yeah, it's kind of true. I kind of agree with Gil here. Maybe it is optional. But even in the traffic jam, it can be very hard to see clearly how our automatic reactions are really our choices and that we have any choice to step off it. Even more so with more dramatic examples in our life. The task of mindfulness practice is to help us be calm and settled enough in the present moment. So we can really see the moment of contact, really see the moment where we meet life, how we actually respond directly and immediately that builds up the cycles of reactivity and suffering. To be there with it, to be right there where the shoe touches the ground, the foot touches the ground. And then we can see how all these things arise. The example which I give maybe all too much, but driving at night up a skyline and getting angry when the people have their high beams on at night driving towards me. And my reaction, that's a kind of suffering to be angry. Not everyone realizes that. Some people think it's great to be angry. But I felt the suffering in being angry. And so I used the mindfulness to look at that. What was going on with me when I got angry? And I looked very carefully and for a long time I didn't see anything. I just had lights, high beams, angry, high beams angry. And then one day, because I was noticed that just before, in a flash before the anger, I was afraid. And it was the fear that then I responded to in terms of pushing away something, having aversion, having anger. And once I saw the fear, I no longer had to trigger the anger. I can just stay there in the fear. The fear I think is just part of, it was reasonable in the context of being blinded. The anger was not necessary, was optional. And even though there's a kind of discomfort with being afraid, it's part of the inevitable part of experiences of life and appropriate to feel destined sometimes. So even when there's inevitable suffering, how do we relate to it? How do we choose to relate to it? What is the values? What's the sense of self? What are the attachments that come into play with the inevitable suffering? There's good grief, as Charlie Brown says, and there's bad grief. I've known people who've gone through periods of grief in their life. And it's been so much more difficult for them to go through the discomfort of grief because of the way they related to the grief. They related to it as if something, there was a personal fault, there was something wrong with them. And that's a kind of attachment, it's kind of drivenness, it's kind of value that kind of clamps down and makes the whole situation worse. To have it, oh, if something's wrong with me, then I'm feeling this. And I know people who, you know, grieving process takes a long time sometimes. And after many months, people have friends say, aren't you over it yet? It's such a disservice to do that to people. Such a disservice because there's no way of knowing how long a person needs to grieve. But as soon as you say that, then the person might internalize the idea, something's wrong with me. And then they're adding a layer of suffering, which is optional, but it's very painful. So how do we relate? You know, what are we doing with inevitable suffering? You know, if you lose your job, sometimes it's out of your control. How does that tie into the self-concept that you have that drives you or the fear that drives you or the ambition that drives you? Or is there something that drives you, your drivenness, your addiction, something that is meeting that's losing your job, that makes the whole situation worse? Losing a job is not a nice thing to do. It's an unpleasant situation often. But to add on top of that, the tremendous clinging and despair and suffering because relating it to my self-image, my self-worth, we don't have to do that. Our inherent self-worth, we have inherent self-worth, which is not dependent on having a job or being in a relationship or anything at all, just in nature of who we are. Part of the function of meditation is to help us relax enough so we can realize that our fundamental well-being, our fundamental self-worth and integrity is already in us. It's not a matter of doing something or undoing anything. So the first noble truth is to look at the suffering honestly and carefully and to notice the difference between inevitable and optional suffering. If it's inevitable suffering, can we simply leave it in the simplicity of the experience? Take care of the situation best we can, rest your back, do what you need to do to help in the situation. But not to add all the other things on top of it. All the drivenness and contractions and fears and additions and all the optional stuff we have. Can you see what's extra, what you add extra to it? A lot of our suffering however is optional to begin with. It's almost primarily optional stuff. As I think someone said, Mark Twain said, that he said, I've had a lot of troubles in my life, most of which never happened. It's the, so the second noble truth is the truth of our drivenness, our compulsiveness. The truth that there is a choice we make about how we choose to relate and respond to the world that adds additional extra layers of suffering on top of often much difficult situations to begin with. Maybe not even difficult to begin with at all. Can we look very honestly at what motivates us, motivates our responses and reactions? Can we notice very clearly where we have attachment, where we have resistance and fear? And look at it very clearly and very honestly. This is what it's called for in Buddhism. You're called to ask, look very honestly and truthfully. And to do this process it helps to meditate because meditation will slowly allow you to see more clearly and give you this calmness and stability that allows you to see more deeply than you can with kind of a normal kind of cluttered surface street mind that many people are walking around in. And I think as I said, it's very hard for most of us to see the choices that we make in relationship to our optional suffering. And if you don't see the choices you have, you don't really have choices. And if you don't see the choices, then it's not so optional. But if you're really mindful and really carefully attentive, you can actually see where the moment of choice arises. And if you can see the moment of choice, you can choose another route. You can choose not to have that constriction of the mind or the heart. You can choose to be open-hearted, open-minded. So then there's a possibility of the release from suffering. That is not based on clinging or craving. Something that can allow for the change and the flux, for the impermanence, the uncertainty. Sometimes in books on Buddhism, they translate the word tanhna as desire. And that gets you into maybe more trouble than using the word attachment, because there are also wholesome desires, appropriate desires. And then suddenly you just complicate discussion about which, you know, is Buddhism so pessimistic it rejects all desires. So it's not rejecting desire. It's really this much stronger thing, anxious desire or clinging or craving. However, kind of the footnote to this is that desire can also easily slip into thirst, into clinging or craving. The way that I just... So suffering is a central issue in Buddhist practice, but in focusing on suffering, the suffering that we focus on in Buddhist practice is what I call relational suffering. It's the kind of suffering that occurs to us through the kind of relationship we form with reality, we form with our life. It's not unavoidable suffering we're trying to avoid. It's the relational suffering we're trying to avoid. The kind of suffering that comes from the way in which we relate. If we relate to with aversion, there's suffering, just aversion itself and the tendency is aversion itself, the resistance and the pushing away compounds the suffering, compounds the pain. There's also suffering in excessive attachment or holding on. And that also can be painful. Is it necessary to hold on? Can we have enough trust in our life that we don't have to hold on for security or anything? Because to hold on is painful. I like to tell the story of my first long retreat in Thailand. I had a tremendous amount of physical pain in my legs and I would go to my meditation teacher and say all my legs hurt and he would give me good advice what to do, how to be mindful of it and I would go back and do it and I'd come back the next day and say they hurt more and he'd say something else and this is all happening through a translator in Thailand. And after about the fourth day of this, the American monk who was translating for me kind of whispered, he kind of as we were leaving the meditate, I have its house, he kind of leaned over to me and said, you're really attached to your pain aren't you? And that caught my attention because I didn't think you could be attached to pain and I wanted to get rid of it. But it was such an odd statement and I went back to my meditation place and reflected on it and discovered that the aversion I had to the pain was a kind of attachment and when I could see that and I was able to see and recognize the aversion clearly, then I could see to which degree that very pushing it away was actually causing the pain to be worse. Just physically it was obvious and not just not just mentally but physically. I could feel all this contraction around the pain, increasing the pain and when I could start seeing the way in which my relationship with pain increased the pain, I was able to let go of my attachment and my aversion and the physical pain got a lot less. It basically became manageable. It said that the desire for tranquility is the last attempt to impose structure on their life, to impose security on their life and meditators, people have serious meditators, it's often the last attempt to hold on attachment to tranquility. And there's a quote from Patanjali, attachment is a state of ignorance based on a memory of pleasure. So then there's a third noble truth which is called the end of suffering, sometimes called freedom. And the point here is that freedom or cessation of suffering is a real possibility and this is the joyful news, the suffering was the unfortunate news, this is supposed to be the fortune news, the good news. And one definition of freedom or nirvana that's given in the early Buddhist texts is it involves the calming of the constructions, calming of all these kind of elaborations and thoughts, abstractions that the mind makes and it's very significant I think it says calming, it doesn't say stopping them or ending them or seizing them, having clearly a blank mind, but it means calming them enough so that they don't kind of, either so they don't create suffering, the great attachment, or so that you can see clearly what's happening so that you don't get caught by anything, to calm the constructions, to release the constraints and constrictions in the heart. So the way out of the trap of suffering is said to be presence, to practice presence or awareness or insight, to see clearly, to understand clearly what is going on. Jeff Kornfield tells a story of when he was practicing with Ajahn Chah in Thailand, this teacher Ajahn Chah, that Ajahn Chah would sometimes walk around the monastery and ask his various monks, are you suffering today? And if the monk said no, then he'd say oh okay good, go on, and if the monk said yes I'm suffering today, he'd look, he'd kind of smile at them and say oh so you're attached today. So there's a possibility of ending the cycles of suffering. The Buddha, partly because he was anti-metaphysical, tended not to describe what this end of suffering felt like and how it was experienced. As soon as you kind of describe it too much, then it becomes kind of a real thing that you kind of hold on to. Is presence a real thing? Where's presence? Will you find presence? So you know, but the presence maybe is the way out, or the other way in or something. But sometimes anyway, sometimes it is called this state of freedom or awakening, it's called, it describes being peaceful, happy, tranquil, cool. Cool is often a common description. It's real cool. So then I have written down here, true awareness is a strength and maturity that sees life without condemnation or selfishness or attachment. So then finally there's a fourth noble truth, and this is that, one of my complaints about religions is that this is a great deal more of us suffering than we do about freedom. Yeah, they noticed that these have no arm freedom, fiveila or that non-self any questions Maybe that's right, what you're saying, it's a good point to be made. Kind of partly in defense, Buddhism at least, I don't feel like I have to be defensive, but the defense is that, as what I just said, is that it's very easy to become attached and ideal if you describe with freedom this. So we don't describe it very much. So rather we focus on, those keeps us from being free, so that those constraints aren't there anymore. We find ourselves in this place which we prefer not to describe. And that's basically how mindfulness practice works anyway. In mindfulness practice itself, 95% of the time, what we're attending to is what keeps us from being free. So maybe the teaching should reflect those percentages. You keep the practice somehow realistic, or teaching realistic. But freedom is a real possibility. And there's lots to be said about it. Maybe I'll say two things. One thing is that there's two kinds of freedom. There's what's called, in a sense, a momentary freedom, a momentary awakening. And then there's kind of a larger, more pervasive, or penetrating momentary freedom, or peace. The momentary freedom is just simply what comes from mindfulness practice. The moment of mindfulness is a moment of awakening. And this is hard to believe, maybe, because there's just these mindful, difficult things. But to have an awareness that sees things as they are, without condemnation, without clinging, without pushing away, without rejection, without holding on, is a kind of freedom, that's kind of awakening, which is very satisfying. And I stress this over and over again, that the goal and the means are the same in mindfulness practice. That the goal is to be mindful, and the means to be mindful is to be mindful. So it's really great to do something. You do it, and you've done it. And instead, sometimes it's called a small awakening, and it's very similar to big awakenings. A Buddha stubs his toe, or her toe, and if he or she is aware of that in a mindful way, that state of that Buddha mind is the same as our Buddha mind, if we're aware of it in a very clear, complete, mindful way, without judgment or evaluation or rejection. So there's one kind. And then there's, if you do that thoroughly, however, completely thorough about that kind of mindfulness, and do it continually and very thoroughly, it begins to penetrate deeply into our marrow, in a sense, the marrow of our mind, in a sense. And there's a possibility for a transformation of our relationship to the world, a radical transformation, radical transformation of the mind. And there's a different kind of experience, almost, which is not an experience, which happens when you're completely thorough about this. If you talk too much about these things, especially as Westerners, we tend to strive after it too much. And it doesn't make any sense to strive after it. You can't strive after the ultimate freedom, because the gate to ultimate freedom is to the momentary freedom. And the momentary freedom, you can't have any striving. So you're stuck. Yes? On this exact point, is the state of freedom one in which... Excuse me. There's one footnote here. See, I was about to describe the path to becoming free, and I was interrupted. We're not done with suffering yet, are we? We're too attached... I'm too attached to it, but... But in the state of freedom, is it that there is no suffering, or is it that the awareness of all suffering, which is... It doesn't mean anything anymore. This answer isn't straightforward, but I'll give what's an inadequate answer, which is pretty close, which goes shortness of time. And that is that the suffering that ends is a relational suffering. And so the Buddha isn't free of all suffering. There's other forms of suffering besides a relational suffering, from the relationship you form with life. So a Buddha isn't free of all pain. He's stuck to his throne of earth. But there's this wonderful analogy that Buddha gives of... If a man is struck by an arrow, that's pretty painful. We agree with that. However, if he's then struck by a second arrow, that's maybe worse. That's also pretty painful, so there's more pain. What happens is there is unavoidable pain in these periods. And most of us add a second arrow to that pain by contracting around it, by rejecting it, by feeling self-pity, and all the kind of things we do. So for the unavoidable forms of suffering, we're learning to live in the midst of that with equanimity and peace, and not add another arrow to it. However, there's also the relational suffering, and that you can do completely away with. I haven't done that myself, so I shouldn't say. But this is what the Buddhist tradition claims. And it's my faith that it's true, whatever my faith is worth. And it's kind of as good as it is. So then there's the fourth truth, and that's the path that leads from suffering. And it's usually described as the eighth goal-double path. And it's eight different levels or aspects or steps or areas which you need to take care of in order to kind of begin finding some freedom to suffering. And I won't go through these different eight tonight, but I'll just list them. They have to do with our view, waking up to the kind of views we have about the world, and having a right view or appropriate view of the world. It has to do with our attitude, it has to do with our speech, it has to do with our livelihood, it has to do with the kind of effort that we use, that we engage in in our spiritual life. It has to do with mindfulness, it has to do with concentration. And somehow attending to all these different areas of our life is how we support and express the practice, express our awakening. That the practice of awakening doesn't exist separate from our actions, our speech, our livelihood, our attitudes, our views, and all these things. That unless we attend to these things and somehow try to clean them up, you don't have the support, the stable support for doing spiritual practice. It's very hard, if they say, to meditate after robbing a bank. And, or as I said to someone earlier here, someone came on retreat and asked a lawyer, and said, I'm expected to lie as a lawyer. How can I lie and still be a Buddhist? You can't, is the answer. You can't be really mindful. You can't cultivate deep mindfulness and lie at the same time. So cleaning up our life, to some degree, ethically, is a very important foundation in order to do meditation practice. So the fourth noble truth has to do with how we live our lives. It's the recognition that awakening is not automatic. It needs, in some sense, some kind of behavioral change. And we often don't stress that. We often stress that mindfulness is enough. In a sense, mindfulness is enough. You don't have to worry about behavioral changes because if your mindfulness becomes stronger, you realize that you're probably need to make some changes. And it becomes, then, you become your own authority for those changes. But you should be aware that maybe that's what it requires. If you're lying, if you're lying in your business, maybe you need to change work or stop lying. So it's said there's no freedom without attention to our attitudes, our speech, our actions of livelihood. It's also said that all four of these truths, when they're really, you can understand them conceptually, but these four noble truths are said to be very difficult to understand in their deep aspect, in their fundamental identity. Deep aspects of them. And it's said that they become an insight rather than an understanding, more than intuitive insight. At the level at which they become an insight, all four truths are realized simultaneously. You see a situation. All four truths are realized simultaneously. You see a situation. And you understand how all four aspects of these truths are present in that situation. You see, if you're miserable, if you're having some suffering, you see that you see clearly the suffering. At the same time, you see what the causes you see, for example, maybe your attachment. You see that there's a possibility of being free of the suffering. So you see that as part of the insight into it. And then you see what you need to do to some degree in order to become free of that stuff. So all those four are possible at the same moment. And this is when seeing all those four together is when these four noble truths switch from becoming an intellectual understanding to becoming an intuitive understanding. And then in my own formulation of the four noble truths, in the end, the four noble truths are teaching. To help us, teaching of acceptance, of trust, and also of empowerment. That what we're coming to in awakening is a very pervasive, all-pervasive form of trust or acceptance. I like the word trust. So that we can live in this world with trust and acceptance, and with enough empowerment that we can act fully in the world at the same time. So these four noble truths are the jewel, particularly when the jewels of Buddhism. And I imagine that if you listen to the Buddha give a talk on the four noble truths, he would shiver, adhering it, and understanding, and implications of them. But anyway, we probably haven't shivered tonight. I wish you all well. Good night. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I have become very hard. And you want to stop it, but there is no button. So we go to a doctor for kind of drugs in order to stop our thinking, or to sleep. But this is not a very safe way, because even when we sleep, we continue our thinking and having nightmares. And we get addicted to drugs as we use them too much. But practice conscious breathing and smiling. You turn off your thinking easily. And if you practice like that for ten minutes, five or ten minutes, you already become different. Without thinking, being only with the breathing and the smiling, and getting in touch with the wonders of life, you get renewed very quickly. You know that a flower, when it cannot communicate with the water in the pot, it will become tired. So if you want to save the flower, you dip the stem of the flower into the water and you cut it again. And now the cell is fresh, the cells are fresh, the water entered, and then now communication is restored between the water and the flower. You put it again in the pot, and a few hours later the flower blooms again. Each of us is a flower, a flower of humanity. A human is a flower. And if you are not smiling, then something is wrong. You have to save yourself. You have to be in touch with the water of life in order to be refreshed and smiling like a flower. If there are people in your family that are not flowering, then help them. Because something is preventing them from being in touch with real life. It's like the dry cell of the flower prevents the flower to be in touch with the water. So practice conscious breathing. You have a chance to be in touch with the wonders of life again because they are all in the present moment. They can only be found in the present moment. And stopping the thinking is also an opportunity for you to be in touch. Because with the thinking, the thinking is something that blocks the way of communication. When you look at the moon, you can either see it or not see it. If you don't see it because there is an obstacle. That obstacle might be your thinking, your worries, your anxieties, and your being not in the present moment. So you remove that and you are in touch with the moon. It's wonderful. Are you in touch with your eyes? It's funny to question, but sometimes we are not in touch with our body. Sometimes we hate our body and we have to make friends to re-establish a good relationship with our body again. You know that a person who has become blind suffers very much. She thinks that she is in hell now as she is not capable of seeing things. If you ask her whether she had the opportunity to look really at anything deeply, he would say, No, I didn't have really a chance to look at anything really carefully. Did you look at the blue sky carefully? No. Did you look at the moon carefully? No. Did you look at your baby carefully? No. Now it's too late. And she thinks that she would be the happiest person on earth if she recovered her sight. She might be honest. She is honest. If someone can help her rest all her sight, she will be very happy. She spent days and hours looking at everything. But maybe a few months later she falls again into forgetfulness and do not realize that having good eyes is a wonderful thing. All of us have good eyes, capable of seeing all forms, all colors, and we always complain that we are not happy. The only fact that we have good eyes is already a very deep source of happiness. And we not only have eyes, but we have other things. We have our body, our hand. You know that putting your hand on the hand of a child in mindfulness really gets the feel of it. It's a wonderful thing. Even if you put your hand on your face, in mindfulness realizing the contact is wonderful. Because this hand is not only your hand. It has been handed down by several generations.
