So, probably this will be the last more introductory talk for the Satipetana Sutta, the discourse on the Four Foundations for Awareness. 
The foundations upon which we can grow a particularly valuable form of awareness. 
And the text begins with this confident statement that there is a direct path, a direct way, a direct journey to, and the word is maybe more like a going, a direct going to freedom, to liberation. 
And what is this direct way? The text asks. 
And then the Buddha then describes it. 
And in short end, he first says to observe the body in its own terms, the body in terms of a body, to know feelings in terms of feelings, to know mental states in terms of mental states, and to know mental processes in terms of mental processes. 
And this word in terms of the literal language it says, if you really did a literal translation, it would say the body in the body, the feelings in the feelings, mind states in mind states, and mental processes in mental processes. 
But this word in, or this grammatical form that gives us in, can also mean in terms of, in regards to, in respect to. 
And the usual interpretation for this is that the observation is meant to be very simple. 
And the word observe here is such an important one. 
Our ability to kind of settle back in a nice, comfortable, easy chair and just see what's happening without judging it or fixing it or doing anything with it. 
This kind of very spacious and peaceful way of just to watch, just to see. 
And to do so, the body in terms of the body, meaning not in terms of our judgments, in terms of our memories, in terms of the other mind states, in terms of mental processes, just a radical simplicity being with the body. 
So to observe it, that's the way to do it. 
But I use the example of sitting in an easy armchair and just kind of watching it as a reference point for it. 
But the text actually says to do it ardently. 
And I love the word ardent, to do it with certain kind of engagement, like really there. 
And then do it with awareness and do it with a clear comprehension, clear recognition of what's happening. 
Having put aside covetousness and distress for the world. 
Now suddenly it becomes kind of a tall order, this whole thing. 
It's not easy to be able to observe without judging, to fearing, thinking about things, reacting, let alone being in the present moment. 
It's not easy to apply a certain kind of healthy peacemaking ardency. 
And it's not easy to maintain a continuity of awareness, a continuity of clear comprehension. 
And it's not easy to put aside the greed we have, the covetousness, the wantings we have, or the distress we have. 
And so what this text is doing is saying there is a path to freedom, a way, go. 
This is the way to go to freedom. 
But maybe recognizing it's not easy to do that. 
Then the text goes on and offers 13 exercises for how to get there. 
And the first one is this first tetrahedra of anapanasati, is being attentive to breathing in a certain way, which we'll go through over the next few days. 
And as a person learns this exercise, then that exercise is onward leading. 
Things move, and you're part of this journey, this ongoing, this going, this movement. 
And the Buddha's teachings is full of movement. 
And it's not about only about going nowhere, being no one, doing nothing, which is a wonderful teaching in a limited way of understanding it. 
But it's not the full teaching. 
The Buddha's teachings are this kind of ongoing quality of it. 
Now if you went to the playground and there's a child on a slide, on the top of the slide, and you said to the child, oh, let me give you some profound spiritual teaching. 
There's nowhere to go, nothing to do, and no one to be. 
Just sit. 
Just sit and do nothing. 
The child would just be like perplexed, or like the child might be wiser, knows what they're there. 
The child's there for the fun, the process of going down the slide. 
And they're up there to do that. 
And there's a kind of a, they're not greedy for it, maybe, or they're not trying to prove themselves to anyone. 
They're not trying to accomplish any great thing, like they'd be the best slide maker in the world. 
They're just going to go down the slide for the fun of the slide. 
So I use that as a reference point for there is a kind of leaning into, or into the slide, onto the slope of mindfulness, of this practice. 
It's not only about staying exactly where you are, and nothing ever changes. 
The language of change, though, that the Buddha uses that is bhavana, which, as I understand it, means something like to cultivate or to develop. 
As you would, a farmer would, or a gardener, would cultivate a plant, or a parent would help a child develop by feeding them and treating them well, so that in a healthy way they can physically and psychologically develop. 
The parent is not stretching the child so they grow faster. 
We're allowing a natural process to unfold. 
So the same way with this mindfulness practice, there's a radical simplicity, being aware of the body in and of itself, being aware of breathing, just a simplicity of breathing, knowing it, and being allowing for the possibility that you're on a slide, or there's a growth or development that goes on here. 
So the text begins with a promise, or a kind of, some people call it a promise, that there is a direct way to freedom. 
The way you do it is observing this very strong, this kind of mature place of mindfulness to observe the body in and of itself, feelings, mental states, and mental processes. 
But the heart of the text is then the exercises that it gives, and we'll go through the 13 exercises. 
After each exercise, there's a refrain, it's usually called a refrain, and that's the part that gets repeated over and over again. 
For those of you who are here Monday when I read my synopsis of this whole process, the refrain was represented by the expression observing change in the body, abiding, not clinging to anything in the world. 
And the refrain itself continues a journey, and it's actually a four-part journey, a three- or four-part journey, that is describing an unfolding that goes through observing change in such a way that the awareness gets more and more clarified, purified, simplified, until awareness becomes kind of lucid. 
And it's so lucid that then we can relax into it. 
Then it's kind of like relaxing into a long, wonderful, comfortable slide down a hill. 
Then the process takes over, and the process of deepening meditation takes over, that leads to non-clinging to freedom. 
So it's important not to be in a hurry to go through all this, it's important not to hopefully get discouraged, but actually I find it phenomenally inspiring. 
This idea that the Buddha describes a process of growth, a process of unfolding, we're not expected to be free just quickly, like, okay, like instant enlightenment, as some people would like to have it. 
But rather there's something very mature and maturing about settling down for the long term and beginning to putting the steady pieces in place of developing, cultivating, growing awareness, our ability to be more and more present in the present moment with awareness, with attention, to learn the art of resting in there and opening to it so that it's peaceful, so that it's inspiring, so that it's happiness producing, so that there's a goodness to it that we open up to as we cultivate and develop this simple capacity to be aware. 
As we go through the text, different faculties of attention are called into play at different times. 
And I think of attention as kind of like the Swiss Army Knife of the Mind. 
It has all these different tools that can be used. 
And so at different times we learn these different tools and apply them. 
Each of them useful at different times, different circumstances to help us be present with our experience and not only be present, but to have the kind of awareness that is onward leading, that has space in it, peacefulness in it, that's not complicated by our expectations and our pushing and our wanting. 
It's just kind of like making space for the organic cultivation, organic development, maturation that leads to freedom. 
And so today the emphasis was discovering more and more about this quality of knowing, recognition and how knowing and recognizing things has a power to it and a beauty to it and a kind of peacefulness to it. 
Sometimes to name something gives some kind of space in the heart, the mind, oh, it's been named, oh, it's like that, yes, that's how it is. 
Some might say that there's a lot of tension here in the group and then, oh, someone named it finally, oh yes, that's what's happening and then everyone kind of relaxes a little bit. 
So to do that with the breathing, to establish attention, establish awareness with breathing and then to know the breathing. 
And as we know it, to begin discovering some of the qualities of knowing or discover how to know so that knowing is unburdened with all the baggage we carry with us. 
It's so simple and to feel the delight or the peace or the freedom from the disentanglement from that simple knowing. 
At first it might seem like it's nothing, like it's, what's the big deal? But to, it's a big deal to develop this capacity to know. 
It's a beautiful thing to do. 
So, thank you. 
I look forward to our time tomorrow.
