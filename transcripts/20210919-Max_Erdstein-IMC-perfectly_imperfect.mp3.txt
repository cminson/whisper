Thank you very much. Very nice to be with you. You can hear me okay? Yeah? Sounds good. Okay, okay, good. Well, nice to see some of you on Zoom, and I trust it's okay up on YouTube. One of the images I was remembering this morning when I was thinking about what I might want to share was a time that I traveled with my Zen teacher, Mel Weitzman, to Japan. We were actually in Japan a number of times together, but this one trip, it wasn't so much business. It was more pleasure, and we did some traveling around, and we went to this island called Naoshima. Some of you might know about this or have heard of it. It's an island, I hope I'm getting it right. I think it's off the coast of Shikoku, which is one of the main larger islands in Japan. And Naoshima is kind of a rural place, and in Japan, there's this phenomena of the rural spots have sort of emptied out because young people go to Tokyo and Osaka, the big cities, because that's where the good jobs are. And you have these pockets of just sort of rural spots where there's not a lot of young people, and there's actually a lot of empty houses and empty buildings. And so the different local municipalities have different strategies for what to do. And in Naoshima, they decided to turn this sort of sleepy little village island into one big art installation. So there was funding, and I think a couple of really beautiful museums were built. And then what they did is took some of the old, beautiful, traditional Japanese homes that have the tatami floor and the sliding screens, and they offered them to different artists, Japanese artists, international artists, and they put different pieces and exhibitions in these homes. So if you go to Naoshima as a visitor, you're given a map, and you can wander around the kind of the old street. And then, you know, there's some dot in front of you don't want to go into someone's home, private home. But if there's some dot there, you know, it's a sign that this is part of the art, and you can go in. So we did that, we walked around, and it was really fun, really creative to see what different artists had done with this sort of blank canvas of having a house to do something. And so the piece I wanted to talk about or share was one by the American artist James Turrell. You might have heard of James Turrell, he's an artist who works with light a lot, and you know, other things. I think he's from Texas, I'm not sure. This was a piece where we had to take off our shoes, and then you can do that in these places because you don't wear shoes inside, right? In Japan. We take off our shoes, and we walked into this pitch black room. It was totally black, totally dark. And you kind of walk in, and...what? And you kind of just stand there, you don't know if you're going to go forward, go back, is there a place to sit? Maybe eventually we sat on the floor, but you don't want to get stepped on. And maybe, I don't know, maybe there was someone who was guiding us a little bit to stand over here, stand over there. But we walked in to this empty, totally dark space. No light. And your mind is going, okay, what is this? What are we doing? And you know, and kind of thinking, and there's nothing you can really do. Little by little, as we wait, our eyes begin to adjust. You know, what it is biologically, I guess, our pupils start to grow, maybe, and to receive more light, whatever little light is there. But it's this kind of trust, just there, we're just waiting, we're just trusting. Little by little, I mean, really, it's like, you know, five or ten minutes until something comes into view. And I was thinking about that. I think that for me, this is a very nice image for our practice. You may have lots of ideas of what meditation is, what I'm supposed to do, what I want to get from it, what I don't want, what I want to happen. But actually, I think our practice is more like finding our way in the dark. And when you're in the dark, it's like, we have to be, we go slow. We have to go slowly in the dark. You don't want to bump into something, you don't want to trip, you don't want to get slowly and carefully. And just like in this art installation, you know, there's nothing we can do to speed up that process. But what we're responsible for is just to stay there, to be still, to be patient. And actually, that's quite a big thing, you know, it takes a lot of courage to stay with something, but we don't know where it's leading. We don't know where it's going. Am I doing it right? Am I doing it wrong? But just to be still, to be patient, to be willing to receive, you know, so this idea of finding our way in the dark. Me, it's sort of the opposite of control. Right? Of mastery. I'm going to control this breath. I'm going to control these feelings. I'm not here to feel that. But I think in meditation, we're always sort of working with this very human wish to control. What is it to soften the hand of control and to receive, to be willing to let this experience happen to us? So it's like for me, being in that dark room, it's like the ultimate humility, the ultimate equalizer. Everybody's equal in there. It doesn't matter what you're wearing. It doesn't matter what you look like. Everybody's one. Everybody's equal. You know, the other place in Japan where there's this kind of radical equality is the communal baths, hot springs. You know, because in Japan, this is a little bit of a tangent, but in Japan, what I realized is that how you're seen in society is very much marked by what you wear. I mean, it's true everywhere. But Japan has these fantastic uniforms and, you know, in business, people wear a certain kind of suit. And, you know, everyone wears something special to kind of mark who you are. But then when you take a bath and you go to the onsen, you can't wear anything. You have to be completely naked just for hygienic reasons. And so you go in, you shower and clean yourself, and then you can get in the communal pools, plunges. And it's like you have executives with, you know, just everyone is there to get old and young, and it's really nice. It's really wonderful. And so that's sort of, you know, in Buddhism, the image of the dark and the darkness is a metaphor for oneness. Everything is one in the dark. It's a great equalizer. And the kind of humility and trust and courage it takes to go into the dark and to find our way in the dark. Every time we sit down to meditate, we're doing that. We don't know what the next moment is going to bring. But we need to make this intention, this commitment to be here, present, to what this moment brings. That's all we have to do. We don't need to control anything. We don't need to figure anything out. And I think with this kind of intention, beautiful intimacy had arise, intimacy with ourselves, this connectedness, this closeness, that we've let go of something. We've let go of that constant, I've got to do this, I've got to get that done and that improve, you know, self improvement. Oh my God. One of my favorite hobbies. My Dharma practice is not about self improvement. This is really, really important point. We're here to experience the truth of who and what we already are. Not to try to get somewhere. What we think we should be, want to be. Because according to the Dharma, we're already there. We're not beautiful. Whenever we think we need to be, we're already there. So really, as one of my teachers says, all Dharma practice is post enlightenment practice. What does it mean to practice the understanding that who and what we already are is enough. Who and what we already are is the most perfect expression of the Dharma of this reality. How can we, how can water get any more wet, right? Water is wet, that's the nature of water. Better water, worse water. How can you become any more you? Right. So, this kind of intimacy, this kind of trust. And I think one of the, something that we can let go of, or that gets let go of in this intimate presence, is that very human tendency to prepare, to evaluate, judge, oh, this meditation was okay, but I don't have much of that meditation. This teacher is okay, but this, yeah. There's a kind of, you know, it's important, very important to have that capacity to evaluate, to compare. But it's maybe just as important to know the limits of it, to be able to put it down. There's almost a kind of violence in the comparing mind, constantly comparing. And what it does is it blocks us from fully entering into this experience, in this moment, and fully appreciating what we already have, because we're thinking about what we don't have. I remember early in my practice, you know, gave a, I don't remember if it was a talk or if it was something he said to me, but he said something like, you have a choice in the ideal, in the actual, do you choose? I remember thinking, obviously, choose the ideal, right? It's ideal. You choose the actual, because there is no such thing as the ideal. The ideal doesn't exist, right? All there is, is the actual. This practice is about again and again, we return to the actual. We return to what's happening now. But we love the ideal, right? The ideal is the ideal. That's the best. This is like the fundamental kind of comparing mind. How things are versus how we want them to be. Practice is always about eeling into this, this dichotomy, a lot of kindness, a lot of compassion, a lot of patience. And to see all the ways that we don't want to be with how things are. Because we prefer the ideal, right? Another way to say it is the perfect versus the imperfect. What is perfect? What does it mean for something to be perfect? And then usually, I think our usual way of thinking to be perfect is it kind of measures up to something we have in our mind. Oh yeah, that's a perfect... Maybe there is such a perfect croissant somewhere. The platonic ideal of the croissant. Just likey, no, it's soft, it's not spongy. The Zen teacher Suzuki Roshi says this about perfect and imperfect, which I love. He says, Nothing we see or hear is perfect. Right there in the imperfection is perfect reality. So what is it to see in such a way, feel in such a way that we might think of this imperfect, that's lacking in some way, that's not coming up to what we want, our standards. There's perfect reality in this. This is as close as it gets. It's like in a Dharma way of understanding. The perfection in a sense, it's sort of like that darkness, that oneness. It's like the perfect peace before we were born. It's perfectly peaceful, but it's probably a little too peaceful for us right now. We don't want it to be that peaceful yet, because life is out of the world of oneness. There's something, right? There's some particular existence, there's some particular feeling. And that's like coming out of this world of perfection. Mel, my Zen teacher, used to say that everything we experience is out of balance. Out of balance, and it's coming back into balance. Out of balance, coming back into balance. So perception depends on difference, right? Receiving difference. Otherwise we're just in the world of oneness, we're just in the world of total oneness. This is Suzuki Roshi again, in Zen mind, beginner's mind, which is great if you haven't looked at that. We should find perfect existence through imperfect existence. We should find perfection in imperfection. For us, complete perfection is not different from imperfection. The eternal exists because of non-eternal existence. Non-eternal means this world of change, this world of transient and permanence. The eternal exists because of non-eternal existence. At this point, one time I was in Japan and had a meeting with one of the great old Buddha masters. And we had to bring a question. And I said to him, everything changes, what's the one thing that doesn't change? And he started laughing. And he said, I missed. But that's this. The eternal exists because of non-eternal existence. In Buddhism, it is a heretical view to expect something outside this world. We should find the truth in this world through our difficulties. So this means that whatever it is we're looking for, whatever it is we think we need, we want to find the goal, the ultimate, the end of our suffering, whatever it is, true love. It's all that can be found right here, this moment, this ordinary, life's ordinary experience. The answer is here. The answer is in how things already are. We can spend a long time in practice spinning our wheels, chasing, chasing, chasing. And that's the comparing mind. They've got it. I don't. One day I'll get it. Or what's worse than that? I've got it. They don't. So this is, I think the antidote to this is this intimacy and this intimate presence, appreciating the absolute value of something. I'm comparing it to something else. One of the great doorways into this intimacy and this appreciation that I found is babies. You spend time with the baby. I've got almost five months old now. Third one. But that presence, that purity that a baby has, they draw you in. You're not thinking, oh, this baby's okay, but if they were, I wish she rolled over a little like that baby, or I wish she had a little more hair or less hair. It's like, no, you're just totally in the thrall of this being who's so present and so open. So what is it? What is it for you that is a doorway into this presence, this way of being that's so simple, actually? We often say in Dharma practice, it pays to be simple, to be a little, you're not too smart. If you're too smart, you have a problem. You're always trying to figure things out. But nothing we see or hear is perfect. Right there in the imperfection, it's perfect realities. Maybe I would share this quote from, according to Facebook, it's from Ram Dass, but who knows? But it's a good quote anyway. He says, when you go out into the woods and you look at the trees, you see all these different trees, and some of them are bent, and some of them are strained, and some of them are evergreen, and some of them are whatever. You look at the tree and you allow it. You see why it is the way it is. You sort of understand that it didn't get enough light, and so it turned that way. And you don't get all emotional about it. You just allow it. You appreciate the tree. The minute you get near humans, you lose all that. And you're constantly saying, you are too this, or I'm too this. A judgment mind comes in. It's eye practice turning people into trees, which means appreciating them just the way they are. One of the great gifts of this practice is again and again, referring to how things are, the kindness, the care, with love, is that this is such a gift to ourselves, it's such a gift to others to really savor another person for how they are, rather than how we think they should be, or want them to be. This invitation to practice intimately, stay close, stay close to ourselves, stay close to others. Thank you very much. Do you guys want to take a question or two? Yeah, that sounds great. If you've got some time, Max, we can ask folks in Zoom. If you want to post a question in chat on YouTube, you can either raise your hand in Zoom or post a question in chat on Zoom as well. We give the YouTube stream time to catch up. It's a blessing. If you want to stay for a few minutes, maybe just take a couple of questions. I'm just going to peek into YouTube. Max, we've got a cat there has her hand up. Go ahead and go ahead and bring yourself off mute and ask your question. Hi, Max. So nice to see you. I'm sorry, I can't help but ask this question. What was in the dark room? You know, remember that we waited and waited. And then at some point, this beautiful, you know, I can't remember exactly what it was, but something totally switched on in terms of light and color. And but it was like, thank you for asking because I wanted to share that at the end of the talk because I don't remember exactly what it looked like, but I remember there was a way that like my heart just, you know, that all of a sudden, what what, you know, some some beautiful image came into interview. And it was quite shocking that you couldn't see it. We couldn't see it. I couldn't see it and couldn't see it. And then little by little, it started and then quite quickly, all at once. Wow. It was very nice and very cool. And I think it's it's a great metaphor for for our practice of we we see what we're capable of seeing, you know, and the people I just remember to kind of like when it when it happened for people, there was a I love his work. The artist's work. Yeah, yeah, he has some really stunning installations and there's a few of his other stuff in Japan or many other places. I actually had a quick question. Oh, actually, Cindy, go ahead and go ahead and come off mute. Well, first of all, Max, it's wonderful to have you here this week to be with us with the Sangha. And thanks so much. Three children. Whoa. You know, so I was just thinking, you know, when I was a young parent, I didn't have a practice. And I just was wondering how you integrate the practice into your parenting with the three children. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's lovely to be here. Thank you. And you know, in a way, you know, I don't mean to be flippant to say this, but that, you know, they are my practice, you know, it's not like there's some other practice and then they kind of fit them in or I really have come to appreciate the way that, you know, really whatever it is that's going on in our life, that's our practice. That's the contour, the shape, the substance of our practice. And as you know, children are amazing teachers and amazing sources of joy and suffering and everything in between. And so it's quite, quite a, for me, the time I spent in the monastery feels like a cakewalk, you know, it's too easy. This is like, you know, it's quite a humbling, beautiful thing to care for others in this way, care for children in this way, but also to be really challenged, you know, that they get to really the edge and sometimes over the edge of our capacities. And then what, then what do we do? Oh, I didn't, I didn't think I was like that. Well, congratulations to you and this is wonderful. I'm so happy to hear you had a, you have a little five month old as well. Max, there was a question on YouTube. When you do your breathing meditation, what part of your body do you concentrate on more often? Yeah, for, for me, I tend to concentrate mostly and bring, bring the awareness mostly to the belly area. And every, you know, it's all good, and it's all wonderful. But I find that there is something special about that part of the body. Feel the rise and fall of the belly. It's like the belly is the center of our being. And so for me, there's something that's very integrated to be with the breath at the belly. And for some years I worked with the breath at the nostrils. And that's nice. It's a lovely practice. But I found that it got a little bit top heavy, you know, it was kind of too much up there. We're already up here a lot. You know, it's something about bringing down the center of gravity down to the belly. And the belly is also a very good place for feedback. I noticed if there's some contraction in the belly, you know, that's good to feel. That's good to notice. What is it to soften that? What is it? Soften, soften the belly. And so I, yeah, that, that's become sort of my home base. And it has a, it has a nice, you know, in our Vipassana practice, it's a very rich area because there's a lot going on at the belly, you know, the sensations of rising and falling, you can really, you can really get close to those sensations. And then in other Eastern practices, especially in East Asian, Chinese, Chang'e, Japan, that area is called the Japanese Dattanden, right? The Dantian. And it's considered to be a place, a very particular place of energy in the body. And so there's a, there can be this nice cultivation of energy there. So yeah, for those reasons, I like, I like working with the belly. But it's all good. It's all good. And it's really where, just where, where intuitively for you, where, where, where is, where are those sensations of breathing most clear? Where does it feel good to hang out, to land and hang out there? Thanks, Max. I actually had a question about, you know, you talked about self-improvement and comparing, I guess. So I would assume there is a, there was room to think about self-improvement in some sense. Be careful, Kevin. No, you're absolutely right. I think that, you know, the reason I emphasize letting go of comparing mind and self-improvement is because I think we tend to hang out there the most. You know, mostly we're on the side of wanting to then, you know, get better at this or that or get away from this or that. And so, you know, it's helpful to bring in the other side. That said, you know, it's like self-improvement is what I think about as the developmental model, right? We're developing from this and growing and, you know, whatever word you want to, proving is a little, it's a strong word. You're cultivating, we're maturing, we're, yeah, you know, all these things we're transforming. And so this is the kind of developmental path. And this is very clearly talked about in the Buddhist teachings, you know, it's a path, a path that we walk on. There's a beginning, there's a middle, there's an, and so, you know, the developmental model is part of the picture. And then I think the interesting thing for me is how do we hold that developmental model with this intimate, I was calling it intimate presence, but whatever words you want to say of this total opening and accepting how it is, how things are. And so the way I think about it is the path of a child to becoming an adult is clearly, you know, there's a developmental process that's happening. Five-year-old is very different than a 10-year-old, very different than a 17-year-old, very different than a 40-year-old, right? So there's that side. And then the other side is a five-year-old is not just a deficient 17-year-old. Now, this five-year-old is great, but yeah, but when you get a few more years under your belt, then you'll be good enough, you know? No, it's crazy, right? A five-year-old is perfectly a five-year-old. Has the thoughts, the feelings, the difficulties, the insights of a five-year-old. And we would never say there's something wrong with this five-year-old for being like a five-year-old. You know, they're going to be as they are, just the way a teenager is perfectly a teenager. And a person who's middle-aged is in that time of life. And, you know, an elder is perfectly an elder. It's like, so I think we need to hold both of these perspectives, that there's the developmental side, and then there's the side of seeing the perfection in this imperfect moment. And so that's like form and emptiness, right? You know, say there's the side that's form, and then there's the side that's emptiness. And they're not actually two different things. It's one thing, right? There's one reality, and we can see it from the perspective of form, and we can see it from the perspective of emptiness. So we can see ourselves from the perspective of self. I have a self who I'm trying to get, and I have lots of projects I'm trying to learn Japanese for, and I'm studying Tai Chi, and there's quite a lot of learning and improvement that is possible in that. And then to also be willing to be where we are, and commit to where we are. And that's this intimate practice of to return to where we are. And I think when we meditate, this is a very, very valuable perspective to let go of all of our ideas about self-improvement. Not because there's something wrong with them, but it turns out that they're not that helpful in meditation. Just to return to where we are. You know, Gil likes to say something at the beginning of retreats like, practice is about getting from A to B, and the way to get from A to B is to be fully at A. Thank you, Kevin. Is that, you know, Yeah, that's great. I think it just kind of brings you back to kind of that beginner's mind, I guess, and growth and stuff. And that's really helpful. Thank you, Max. Okay, I think that's, it looks like that's all the questions that people have. So, Max, thank you very much for your time with us today.
