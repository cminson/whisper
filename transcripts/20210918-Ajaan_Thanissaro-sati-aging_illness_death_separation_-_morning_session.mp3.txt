So, I'd like to welcome everybody to this Sati Center event.
I also want to point out the San Francisco Parisa for that we meet and study Tana and
John's teachings.
There's also a co-sponsor of this event.
We've upgraded our Zoom link to accommodate 500 people and Abology actually funded that,
so thank you for that.
Big thing is very about it to be muted and if you have a question, you can go to the
reactions with maybe other ways on Zoom to ask a question, but raise your hand.
And then when Tana and John ask for questions, for the morning, I'll be calling on you to
ask your question and then the afternoon Abology will be calling on you and bring more of afterwards
to put your hand down also, but to keep muted.
One more quick announcement if you feel inspired to give a donation to the Sati Center.
Go to the website or write a check.
The important thing why I'm making this announcement is two things, one, 95% of all donations
of this event will go to MetaForest Monastery, but the other thing more importantly is to
put down, there's a space on PayPal, put down what the donation is for because the Sati
Center has a great deal of programs going on these days through the Zoom and if you don't
put down where it is, we won't know where it'll go, it makes my life a treasure of confusing.
So with that, I would like to turn this over to Tana and John.
Okay, let's start with some meditation.
Get a comfortable position to get into, close your eyes, and I'll give you some brief instructions
for the meditation to begin with and then ask that you meditate while I talk.
Okay, first start with thoughts of goodwill.
Goodwill is always for true happiness.
There are true happiness, the true happiness of all of the beings.
Because true happiness comes from within, there's no conflict there.
So start with thought, may I be truly happy, may I understand the causes for true happiness
and be willing and able to act on it, and then spread that same thought to others, to start
with people who are close to your heart, your family, your very close friends, may they find
true happiness too.
And then spread those thoughts out in never-widening circles, the people you know well and like.
The people you like even though you don't know them so well.
The people you're more neutral about, and then the people you don't like.
Remember that the world would be a much better place if everyone could find true happiness
within.
That thoughts of goodwill to people you don't even know, and not just people, living beings
of all kinds, east, west, north, south, above and below out to infinity, may we all find
true happiness in our hearts.
Now bring your attention to the breath.
Take a couple of good long deep in and out breaths.
Notice where you feel the breathing process in the body.
Subtly your attention there, and then ask yourself if it's comfortable, if long breathing
is comfortable, keep it up.
If it's not comfortable, you can change, try shorter breathing or in short, out long,
in long, out short, heavy, light, fast, slow, deep, shallow.
You can experiment for a while to see what rhythm and textual breathing feels best for
the body right there.
Or you can simply pose the thought in the mind each time you breathe in, what kind of
breathing we feel good now, and see how the body responds.
Mind winders off, just drop it over the thought is, and you'll be right back at the breath.
Minders off, ten times, a hundred times, just keep coming back ten times, a hundred times.
Don't get discouraged.
Each time you come back, actually, reward yourself with a really good breath when it
feels gratifying deep down inside, and then of course, why stop at one.
Now, as the breath gets comfortable, the next step is to be aware of the whole body as you
breathe in, the whole body as you breathe out.
Pick up yourself a good solid foundation, and a good way to build up to that whole body
awareness is to go through the body first, section by section, to a good place to start
is down around the navel.
Locate that part of the body in your awareness.
Watch it for a while as you breathe in, breathe out to see what rhythm of breathing feels
good there, and if you notice any tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow
it to relax so that no new tension builds up as you breathe in, you don't hold on to
any tension as you breathe out.
Then, move your tension up to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there, one, locate
that part of the body in your awareness, two, watch it for a while as you breathe in, breathe
out to see what rhythm of breathing feels good there, and then three, if there's any
tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax.
Now, let's move on to the solar plexus, the solar plexus, the solar plexus, the solar
plexus, the solar plexus, the solar plexus, the solar plexus, the solar plexus.
Now, I'll let you continue going through the body at your own pace.
through the chest, throat, into the head,
down the shoulders, to the arms, down the back of the legs.
Do that at your own pace.
And you can go through the body several times as you like
until you're ready to settle down.
Then choose any one spot in the body that's most congenial, focus your attention there,
and then think of your awareness spreading from that spot to fill the whole body.
If you're going to maintain that whole body awareness,
if it begins to blur out, go back to the survey of the body section by section again.
Meanwhile, I'll talk.
Aging illness, death.
Western Buddhism, these are sometimes treated as peripheral issues of interest only
to people who are already old, sick, or dying.
Western Buddhism could be called the cult of the present moment, or the cult of the here and now.
And that focuses on the problem of solving, finding happiness and ease in the present
as an end in and of itself.
And in this context, issues of aging, illness, and death are only ten-central.
When they are addressed, they're told,
well, take the lessons you learned about being okay in the present moment,
learn how to be okay about aging, okay about illness, okay about dying.
As for the question of what happens after death, it's usually treated as something that's in bad taste.
In fact, some people question, say the question of what happens after death
is not even worth thinking about, it's best left as a mystery.
On the grounds that no one can really answer.
It's better to accept the mystery than to try to find answers to things you don't yet know.
When we compare this to the Buddha's original teachings, it's very ironic
because it has the priorities backwards.
And it's worse than ironic.
It's a mistake on two levels.
The first level has to do with the role the aging illness and death played in the bodhisattva's original motivation to find the Dharma.
When we look at his life, we see the ages of aging illness and death were central to his quest for awakening.
But because of these things that he looked for the Dharma to begin with,
he wasn't looking simply for peace in the present moment.
Even though he knew his 20s, he saw the fallacy in the sentiment,
this is, I don't need to be taught how to die, I don't want to learn how to live.
He realized that if you don't answer the question of what happens after death,
it's hard to answer what's a well-spent life, what's a skillful use of your life.
We wanted to find answers to that.
It was because of his desire not to suffer from aging illness and death.
It kept him on the path.
It was because of his success that we have the Dharma.
In fact, you say we have the Dharma because of aging illness and death,
because one person's desire not to suffer from these things ever again.
One text tells us that he saw that aging illness and death must come from birth.
But then the question is, is birth repeated?
Is it going to happen again?
Is it something you have to prepare for again or not?
And once it's happened, do you have to suffer from it?
These are the questions that remain unanswered until the night of his awakening.
We find that the answers they gave after the night of his awakening come into two sorts.
One is how not to suffer, or even when aging illness and death are still happening.
The other is how to find a dimension where there is no aging illness and death at all.
That's what we'll be talking about today.
And the night of his awakening, we got the mind into the right concentration.
We realized he could use that concentrated mind in order to get acknowledged.
The first question he asked basically was, is there anything after death?
And if so, what?
And he saw that he'd been reborn many, many times in the system with many, many aeons of births and deaths.
Seeing his name, his appearance, what clan or species he belonged to,
his experience of pleasure and pain, the food that he ate, and the way he died.
Again and again and again.
Now sometimes this knowledge is dismissed simply as being a holdover of his culture
and that everybody in India at the time believed in rebirth.
But that's not the case.
It was really a hotly debated issue.
Some people said death was followed by annihilation.
Others said there was followed by rebirth in which you stayed the same as you were before.
The Brahmins especially liked this one.
If you're a Brahmin in this lifetime, you're guaranteed to be a Brahmin in the next lifetime.
People in other castes were going to be in those other castes again and they had to serve the Brahmins.
But the Buddha saw from his own knowledge that that was not the case.
He changed from many, many levels of the cosmos from the very highest to the very lowest.
So instead of pursuing that knowledge any further, then he came up with a question,
what is the factor that determines these changes?
That became the second answer.
The answer was his actions, his karma, based on right views or wrong views.
And here it's good to look at the way he responded to this particular sort of knowledge.
He said that, freely admitted, that there are other people who had these kinds of knowledges in their meditation before him.
But his knowledge differed in two respects and also different in terms of the questions he asked.
The differences had to do with the extent of his knowledge.
He saw much further backs.
We could see larger patterns than they had.
We looked in more detail, and this relates directly to the issue of how we later came to teach the Dharma.
Because other people had had this knowledge beforehand.
In some cases they would see someone had done good in this lifetime and it went to a good rebirth.
Done bad in this lifetime, gone to a bad rebirth.
And they ended up teaching that action was deterministic.
In other words, your actions in the past will totally determine where you're going to go at that time.
There were others, though, who saw that there were cases where someone had done good in this lifetime and went to a bad rebirth.
Or done bad in Islam and gone to a good rebirth.
And these are the ones who taught that your actions had no impact on your rebirth at all.
The rebirth of changes in your birth or troubling random.
His response was to look at the issue more carefully.
And he noticed one thing that was very important, the cases where someone had done bad in this lifetime and gone to a good rebirth.
The person that actually changed their views before they died.
In fact, a moment of death.
In some cases they actually acted on right view.
And in cases where people had done good in this lifetime and gone to a bad rebirth.
It's because at the moment of death they developed a wrong view and acted on wrong view.
This is the question to them, that actions in the present moment can have a huge impact and counteract the impact of your past.
There is someone who is not muted.
If you're not muted, please mute yourself.
Music time.
Okay.
And so the suggestion that your present actions were very important, that they could actually counteract the effect of past actions.
And not only present actions in the mind.
So that's what inspired in his third knowledge to look at actions in his mind to see what actions in the mind were actually leading to rebirth.
And this was a way that you could actively beyond rebirth.
And it was here he began to just look at the actions in themselves.
This was the other part of the question that he asked.
He didn't ask who was doing this or who was going to be repeating the results of these things.
This is where other people had fallen astray because they had noticed that there was rebirth.
And the question was, what is there in an individual that remains the same from one life to the next?
They got way late from the issue of aging, illness, and death and started focusing on issues of who am I, what am I, what will I be in the future?
What do I have that's of a permanent essence?
There were those who asked the question, who am I, what am I, what is the permanent essence to me?
And they got way late from the issues, whereas the Buddha state focused on the issue of what actions will lead to rebirth and more further death.
And can those actions be used to put an end to that?
So he traced through all the actions that led through up to death.
This is where we get dependent core rising.
You have clinging, which is dependent on craving, which is dependent on feeling, dependent on contact, dependent on six senses,
dependent on name and form, dependent on consciousness, dependent on fabrication.
And when he applied knowledge to the fabrications, in terms of seeing their origin, their cessation, and the path to their cessation,
that allowed for the whole strain of actions to dissolve.
This way they were able to attain the daffodils.
So he learned two very important lessons here. One is that the best way to, that when one, it is possible to attain the daffodils.
Let's answer his question, the big question of his quest.
To mention it, is no aging, is no illness, is no death.
And it's done by looking at actions in and of themselves, rather than being concerned about who you are or who's going to be receiving the actions.
And he also learned the causal principle that underlay all this, which as you said was that some of the impact on your present moment experience
is going to come from your past actions and some of it's going to come from your present actions.
And it's a combination of the two that basically create your experience of the present moment.
Now this is going to be very important as we face aging, face illness and death.
Seeing what we're doing in the present moment is contributing to any suffering that there may be around us and how would we put an end to that suffering by changing the way we act.
So the principles of karma are not totally deterministic. It's not the case that you did something bad in the past lifetime and you're going to have to suffer.
Now there may be some physical manifestations that are going to come from that, but the mind doesn't have to suffer if it's skilled.
This causal principle is what lies at the basis of all the Buddhist approaches to how you face aging, how you face illness, how you face death.
It's also good to think about for a minute how much we owe the Dharma to the Buddhist staying on topic all the way through his question.
This is what he wanted to say, what can be done so as not to suffer from aging unless and then.
It is the prime question of the Dharma. We owe that we owe our knowledge of the Dharma to the fact that he pursued that question all the way to the end.
So what he taught, again aging and no missing death, became primary topics.
Basically two main teachings, the Four Noble Truths and the Pentechorizing, are basically explanations of how suffering is brought into being and how suffering can be brought to an end.
In both cases, when the Buddha identifies suffering or talks about what suffering is, he gives as his first examples, birth, aging, death.
These are the big issues in life and he's not going to shy away from them. This is going to take them on, so they had to put an end to these things.
So that was the first mistake we said in modern Buddhism which is not seeing the importance of the issues of aging, illness, and death had in the Buddha's own quest for the Dharma.
The second mistake is if we ignore the central role of aging, illness, and death in the Dharma, we miss out on many benefits to be gained from fully practicing what the Dharma has to teach.
There's going to be more to the practice than just focusing on being okay in the present moment.
You have to be heedful in preparing for the future. One, to provide yourself with a good range of opportunities to be available at death.
And then two, to master the skills that you're going to need in the present moment so that when death or aging, aging, illness, or death become present moment experiences, those skills will be ready.
When the Buddha talks about being in the present moment or being alert to the present moment, it's always in the context of mindfulness of death.
In other words, there's work to be done here that you need to prepare.
However, the focus is not so much on death in itself, it's there as a reminder.
Then you get focused on the work of mastering the skills that you're going to need in order to figure out how you can put an end to craving, how you can put an end to clinging, how you can put an end to the processes that lead to the coming birth, aging, illness, and death.
Now, sometimes the question is asked, why bring in issues of death that are going to be focused on the present moment anyhow?
It's largely because issues of death bring a greater sense of urgency to your practice and it's necessary to set higher standards.
You make an analogy with learning a foreign language.
If you're planning to go to Brazil just for a vacation, you may learn a little Portuguese.
Or if you're conducting Zoom meetings with people in Brazil, you would learn a little bit of Portuguese to entertain the Brazilians and the Spanish speakers.
But if you're going to go live there, and if you know that someone's going to pick you up and take you there and twice you'd live there for the rest of your life,
if you're going to learn the language, you're going to put a number of energy into learning the language and learning it well because you know that your survival depends on it.
And it's the same as your practicing meditation.
If you're meditating simply to enjoy the present moment, you'll have one level of standards as to what counts as an acceptable meditation.
But if you realize these are the skills I'm going to need when my body is beginning to fall apart.
My relatives are crying.
Doctors are sticking things up in my nose and in my mouth, into my arms.
And I'm going to have to maintain my mindfulness and alertness and my concentration and discernment through all the midst of that.
And it sets higher standards of what's going to be acceptable.
I'll give you an example.
The issue of craving, which the Buddha said is the cause of suffering around all of these issues.
In modern teachings that are focused exclusively on finding a pleasant, a body that has a moment, craving is defined as the desire for things in the world to be different from what they are.
And so we're told that developing equanimity, patience, and contentment will be enough in order to not suffer from craving while we're here in the present moment.
This relates to what one teacher once called the third and a half noble truth.
Suffering may not be able to be put into it, but it can be managed.
Well, the Buddha wanted to do more than just managing suffering.
He wanted to put it into it.
But you have to realize that at the moment of death, craving is going to come out really raw and really strong.
Those three types of craving that the Buddha identified as the cause of suffering are going to be especially strong as you're dying.
You're being addicted from the body and everything from which you've identified is you and yours.
Your craving for central pleasure as an escape from the pain of all that will be strong.
If there's physical pain, it's going to be that much more desperate to just get away from the pain.
An opportunity for pleasure shows up and you'll go for it often without thinking about looking at the fine print and see where is this going to take me.
Because after all the Buddha compares craving at the moment of death is like a fire.
My house is on fire.
And it's being blown by the wind to another house.
The wind is blind.
So we can't let our cravings take over at that point.
We have to be in charge.
So we have to learn how to overcome them and not get pulled along with them.
Because all too often as we go through life, as the Buddha said, we go with craving as our companion.
We're used to going wherever it goes and believing whatever it says it would be a good thing to do.
We have to learn how to step back from a second.
Even our craving for sensuality has to be put away.
As for craving for becoming, which is the desire, which is basically taking on identity in a particular world of experience.
This again will get very strong at the moment of death.
You can't stay in this body any longer or you can't stay in this world.
Where are you going to go?
As long as there's a sense of me and mine and what will happen to me.
Have a very strong desire to find a new identity to take on a new place.
Where you can continue having an identity as a being.
The idea of annihilation is just too scary to contemplate.
In most cases.
In other cases, there's the craving for non-becoming.
A sick and tired of life, a sick and tired of the suffering of aging.
You just want to be obliterated, annihilated.
But that's not going to solve the problem, as I've already said.
You might just think of yourself as having to be annihilated or wanting to be annihilated.
That in itself creates a new becoming.
You go to becoming which you blotted out for a while.
But that's not the end. You come back again.
So this requires that not only that you learn how to have some control over these cravings,
but you've got a real dilemma in this craving for becoming a non-becoming.
Because each of them will lead to more becoming.
The Buddha discovered that the way beyond that was what he'd learned in his third knowledge in the night of his awakening.
Which is you look not so much at trying to destroy becoming, or trying to maintain becoming.
But look at the processes. Step out of the process a bit.
And look at the steps leading up to it. All the actions that lead to becoming.
Simply as actions in and of themselves.
To the point where you can develop dispassion for them.
And then that dispassion is what frees you.
And this requires a lot of concentration and a lot of discernment.
Simple equanimity, patience, contentment, tolerance will not cut it at that point.
As the Buddha said, you're simply a quantumist.
You're not going to get the concentration you need in order to gain any really good discernment.
So keeping in mind the fact that you are practicing for how to die as you meditate.
That will raise your standards as one, what is an acceptable meditation.
And two, what you're looking for as you're trying to overcome the cravings.
They're getting in the way of saving your concentration, getting in the way of your discernment.
So in the reverse of the modern context, you'd rather see preparing for death as a ten-central application of teachings
that were originally meant to be focused on the present moment.
What happens is that the present moment is part of the view in the context of preparing for death.
And when we meditate and focus on the present moment, we're learning to form the duties.
So, of course, the truths aren't that precisely the duties that we need to master as we're facing death.
So that at the very least we don't suffer from it.
If we're going to be reborn, we can direct ourselves to a good rebirth.
Or ideally at that point of the word said, it is possible that your right view is strong enough
that your concentration and your discernment are strong enough that you actually don't have to be reborn at all.
You're released into the end of the deathless, which as you said is the highest happiness, the highest freedom.
The ultimate truth.
So those are the basic lessons that we can learn from the Buddha's awakening.
Looking at how we're going to approach these issues of aging, illness, and death.
Today I thought I'd go about ways in which we apply these teachings to the process of aging and illness this morning.
And then this afternoon we'll talk about death.
Keeping these larger issues in mind can help to encourage cheatfulness, which the Buddha identified as a source of all skillful qualities.
But this practice requires confidence.
I mean, it's one thing to say, there is no such thing as a good meditation, whatever happens in your meditation is okay.
But once you start realizing there are skills you're going to have to develop, it can get kind of taunting.
People can sometimes wonder, am I capable of doing this?
We have to keep remembering the Buddha's and Ananda's advice on when you hear teachings like this.
Ananda's advice is, hear that someone is gained awakening and the proper response should be, why not me?
They can do it, they're human beings, I'm a human being, if they can do it, why can't I?
You have to convince yourself that yes, you are capable of doing these things.
It requires dedication, more dedication than you might initially expect.
But if you tell yourself, look, I'm not capable of doing this.
Remember, if you stick with the path, the skills that you master on the path will make you a new person.
You change as you get more and more skilled.
So you sitting here right now may not be able to gain awakening, but the you who will master these skills, bit by bit by bit, will be able to at some point.
In other words, you're going to have to learn how to give yourself pep talks as you practice.
And you look at the verbs that they use to describe the Buddha's giving Dharma talks amongst Ananda laypeople.
And there are four verbs altogether that I think are useful to describe his giving a Dharma talk.
Three of them are pep talks. He says he instructed, he urged them, he roused them, he encouraged them.
The instructions are things you read about, but the urging, the rousing and encouraging, these are things you have to learn how to do for yourself.
And it's an important part of the practice.
Of course, there will be a sense of self that develops around that urging, etc.
But that's a skillful sense of self.
At the point where you don't need it anymore, you can put it aside. You may well make good use of it.
So those are the general principles we'll be holding in mind as we discuss the topics of today.
The two topics for this morning, aging and illness.
Aging is a foretaste of death without warning.
It seems alien that your body used to be able to control and begin to get out of control.
The main themes that the Buddha talks about in terms of aging are loss of beauty and loss of strength.
Now, some of the lessons we learned from the Buddha's awakening that apply to aging.
One is your consciousness is supported by the body, but it does not need to depend on the body.
So given that when the energy of the body is down, the wise ways to prioritize this use to work on qualities of mind that will carry over to the next lifetime.
In other words, aging is no excuse simply to rest.
There was a series of Dharma talks that John Mahabhava gave to two women years back.
One of the women had cancer and she wanted to come to his monastery to learn how to meditate in order to deal with the difficulties of the disease.
And he told her, well, I can help you with issues in the mind, but I can't look after your body.
I know nothing about that kind of disease.
If you can bring a doctor or a nurse along with you, I'll be happy to have you come.
And so the woman had an older friend, an older woman, 80 years old, who was the doctor, retired.
And so she volunteered to come.
And so the two of them listened to the Dharma talks for three months and they recorded.
He gave her talk every night and they ended up with 80-some Dharma talks.
And they ended up with a recording of each talk after they returned to Bangkok.
The woman with cancer died after six months.
And then the old woman who was the doctor suddenly found herself with this big pile of tapes.
And so she said, well, even though I'm old, maybe I can transcribe these tapes.
And so she consulted with a John Mahaba where he encouraged her.
And as she said later, an important part of his encouragement was as the body begins to weaken,
focus on the goodness that you can still squeeze out of it before you have to throw it all away.
And I've always liked that expression, squeezing as much goodness out of your body as you can while you still have some strength.
And so the old woman, in spite of her failing eyesight, in spite of other weaknesses,
was able to transcribe all 87 Dharma talks.
And as a result, we have these two huge finds that are among the best talks that John Mahaba gave,
the best Dharma books.
And so the lesson that we learned here is that you want to develop strength of mind
in order to squeeze as much goodness as you can out of the body as it becomes.
So that you have the good qualities that will carry over.
We'll talk about the good qualities when we talk about the section of death.
And so given that your body is going to lose its beauty and lose its strength,
the Buddha basically advises that you learn how to redefine your sense of what's beautiful at this age
as the body begins to get decrepit.
This is not simply a matter of getting old.
I mean, some people are quite young and their bodies get decrepit and weakened.
And so it's good to be able to know how to take advantage of that.
In terms of beauty and the buddhism, as the texts say,
beauty comes from beautiful will, beautiful intentions, honorable actions.
They say virtue is beautiful even to old age.
Your jewelry and your other things may not look good on you,
it's just like getting old where they may look out of place.
But the fact that you're a virtuous person, they will always look beautiful.
Always keep that in mind.
That's the beauty that's appropriate.
And actually, it's the buddha that's appropriate at any age.
As for strength of mind, that's emphasized to not compensate for weakness in the body.
The buddha has two lists of strengths.
Five in each, but there's some overlap between the two.
And combined, they give you seven.
The first one is conviction.
Conviction and again, the Buddha is awakened.
That what he awoke to really was true.
And what that means for your life in terms of the power of action in order to find your happiness.
And when you believe in that, then it gives you more and more encouragement
to keep on wanting to develop more quality and more strengths of mind.
The second one is shame.
Now, the shame that the buddhas are recommending here is not the opposite of pride.
It's the shame that's the opposite of shamelessness.
In other words, you see something that is dishonorable.
You could do it, you might be able to get away with it, but you realize,
I just wouldn't want to do that.
Shame is often defined as how you want to look in the eyes of others.
And it's a matter of whose eyes you want to look good in.
Here the Buddha is recommending that you want to look good in the eyes of the noble ones.
What standards they have.
And that, he says, is a treasure.
Because it will prevent you from doing a lot of unskillful things that you would later regret.
In cases of veterans from various wars that have been going on for the past several decades,
saying that as they get back home, they're haunted by visions of the children they killed
and other atrocities that were done.
And if they said they give a million dollars to them, they'll be able to go back and undo that deed.
A million dollars can't do that.
But if you start out with a sense of shame to begin with, it just kind of thing is dishonorable.
You won't have that scar in your memory to begin with.
In which case that sense of shame is more valuable than a million dollars.
The same with compunction, which is the next string.
Compunction here is realizing that your actions will have consequences
and the idea of doing something that would lead to suffering just doesn't appeal to you.
In other words, you do care about the long-term consequences.
Your actions are not apathetic.
You're not devil-made care.
You think seriously about what's going to happen down the line
and take that into consideration.
Another strength is persistence.
This is motivating yourself to stick to the practices
or thoughts of hatefulness, thoughts of compassion, thoughts of goodwill for yourself and for others.
These are important part of the practice is how you motivate yourself to want to do what is skillful
and to abandon what is not.
Another strength of mind is mindfulness.
And this is not simply being okay with what's coming up in the present moment.
Remember mindfulness for the Buddha was a quality of memory.
You remember what's skillful, you remember what's not,
you remember what you've been able to do in the past
and enable you to do what is skillful even when it's hard.
You remember what you've been able to do to abandon what is un-skillful
even when it's hard to do that.
And you learn to recognize what's skillful and un-skillful in the mind as they come.
This will be an important skill because many times things can come up in the mind
and they look okay to begin with, but after all as you get to know them
you realize it's mind-state has its problems.
You want to be able to learn how to recognize that.
The final two strengths are concentration and discernment.
We'll talk more about these this afternoon.
But the important thing is that you learn how to maintain focus.
Why don't you make a reminder, go stay focused on an object,
you can get a sense of well-being there.
Because this is good not only for just keeping your mind focused and under control
but also to compensate for the fact that when you're aging there's going to be a firm amount of pain,
there's going to be a firm amount of restriction in what you can do with your body.
There's a beautiful passage, right?
And I'm just talking to the Buddha, the Buddha is now 80 years old
and he says, you know, even Buddhas can get old, you know.
And the Buddha says, yeah, it's not to be amazed, it's nothing amazing at all.
It's the way things are.
He says, the only sense of ease I have in my body right now is when I enter concentration.
This is the theme we'll be getting to over and over again as we go through the day,
that when the body gets sick or when the body gets aging or when you're dying,
there's going to be a firm amount of pain.
Most people, they only think part of escape from pain is central pleasure.
Whereas you have the pleasure of concentration that gives you an alternative,
a better place to go.
And then finally, discernment allows you to separate the mind from the pain,
separate the mind from the fact that the body is aging and you're being derailed.
It's the body for which I've identified so long, which I've identified,
however you identify your gender, being derailed.
Okay, it's going, it's going, it's going, I can't identify with this any longer.
And it's not a loss.
But if you can see it that way, then it's a lot easier to face these things.
Those are a few comments on using the Dharma as your age.
We can talk about it more when in the Q&A.
The illness, this too is a foretaste of death largely in the sense of not only that your strength is restricted,
but also you have to deal a lot with pain.
And remember with illness, you have to face that in line with the Buddhist teachings on causality
that he learned on the night it was awakening.
That some of the things that are happening at present moment are the result of past actions.
And some of them are the result of what you're doing right now.
So when illness comes, as the Buddha said, there are some illnesses that no matter how much medicine you give them,
they're not going to go away.
Other illnesses that you even without treatment, they will go away.
But then there are those that will go away.
If there's treatment, it will not go away if there's no treatment.
And it's for the sake of that third group that medicine is given to everybody.
And it's the same with your, your, your mindfulness and your concentration.
Sometimes it is possible through the power of mindfulness and concentration to make an illness go away,
or at least awaken.
Other times it's because if it's an illness that comes from strong past karma,
the illness itself will not go away.
But you can learn how to put the mind in a position where it doesn't have to suffer from it.
My teacher had a student one time, she had cancer.
It was one of those cancers that just kept moving around in the body.
They would hit this organ and they would cut out that organ.
They would move to another organ and cut out that one, cut out another one.
This has been going on for about 10 years.
And I happened to visit her one time right after she had had a kidney removed.
And she was sitting up in bed and she was looking perfectly at perk and fine.
And I asked her, you know, is there any pain?
And she said, well, yes, there is.
She said, but I don't send my mind there.
And she stayed with her meditation where Bhutan,
so even though she still had the karma that she had to suffer from, the cancer,
or have cancer, the fact that she was able to train her mind,
and that she didn't have to suffer in the midst of the cancer.
So we have to remember this.
The Buddha will talk about even when you're sick,
even the body may be sick, the mind doesn't have to be sick.
And there's a parallel between illness and physical illness.
Physical illness.
The Buddha said primary physical illness is something that happens to everybody every day,
i.e. hunger.
You don't have to be old to get hungry.
And it's the primary mental illness is when you're clinging to black-eyed grits.
Now remember the word for clinging in Pali is the same word as for taking sustenance or for feeding.
So there's a parallel between our illnesses that we're feeding on things.
There's a constant lack in the body and there's this felt lack in the mind.
And the practice is going to be aimed at getting rid of that sense of that.
Maybe you can't get rid of physical hunger,
but you can get rid of mental hunger.
That's what we're going to be focusing on.
In dealing with pain, the trick is learning how not to cling to it.
And a good powder to follow there is to think about the four steps
and then the tetrad on feelings and mindfulness of breathing.
The first step is to breathe in and out sensitive to rapture, breathe in and out sensitive to pleasure.
And this parallels a lot with the John Lee's recommendations on when there's pain in the body,
that you don't focus immediately on the pain itself.
You focus on other parts of the body that you can make comfortable with the breathing.
So you give the mind another place to stay.
And then after the breath has gotten comfortable in that other part of the body,
then you can think of that good breath energy spreading through the pain.
This moves on to the next step, the next two steps,
which are to be sensitive to mental fabrication and then to calm mental fabrication.
And mental fabrication here, these are the factors with which you shape your state of mind in the present moment.
And the Buddha identifies too, this feeling and the perception.
And so first you're using this comfortable feeling in one part of the body to deal with an uncomfortable feeling in the other part.
Some cases you can actually make it dissolve and go away.
Other cases you can't, but there's a greater sense of relief
and also a different perception of your relationship to the pain.
You're not simply sitting there as a victim of the pain.
You're taking a more proactive stance toward it.
And when you're more proactive, it can't shoot you down.
It's like someone's trying to shoot at you
and you're moving around, moving around all the time.
It's much more difficult for them to shoot you.
That's one perception you hold in mind.
But you can also look at the actual perceptions that you apply to the pain.
This is where Dhamma Hava was instructions on dealing with pain, again, very useful.
You ask questions about it.
Is the pain a solid block?
Is the pain the same thing as the part of the body in which you find it?
Part of you may say, well, of course not, but then
there's a part of your mind that might say, well, yes, actually, that's how I perceive it.
You have to remember that we started dealing with pain back when we were children
before we even knew language.
Our ways of understanding pain, our ways of dealing with pain
often come from that period in life.
And so we have to understand the strange perceptions and assumptions
that we develop at that time.
You have to ask some strange questions.
So one of them is, is the pain the same thing as your knee?
Is the pain in the knee?
Is it the same thing as the hip?
Do you see them as separate things?
The image I would like to use is of radio waves going through the room.
You set up a radio in one spot and you tune it to one frequency
and here in San Diego, you might get San Diego, you might get Tijuana,
you might get Los Angeles, you might get Phoenix.
The radio doesn't move.
It's there in one spot, but there are these different frequencies going through it at any one time.
And if you can learn to see the pain as one frequency
the physical elements of the body, earth, water, wind, and fire as another frequency
that helps to weaken a lot of the sense of how the pain is impinging on you.
As you see them as separate, the pain becomes much less of a burden.
You could also ask yourself, is the pain a solid block?
Or can you see it as individual moments of pain coming in God?
When those individual moments come, are they coming at you
or are they going away from you as they appear?
I find a useful perception of older minds that they're actually going away.
Years back I was in Singapore, I was being treated a traditional Chinese treatment for backing.
The doctor was rubbing oil into my back and first it felt good
and then it got more and more raw as it rubbed harder and harder.
And then he took these bamboo whisk and started beating me
and it didn't sound like it seemed like it was going to stop at any time soon.
My first thought across was, okay, what bad karma do I have?
I'm going to just go through this.
And I said, well, it looks like he's not stopping and I'm not going to be a wimp and say stop.
And I said, well, wait a minute, but how can, there's a good opportunity to relate to the pain in the right way?
And I began to see each time he hit me, the pain was going away, it was not coming at me.
And that way the pain didn't impinge on the mind at all.
It's like sitting in the back of a station wagon facing backwards as you're going down the road.
As soon as something comes into the range of your vision, it's going away.
So look at the perceptions you have around the pain
and see if you can replace them with better perceptions.
This way you're not just resisting the pain through gritting your teeth and force it well,
but you're actually using your discernment to change your relationship to the pain.
And that way you don't have to suffer so much from it.
Because remember, it's these two factors of feeling and perception that shape your mental state.
And so you find some alternative pleasures to focus on and then you try alternative perceptions.
You focus on those two itches around any pain in the body.
And you find that you live with it a lot more easily.
And then watch out for any other perceptions that come in, especially the mind's conversation around the pain.
About how much longer it's going to last.
This is going to kill me.
Am I going to die from this pain?
To say, well, this is not helping at all.
How much longer will it be here?
How long has it been going on?
Don't think those things.
This is where being in the present moment is a good thing.
But you want to be in the present moment with a lot of discernment
so that when pain comes up, you're not afflicted by it.
So those are some of the lessons we can gain from what the Buddha has to say about aging and illness,
looking at it within the context of how he found awakening and the lessons he learned from his awakening.
So if you can give me just five minutes, I will be back and we can have questions.
Thank you.
Okay.
Who's up first?
Remember to raise your hands.
Yes, please raise your hands.
I have a question related to oftentimes I've heard during meditation practice,
you said something along the lines of just stay there.
There's nothing else you have to do.
There's nothing else you have to think about.
But I think at some point there is something you have to do and I mean the Buddha had a question
and it seems that there must be certain questions you should maybe be turning to at some point in order to make progress,
not just exactly along the lines of what you said.
Not being okay with the present moment is not, I mean just being okay with the present moment is not enough.
How do you know which question you should be turning to at what point?
Now I don't know how to ask it better than that.
Okay, but when the basic question is the question you don't know what to ask have to do with affordable truths.
Where is the suffering here?
What am I doing this contributing to it?
And the right time to ask those questions is when you're ready and knowing when you're ready is you try asking the questions
and see what happens is your mind gaining insight or is it just getting blurry as you ask those questions.
Do those questions raise spontaneously or not?
In some cases they will, in some cases they won't.
Okay, thank you.
And if you find that they're not rising on their own you can give them a little push.
Okay, thank you.
And John Furrow once said that there are two kinds of meditators, the people who think too much and the people don't think enough.
So if you know you have a particular habit, if you think too much, you don't think enough, try to compensate.
Marisol.
Good morning, Tana, John.
I have a question about the reading.
The first one, I just, on page 10, the Faculty of Conviction is dependent on, or,
let's see, I'm not sure how it's worded, but the Faculty of Conviction depends on the four factors for stream entry.
Can you remind me what those are? I always think of stream entry as the seven factors for awakening.
This is much more basic.
It starts out with finding people of integrity.
Okay.
Then listening to the true Dharma.
Applying appropriate attention.
And then practicing the Dharma in line with the Dharma.
Okay, now all of those sound very familiar. I just didn't make the connection.
And then the Faculty of Persistence, what are the four right exertions?
They speak to abandon any unskillful qualities that have already arisen and to prevent them from arising again.
And then to give rise to skillful qualities and then to maintain them when they're there.
Okay, so those aren't pairs.
Yeah, yeah, they're two pairs.
Okay, and then, if you'll just give me a couple of seconds to look at page 11.
I had a question on the bottom of page 11.
Oh, actually, I think it's page 13.
So I didn't quite understand the bottom of...
Actually, it's the SN 35-145 right there.
Can you help me understand that the eye is old karma?
Because what you see is the result of old karma.
What you hear is the result of old karma.
Everything that comes through the sixth sense is old karma coming back at you.
But I'm confused because we've been talking about what you see is already...
I guess I'm just really confused then, because what you see is a result of what you're looking for.
Okay, well, again, things have come in. You're looking for a bird, but there's no bird.
And you're not going to find it, right?
No, but if you're looking to get angry, you will get angry.
But then you're going to focus on certain things.
The things that are there available to you, that's the result of old karma.
Now, what you're going to focus on, what you're going to elaborate on, what you're going to create out of that, that's your new karma.
If I close my eyes and open them again, and will that there's nobody on the screen, it's not going to happen.
So old karma is just what is available to us.
What's available to us through the senses, yes.
Okay, and then, but what we perceive is...
That's the new karma.
Is new karma, so okay.
Thank you. I'll just stop there and maybe ask later.
Okay, fine.
People were chewing on foods. Remember that you're appearing in public.
Valentine? Valentine?
I don't know how to val- Lori?
Lori's next.
Okay, thank you.
I wanted to ask you about the illness of the mind as in dementia and how that relates to someone having concentration or persistence, which seemed to be going away with a friend of mine.
Okay, no, someone's got to mention that's the only thing that can help them at all is if you give them some mindfulness exercises to see if they can help stretch their mindfulness a little bit, because sometimes it's...
There are cases where the brain is not cooperating and whatever talents they had in terms of concentration or discernment in the past are going to be leaving them, in which case they're going to be more and more subject to past karma.
And as a caregiver, if you're helping them along, your job is to try to be their memory for them and help them remember good things that they've done.
If I bring them, and I am, and when she's agitated or scared, I can bring her back, but is that helpful?
So even my help to help to get her to concentrate, and she knows she has Alzheimer's, she knows that she's losing her memory.
So my bringing her to that awareness is helpful to her?
Yes, and then kind of bring her to the awareness of good things that she's done, anything that would lift her spirits.
That's what she's going to need at that point.
Okay, okay, thank you.
We had an old man who was dying at the monastery one time, and to make a very long story short, he had cancer and then the jaw.
And you could see that if you ever known that the pain would be getting to him, he'd start pushing his head back and forth, back and forth, back and forth on the pillow.
His daughter was there with him, and because he'd been meditating on the word buttock, I told her every time she sees him do that, whisper the word buttock into his ear, and he would stop.
And he'd be okay for about two hours, and then he'd lose it again, and it's okay, put it back in.
And she was with him all the way until his death, and she kept his mind state in a good state all the way until he died.
This woman used to meditate, and she can't remember that she used to meditate.
Okay, well, you don't have to talk about meditation, but just say, you know, you may not remember.
You did a lot of good things in the past, and everybody loves you for all the good things you did.
Okay, thank you.
Indu.
In the talk you just gave, you spoke a little bit briefly about people kind of, at the moment of the death, will have right view or wrong view, and then they would, you know, correspondingly be reborn in a good place or a bad place.
Could you maybe expand a little bit on that, like, how could you have at the moment of death, like say, if you've been doing stuff that's been quite hateful,
how do you then at the moment of death, just have right view, or is it kind of saying, oh, shoot, I did something wrong, maybe I can do something better next life.
That's a good step, yeah, I realized that that was a mistake, you know, I feel, you know, I recognize the mistake that I did, and I don't want to make that mistake ever again, that's right for you.
And then an important part of right view, which is often missed, is that you have good will.
And this is going to be one of the themes that we're going to find this afternoon when you're talking about the various hindrances that could hit you as you're approaching death.
And the cure for a lot of the hindrances is good will, because good will is a type of right view.
It's good that everybody be happy and truly inside.
So like in the case of your father, you have a super whatever extent you can develop good will for all beings.
And if he starts realizing, gee, I know I have those, there are those beings I heard in the past, he said, well, make sure you don't do it again.
And then good will for himself.
Yeah.
And just on that topic, we found that coloring is really helpful to keep him focused.
There's also adult coloring books that are out there now.
It's actually good for both of my parents.
They color a lot these days.
We're on a lockdown.
I feel like I'm running a kindergarten.
But yeah, I was just wondering, do you think it actually increases mindfulness?
I mean, it says so on Google, but I don't know.
Okay, give some nicely occupied.
That's it for me.
Lee.
Lee.
Lee, you're muted.
We can't hear you.
You have to unmute.
I'm sorry.
I'm technologically challenged.
I want to go back to the old and the new karma.
It's very subtle.
Oh, karma isn't necessarily bad karma.
Is it?
Oh, no, it's good.
It'll be good karma too.
Yeah.
Okay.
But if one finds oneself, and I see this in my work as well as in myself.
I see myself competing thoughts or memories that are not skillful.
Or that are difficult.
And I'm very aware of that.
And being aware of it.
I can put it aside.
In other words, my mental actions.
Can shift from, all right.
This is the past.
This is the present.
And what I discovered is that doesn't change the pattern once and for all,
but it does bring me back to a whole different frame of reference.
And I'm not, I have to keep doing it over and over and over again.
And I'm wondering if that's the beginning of a fresh karma.
I even like that better than good karma.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's fresh karma in the sense that you're developing a new habit.
A new habit.
Yes.
And the other thing is when the Buddha says,
when you see these things arising and you learn how to put them up,
put them aside, then the next step is true.
Well, when they come back again, why do you go for them again?
What's the allure?
But when I say, all right, here it is again,
and I bring myself back to something else.
I'm not going for the allure.
Am I?
There's something programmed in there that brings it back.
Yeah.
Well, that's what you want to look for so that you can realize,
whatever it is that's bringing it back.
I want to see that.
I want to understand what that is.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah.
All right.
Thank you.
Susan.
I have to unmute myself.
Have you got me?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Okay.
In the readings, Rathapala taught the four Dharma summaries to the king.
And the thing that's interesting about Rathapala,
the four Dharma summaries being the world is swept away.
There is no refuge.
My favorite one, there is no one in charge.
The four Dharma summaries, the king noted with interest that Rathapala
understood these things, not because he'd gone through any particular hardship,
but because the Buddha taught them and he recognized them as true.
Some of us know the four Dharma summaries are true through direct personal
experience, kind of raw and harrowing direct personal experience.
So some of us are practicing with post-traumatic stress disorder.
And I'd like to know if you have any particular considerations or cautions
that you'd like to convey to us.
I can tell you some of the things that I've done to my own practice
that may have been unwise or things that I've tried to change it.
But are you willing to address this issue?
Sure.
What you've got to realize, if the world is not providing these things for you,
you've got to provide them for yourself.
And that's the message.
That's why Rathapala went for.
To say, okay, what can I do?
The world is swept away.
Is there something in me that I can develop that's not swept away?
The world is, there's no one in charge.
There's no shelter.
What kind of shelter can I provide for my own life?
Because if you simply think about how the world is horrible, horrible,
horrible, horrible, it's going to drive you crazy.
The world is not going to provide this, but the Buddha is telling me
I have within me the resources that I can provide that for myself.
What I noticed, and it took me a long time to notice this,
because I've been doing it for years.
I've been doing sitting meditation.
And I would sit there, you know, always with the focus,
always with the intention of returning to the breath.
But, you know, with post-traumatic stress disorder,
there are alarm signals going off in the brain.
I mean, the flashback film festival is rolling.
Your body is presenting all kinds of symptoms,
telling you you need to pay attention to this,
something dreadful is about to happen.
But the thing is I keep returning to the breath and, you know,
I sit there and let my mind beat up on me for a while.
I return to the breath and then, you know, ding, the session is over.
And I sort of pat myself on the back for just having endured a meditation session.
But only recently I came to see that what I've been doing,
I don't get brownie points just for enduring a meditation session
that's, you know, that's torturous.
I mean, we don't have to repeat what the Buddha did.
He already discovered that self-torture doesn't work.
So with reluctance, because I said, you know,
I've actually been kind of torturing myself with my sitting meditation practice
and I've actually made an enemy of myself.
I wasn't taking any joy of it.
With reluctance, I said, I need to try something different.
So I started doing walking meditation in my house.
I mean, my house is all on a single level.
So I just paced the house through the living in the dining room
and then an L shaped hallway where, you know, the bedrooms and bathrooms are.
And it's a different experience.
I feel less threatened walking than I do sitting.
I know there's different things coming up in my mind.
But the main thing is, I have a greater sense of ease
and it's not quite the self-torture that sitting was,
but I have this nagging sense that it's somehow an inferior kind of practice.
Oh, no.
John Swat has reputed to have gained awakening while he was walking.
So it is possible.
Oh, it is possible.
In any case, I don't see that I have an option.
If my practice is torture to me and I'm not finding any joy in it,
I have to find an ultimate way of practice.
And so for now, I'm pacing the house and it's a little more easeful.
Can you meditate lying down?
What's that like?
Lying down, I fall asleep.
Okay.
I'm able to do sitting meditation.
For example, if I bring up one of your Dharma talks and you're talking,
I'm able to do sitting meditation if I'm guided,
if I have something outside of myself to focus on,
but if I'm just sitting by myself,
I'm just going to get beat up on by my mind.
What's interesting to me,
but I noticed my mind doing when I'm doing walking meditation,
my mind is doing a lot of planning.
It's anticipating disaster and trying to come up with scenarios.
Okay.
This terrible thing could happen and here's how I'm going to respond.
And I love the reading that was included today about the guy with the fruit tree.
And he's like, well, the fruits aren't falling to the ground,
but I can climb the tree and grabs the fruit and fill my clothing up with them.
And then the second guy comes along with an axe.
I love this image because it's an image I bring to mind when I'm walking
and my mind goes into planning mode.
You know, it starts forecasting disasters and then I start saying,
okay, what am I going to do to meet that disaster?
What am I going to do to meet this one?
There's always going to be some guy with an axe or an atom bomb or something.
I mean, that's not the way to do it.
The way to do it is to return to your own breath, your own body
and to find some pleasure in your own being, I guess,
and whatever way you can do it, whether it's walking, sitting, lying,
I don't know how many different options there are,
but thank you for letting me know that it is possible.
Another person that inspires me is Kesa Gautami,
the woman who lost her entire family in a single day.
If that's not a traumatized person, I don't know who was,
yet in her own words that you beautifully translated,
she realized unbinding herself and her heart was released.
So walking meditation, I think this is a problem of right view.
I mean, I didn't catch on that I was supposed to actually find
the practice enjoyable because that's my refuge.
Is this correct?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
So before we go further,
I just wanted to make one announcement clear to everyone.
We are live streaming this on YouTube as well.
So please be cautious and not discuss or talk about personal matters
for your own privacy sake.
Thank you.
Mariana.
Hi.
First of all, thank you for the explanation about the old karma
with the senses.
That was a bit confusing.
One of the questions I had that's sort of basic about the idea of
going on, you know, to a new life or to a better or worse place
based on what you're thinking or doing when you die is people
die unconsciously, like they die in the middle of sleep or they
get shot in the head or something happens such that they're not
really conscious at the time.
So in that case, I'm kind of wondering is where they go dependent
on sort of the state of their mind the last time they were
conscious or.
Well, they may regain consciousness right after they're outside
of the body.
So there's a consciousness that could happen as the transition
sort of.
Right, right.
One thing and my own experience I had a near death experience
one time I was electrocuted and it's happened in the snap of a
finger, but for me it was like five minutes.
Everything slowed down very quickly and I began to realize there
are a lot of decisions that I was making as I was going through
that period.
But the people who watched it happen said it was just a split
second that I was electrocuted and I was able to pull away.
So I think when you realize when you're leaving the body or forced
out of the body the mind suddenly speeds up and it's consciousness
of lots of things that wouldn't ordinarily be conscious of.
So someone would say dies in their sleep they may wake up inside
and say this is it.
This is it.
I'm going.
And so they're making decisions.
The other alternative of course is that somebody was shot.
My teacher had a student who was quite psychic of her job was to
drive around delivering oxygen canisters in South,
South Eastern Thailand.
And she drove past a lot of accidents.
Accident scenes.
The police in Thailand are a little bit slower than they are in
America to clean up after accidents.
And so you tend to see more accidents on the side of the road.
And she said she would drive past an accident and she would not
always see the bodies on the side of the road,
but also the people corresponding to the bodies kind of milling
around looking lost.
And so she'd always stop and basically in her meditation talk
to them and say okay now it's time to go on.
Think of the good things you've done.
Move on.
Which is why when someone's had a violent death like that it's
always good to say good things to them.
Okay, that's helpful.
Just one other question is when I'm going outside and this is
partly a meditation thing,
but it's also just if I'm walking around or whatever,
particularly walking.
When I look at the world,
I sometimes am very aware of this is passing or this will be
gone in the Bay Area.
And that's where we live used to be under water 5,000 years ago.
And these houses and everything that people think are so permanent
will be gone.
And other times I, you know, and sometimes I'm thinking,
well, that's, that's a helpful view.
That's, you know, awareness of the transience of life.
And other times I think it's, but it's so beautiful.
It's here now.
I'm lucky to live in a nice place where I'm not, you know,
choking from smog or whatever.
And so I'm sort of wondering, you know,
when is it better to be sort of aware of the transience of it
and the thought that it will go away versus really enjoying
and appreciating where I am.
It depends on your state of mind.
If you're feeling down, think about,
this is really a nice place, heaven on earth, the Bay Area.
And other times when you're getting careless and complacent,
then it's good to remind us, hey, this stuff's going to go someday.
What do I have that's a permanent value that I can take with me
when it goes?
And you reflect back, well, it's my actions.
You know, the good things that I do for myself,
the good things I do for other people,
those are the things that are of real value.
So if I'm like reflecting as I'm walking around on, you know,
I pick up trash or, gee, I could help people who are suffering
who don't have a home, that's sort of a positive thing.
That's of more value than just sort of thinking about the world going away
or not being permanent.
As I was telling Susan just now,
you realize that the world is swept away.
What is not swept away?
Let's focus on that.
Yeah.
Dave?
Dave Sado?
Hi, Tanijan.
Thank you very much for teaching us today.
I have a question that is related to the meditation word,
at the moment of death, kind of a follow-up to the story
about the gentleman with the jaw cancer.
And it seems like it's very common when some of the teachers
in the Thai force tradition teach this word.
And it seems that when you teach, you kind of more focus on
it's making sure we're paying attention to the sensation of the breath in the body.
And so being the buddho seems like a very helpful single word
to snap you back into your practice
as you're being pulled in all sorts of directions as you approach death.
If we're not using a meditation word in our meditation,
do you have any other suggestions
for something that can snap us back as we're facing death?
Well, breathe.
If you've been focusing on your breath all this time,
then there should be some really good associations with the breath.
Where's your breath right now?
That should be plenty.
It's almost in a way you could just think,
okay, remember my breath.
Just remember my breath.
Okay, back to my breath.
The breath right now, yeah.
First, okay, as you're dying, you're going to have to leave the breath.
And you say, okay, where's the state of my mind right now?
Where's my word right now?
I see.
So almost like kind of jumping through the tetrads a little bit.
Like, okay.
Right.
That's what I'm talking about.
Feelings, mind.
We'll talk about this a little bit more this afternoon.
Okay.
Thank you.
Valentin.
Can you hear me now?
Yes.
Okay.
Tana, I have a question regarding the strategies in dealing with pain.
So I've been mostly focusing on using the breath energy to,
if I have a pain, using the breath energy to go through that area,
to ease the pain, to calm.
And usually it goes away.
When do you recommend to use the other one to use the sermon to look into the pain?
Like, how does it feel?
Is it, I never had to use it so far.
I could say you're lucky in one way.
Just sit for longer hours until there's pain.
And that doesn't go away as you breathe through it.
Okay.
Thank you.
That's it.
Thank you.
Hi, Tana-Jan.
So I was wondering in your talk,
you're talking about that we should teach ourselves,
urging, rousing and encouraging.
And to me, these seems quite similar.
So if you could give an example of these three,
how we can, in our own practice, use these three different strategies.
Basically, urging is saying, this is a good thing to do.
You should do it.
Rousing is saying, come on, you've got the energy, you can do this.
Are you just going to sit there and do nothing?
And then encouraging is more, come on, you really can do this.
Really believe it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Mike.
Thank you, Jen.
In response to Lee's question,
I just wanted to talk about different kinds of thoughts
and the gratification that might come along with them.
When I cut someone off in traffic and then,
or sorry, when someone cuts me off in traffic and I get riled up,
it's pretty obvious kind of what the gratification that comes along
with sort of more simple thoughts like that is,
I'm defending my territory into those types of thoughts.
But then, I'm a primary care clinician and I treat folks
with anxiety disorder spectrum and OCD.
And they often mention things like intrusive thoughts
or thoughts that kind of seemingly come up.
They really don't seem to represent their inner desires,
just kind of come out of the blue, maybe something really unpleasant.
And it seems like understanding those types of thoughts
and the gratification that might come along with those thoughts
is a little bit harder.
But if you just speak to that and how to sort of deal with thoughts
that come along that aren't obvious what to do with them
or what the gratification is
and how you can reflect on the gratification that might be coming there.
Well, this is where it's good to think of the mind as a committee
and that you've got lots of different members in there
that have some strange ideas about what they want to think about.
And for people who feel intruded by those things,
you have to remind them,
okay, this is normal that everybody has members like this.
Because a lot of people, this is where people start getting schizoid
is they don't even want to admit that there's that sign to their mind
and they block it off.
And so as long as they keep it blocked off,
they feel safe and then when it intrudes,
that's basically when their defenses are down.
And so the proper attitude is that,
okay, I must have picked up something from maybe from somebody else
that's just kind of hanging around in my mind right now.
John Lee's thing about the different consciousnesses in the body,
that's a good one.
And so there's one part of the mind
that you don't necessarily have to identify with,
but it's there.
And just admit, okay, this part of the mind likes this kind of thinking.
Yeah, I'm going to ask,
why does that part of the mind like that kind of thinking?
Even though you in the moment don't particularly care for it,
you feel threatened by it.
Both as a clinician and a meditator though,
I've often found that it's sort of on the spectrum
where there are some thoughts that feel very volitional,
other thoughts that feel kind of more like they come out of random.
It just seems like it's kind of like a person with mental health issues
yelling in the park to a certain extent.
That's somebody you kind of just don't want to engage with,
but yet they're still there yelling.
And so I mean, I think that idea of kind of getting to the bottom of that
for those thoughts that really don't feel very volitional
and seem to just kind of come from past karma.
I mean, that idea of kind of getting to the bottom
and thinking about the gratification,
I just haven't quite found a great way to do that,
or to recommend other people to do that.
It just seems more like it's something to be ignored
and undermined through other ways.
Well, it's still there.
That's somewhere you're going to have to engage in.
And the question is, do you feel comfortable engaging with them yet or not?
You have to have to have a safe space inside.
Yeah.
And this is one of the reasons why we work with the breath
and work with it and get the body as comfortable as possible.
So you feel secure in the present moment
so that you can take these things on.
If you don't feel secure, you don't want to take them on yet.
And the other thing is just say whoever that is,
whatever bit of that personality is,
personally just have lots of goodwill.
This is my teacher's way of dealing with spirit possession.
And it works well with psychotic thoughts as well.
Just lots of goodwill.
What do you want?
What's your problem?
Thank you.
I could spend the next whole afternoon talking about my teacher's dealing with spirits.
Thank you.
Can I please get the list of the qualities that you listed out
that are useful to deal with aging?
If you listed them out and I didn't quite get a pen and paper to note them down.
You mean the strengths?
Yeah, the strengths, yeah.
Well, it's listed in the readings. There are two lists of strengths there.
Which one of those?
Under the topic of aging.
In my readings, it's on page 11.
Okay.
And then putting those two lists together, you've got seven factors.
Yeah. Okay.
The other question I had was, seems like at the moment of death,
you said that changing the change of right view or wrong view
can kind of depend, can actually guide exactly where you could be reborn
or maybe at least direct you in a different direction in case you change it.
How much of a change in right view would be required?
It seems like it seems to me that it's rather extremely subtle.
It seems almost like you could have gone all your life committing murders,
killing animals or all of that.
And the moment of death, you just say, gee, that was terrible.
That was bad for me to have done that.
And that immediately takes you somewhere else.
That seems a little arbitrary. I'm not quite sure that...
You might go to a good place,
but there may be some bad things happening to you at that good place.
Okay. So in other words, some of the comma would have some effect at some point in time.
It might shorten my lifespan for some while or something like that.
Okay. The other thing that also was occurring to me was the present moment,
when actions in the present moment,
if those actions are done with the senses,
like for example, we are using the senses, the senses are also from past comma.
So now we have a point where we're basically using past comma and present comma together.
And that seems to be happening all the time.
So in other words, we are using what came from the past as a raw material
to fashion out what's going to happen in the future all the time.
And the present moment.
And the present moment. Okay.
And so that's what we are trying to get training in during the meditation.
It's just that it is just that we're always doing it.
It's just that we don't do it very well.
That's the only reason.
Okay. Thank you.
It's like being a good cook.
If you're in a really good cook, you can take bad ingredients and make good food out of them.
Great.
Hey, good morning and thank you very much for the teachings and for the readings that you gave us.
I really appreciate them.
And I appreciate the story about the Buddha wanting to find the death list so much.
I told a few Buddhists that I know that I'm not interested in being reborn.
I really don't see any realm that attracts me.
And they said, oh, you're just practicing a version.
And anyway, you're not a monastic.
And I just didn't know what quite to make of that.
But it didn't seem relevant to me.
I mean, why, why would that make any difference or does it?
Because the problem I am having is that my job is so exhausting that I can never reach concentration.
But it seems like you were saying that concentration is necessary.
So I guess I have to make a decision about my job.
Is that where I need to go now?
Yeah. Ask yourself how much do you want to continue working on your job and how much time do you want to have to work on your mind?
Yeah.
Okay. That's a tough choice.
But thank you for that answer.
Alex.
Oh, Tanajan.
There's something I want to ask about in the Suttas.
I don't know whether it was in the readings till I haven't read them.
But in the Suttas, the Buddha becomes ill.
And I think some of his senior disciples do as well.
And one of the other monks recite the Vajangas.
And then they're the better.
So I just wonder what your thoughts were about that.
Is that something we could do more?
Well, that's one of those cases where the illness had to do with his state of mind in the present moment.
And as whatever past karma there was involved in it, and this was not all that strong,
so that just strengthening his mind, but remembering that those factors for awakening was enough to give capacity on us.
So was that, was it a recollection practice?
It's basically a recollection, because in those cases, all those cases are our hands.
Yeah. So would that not be helpful for someone who wasn't?
Well, give it a try.
I mean, the whole thing is, you know, what qualities of mind would be skillful to induce that person while they're sick?
In some cases, as I said, it's, I don't think thoughts are good will.
See if that helps.
Just think good will for all beings, rather than focusing on their personal pains and illnesses.
Thank you.
John, it's past noon. Do you want to take more questions?
We've got four questions. Why don't we just close the floor to questions and just take these remaining four.
Okay, that sounds good.
Okay, so Deborah.
Hi, thank you, Tan Jeff.
Well to be here.
I've been focusing on making my mind like earth.
And so I typed into Domitoks and I'm, I've now listened to the first one, which was in 2019 about 20 times and I keep picking up more and more.
But can you that at first I thought that that idea was to make it so that other things that happened to me or are, you know, I could just be okay that
I wasn't, I can try to keep myself really stable. But then I realized it's so that when things in my own mind become visible to me or apparent to me that I don't get upset.
Right.
And so can you just relate that to this whole thing on aging on this in death, just talking about making your mind like earth.
Okay, there's a lot of negative stuff is going to come up.
In terms of what the body is going to be doing to you and the thoughts that are generated within the mind.
And if you're going to be dealing with them skillfully, you have to not be blown away by what is negative or even what is positive.
Because you want to see very clearly.
This is something I don't want to go with.
And then understand and then you have the understanding.
Well, if part of the mind wants to go with it, what is the lure?
What is the what's pulling it in?
And can I counteract that?
Even if it's positive.
If it's positive, then you ask yourself, am I getting, is this going to get me complacent?
If it's positive and giving you energy in the practice, go ahead and use it.
Some more skillful, I should look at it as skillful as opposed to positive and negative.
Is it okay?
There was that.
I don't hear so any of the Ice Age movies.
I'm not sure.
There were these animated films about animals from the Ice Age.
No.
I was on a flight across the Pacific and the kid sitting in front of me had the whole set.
And I got to see the whole set.
And in Ice Age 2, there's this one scene where the characters are floating in this boat in this fog bank.
And all of a sudden these mermaids and mermen start appearing and they're all very attractive.
And the animals kind of look kind of dreamy-eyed at these beautiful creatures.
And then as you look more closely at them, you realize that every now and then there's some sort of static in the picture.
And inside the static, you begin to realize they're corona fish.
And I said, great image.
Things that look attractive, watch out.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you.
Lee.
Tom Jeff, I want to go back to Eileen's question.
Because for me, if I can't bring my meditation and working with my mind into my daily life, specifically my job, which is working with some very difficult people.
And here's an example to make you laugh.
In my class now, they just screwed up the whole first assignment.
So I'm really angry, but of course I'm not, I'm not going to, I've been working with myself since Thursday.
Of course, I'm not going to send them an email telling them how angry I am.
So if I can't apply what I do in meditation to my life, it seems to me not too relevant.
That's just where I am.
And I just want to know what I could comment on.
Okay. Well, your meditation has two functions.
One is that you can live this life.
Or, you know, more wisely.
Yes.
And then secondly, that you really do have to prepare.
And what do I have to take with me when I go.
Right.
Well, right now, to be really honest,
I think I have to develop the wisdom to deal with 18 difficult students.
And if I don't do that, I don't think my, my next life is going to be so good.
No, you would have the wisdom to deal with your 18 difficult to five ones here.
So, so I've just, it's just, it's very neat.
I just feel that it's very important for me anyway, to bring the wisdom of the sitting and the meditation and my study and reading to the details of my everyday life students and otherwise.
For me, I just can't make that separation now.
The time will come and I think about this all the time when I won't have outer activity.
But right now, for me, I have to bring the two together because otherwise it's not skillful.
And it's not creating good karma.
Well, this is going to be a decision everybody has to make on themselves how to balance these issues.
Yes, thank you.
Who do you think?
What?
Dear Ajahn, in conditionality, the first one, ignorance, conditions, fabrications.
What are those fabrications referred to there because there is no consciousness there, there is no name and form are there.
Okay, well, it's basically another way of talking about name and form.
Because you have, you have in and out breathing is bodily fabrication.
You have direct thought and evaluation is verbal fabrication.
And then you have feelings and perceptions are mental fabrication.
Now, if you look, you take those and move them down to the factor of name and form, you see them basically repackaged.
There's different ways of packaging that what you are bringing to the present moment prior to sensory contact.
Okay, thank you.
Just a quick question.
You said for calming the mental fabrications, keep different images in mind.
This water sprouting and spreading all over the lake and this bath powder needing.
That's one way.
Whatever way you find it, whatever perceptions you hold in mind that help to calm the mind down.
Those are the, those are the perceptions you want to use.
If you're working with breath meditation, then you use those images.
If you're, or you can have different images of how the breath energy is flowing in the body.
And some of them are more common.
That is where I'm a bit confused because when I'm following the body, the body is the perception of the entire body.
How the energy is spreading and how to bring another perception.
Okay, well, there's, you kind of the perception of the breath energy originating in the body and spreading throughout the body.
That's one.
Another is that each cell is breathing.
And so there's no one spot in the body that has priority over the other spots.
That's going to be even more calming.
It's like every, every, every cell is breathing.
Every cell is awake and aware.
That's more calming.
Or you can have the perception that the, that you, the outline of the body is gone and it's just space.
These get more and more calming as you go down.
Okay, thank you.
Yeah, I think that's it for the questions.
Okay, fine.
Well, thank you for your attention.
And we'll be meeting back here at two o'clock my time and two hours, whatever it is in your time where you are.
And we'll talk about death.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for your help.
Thank you.
Wonderful seeing you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
All blessings.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'll let you remember to turn off the recording.
