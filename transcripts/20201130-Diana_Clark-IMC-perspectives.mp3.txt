The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good evening or good morning, good afternoon or good day, whatever time of
day it happens to be when you're listening to this. If you're here in
California at the same time that I'm speaking, it's evening.
I wanted to talk a little bit about how some of the perspectives that we take
influence our experience, the perspectives that we have in our minds that, you know,
sometimes we're not even aware of them, but they influence our experiences
directly and indirectly. And one way is to use this expression that I used a
little bit in the guided meditation of becoming sensitive to, quote unquote,
as a way to think about practice, to think about our meditation practice,
to think about our Buddhist practice as something about becoming sensitive to.
And I can think of this expression sensitive to as being like a tuned to
or noticing maybe like when you hear a song in the distance or maybe in the
middle of a restaurant or coffee shop that's loud and you hear a song and you
want to like, oh, is that the song that I think it is? And you kind of like tune
into it, kind of like tune the ear for it? Maybe something like that is kind of
becoming sensitive to is tuning into or inclining the mind or so it's not so much
about being more susceptible to becoming upset or throwing off balance.
You know, sometimes we have that expression, oh, you're too sensitive.
That means that you're getting overwhelmed by your experience.
So that's not what I am pointing to here, but being sensitive to your
experiences more just maybe using our senses, all of our senses in a more
complete way and a way that maybe as like little antennas or something like that.
And one of the reasons why I bring this up is this idea of that we might consider
or take the perspective that practice, meditation practice, Buddhist practice,
is about becoming sensitive is because how we conceive of the purpose of
meditation affects the approach we take towards practice and maybe some
subtle ways. So that is, for example, if we consider or we have this idea that
the goal of meditation practice is to see clearly, which is a perfectly reasonable
thing to do, but we might find ourselves then we have this idea that we have to
create a magnifying glass and that we are straining to magnify our experience.
We're straining to get a closer and closer view and to see clearly and maybe
we're straining to really zoom in and we might not be noticing that that little
bit of straining or maybe it's not even little, maybe it's obvious.
So having this perspective of becoming sensitive to is an alternative to this
idea that we have to see clearly. Or maybe we have this idea that meditation,
the goal of meditation, the purpose of meditation is to have no thoughts.
And then if we have that idea, then every time thoughts arise and let's face it,
thoughts arise during meditation. They make it quieter and quieter and
whisper and whisper, but not at the beginning of meditation.
And when we have this idea that the purpose of meditation is to have the
thoughts go away, then when thoughts arise and there can be this repeated,
maybe it's subtle, but this sense of disappointment, this maybe a sense of frustration
and then maybe comes in some comparing mind.
That is that we're remembering that time three years ago when we went on that retreat
and that weren't any thoughts for a little while or maybe we're comparing
to what we imagine other people's experiences are.
Seems like some other people, they clearly aren't having any thoughts.
They're sitting so quietly or something like this.
So having the idea that meditation is about not having any thoughts,
having that perspective about meditation is a way that influences our experience.
In the same way, if we have the idea that meditating is all about getting blissed out,
that is having pleasant experience after pleasant experience,
and of course the more pleasant the better, then we might spend all our time
just trying to get comfortable while our meditation time,
trying to bat away or push away anything that doesn't seem like it's
helping us get to our happy place or that happy place.
Again, there might be this irritation and frustration and annoyance
as we try to shove away everything that seems to be getting in the way
of our getting blissed out.
But if we think of practice as a way of becoming sensitive to our experience,
then at least for me, and perhaps it does for you as well, I hope it does,
has this more of a connotation of openness and softness,
more of an attitude of allowing and allows no matter what is arising to arise,
we're just tuning into it or noticing it.
And having this perspective that meditation practice is about becoming sensitive
to our experiences helps us to recognize that there are a range of experiences.
Of course there is that humans have when we're meditating, when we're not meditating.
There are thoughts, there are uncomfortable experiences,
there are things that are unclear.
But if we have the idea that becoming practice is about becoming sensitive,
then we can just have the attitude, well, can I just be aware of whatever is arising now?
Can I hold these experiences instead of trying to make them different or push them away?
And can I be sensitive to what's happening in a way that supports some stability and steadiness
and with some warm-heartedness, some softness?
So one reason why I'm talking about this is that just to recognize that the perspective that we take
has influences our experiences and in particular that perspective that we take about the goal
influences the way that we might think about or behave in the means.
And so our perspective about the goal of meditation might affect our response to
or the way that we practice, the way that we practice.
And this is worthwhile reflecting on.
What is your view about the goal of meditation, the purpose of meditation?
Is there a particular way in which you think about which experiences should be arising
or that the purpose of meditation should be?
Maybe it's not as explicit as the language I'm using right now.
Maybe it's not even clearly defined in your mind.
But maybe there's a view in which that shows up in a way that we interact with our experiences
or meet our experiences while we meditate.
And maybe this way is helpful or not so helpful.
And such a big part of meditation practice is in fact learning to be flexible,
learning to be malleable and to have some plasticity in the way that we approach our experience
and to include that maybe it's appropriate sometimes simply for us to be sensitive to our experience.
That is, we can be sensitive to our bodily experience, either the global bodily experience
for example, like feeling the posture or to sit and know you're sitting in some global way,
some general way, being sensitive to whether your posture kind of has the balance
between being alert and being at ease.
Or we can be sensitive to more particular bodily experiences, that pain in the knee,
the furrowing of the brow, that leaning forward or whatever it might be.
But this idea of becoming sensitive to is a way in which we can avoid having a sense of inertia.
And what I mean by that is there can be, especially if we've been practicing for a while,
there can be a way in which, like, okay, I know how to sit, I always sit this way.
And we're like no longer really paying attention to it.
It's familiar and in some way we're kind of in a rut.
I sit this way with my hands this way, but there isn't any longer being in tuned with
or sensitive to what's actually happening, what's the bodily experience.
So this idea of being sensitive to is a way in which there's like a little bit of movement
in a flowing, relaxed way that's inclining the mind towards the experience that's supportive.
So not so much like in this deep probing, I have to figure this out,
but more in a way in which brings this sense of aliveness or brings a sense of awareness
that brings along with it a sense of vitality or energy in some kind of way.
So of course we can also be sensitive to our emotions.
And we can tune into, okay, if this is a difficult emotion, one that we might feel overwhelmed by,
then often the first choice can be to simplify, simplify the emotion.
And then this way kind of letting them quiet.
And so one of the easiest ways to simplify an emotion is to become sensitive to bodily experiences
that are associated with an emotion.
For example, like tuning into the lump in the throat or the knot in the belly
or maybe the feeling behind the eyes.
And then when we do this, when we simplify our emotions in this way
by becoming sensitive to the bodily experience, we do this with warmth and with care.
Not in a way that's harsh or dismissive of our emotions and we're not pushing them away,
we're not shutting them down.
Just in some kind of way saying, I'm not going to go there right now.
And to be sure simplifying our emotions by tuning into the bodily experience
isn't what we should do for all of our emotional experiences, both on and off the cushion.
It's not appropriate for our whole path of practice, it's not appropriate all the time.
Sometimes it's appropriate to be sensitive for the fullness of the emotional experience
and to attend to it, to notice it, to be with it with warmth and care and compassion.
I think all of us know it's easier to do that when we have a certain amount of stability
and we feel like we have the capacity to do that.
So the approach whether we are simplifying our emotions by tuning into the bodily experience
or we're being present for the whole shebang of our emotions,
which approach we choose is, you know, we learn.
And for each experience we learn by exploring, by having a sense of curiosity, by playing.
And so much a big part of meditation practice is being able to pick up tools
such as this idea of simplifying emotions and being sensitive to the bodily experience during the motion.
So having this flexibility to pick up tools and to use them, but also to put tools down
and to notice when they aren't helpful.
Maybe some things are helpful on the cushion but not off the cushion or the other way around.
So being sensitive to our emotions and which tools that we're using to be with them
also includes being sensitive to what leads to more suffering and what leads to less suffering.
There are so many different ways we might determine this.
Suffering might be feeling overwhelmed or it might be a feeling of constriction and stuckness.
Or it might be still difficult and uncomfortable but there might be a little bit less suffering
because we're being sensitive to what's happening and there's still a little bit sense of being able to move forward.
That there's a moving through or metabolizing or processing in some kind of way that maybe we don't even understand.
So this idea of being sensitive also to what kind of tools that we're using and is this the best tool at this time?
And sometimes we don't even know that. Maybe I should say all the time we only learn this through experience,
through trial and error, which of course means there will be a lot of times when we discover,
oh, yeah, maybe that wasn't the best way but it's what I did and I learned something from it.
So in the same ways we can be sensitive to our mental experiences.
We can be sensitive to in general what are some of the perspectives or attitudes that we have.
For example, do we find ourselves stuck in an us versus them, me against the world kind of a mindset
in which we find that we're doing a lot of blaming?
I can't believe they did that. That person said that. I can't believe I did this.
When we find ourselves filled with the kind of feeling being stuck in this way of us versus them or blaming when there's these really strict ideas of there's a self here
and maybe there's a self over there and that self shouldn't be that way or this self shouldn't be that way or
of course we're not using this type of language explicitly but there can be like this general attitude or perspective that we're taking.
In contrast to maybe finding ourselves filled with appreciation or gratitude or certain softness or openness to our experiences
even though they might be uncomfortable or they might be comfortable but the perspective we take influences the comfortableness or uncomfortableness of those experiences.
We can become sensitive to the general way in which we are with our thoughts. This is kind of global sense of me versus the world
or maybe a global, things are okay and there's an openness and softness, gentleness towards types of thoughts that we're ever attituding that we have.
In the same way we can become sensitive to the particular types of thoughts that we're having.
A lot of planning or a lot of fantasy or reminiscing or story making of some sort or another.
Or we might become sensitive to the particular type in terms of it being light or wispy or in some ways being not so solid that they're like coming and going.
And so we can also become sensitive to the felt experience of the mental experience.
That is, is it tight or constricted or is it flowing and specious?
Maybe the thoughts are rapid or languid.
And if we find that the thoughts are persistent then we can become sensitive maybe to if there's an emotion underlying them.
And then if we discover that there's a difficult emotion then we can do just like we did with difficulty emotions,
become insensitive to a bodily experience, simplifying the difficulty emotion and tuning into a bodily experience that's associated with it.
We can also become sensitive to the amount of effort we are applying during the meditation.
I mean even part of the reason why I'm saying this word sensitive to is to just get a sense of the feeling of the type of effort that is needed for it to become insensitive.
Insensitive is more of a type of an opening or allowing movement as opposed to this idea of getting concentrated or getting focused,
which implies more of a kind of like a bearing down type of effort to closing and finding myself like hunching my shoulders and making a fist,
that kind of effort, or more of a relaxed open effort.
And so becoming sensitive to or getting focused on, it might have the same direction, the same movement,
but there's a way in which there's a different flavor, maybe a little more closed versus open.
But that art of practice is to notice some of the ways in which we are over-efforting, striving, straining,
in some ways which we're under-efforting, that is being cavalier or too relaxed.
So one more thing we can become sensitive to as part of our practice is the amount of efforting.
Then I also would like to introduce something else, is that we can intentionally incline the mind to become sensitive,
to become sensitive to beauty, allowing ourselves to be nourished by the visual beauty around us.
It's only one type of beauty is visual. Chances are that you're sitting in a room right now and perhaps there are things hanging on the wall
that were put there because maybe they're visually aesthetically pleasing, maybe they have sentimental value.
Maybe there you have coffee table books, so to speak, books that are filled with beautiful pictures or calendars
that have beautiful pictures on them.
So a way in which we can become sensitive to the beauty, there's another way in which we can maybe soften and allow
when we kind of like tune into beauty, there's a way in which there isn't usually a bearing down,
but instead there's an openness to this. We can see this sometimes when we go outside,
when we go for a walk, either just in our neighborhood or maybe even driving in our neighborhood,
or wherever we might be, we can tune in to become sensitive to the architecture, the colors,
I mean nature, trees, plants.
This is a way that can really support us and help us find some stability.
So then we might ask, well, if practice is about becoming sensitive to all these things,
really there's got to be more to it than that.
And when we become sensitive to all these different experiences, all of our experiences,
and tuning into the amount of effort we're applying and being nourished by the beauty
that might be internal as well as the gratitude and compassion that we might find,
then we begin to notice more.
And one thing that we notice is how things are connected.
That is, that the perspective we take influences our experiences.
If we take this perspective of our meditation practice of being just sensitive to,
we're more apt to be open, we're more apt to have a softness in our practice
that allows our experiences to flow through and to arise and pass away,
as opposed to our glomming on to them and getting stuck in them and feeling overwhelmed by them.
You might notice that, of course, that when we're hungry,
and something has just triggered a memory about a fight that we had a number of years ago
or maybe even the other day,
and then, of course, we're more apt to have anger in the present moment.
Because we have this perspective, we've been viewing, stewing maybe in some anger,
and we're more apt to become angry.
Or if we've been practicing loving-kindness or appreciating beauty or reflecting on appreciation,
then maybe that same example, that same experience, we're less apt to become angry.
I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
We all know this. That's why we have this expression of, well, maybe you should sleep on it.
We say that to this recognition that, oh, you'll see things differently later,
and when you see things differently, you'll have a different response to them.
So much about practice in some ways.
Maybe one of the most important things about practice is to see all the different conditions
that come together to create the present moment experience, including our perspectives,
including what's happening in our mind, kind of like the ecosystem of our mind.
And recognizing this, we can adjust, shift, affect our perspectives,
which then affect our experiences, which then make it easier to affect our perspectives.
And when we start to see that our perspective affects our experiences,
then we're less apt to really hold on to our experiences as being this is the solid, true nature of this experience right now.
This is the truth, absolute truth of the moment.
We tend to hold it a little bit less tightly when we know that the perspective that we take influences our experiences.
Then we don't hold our experiences as tightly.
And with holding our experiences less tightly, it's easier to let go.
Less tightly holding is less suffering, less dukkha.
So this is the way to greater and greater freedom, all the way to complete freedom,
is to notice the conditions that are coming together that are helping to create our experience
and importantly the perspective that we're bringing.
And I'm offering this idea of becoming sensitive to is a perspective we can take that allows us to maybe tune into,
but still with some softness and openness that can support having our experiences have softness and openness.
And maybe for them to have a little bit less of a solid, static experience that we can get ourselves stuck into,
but instead can allow some letting go so that we can find some more freedom.
So in this way being sensitive to our experience, one way of understanding practice is how practice can lead to freedom,
all the way to liberation.
Thank you.
