 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and warm greetings from Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City. I say that with a particular kind of happiness that I'm back here at IMC. I've mostly been gone for the last month, certainly gone from YouTube and all of you here. And that's nice to be, very nice to be back and being able to be, have this kind of contact with you and the kind of contact it is for me is that, you know, I get to share my heart, share my practice, my sense of the Dharma. And I feel very grateful to be able to have this opportunity and to be able to share what I have loved and delighted in. So here I, here we are and I'm certainly delighted and glad, happy to be here. And I want to use that as a jumping off for our meditation that there is a role at times for gladness, for delight, and maybe as we settle into our meditation here, there's a variety of things that we can settle into or be inspired by or kind of welcome us, kind of make a welcoming kind of place within to be present. That we want to be present to these good feelings that can arise, maybe. And there is a gladness, maybe, that comes from simply sitting in this meditation posture. If you've been doing this for a long time, it might be a kind of homecoming. Fortunate to be able to have a posture to meditate in and to have that. And it can maybe be at a certain degree of gladness or delight that you have these minutes put aside where there's so much of your life that you don't have to take care of at this moment or you've chosen not to take care of or be engaged in. And it's kind of a vacation, a Sabbath, a stepping away. And maybe there's a gladness for this little bit of time and maybe a modicum of peace and subtleness, peace of not having to respond and react and do and accomplish and prove yourself and just to be here. And maybe there's gladness in having a mindfulness practice, gladness in a practice where we, with time, can find our home here in this body, in this space, that there's a kind of safety that we find in being aware, being attentive so that our reactivity doesn't get the upper hand. Just to be here breathing. And so there is maybe a variety of things you can be glad about, happy about this opportunity to meditate. You might have a lot of challenges. You might have physical pain. You might have emotional difficulties that are very uncomfortable, not to deny them or try to override them. But maybe for these minutes here, in the middle of them, in this present moment, maybe there's a place where your heart can smile. Maybe there's some things there that allow your heart to have a smile and in that smile to welcome you to be here and present. So gently closing the eyes. Maybe closing the eyes so that that part of you which has the smile or the gladness can be felt more. Gently taking some long, slow, deep breaths, gently. Three quarters full. Inhale. And perhaps with the inhale and exhale, breathing with the smile, breathing with the gladness. Letting your breathing return to normal. And sometimes it's useful to notice the location in your body from which you're aware, from where you practice mindfulness. And this seat of awareness can be changed as variable. Without denying how you might be otherwise, can you let your awareness come from the place where you feel a delight or gladness or contentment, a quiet well-being. Like you're sitting into a nice, comfortable, easy chair from which you can gaze upon the world. Letting your awareness take a seat in the smile of your heart. And from here, be aware of your breathing. Be aware of your body. Be aware of your experience, remembering always to know it. And then from that seat within where there is some well-being, resting there, awareness resting. So awareness does not work................................................
