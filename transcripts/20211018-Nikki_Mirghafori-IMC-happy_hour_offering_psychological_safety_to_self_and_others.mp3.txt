 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Okay, great. So formally, hello and welcome everyone. Dear Sangha to happy hour. So I missed you on Friday. I was teaching a day long part of a leadership program I've been teaching in five month leadership training. The reason why I mentioned that is that one of the themes that I was sitting with and it's been a lie for me and I want to bring in that theme tonight is borrowed from that context of what makes teams what makes you know when you have when you are working or volunteering or, or even your family units you know you have a team of maybe you're throwing a party and you know, you know, people you're working with so any team, what makes teams successful what makes teams really really work at their best, and it turns out that there's a lot of research about this and and Google for example being you know that there's so many scientists there and so they've done so many studies and it turns out that the number one there many variables there five they come up with but number one is psychological safety. Isn't that interesting. The number one factor that makes teams really co here and work and succeed psychological safety, which to me is ties in with metal, I'll say more in a minute but the idea of psychological safety from this context is that you know, you're yourself and offering team members. This, the sense of, you know, they can disagree, they can say what they want, there's not a sense of retribution you know people won't be shut down immediately for voicing their opinion or if there's something is going wrong or for making a mistake, making a mistake there's psychological safety. It's okay. It's okay and those teams, the teams that have psychological safety succeed the most, which makes sense right if something is not going right. If people are scared to speak up, then it will continue to go off the rails, but that's one way people have the ability to brainstorm make mistakes, take risks. So now let's take that idea. I want to thank ourselves for our team, this team that is me with all my voices inside you know all the, the, the ways I speak to myself, the way that I show up, the way that I put myself down the way that I disagree with myself the ways I, the way I tell you, I can't think that you made a mistake bad bad bad. Ouch. So, as a person, as a being with all these voices that come up for us internally. How can we offer ourselves psychological safety. So that's what I like to bring in tonight as, as a practice of metta, and also to tie it into metta in the following way. Remember the first phrase of metta is, may I be safe from inner and outer harm. May you be safe from inner and outer harm. Safety. Hello. Here it is you see the connection. This idea of offering safety, especially to ourselves may I be safe from inner harm and inner harm is the harm that we cause ourselves through not offering ourselves this sense of safety the sense of psychological not opening our own heart to ourselves. So, so that's the connection I like to bring in for the practice of metta tonight, offering ourselves safety, offering other safety so that people feel safe in our presence. They can disagree. They can say what what's on their mind, and it's okay. We won't shut them down right away we won't be angry we have the sense of stability and resilience and open heart to be curious, they can make mistakes, they can fail, yay, they can fail, and not be quote unquote perfect. And it's okay, they can feel safe, we can offer people safety, psychological safety, the safety. So, metta practice safety is number one is the first phrase of the four phrases. And in the research and multi variable research and industry and, you know, various places psychological research Oh, it turns out psychological safety to is number one, far more than the definition of teams etc etc. So I think that is not surprising, not surprising at all. So, with that as the setup. Let's practice let's begin. So, I'd like to invite you invite us to land, to land in our bodies, and let all the words go. No words needed at this moment. Arriving, arriving. This body in this moment. We might be tired, we might be sad, we might be anxious, we might be a key. We might be going up right now. It's okay, it's fine. Next exhale, relaxing into the body making space for whatever is showing up in this moment, reality as it is in this body in this heart in this mind. It's a hard day. Maybe we've had a lovely day. Opening our hearts. Opening the door of our heart. Letting in, letting in all the guests. It's alright, come in. There's plenty of space in this heart. Disappointment, sadness, confusion, heartache, joy, excitement, body aches, body energy, whatever. Ah, welcome, welcome them all. Welcome, welcome them all. Enriding this body, the muscles to relax, to soften. Starting with our eyes, let them rest in the socket. Our forehead, let it soften. The jaw, relaxing. Neck and shoulders. The arms and the hands giving their weight to the earth. Feeling the sensations in the hands. Relaxing the chest. Finding the heart, the heart center, the proverbial space for emotions to relax, be just as it is. Finding the abdomen to relax and soften. Bringing awareness to the sit bones. Finding the lower legs, the upper legs, the knees, the feet. To offer their weight to the earth. The entire body feeling a little heavier, deliciously heavier, settled. Receiving the breath in the abdomen, the lower abdomen, the abdomen receiving the breath. Each breath, the entirety of the breath. In and out, just to settle and calm the mind just to arrive. And if your mind wanders to a thought or memory or daydream, it's okay. It's all right. No need for judgment. Offering your mind, your heart, safety, safety. The mind will wander, it's okay. It's all right. Just notice, simply notice what it's resting on. Ah, this, yes, this. And then ever so gently inviting the puppy of the mind to return, to return. The breath and the abdomen to settle. It's not just your mind. It's not just your mind. It's bringing yourself safety, kindness. Next something is the Maybe even the next time you notice the mind is thinking, has gone off, maybe try saying it's okay sweetie, it's okay, it's alright. Smiling, feeling the breath in the belly and smilingly, joyfully, coming back home, coming back home to rest with the breath. two You offering safety to yourself, your poor mind this often restless mind, this heart, this body, offering safety to ourselves it's okay, it's okay dear, it's okay it's okay, it's okay you maybe there was something your day or your week it was challenging for you, you tried your best, it was confusing, difficult maybe you made a mistake, or failed in something, it's okay, it's alright offering yourself safety, psychological safety, safety see what happens when you offer yourself safety and don't be afraid that you'll become a slacker, couch potato it turns out that through offering ourself safety with care and compassion we take more responsibility so see how that feels internally for you let that fear, if it comes up, let that fear feel safe, it's okay fear, it's alright come here, hang out, I'm not going to push you away or give you the reins of my mind can you offer safety to whatever is coming up and that's not it you just breathing, receiving the breath, with kindness may I be safe from inner harm I offer myself safety may I love and accept myself just as I am whatever version works for you or without words you Notice if there can be more ease and peace in your heart than your body and your mind. You offer yourself safety every time the mind wanders, you don't yank it back. Jerk the mind back into the present moment with force, but just gently. It's okay dear, it's all right. Ahh, sense of ease, it's all right, it's part of this training. This is how we train our mind, our puppy. Gently, gently returning every time. Now you can stay with yourself, offering safety, kindness. It has an expression of metta, loving kindness to yourself as a part of this training, the most important part of this training. So either stay with yourself or if you like, and consider someone in your life, for someone in your life you like to offer more safety to from you, for more psychological safety too. May you be safe from me, may I be safe for myself, may I be safe for you. I wish to offer you safety, psychological ease and safety in my presence. Radiating as if your heart, your heart center is radiating. A slight, a warm, caring light of safety. Touching you first, relaxing your body, your heart, your mind. Nothing shining out, offering safety, touching with safety. The ones you are considering in your mind's eye right now. May I be safe for myself and others. May I allow space for ease, for mistakes, for imperfection in myself and others. May I feel the goodness in myself and others. Offering safety from judgment. To ill well, internally and externally. Recognizing you're doing the best you can. So are others, given all the causes and conditions that have come to be. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Every time you find your mind has wandered, relax into safety some more, into ease. No need to judge yourself. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. For the last moments of this practice period together, offering, offering your self safety from judgment, from however this practice period was. Are you sleepy? Am I most distracted? It's okay. You showed up. You did your best. Offering safety without judgment to yourself. It's okay. Offering appreciation. Yay! I showed up as best as I could. It's the best any of us can do. Trusting there is goodness. There is goodness and just showing up, even with one moment of awareness and kindness to yourself and or others. We're planting seeds. Trust. Trust your planting seeds and offer. Offer the goodness. Trusting in the goodness. Offering the goodness to yourself and to all beings everywhere. May all beings everywhere. Be safe from inner and outer arm. May all beings everywhere be happy and free, including ourselves. Thanks everyone. Thank you for your practice. Safety. Safety. So the more I have practiced with Metta, the more I have discovered that it's not accidental that the first of the four phrases of Metta have to do with safety. I'll say all four phrases. Traditionally they are may I, may you be safe from inner and outer arm. May I you be happy. May I you be healthy. May I you have ease in our lives. So safety, happiness, health, and ease are the four wishes. Of course we can change them. Many teachers change it and it's all fine and you can change them to be whatever work for you. So some teachers shifted and changed it, make happy to be number one. May you be happy, start with that and safety comes at the end. That's how originally I had started to practice with may I, may you be happy being the first one and then later when I was starting to step into the role of you know being a teacher and sharing the Dharma I looked at the order and I looked like oh safety is first I wonder why. So I practiced that way intensely. I remember one retreat, it was a month-long retreat, Metta retreat where I did happy as first and realized wow there needs to be I'm sorry I need I need I did safety as first. Ah let me rewind. I did safety as the first one as canonically off suggested that you do may I be safe may you be safe as the first wish of the fourth. I discovered that this wish for safety is so fundamental this feeling safe feeling safe our bodies and mind and heart is so fundamental really it's it's what holds everything else it holds happiness and health and and ease until you have a sense of safety in your heart in your mind and also it ties in with the attachment theory of Bulby's attachment theory in terms of safety in our hearts anyway there's so much years and and now also this connection to the world of research about teams and work offering ourselves and each other safety so safety what an important gift to cultivate it's a gift to cultivate gift to cultivate for ourselves for others so I'd like to invite you to to share reflections in this space please especially if you haven't spoken for a while you're welcome to raise your hands or type in chat if you type to me alone on zoom I will only say read out your reflection not your name if it's to everyone I will read your name also so what did you notice what did you observe are questions comments anything's welcome hmm Neil says a lovely practice I feel all warm and cuddly oh thank you Neil yeah it is a lovely practice isn't it offering ourselves safety yeah sweet yeah ah our hearts feel more ease did any of you try especially you know when your minds went off to say it's okay dear it's okay sweetie and kind of easing into safety a little more did you try that Yerba says this meditation made me feel cozy and empowered ah thank you Yerba I'm so happy to hear that yay cozy and empowered beautiful dimensions of just feeling contented and sense of empowerment coming out of that thank you Yerba Arura says this was very timely in the middle of a covid scare and really needed to offer myself safety ah thank you Arura yeah safety yeah safety to our minds another share it was a difficult sit initially because I have been having trouble feeling safe in my body due to some health challenges so when I remembered safety I decided to lay on the floor with a blanket and it helped soften some of the edges fantastic great I am delighted to hear the inner wisdom to to say hey body is feeling challenged and lying down with a blanket with this blanket make us feel safe right safety blanket and and softening the edges beautiful thank you for sharing that beautiful yeah I'd be delighted to to hear how that came up and how you worked with that thanks for that share yeah the reflections I was asking if anyone tried the being kind especially kind to your mind when it goes up Mary says in practicing first to give myself safety I was able to see how a friend who's often critical of me perhaps is not feeling safe themselves I was able to offer safety for them oh beautiful what a beautiful insight what a beautiful insight yeah that's often the case when people feel threatened themselves then it's it's hard for them to offer safety to others both with friendships and also in work relationships Jamie says it was nice to be pure occupied and then distracted and then sleepy and no it was all okay yes great yeah sense of safety and and Jamie when you noticed all that and it's like oh was it a sense of ease and safety that sounds like it's okay I don't have to feel bad about it's like so the one yeah so you're nodding and smiling yes and so then that moment that actually one comes to it's like oh yes there's a depth there's a settling that can happen in that moment when there is safety if you notice that it's like yeah the mind was sleepy and you're like ah now I can settle let's notice that moment it can be very nourishing very nourishing lovely yay internal safety so dear ones let's turn into small groups and see if we can continue to offer ourself safety and offer each other safety and let the rubber meet the road of of release relating to each other in this sphere and the space of safety so important to practice and and if you're on the edge if you're like oh I don't feel safe getting into small groups maybe stretch stretch yourself just a tiny bit given that this is the theme see what it feels what it feels like so one reflection I notice that when we are in breakout rooms I feel safer when talking taking the time to do a few seconds of sitting quietly before we share to know that I'm with like-minded folks beautiful yay so we'll do that again tonight we'll start with a 15-30 seconds of metta silently for yourselves for each other offering safety to each other to yourselves in silence and then share as much as little as you wish about your your practice take care of yourselves take care of each other and the rooms are created and now they are open here we go welcome back everyone the rooms are closed so we have a few minutes for any reflections that came up for you that you like to that you like to share please especially if you haven't spoken for a while Neil please so this practice reminded me of a time I went horseback riding when I was six years old maybe seven I don't really recall it was just me and my dad my dad's standing right I don't think he ever touched a horse or if he could avoid it you know he was a brooklyn boy and we were in a little corral I was just going around in circles and some horses galloped on by and my horse took off it was like crazy you know and my dad he didn't yell stop Neil right instead he jumped in front of the horse right I don't know what he was thinking I'm sure he didn't know either but you know sort of you know I keep thinking about that because it kind of like was obvious to him telling me to stop was pointless you know I was not the one in control there right I was being taken for the ride you know you know and there would be no point you know him yelling at me for having not stopped the horse would have been ludicrous right I mean gosh I didn't want it to do that either you know so that thought came to mind here tonight you know you know you know sometimes your mind just takes you for a ride and you just have to figure out how to manage it hopefully not getting run over and trampled in the process yeah thank you Neil appreciate what you're talking about is really a lesson in you know thanks for sharing the story first of all and how frightening that must have been as a little boy for the for this horse to just take off and your dad trying to support and also his wisdom not to say you know shout at you but realize yeah but just you know you're not in control and having the same sense oh yeah my mind I'm not always in control of my mind and that's really an insight into annata not self it's like it's impersonal you can't say my damn it it's you know bad it's like oh sweetie it's okay you're running off again okay come come so it can only tame it or train it with with this gentleness with this kindness yeah thank you it's thank you jesse please so hey thanks yeah just uh along the lines of what you said about the mind wandering what struck me today is that it really is just a fantastic opportunity to practice kindness right at that moment and i was wondering if you are recommending like saying a specific different other phrase like so like i'm normally saying may i be safe may i be happy but then when my mind wanders i'm drifting off i'm just wondering if that's um should i say like good job or welcome back or you know i'm just wondering what what types of um how i could be supportive to myself in that specific moment of noticing that the mind has wandered yeah yeah yeah very good very good point so so it's um what what feeds what supports what nourishes you know there is the carrot and there's the stick right method so the moment that you realize that you know you become awake you know your mind has been gone forever many minutes right just minds do that and and the moment you become awake instead of going oh bad mind you've been gone right and so and you're and so you're not you know but i'm giving the complete picture and i'm going to get to you the details every question for a moment and now you're asking so in that moment do i just bring it back and continue and say may i be safe you know continue the practice or do i actually acknowledge in that moment do i do something more in that moment so great so in that moment it is helpful it does feed it will like it's a carrot to actually celebrate that moment to actually say yay i'm awake now oh sweetie it's okay come back you know it's something positive you know bring in something positive in that moment instead of definitely not something negative like how bad you were sleepy and and and neutral is fine but it's kind of nice to bring in yay just a little bit of a smile oh yay a moment of awakeness yay i'm awake now i'm yay and oh or or what i was suggesting tonight like it's okay it's okay there's a sense of comfort there oh it's okay and so try that yeah it's okay when you find yourself you've been gone and so and see if that it's okay with kindness if it blends you deeper than just going back so that's what my recommendation is you experiment with it for a while and some you know or for a long time so yes does that does that make sense beautiful thank you thank you jesse christine we're over time so this needs to be really quiet it really quick or i'll stay over time not sure what you're saying my dear okay yeah it just occurs to me um that i think when when david sat in for you was he was that he's sitting in for you here at happy hour where did i hear him yes yeah and he suggested when when you come back well that when my mind goes away it is always going it is always going somewhere to try to make me safe it's going somewhere to try to figure something out to make me safe right and so he suggested when you come back to say oh thank you for working so hard to try to make me safe like um great great that's that's whatever positive thing you put in there whether say it's okay sweetie welcome back or thank you as long as it's it's a positive reinforcement you whatever works for you christine as long as it's a positive reinforcement basically in psychological terms yeah sounds good thank you all thank you all so much for showing up for your practice for offering safety to yourselves and others and i want to share this link by the way for for those who might have been intrigued about psychological safety at work that i shared it's in chat and let's bring this session to a close maybe we'll do this theme again more later may all beings be safe may all beings be free may all things be happy including ourselves thanks everyone
