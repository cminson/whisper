Welcome. Welcome, everybody.
Some of you noticed we had a little hiccup with the meditation hall, but we roll with it and just find our way back.
A lot like meditation practice, a lot like life.
And if you didn't notice, no problem.
So today we did a second day of loving kindness for ourselves.
For some people, it might have been really deeply nourishing and supportive.
For some people, maybe it was difficult running into snags or difficulties and so many different ways.
Some people was a mixture.
But no matter how it was, however it was your day unfolded today, this is a beautiful practice and worthwhile doing.
Because so often we have habits of harshness or anger or judging or disconnecting.
And I appreciate that Tara Brock writes in the introduction to Mark Coleman's book, Making Peace with Your Mind, Tara Brock writes, or I guess it's a forward to his book.
She writes, stopping the war against ourselves is the key to healing our wounds and opening our hearts to the world.
Yet putting down our weapons and learning to love our own being may be the greatest challenge we face in life.
The inner voice of judgment and criticism can be unrelenting and painfully convincing as an arbiter of truth.
Unrelenting and painfully convincing this inner critic that I spoke about last night.
And of course it's one thing to see how we treat ourselves and it is something entirely different to start doing something different.
Part of caring for ourselves is learning to be, to be with the difficulty in a caring way.
And to be able to respond to difficulties in a way that is skillful, helpful, and healing.
And this is something that I appreciate so much about Buddhist practice.
It's not only about this, but it includes this idea of cultivation, about learning.
Like there's, it's possible to have a different way to show up in the world, to react to our experiences.
It's impossible. It's not like we were born with a set structure, of course not.
And part of meditation practice, part of it is a cultivation practice, not entirely, it's not always that, but sometimes it is.
It's quite something that we can learn. Like it's part of a skill that we can gain to how can we be with difficulties in a way that's caring and helpful and healing.
How can we, what does Tara Brock say, put down the weapons?
It is possible. This can be done.
Part of loving kindness practice is learning how to do that, or maybe actually learning, loving kindness practice is doing that.
Because sometimes on an emotional level, we might feel challenged or lost or overwhelmed.
We might feel like, okay, I don't know, maybe everybody else can do this, but I can't.
And so part of the teaching is learning, practicing, developing, cultivating.
And last night I talked about a number of ways in which we can work with difficulties.
So something else I'd like to introduce about being with difficulties is this idea that we can, maybe this is implicit in all the ways we work with difficulties, but maybe to make it more explicit is to, we can look at things differently.
The different perspectives, different frame of reference than the way we usually look at them.
When there are difficulties, and I'm just using this generic word difficulties, maybe it's anger or sadness, or maybe it's not even clear what it is, it's just really uncomfortable.
Suffering, duke, uncomfortableness, dissatisfaction, has different names, different flavors, different times.
When these arise, there's a way in which our attention shrinks.
And it just collapses around that experience and we often lose awareness of other things that are happening at the same time. Instead, it's just here.
For example, there might be this wound that shows up repeatedly.
Maybe a divorce of our parents and there's this story over and over again that we tell ourselves or get told in some kind of way about what happened to Rich Child and this really kind of uncomfortable, maybe even painful thing that just comes up and just making this up as an example.
Is it pattern? Many of us have these patterns.
So if we have this thought pattern that just repeatedly comes up to help us look at it from a different way, from a different perspective, is maybe one way to think about it is to expand the field of attention.
How does that thought about the divorce and what happened to which child or what it means or all these things, how does that thought feel in the body?
Oh, there's tightness in the chest and the lump in the throat. Or we can expand the field of attention also by maybe just dropping in this question.
Is it true?
In some ways, it feels like a rude question. Like, of course, it's true. I'm thinking about it. But just to ask ourselves when we drop in, is it true?
And that helps us to also kind of shift the perspective a little bit so we can see it from a different angle.
And so a repeated difficulty may be predominantly felt in one area of our experience thoughts.
Where the body or emotionally or energetically, and can we just become aware of another dimension? It's primarily in the thoughts.
Can we put attention towards the body?
It's one way. There's lots of ways. Sometimes there may be a desire for things to be different and that shows up physically as I'm leaning forward.
I know I do this, or sometimes my chin goes up to if I feel like I want something.
But that same desire maybe energetically is this restlessness or this upwelling of vitality or maybe gets expressed emotionally as excitement and eagerness.
Or maybe it just shows up as cognitively as different beliefs and stories.
So just to remind ourselves, we all know this, that there's different dimensions and we find that we're getting stuck to broaden or shift the attention.
But there's this wide range of states associated with META, this whole range of colors and flavors.
And sometimes there's no feeling at all. And that's perfectly fine. It's perfectly fine.
Sometimes META can feel smooth and calm and soothing.
Sometimes it feels like there's a healing energy.
Or maybe sometimes there's this bubbliness to it, this energetic or maybe feels very bright and sunny and warm.
Sometimes there's just a real gentleness, a sense of spaciousness.
And we want to allow this whole range, this whole range of the way that META shows up.
And sometimes META colors into, blends into compassion.
And compassion is what flows naturally when META encounters difficulties.
Jill Shepherd says that compassion is the love child of META and dukkha.
I like that. That's kind of the fun way to think about it. And to think about a love child between META and dukkha.
But so compassion is grounded in the same kindness and warmth and all of these different colors or flavors of META.
But it's turned specifically towards distress or difficulty.
And so it also has this sense of this wish for the difficulty to end.
And so to have compassion for our difficulties that we're experiencing.
Is to turn toward our difficulties and embracing it with feelings of care, with feelings of a connected presence of warmth.
And treating ourselves in the same way that we would treat a friend that was in distress for whatever reason.
This might be markedly different than some of the ways we treat ourselves.
Tara Brock talking about, you know, this war that we have with ourselves.
Many of you are familiar with the work by Kristin Nath. I'm not going to talk about her work today.
I wanted to read this quote from her, which I just found really powerful and I don't know, it's a little bit silly also.
And maybe it's part of the silliness is what makes it powerful.
So Kristin Nath is highlighting the importance of, you know, caring for ourselves in the same way that we would care for a friend.
And highlighting, we know how to care for others. We know how to take care of our friends, our dear ones, our loved ones.
And can we do that same thing for ourselves?
So here's this little scenario that Kristin Nath paints.
Imagine a close friend calls you after she just got dumped by her partner.
Outrage, right?
And you respond by saying, well, to be perfectly honest, your partner probably left because you're old, ugly and boring.
You're also needy and dependent and you're a little bit overweight and I just give up now because there's really no hope of finding anyone who will ever love you.
I mean, frankly, you don't even deserve it.
Oh my gosh, that just is so painful for me to even just say out loud, right?
We would never speak to somebody like this.
That was hard, actually, for me, kind of like sitting in all these days of meth to say that.
But there might be a way in which we say these things to ourselves, if not these exact things.
But sometimes there's some version of this, but we would never say it out loud, right?
Even just hearing me say it, maybe you are aghast like I was feeling.
So self compassion is offering support in a way that is supportive and healing and helpful when we're having difficulties.
Sometimes the difficulties we're having is the way that we think about ourselves are inner critic that I talked about yesterday.
And something that I appreciate so much about self compassion is that it supports us to make some changes in our lives, not because we are inadequate,
but because it cares.
And this is a way to lessen our suffering.
This is a different way, right? This is this shift in this perspective, looking at things from a different way.
Sometimes we have these feelings that we want to do this cultivation, which thinly disguised as a self improvement project because we're inadequate.
But can we shift our perspective? Can it be about love? Can it be about kindness? Can it be about care?
Can it be about inadequacy and fixing?
So in the same way compassion for oneself is, it's not the same as being indulgent, self-indulgent.
This morning I mentioned maybe only taking one bubble bath and not ten bubble baths.
I'm not exaggeration, of course, but the thing is with about being self-indulgent is we often have to learn what is self-indulgent and what is self-care.
And we kind of learn only by tipping into, okay, now I feel like I'll just use bubble baths as an example.
I'm taking yet one more bubble bath. I'm actually feeling really disconnected from myself.
I feel worse. I feel completely run out of energy or enthusiasm and I've fallen into a sense of futility and this energy is kind of like drained out.
Like, okay, so I thought it would be supportive, but note to self, maybe that wasn't the right way.
So taking care of ourselves has this, but feeling a potential, a little bit feeling of spaciousness in the sense of possibility.
And to be sure, sometimes there are some difficulties and we're just doing all that we can to hang on.
And we're just hanging on to whatever is available and that's all we can do.
And we have to honor and respect that.
And honor and respect. Sometimes we have more capacity. Sometimes we have very little capacity.
That's okay. That's what it means to be a human.
And so much about practice is about being sensitive to and responsive and flexible and recognizing what is helpful here.
How can I take care of myself? Meta for myself, kindness for myself in this moment in a way that is helpful and healing and supportive.
So self-compassion doesn't isolate us or pretend that difficulties aren't there.
I think we've all tried this and it turns out that the difficulties find us, right? We can't run away from them.
And so, when people are self-compassionate, they tend to engage in or do activities that take care of themselves.
They go along like eating well, exercising, spending time in nature, sleeping, these types of things.
And this recognition that befriending ourselves as best we can, as best we can, we're not looking for perfection.
It helps us to connect with others and to receive support from others.
Sometimes receiving the love and the care is more difficult than giving.
So it can be difficult to receive from ourselves.
Is there a way in which we can honor and respect that and
maybe allow the loving kindness practice, even if it feels sometimes dry and mechanical,
to allow it to continue, kind of like this. Sometimes it might feel like we're plotting along
and trust someone that we're planting seeds that might not fruit, bear fruit right away. That's okay.
We can be patient.
We may not want to be patient, but we can be.
And to be sure that to have this compassion for ourselves can be difficult because it's natural to avoid pain, not turn towards it.
Many of us come to the Dharma because that is the last thing we want to do. We came to the Dharma trying to get away from suffering.
Not everybody, not all the time, but it's often because we were trying to find a way to be or not be with our difficulties or suffering,
or to be with them in a different way, but inevitably there are times on this path when all kinds of pain does come up.
It's part of the path of practice. It's not a mistake.
It doesn't mean anything about ourselves as practitioners or as people. It's part of how this practice works.
And I appreciate Nikki's expression as purification cycles.
It can feel like that, that sometimes things come up and we hold it, we are with it as best we can.
And then it gets resolved in some kind of way. Maybe it doesn't go completely away, but it doesn't last forever.
But of course we don't like to be vulnerable or weak or to feel these difficulties. So sometimes this whole compassion practice feels uncomfortable because it's acknowledging this is suffering.
So with this retreat we'd like to focus on Mehta, but this recognition that sometimes Mehta just transforms into compassion.
And that is this loving-kindness when it meets difficulties, when it meets suffering, whether it's our own or of others.
So Mehta is the foundation for all of the Brahma vaharans. So it's really helpful to stay with Mehta and really gain some familiarity with it, some comfort with it and kind of explore all these different colors and flavors of Mehta.
You don't always have to get bored with it and come up with other ways. But there also may be times in which it's appropriate to do a little bit of compassion practice for yourself.
And so I'll offer a few phrases. It might be helpful if you find yourself struggling or one might be, may I hold this difficulty with kindness and ease?
I might feel a little, I don't see how that feels, or something else. May my difficulties ease?
Or may I know peace?
I think with the Mehta practice, introducing phrases is a way that interrupts kind of like this habitual flow, this way in which the mind and the heart can sometimes have this locomotive power and go down certain directions.
So these phrases are a way to kind of hold the difficulty, maybe bring in a different type of energy and interrupt what's happening.
May my difficulties ease?
May I know peace?
So compassion, in a way, is part of Mehta, but it's slightly different.
And in this retreat, we're focusing more on the Mehta, which is a bit more buoyant and bright, rather than emphasizing the suffering.
It's fine if compassion comes up and it may be a skillful way to work with some of these difficulties.
Some time ago I was asked to participate in kind of like a panel discussion.
In a different setting, which I'm usually teaching.
And as part of that discussion, all of us were asked to give a little bios in the background.
I knew they were going to do this, so I had kind of like jotted down a few notes of things I wanted to say, and I thought to myself, wow, okay, this is very interesting because this bio here is really different than the bio that I have in another setting.
You know, emphasizing practice or emphasizing more academic or occupational, you know, aspects, and just reflecting that, okay, both of them are true.
Both of these, you know, descriptions of things I've done and why we could even write a third one.
Diana's favorite flowers are tulips, and she likes watching the birds, you know, right?
We could write a whole other one too, right? How many countless ones?
But we can also ask the question, I mean, these bios are like written down now and recorded, which one is real?
Which, what's the true one?
And right in some ways that feels like a silly question because, well, they're both true. Wait, they're both real and yet they're so different.
There wasn't a whole lot of overlap.
And so this idea again, kind of like shifting the perspective, right, we might see something different.
And so the stories of our lives turns out they're malleable.
They're amenable to having these different ways of looking at them, and we can reshape the story.
We can see it or experience it from a different angle. We have an option of looking at it from a simpler level.
And part of what I talked about earlier has been with difficulties when I had the example, like, well, maybe we have thoughts about something that happened to us earlier in our lives, maybe a divorce, pain, difficulties that arose from that and
all these stories, right, all of us have a version of some stories of our life.
And earlier in the talk I said, well, when that comes up, maybe we can broaden our awareness and look to the bodily experience. How do we feel that in the body?
And we might say that that's a simpler level.
It's looking at it from a different perspective and also a simpler way.
And they're both true.
So what seems like a difficulty can be transformed into not being a difficulty by looking at it differently.
This morning I talked about we have narrative selves and we have this felt sense of it being in the moment. How it feels like in this moment. They're both true.
Earlier I talked about how loving kindness has different flavors and it can be transformed into compassion.
So all of this kind of like points to this recognition, this conclusion that and this is something we can really use that the malleable nature of the heart and mind.
Maybe we know this as meditators, we see this, but maybe we haven't thought about this so explicitly.
And part of loving kindness practice is taking advantage of this malleable nature.
The non-fixedness of things.
From a different perspective.
And so often our well-being is associated with this, what's happening in the heart and mind.
It can be, but often it is, the way that we're experiencing it.
And this recognition, oh, there's this malleability, this flexibility, this changeability, this non-fixedness of the heart and mind.
And that affects the well-being.
Oh, the well-being can be malleable, changeable, fixable, non-fixedness, I should say.
And we part of the way we do that is with this intention.
That is, sometimes Nikki and I have been using this expression of planting the seeds of the intention of goodwill and this intention of warm-heartedness.
So planting the seeds.
And it may not seem remarkable when we're practicing loving kindness, but we're doing something incredibly powerful actually.
And having these planting these seeds, these intentions that may blossom or fruit or flower.
Sprout.
In different ways at different times, but so way in which these seeds.
Their blossoming is a way that points to the malleability, that changeability of the heart and mind.
Which allows things to unfold differently, have different outcomes.
But sometimes we're so focused or we tend to highlight the importance of particular outcomes.
And of course outcomes are inherently uncertain. We know this.
There's a part of us that wants to try to control them anyways, but we know that we don't get to control everything.
And why not even be able to control anything?
But much more certain is the effect of this investment of this in planting these seeds, this intention.
Because we can recognize how our intentions are floating around with thoughts, emotions and perceptions, and they all feed each other. They all influence each other.
Certain ecosystem.
For example, we might have this habit of believing we are unlovable in some kind of way or rather this deep defect or something like this in some kind of way.
And this colors our perceptions and we find ourselves collecting data in the world to support this habitual view of ourselves.
For example, we might, well, see that person didn't reply to my email in just the way that I expected.
And we don't usually say this explicitly, but something like, well, and that's just further proof that I'm unlovable.
And then this reinforces that emotion and maybe this feeling of inadequacy and then this affects our behavior.
Maybe the next email we send doesn't have the same degree of warmth as the first one because we didn't get that reply back that we were expecting.
And then these thoughts, emotions, perceptions, actions, habits, they all kind of get away against litified.
And then we kind of get imprisoned in the seeming reality of things.
But meta practice is disrupting this solidification process by planting these seeds with these intentions.
Doesn't mean that we have to be experiencing loving kindness all the time, but to be oriented that way as best we can.
We're introducing new intentions, new thoughts and disrupting patterns and habits and lessening the inner critic.
And then we start to discover that maybe we don't need to trust our negativity as much as we have been.
We don't have to give this inner critic or the negativity some of the authority, this arbiter of the truth power.
Because it turns out that meta has this incredible strength.
Sometimes we don't think about it as that way, but it's this incredible strength that also has a softness to it.
And this strength comes from it's aligned with reality.
It's natural that there's this warm-heartedness, this care, this love.
We notice this when the hardened minds finally start to settle down a little bit.
We start to notice that there is some spaciousness and ease there, and it might be subtle, but in that spaciousness is this quality of ok-ness warmth.
So in this way we might see that our difficulties are maybe more constructed, more put together in a way, or a little bit more complicated than just the warm-heartedness.
And to be sure our emotional life has a really big range, and it's really important to learn our emotional landscape, to be with our emotions, to honor and respect our emotions.
It's really, really important.
With meditation practice we might start to understand with meta practice, and maybe meta for ourselves, or maybe the distinction starts to fade, meta for ourselves, for others.
But we might start to tap into as things settle down and a little bit, get a little bit simpler, but maybe there's something beautiful and warm, kind, caring.
That's at the heart of everything, and is always available.
Part of our practice is to learn how to tap into it, or tune into it, avail ourselves of something that's already there.
It doesn't mean we don't have access, it doesn't mean that sometimes we don't have access.
They're just like loving-kindness can morph into compassion.
And now we can look at things from a different way, from a perspective, and maybe difficulties can be less difficult.
In the same way, just to honor and respect and notice the changeability of our minds and hearts, and it's part of what this practice is about.
Taking advantage of this.
It's a feature, not a bug of our software.
We all stuck there, so this really warm heartedness of practicing together, and we feel touched and inspired by all of us practicing together.
So it's a wonderful thing.
Let's just sit for a minute here.
Thank you.
So thank you.
Thank you for your practice.
Good night.
