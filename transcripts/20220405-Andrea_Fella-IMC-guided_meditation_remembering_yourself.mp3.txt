 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. We could say that we could start our meditation by just remembering ourselves. Remembering that we are a human being sitting in a body that has senses, that feels. That that simple recollection can sometimes help us to land with ourselves. And perhaps remembering that the only place or time that we can know anything is here and now. Can you arrive with yourself here in this body, in this place? And now, in this time, in this moment, how are you? And not thinking about that question, but feeling into it, being with yourself. Perhaps starting in a very broad way, is there tension or ease right now? And if there's tension, is it possible to soften it? Sometimes when we just notice tension, it may be that it's, when it's just below the surface of our awareness, it will perpetuate itself. But when it comes into awareness, sometimes it can be softened. Sometimes it will soften itself, releasing itself through simply being seen, being touched, felt. How are you in this moment? Our practice of meditation, of mindfulness, is to keep connecting. Keep being here and now, each moment, remembering ourselves. We can do that in different ways. Sometimes it may be supportive to simply be with whatever's obvious. Settle back and relax the controlling faculty of the mind and just let experience be. Let ourselves be. And be with ourselves, with whatever is here, whatever is coming up. Holding that with a heart of allowing. The connection of kindness, of friendliness, meeting ourselves like a friend. Sometimes it can feel more easeful to let there be a little bit of directing the awareness. And then bringing that attention to something that feels restful to connect with in the present moment. Still here and now, but a particular area of experience here and now. Perhaps that's the breath for you. It could be the experience of hearing. It could be some other simple experience. At different times, we may find it more easeful to connect with some more limited aspect of what's happening in the present moment. Simplifying things to something like the breath. At other times it feels more easeful and actually it feels simpler to not choose and just to receive. Letting the experience show us. Letting experience come to us. What feels most easeful for you right now to stay connected, to stay present, to keep remembering yourself, keep remembering the present moment, being with. Thank you. And of course the mind will wander, will forget, forget ourselves, forget to be aware in the present moment. And at some point we will remember, mindfulness will return in that moment. We often judge ourselves or we focus or emphasize that we've been lost, but what's actually happening in that moment is that mindfulness is back. Mindfulness is arising. Can you connect with what's actually happening in that moment? What does it feel like to be mindful again? What have you become aware of in that moment? Perhaps you've become aware that you've been thinking or that you are thinking. That's okay. We can know that. We can be mindful of that. It's often helpful in that moment first to recognize that we've become aware. Perhaps notice if there's some tension that has crept back into our system while the mind was wandering. If so, it can be useful to reconnect with relaxing again, releasing tension. We don't have to hurry back to some particular experience. What we're cultivating is the mindfulness. And we can cultivate mindfulness of the body with exploring relaxation of body. And as there's a little more relaxation or ease, we can reconnect. Perhaps let go of the directing towards relaxation and just be with ourselves again, either simply receiving what's obvious or from that place of relaxation, allowing our breath to come to us. Reconnecting with a simpler aspect of experience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
