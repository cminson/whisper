 So the topic of peace has been in my mind a lot these days, and I'm reminded that the flavor, one of the flavors of the Dharma of Buddhist practice is peace. And even sitting here today, it was wonderful to kind of tap in a little bit to the sense of peace that can come with practice, with settling on oneself. And it's really one of the, I find for myself, one of the great happiness, great joys, great delights of life is the quality of refreshing peace that can kind of be in our hearts, be in our minds, be in our bodies, kind of just be something we taste and drink in. Today I was talking with Donald Rotberg, who is a friend and a bhipassana teacher, and very much involved in Buddhist Peace Fellowship and engaged Buddhist issues. And he was telling me about some of the anti-war protests he's been to in the last couple of weeks in San Francisco. And the first one he was very impressed by was one of the large gatherings in Market Street and Civic Center in San Francisco. And a lot of the Buddhist community, the Buddhist Peace Fellowship and the San Francisco Zen Center and different Buddhist communities, they had about, he claimed three to four hundred people gathered, I guess, in the corner of Civic Center. And they had three or four hundred people meditating. And he felt that they had a very strong statement to be meditating. And so it was actually hard to meditate. It was very interesting to meditate. I don't know if he said hard, but very interesting. Because he tried to stay very attentive to what was being spoken on stage, where the short little speech was being given. And as the day got on, he said that people were more and more strident and aggressive and angry and violent in the kind of speeches they were giving against the war. And it was quite a practice for him to sit there and sit still and hold that in his awareness, something that was so painful as to hear people protesting a war. But he felt very confident that that had a big impact on the environment of the march, the protest in San Francisco. People would go by and notice these three or four hundred people meditating. And he felt very strongly that it's a particular kind of message to be given when you protest in meditation, you know, publicly in a public place. And there's all the people protesting. And it's like, you know, you're taking your stand, you're sitting there peacefully, and you're not antagonistic. You're not angry with anybody. You're peaceful. But you very clearly say, this is where my position is. And then he was involved in, I guess it was last Friday, there were 85, 83, 85 kind of clergy type people who were arrested blocking the federal building in San Francisco. And the clergy of all kinds of backgrounds, you know, Christian Jews and Buddhists and Hindus. And so at that point he felt it was necessary to take the next step, not just simply protest, you know, by meditating during a raj protest, but actually do an act of civil disobedience. And from our kind of teacher community, he was joined by Jack Kornfield and Sylvia Borstein. And he described, you know, the kind of non-violent act of civil disobedience. And he said that they would tell the police what they were going to do, and the police would tell them what they were going to do. And they said, okay, then we'll do this. No, you shouldn't do that. You have to do this then. Okay. And they kind of talked, and they had the whole thing choreographed ahead of time. And when it was time to actually do the act of civil disobedience, they followed the instructions given both by the people organizing the act of civil disobedience, and it was a handout about how to show the proper respect to everyone, to the police. And there was instructions from the police what you had to do. And so they all did it, very, you know, and then the police would arrest them, which meant part of men's is putting handcuffs around, you know, and putting their hands behind their back and handcuffed. And Donald showed me his handcuffs. He was very proud of them. He had to put them in his pocket. And, you know, and, you know, they're very, very loose, you know, they're kind of cloth. They're kind of like, I don't know what they described them, but they're kind of like, I've seen plastic ones. They tighten the plastic around your wrist and they hold you in. But these are made out of more cloth, I guess, maybe so it hurts you so much. But they're both tightened up, I guess, and they can hold you really, you can't move your hands so much. But what they did with the police then for this protest was they just kind of loosely hung them around the people's arms. You know, there was, there were, the loops were this big, right? And so they all, so he told me that he said they were, they're all marched into the federal building to some place there and, and they're standing there and they had to give their names and no one was charged, but they had to sign a document that's, that they were not going to sue the San Francisco police department for how they handled the event. And you know, get arrested in your own risk kind of document. And, and then they're all standing there with their hands behind their backs and someone finally asked, you know, be okay if we took these off, these handcuffs off and the response was, I guess it's okay, you're not going to hurt us. And so then they were all let, let go. And it was a beautiful, I think it was beautiful, you know, probably wasn't nearly as expensive as the people running around Market Street, we heard about before. And he said that one of the beautiful things I thought was some of the police officers actually volunteered that they were very supportive of the protest and were kind of, you know, against the war. And it was very warm kind of relationship between the police and how difficult had some police volunteer also how difficult had been to have been seen as the representatives of the people perpetuating the war and have all this animosity directed towards them. And they prefer much prefer this, you know, this act of civil disobedience and the way it was done. And hopefully it's, it has an impact in the wider world that people of the cloth, the clergy kind of people are involved in these kinds of protests. So then, so then that was today. Some of this today will just be my own reflections on it because I feel it's safer for me to just give my own reflections rather than give you some Buddhist point of view of this. The, the, the, the on Saturday I ran into an old friend who has been a Darmark student for many, many years, very, very dedicated practitioner and has his own sitting group and he's kind of a teacher a little bit in his own right. And he had used to be involved in politics as a politician like into office and stuff. And recently retired from that. And I said, Oh, this probably inspires you to get back into politics. Get, you know, and I thought, you know, get involved political work in terms of protesting the war. And, and, and his response wasn't was, Oh, he's not cutting your categorically against the war. He's not, he's unsure about his position about the war. He's unsure about the wisdom of the war and, and, you know, not war. And you know, he's kind of, you know, he's unsure. He's giving him a lot of thought. He's researched a lot and, and he was on, you know, he kind of not for not particularly against it, but not, you know, it's quite no, but he wasn't going to fight it. And he said it was, what he said was he's unsure whether the, the damage caused by the war is going to be less than or more, less or more than the damage of not going to war. So I didn't respond and let it be. It wasn't the time to have a conversation with him. But what struck me about that was that I had assumed that he was against the war like, like I am. And, and it felt a little bit bad that I had kind of assumed who he was without, you know, you know, somehow asking or checking in and kind of imposing my view on who he is and his, you know, his ideas. And he was quite open to have a dialogue and, you know, sometime hopefully we'll sit down and talk and have a long conversation about it. And, but so kind of get that this is from a different angle now. The, I don't know quite why, but my association since I was a child has been that religious centers, like churches, like I grew up partly in Europe and churches in Europe were meant to be sanctuaries and people who go there and still in this country there was a whole issue about how much is a church a sanctuary. And you can go there and you can find sanctuary in a church in the old days. The police, the military wouldn't chase you into the church. You were safe as long here in the church and you can stay there for years and you know, and you know, and you couldn't leave left. Maybe they'd behead you, but if you stayed there, you know, you were safe. And, and I also had this idea that people of the cloth, so-called, you know, people who are ministers or clergy or monks or priests, where I had lives dedicated towards being peaceful, being nonviolent. And when I grew up, I was surprised to find out that this wasn't automatic. And in fact, there were lots of people of the cloth, lots of clergy, both in Christianity for sure, but also in Buddhism for sure, who advocate a war and been involved in fighting. And, you know, I find it a little bit kind of a, in Congress when I read last week in the paper about the US chaplains who are there in Kuwait blessing the soldiers as they went across the border into Iraq, it just somehow, it doesn't, it doesn't jive for me. It doesn't work. I'm such a strong, I'm so strongly conditioned to think of clergy as being people who are dedicated towards peace and not supporting war in any way. And maybe not protesting it, maybe in kind of a neutral space, like a church is a neutral space. The church is a place you find sanctuary and people are not for or against, but that's neutral, it's a safe place. It's outside of those kinds of games and that kind of conflict. And in Sri Lanka, there's Buddhist monks who've done the same thing, you know, blessed Sri Lankan soldiers as they go off to war. And Thailand has been the same thing in Japan. So certainly in Christianity and Judaism and all the different religions you find, what you do find is you find individual clergy who are dedicated to peace and you find others who have other ideas about it. So as I became an adult, there was a surprise to me and a little bit of a shock, but I understood this. And then when I was being, when I was practicing in San Francisco's end center in the early 80s, late 70s, one of the lessons I picked up from there is again, the value of a spiritual center, meditation center, remaining neutral in these kinds of conflicts. Because everyone in a conflict, in theory at least, should be, everybody should feel, should feel welcome to come to the place where people can be engaged in spiritual practice that helps them resolve the inner tensions, conflicts and sufferings that they carry with them. And so if you're involved in the political position, then the center is not a place that feels safe for people to come who fit to one side or the other side of the political position. So a few months ago, there was someone put up a sign on their window here that said, you know, no war in Iraq. And I said, I'm not going to do that. So I promptly took it down for that reason. I didn't want our center to be identified that way so that people who even are for the war, so George Bush, if he walked down the street, he wouldn't feel welcome to come in here and meditate. I imagine that in my mind, at least, he could use some. So I'd be very happy, but that's my opinion. So anyway, so I took the sign off the window and I put it over there on the community table in the back where anybody can put it in a flyer if they wanted to. And I thought that was a good place because it wasn't associated with the center then. So they want that neutrality. And then I talked with Tara Brock, who's the Vipassana teacher in Washington, DC. And she checks in with me periodically to ask if she wants to have it. They want to get their own meditation center building like we have here. So they check in with us periodically, how do you do it and what are you doing there? So she called me and said, what are you doing about this war thing? And I told her, I felt the center should be kind of a neutral place. And she asked a lot of questions about that because in Washington, DC, it's quite hot, much more than it is in California. And for her, it felt really odd not to get involved. My attitude was that it's okay for a Dharma teacher to be involved as a private person, but not for the center to do it. So of course, now I've probably already gone across the boundary of my own policy by sitting in the Dharma seat in the center and basically saying, you know, I'm against the war. And that's certainly the message they came across. So I don't want people to feel uncomfortable. So maybe I shouldn't even have said that. But what this is today, partly this talk is my own reflections and a little bit of my own kind of grappling with this issue and sharing that with you. And I was very surprised. So in the mid 80s, there was an incident at the San Francisco Zen Center when I was living there. One of the abbots there, in a very unfortunate circumstance and very stupid, I would think, circumstance, ended up being arrested for carrying a gun into the projects, in the housing projects in San Francisco. And I guess, you know, these housing projects back then, probably still, most of them are mostly made of African Americans. And he was, you know, shaved head, you know, white guy, very muscular and, you know, with a gun. So he was arrested. And so there was a whole issue about guns and stuff. And the whole community was very, very, very upsetting for the community and a lot of community meetings. And I was really surprised that an abbot would have a gun. I was kind of shocked by the idea. But it was even also shocked that one of the, we had a meeting of all the priests at Zen Center. I was a priest there. And one of the priests spoke up and said that, you know, basically, he didn't say this, but basically kind of sounded like he was a member of the NRA and was defending his right to have a gun. And he goes target shooting and he had several guns. And what was wrong with that? And I was just kind of shocked. And then, in fact, in the four Mahayana Buddhist monks in China, there is a very clearly a rule that they're not allowed to have anything to do with weapons. And for Theravadin monks from Southeast Asia, there's a very clear rule they're not supposed to have anything to do with weapons. But what happened is that Buddhism came to Japan, a lot of those rules were dropped in favor of 10 simple rules that doesn't clearly specify no weapons. So that Japanese priests don't take that vow with no weapons. But still, so with all this is kind of my kind of strong feeling, strong sentiment about that some people in society, it's really helpful that some people in society are known as people, known as places that are sanctuaries, that remain neutral, that remain, they're dedicated to peace no matter what. That's kind of like Theravadin. And the recognized people go there because of it. I was very impressed when I was a Zen priest. Before I was a Zen priest, I was a long-haired hippie. And I had hair down to here, and I had this long beard, goatee, long goatee that went down. And wore the appropriate clothes. And I noticed that like if I flew on an airplane, some people would talk to me, but some people wouldn't. Some people sitting next to me in the seats, certain kind of, certain people who looked like they were, I don't know, what, businessmen, certain kind. You can probably imagine the kind of person who maybe wouldn't talk back in those days with a long-haired hippie. Anyway, so certain people wouldn't talk to me. But what surprised me was when I was ordained as a priest, and I had a shaved head and wore a little bit simple robes, that it seemed like I was, everybody's business, everybody would talk to me. At first I thought it was a little weird, a shaved head, that was kind of a weird thing to be walking around San Francisco with a shaved head. But what happened was that by being a priest, I was kind of outside, seemingly outside of the usual categories that people were for and against people for. And a priest or a monk or someone who everybody could feel like they could be friends with. And I never had any sense that someone was avoiding talking to me. I had a sense that people wanted to talk to me. They would stop me on bus stops and start to talk to me. And people would tell me their life stories and suffering, you know, sitting on the bus. Because you were available. You're kind of available in that kind of way when you're a priest. So some people are available. Some people are known as being people of peace, people who are not going to be judgmental or available to talk, be a good ear, a good listener or something. I think it's really valuable. So my hope for our little center here is that somehow we are able to hold that kind of space here. And we have the anti-abortion protests here, right on our street. And a lot of people here have all kinds of opinions about abortion, pro and against and everything. But what would it mean to not, in this context, not to express our opinion, but to hold everyone in our hearts to be neutral in some way? Is that appropriate? So I had this discussion with Tara Brock in Washington, DC. And she was struggling much more with what I was saying, my view, my opinion, you know, the center should not be a neutral place. And what I suggested was, well, it's okay for you as an individual to go and do what you need to do, but make sure that the Dharma Center is neutral in some way. Is this interesting enough so far? My reflections? I hope so. So I'm going to change now, I think, the direction of the talk. So Donald Rothberg just talked about being there, sitting in meditation at the demonstration, and hearing this stride into Maryland, anti-war speeches being given, and holding that in his awareness. That was a practice, it was hard to do, and to stay patient, stay open, not to be contracted, not to get caught in thoughts and ideas and criticism, just to stay open in the midst of that. So what I would suggest is that the practice of peace is a practice that's not easy to do. And I think most people are committed to it into some degree. The question is to what degree are you committed to it? You might be committed to it in your own family, maybe, maybe not. But you know, not to get angry in your own family, but to somehow do the practice it takes to say what needs to be said without being an explosion of anger. Or maybe you're committed in other situations that way. Some of, some of, part of the commitment to being a peaceful person, a person who does not succumb to aggression, to violence, to hostility, the commitment to avoiding that has a lot to do about knowing alternatives to aggression. People who don't know alternatives are much more easy to succumb to aggression because they feel that, you know, what else is there? There's a certain logic towards responding with violence, to acting violently. Part of the logic is that I'm defending myself and I have a right to defend myself. Part of it you know is an eye for an eye kind of logic. There's all kinds of logic that people have that's a pretty good logic. But what if you know about alternatives? What if you know about, what if you, or what if you have better sense of the consequences of this? So for example, I apologize for using a lot of child raising examples these days. But I've noticed, you know, there's certain logic that I tell myself about, you know, the appropriateness of aggressive discipline sometimes. And the strongest aggressive discipline I've done with my son is I've yelled no at him in a voice that gets him to shake. And I don't know if that was, you know, I have a lot of doubts with the wisdom of, when I've done that. And partly I know I was acting out of frustration when I did that. But there's a logic that says I have to discipline him. And then, for example, it might be that he's just really hungry. And you know, so what do you do? So you get, by all means possible, aggressive means stop the kid from acting the way he's acting. Or do you get him, you feed him. And as soon as you feed him, then he's happy. He's really the sweetest kid in the block. And so, to get, so there's a lot of examples where if you kind of tune into the child, you see there's a need that's there. And so rather than kind of putting down district discipline, you try to respond to the need that's there. So is this true in other situations also? Are there alternatives to violence? Are there alternatives to aggression and hostility? And I think there often are, but people need to learn about them and be trained in those. I was very impressed when I was, last time I lived, I'm Norwegian, last time I lived in Norway, was for any length of time was, now it's almost 25 years ago, or more, almost 30 years ago. And I'd gone back there from living here in this country. And there was a very strong, in Norway there was, back then, I don't know if it's now, but back then there was mandatory military service for all young men. It was one year of service. And there was a lot of people who opted for the alternative to military service, and like 10% of the young men opted for, they were conscientious objectors. And then you had to serve as an alternative to one year in military, you had to serve two years in civil service. Like you had to work in a hospital for two years or something like that. But there was a certain percentage of people who didn't like that option either. They're against violence, they're against war, but they didn't want to serve, they didn't like the idea of doing civil service because they wanted to be able to defend the country. They felt that back then there was all these little, Russia would do all these test probes into Norwegian defenses, that they would send the submarines in and pop up in some fjord. And they're always always feeling that Russia was kind of testing its defenses. And so there was some feeling that there was some threat coming from Russia. So people were concerned about that threat. And so people felt, some of the young men felt that they wanted to actually be able to defend the country, just simply working in a hospital wasn't good enough, they wanted to defend the country. But they didn't want to do it through serving in the country. And what they petitioned to the government for was they wanted to have a training camp, like boot camp, to learn about civil disobedience. Civil disobedience has a very good track records in a lot of different places of being very, very successful. It worked even against the Nazis at certain times. There's a lot of success, there's probably places that didn't succeed, but there's a lot of wonderful success around acts of civil disobedience. And they felt, we need to get trained in those techniques. And so we want boot camp. And we want to serve in the alternative army, so we can defend our country. One of the great take, one of which is a very cute little techniques of civil disobedience, when the army invades, you go and take all the street signs and you juggle them around. And so the army shows up with their maps. Now I guess they have GPS, it doesn't work, but back then they had to show their maps and suddenly they're looking for El Camino and there are now Almeida de Las Palugas. So it slows them down. And in Czechoslovakia in 1968, civil disobedience there was amazingly successful. It didn't win out in the end, but it only failed because the Russians had to pull the soldiers out and replace them with fresh recruits who weren't influenced by the civil acts of disobedience. The disobedience in Prague was so loving, they put flowers, they gave flowers to the people in the tanks, and these soldiers couldn't fight. And so they had to pull them all back to Russia and send fresh ones. And by that way they could quell the rebellion. And it turns out that civil disobedience is an art form. I have a book at home, it's three volumes. One of the volumes is this big and it's all about the techniques of civil disobedience. It's very sophisticated art, it's well developed and thought out and lots of examples. American society itself has lots of examples of civil disobedience. The union movement for the most part was a form of civil disobedience, nonviolent protest that had a big impact in this country. So a person's dedication to peace or to nonviolence or to alternatives has a lot to do, I believe, in being educated about what the alternatives might be. It also has a lot to do with learning how to handle one's own aggression and how to handle even more, maybe more profoundly than one's own aggression, how to handle one's own pain. Because I don't know what percentage, but a good percentage of aggression has to do with pain. I've seen it sometimes when I've been louder to my son than I want to be. It wasn't so much that my son was the problem, the problem was that I was in pain, I was frustrated and I wasn't really reacting against my own frustration within myself that caused me to act a certain way. There wasn't that he was being, he was just him, but it was my unhealthy relationship to my own pain. So it caused me to act out in a sense. That's really one of the heart issues of Dharma practice, is learning how to come to terms and relate to our own aggression, our own violence, and how to relate in a healthy way to our own pain. One of the very interesting teachings around this is to look at the five hindrances as strategies that we have to avoid our own pain. This is not the definitive definition of the hindrances. For example, the five hindrances, those of you who don't know it, are the five things that hinder, traditionally said to be the five things that hinder our capacity to be concentrated, hinder our ability to get concentrated because it keeps the mind scattered and distracted. In the same way, it also keeps the hindrance to keeping the heart, the mind unified, calm, peaceful, settled on itself. The first is desire. The second is aversion. The third is, usually called sloth and torpor, lethargy and resistance. The fourth is restlessness and the fifth is doubt. So I think of these as strategies. I think to spend some time with yourself exploring the question, what are your common patterns? What's the common way that you, when wisdom isn't operating, when wisdom isn't operating, what's your gut reaction to your pain when you feel pain or frustration? Everybody probably has their own. Some people, it's the desire mode. They feel personal pain and they think, well, I'll just go out and get ice cream. Fill it with a desire. Avoid it with a desire. Some people, it's aversion. Lash out at something. You can lash out at other people. The aggression can be turned inwards. Something, I must have done something wrong. I must be at fault. It might not be your fault at all, but that's something, you feel pain and so you have to look for fault. The whole thing of blame can often be an aggression that comes from it. It can often be misplaced and misunderstood and a reaction to our own pain, even when we blame ourselves in the wrong ways. Then lethargy and resistance is a strategy to pain, to frustration. You just give up, hold back, get tired. I've seen it myself, especially when I was a kid. I didn't see it when I was a kid. Now I look back and say, oh, that's what it was. It really struck me how I could get so tired, so tired in certain circumstances when my mother wanted to take me places. Then how amazingly fast I'd revive. It was resistance. I didn't want to go there. Agitation, restlessness, get lost in our worry and agitation. It's a strategy people have, a response to their own frustration, their own pain. Then doubt, rather than just filled with doubt and just frozen by doubt, hesitating by doubt, holding ourselves back by doubt. I think it's a valuable exercise to do, to spend some time thinking what is your common, your own personal, unique way of responding to pain? Do you have one? Not to think that you're wrong for having it or bad. It's embarrassing. Rather, different people are wired and programmed different ways to respond different ways. Some people are desire type, some people are aversion type. It's not like wrong. It's just how it is. Actually, it's said in Buddhism that there's a certain advantage for being the aversive type in practice. It's said that aversion, people who get angry and aversive easily, they tend to be much more motivated to abandon their unwholesome tendencies. They're not going to be patient with it. There's enough of that. They push it away. There's a little bit of an advantage in the Dharma, to be an aversive character. In case you are feeling a little bit bad about it, you can look at it in a good light. The disadvantage of being a desire type person is that it's sometimes hard to see that desire is a hindrance, is a problem. You might hang out with desire for a long time. It's kind of pleasant, seductive, the thoughts of desire. What's your common strategy in situations of discomfort, of impatience? It's now 8.55. I have no idea. This talk has been interesting for you, or helpful, or engaging. By 8.55, I imagine some of you might be getting a bit impatient. Where's this going? Sometimes guilt talks on beyond nine. It's going to happen today. There's certain level of discomfort arises. Some of you are sitting on the floor. Maybe your knees hurt right now. What's your response? Some of you get restless. It's that approach. Some of you are just getting tired, but you get to leather g-sets and say, I gave you a little bit of time. Some of you are starting to think about fantasizing about something else, and tune me out by now, and thinking about something wonderful, desire. Some of you are thinking bad thoughts about knees. When is he going to shut up? Some of you just turned out, what's going on here? What's your way? I'd encourage you, really encourage you, especially because of the war in Iraq, to do a couple of things. One is to look at your mindfulness practice, as your awareness practice, as a tool to understand your own aggression, and your own capacity to be at peace. To explore the patterns that you have for responding to hostility, responding to pain, and see if you can think of alternatives that maybe are wiser and more effective, and in the long term might have much better consequences than the short term gain from acts of hostility and aggression. And see, and I apologize for this last one, but I'd really encourage you to see, to up, strengthen your commitment to being peaceful, or strengthen your commitment to not being violent. See if you can, I'm really confident all of you have some commitment to this, but can you up it? Can you strengthen it? Can you expand it? Can you expand the domain in which you apply it to? That's my wish. Did I make you uncomfortable? So there's three minutes left. Any comments or questions in three minutes? Nagy. I was wondering if you heard that Sylvia Washington and Joseph Foske and Ed Lamont were the best in Washington. No, I didn't hear that. Gently. It sounded like a similar to this. Gently. I kind of emailed to that effect and it said that Sylvia, they were the first to put their hands behind it. Apparently they were looking for barriers, and decided that was what they needed. It's a beautiful thing, you know, people to act peacefully like that in a friendly way. Donald now has his, so I joked at him, you're saving so you can recycle it? Show up. You don't have to bother. I bought my own. Save the city of San Francisco $10 for its handcuffs. So please, if you get arrested, save the handcuffs so we can be used again. Yes, Doris. Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock, there's a mass movement that's around the world of people sending love to President Bush for 15 minutes. And the people around him and their idea is to appeal to the small child within, or the young boy within President Bush, and empower his heart so that he can make more compassionate decisions and let people around him also. So if enough people do that for 15 minutes, the idea is that it could have a strong effect. Tomorrow morning, from eight to eight to 15, 5 p. Did you have an idea if she was a children? I just wanted to add to that, but my understanding was to send love not only to Bush, but also to Saddam Hussein and to anybody involved in the violence. I'll have the last word, if I may. I saw Donald today and I asked him, what was most inspiring to him these days about the anti-war movement, anti-war activities? What was the most inspiring thing that's happening right now? And he said, the fact that it's a global movement, it's all over the world. It might be a small percentage of people in the world, but it's all over the world. And what popped to my mind was that because of that, we could, for different reasons than the last two times, we could call this World War III. Because this is one of the first wars, it's really clear, there's a global consciousness or a global awareness of it, but the whole world in some way is watching and participating, at least. So the whole world is involved. And perhaps it's a good thing that we all see it. We're accountable to each other now in a way that we maybe weren't 100 years ago. I don't know, maybe you saw, you've seen it, there was a statement by Robert Mueller who was the Assistant Secretary General of the UN, and he said, this is an amazing time, it's a miracle right now, and somebody wondered where has he been? But his thought was, it's the first time in history that we have debated a war worldwide, we've debated it and discussed it before it happened. This is a step toward the time when we may never go to war. It's a conscious step forward. It didn't work yet, or we don't know what worked. How do we understand? Mark? Just to... The Tibetan people have always been an inspiration, particularly when I find myself. Two times I found myself, what I thought was going through a hard time, and I somehow picked up, I remember, one time in People magazine, there was this article about the Dalai Lama, and he was talking about, you know, he's lost 6,000, monastery millions of people, and he says, they've taken everything from me, can I let them take my mind and my heart? And the other day I was at Carmel Beach, and I walked along the beach, and I see these beautiful robes, and I get closer, and there's about five Tibetan lamas at the beach. And so I went out there and started talking to one. As I was, I saw them walking as a ricochet who came from India, they were taking to see the beach, and they were walking off the hill. And at the top of the hill, there's a sand sculpture, this guy who does the sand paintings. Tibetan sand paintings? No. No, no, there's western art. Beach pictures on the beach. And I see them, like, their eyes open up, and they're standing there, I wish I had a camera, because this beautiful picture of these lamas sitting around, just watching this guy do work with the sand, and, you know, what they do with the mandalas and everything. So I went up and started watching them. It was just delightful. And in the middle of all this, there's still delight. So thank you very much. And if my personal reflections and point of view has caused anybody distress, I apologize very much, it's not the intention.
