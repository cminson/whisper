Samādhi (1 of 5) Concentration as 
Centering and Letting Go Into  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

Good morning. This is the morning of the fourth week , 
where each week I am talking about one of the five 
faculties. The first three were faith, effort, and 
mindfulness. This week is about samādhi, 
concentration. The translation of the word samādhi  as 
concentration is fine , but I think it somewhat limits what  
samādhi  means in the practice we do.  
 
Samādhi  has two basic meanings. One is as a faculty , a 
particular function or capacity of the mind that becomes 
stronger as it is utilized for the purpose of practice  – or 
really for anything. The other meaning is th at when th is 
faculty is fully engaged and strongly present, then 
samādhi  is a state. I think of it as a state of being. Some 
people might call it a state of mind. It’s an overall state 
in which we are abiding or feeling. It exists in and 
through us. It’s a  state of wholeness, integration  – a 
state of deep stability and steadiness, a kind of radiance 
of presence. To be centered in the state of samādhi  is 
almost like finding a sacred temple in which we live.  
 To engage the faculty of samādhi  is, in the simplest 
language, to be focused on what we are doing. There 
are many different choices about how we focus , so we 
have to be careful not to assume that if I use the word 
focus, I mean exactly what you would use the word for.  
 
For now , I would l ike to play with  the English word 
‘concentration .’ I think of the word samādhi  as the ability 
of the mind’s attention to center itself on something. 
Rather than focusing itself on something, it centers itself 
on something. The difference is that for some p eople , 
focusing is constricting, draining – whereas centering 
implies the idea of resting in something, abiding, 
standing in the middle of something. We are centered in 
it. It’s a whole body standing in the middle of some 
experience. We don’t have to strai n at it , or look at it 
with the mind’s eye. Rather, we abide in it , and are 
present for it in a full way.  
 
The idea of being centered has a lot to do with being 
wholeheartedly engaged in what we are doing at the 
moment. If what we are doing is using atten tion, then 
we use mindfulness to see what is happening . Samādhi  
brings to mindfulness a sense of wholeheartedness. 
Just this. Just let me be centered on this right now. If we 
are doing mindfulness of breathing, then as a partner, 
concentration is taking this and wholeheartedly 
centering ourselves in the experience.  
 A big part of centering ourselves in the experience is 
letting go. That was one of the first lessons I received 
when I went to study Buddhism in Thailand. For the first 
days when I was there, I stayed in a monastery and met 
a monk who talked about concentr ation. He said that 
the deep states of concentration are what is attained by 
just letting go. Just letting go. He wanted to differentiate 
that from mindfulness , a clear knowing of what the 
experience is.  
 
But anytime you let go thoroughly, you end up in a  state 
of concentration. That’s because we are letting go of 
distractions, o f fragmentation, of the mind going off in 
different directions. As we let go, there is a letting go 
into this moment. Just here with this. As we let go into 
the moment , more and  more here, it’s like centering 
ourselves more and more. Centering ourselves at the 
bottom of a bowl as the marbles get quieter and quieter, 
centering in the middle of the bowl.  
 
Letting go is not the same thing as samādhi , but letting 
go is one of the  means of becoming concentrated in a 
way that is relaxed, not straining. It is more like we are 
allowing the mind’s capacity to be focused or to 
manifest because we are getting rid of the distractions 
that interfere with it.  
 
So the se are the two aspects o f samādhi . One is the 
idea of being focused or centered on the experience. The other is to let go of the things that interfere with 
that. If we don’t let go, then there is the tendency to 
want to override the distracting forces by straining more 
or concent rating harder.  
 
Certainly , the faculty of focus can become stronger over 
time, and its strength makes distractions less and less 
attractive. Until the mind is strong, to try and use 
strength to focus and get concentrated can often be 
counterproductive. It  can create strain and tension . A 
variety of things can go wrong for people if they are 
trying too hard. The idea is relaxing and letting go into 
the breathing or whatever we are centering on . 
Sometimes this means the present moment , and letting 
go of what  takes us away. Relaxing into this moment, 
settling into  it.  
 
One principle of samādhi  is that the mind is a soft mind. 
The movement is toward a mind that is softer, more 
pliable, more malleable . A mind that is concentrated is 
bright , with a lot of clarit y and calm. The very means by 
which we try to get concentrated , hopefully will have 
some of those qualities in it. We have softness , 
malleability, calm, and brightness.  
 
These are a lot of ideas to incorporate together , but I 
hope they give you a sense of what is meant by 
samādhi  and concentration. The beginning process of 
using this faculty and engaging it to become concentrated is the capacity to be centered on our 
experience. Th is initiating step in concentration is to 
center oneself  on something , or to focus, if you prefer 
that language.  
 
Then, let go of what gets in the way. The mind goes off , 
and we center ourselves again  – here. Centering is a 
little different from mindfulness in that mindfulness is to 
know and stay present in a knowing way. Concentration 
is to come back, and not necessarily to know the 
experience, but to rest in the experience, to be centered 
in the experi ence. We do that over and over again. We 
come back.  
 
And every time we come back to being centered, we 
figure out how to do that whole process of letting go, 
centering, being focused. It’s important to experiment 
with how to do the whole process so that y ou enjoy it. 
How can you be very forgiving, very allowing ? One way 
to do that is to have low expectation that you are going 
to get concentrated. Don’t try to be fast or cling. Give 
yourself lots of time . Be very relaxed.  
 
When the state of concentration oc curs for me, I think of 
it as a gift. I am not measuring myself , or trying to attain 
it in a tight way. I do my practice. I stay centered and 
present. I let go into the experience more and more , and 
with time , comes a state of being settled and 
concentrate d. It feels like a wonderful gift.   
I hope this has been a nice initial discussion about this 
faculty of samādhi . We will continue this theme over the 
next four days.  
 
May you find many ways today to find yourself centered 
in your experience in yourself. And may you even enjoy 
that centering in yourself. Thank you so much.
