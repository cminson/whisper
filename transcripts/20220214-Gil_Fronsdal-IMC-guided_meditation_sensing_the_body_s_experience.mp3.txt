 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So hello everyone. And beginning of the week for some of us. And some places in the world it's already tomorrow. So, happy to be here. And I want to start right in with the teaching to get oriented around this practice of mindfulness of the elements or the physical properties. Such an important part of the Vipassana practice. No sound. Is it... Are there people not having sound? Let's see. Let's take a moment to see if there's people are hearing. Usually there's a whole stream of no sound, if that's the case. Okay, great. Thank you. So I wanted to start right in with this important area of mindfulness, the mindfulness of the physical properties or sensations that we have. They're so fundamental to our experience and something very valuable about being attentive to the fundamental layer of our experience where the consensus all begins. And so here's an example. That I could be sitting here and I could feel there's tension in my shoulders. That's an ordinary thing to experience. But then I start wondering, why am I tense in my shoulders? Oh, it's left over from yesterday. Yesterday I was waiting for a car to pull out of a parking space and when it pulled out, someone else zipped their car into that space. And I felt indignant and angry and how could they? And I got all tense. And since then my shoulder has been tense. And why is the world such an unjust place? And there's been so much injustice and now it's with the cars. And maybe I should really do is buy a small car or even buy a bicycle. They don't have to deal with this problem. And where do I get a good bicycle? And on and on it goes. And in the meantime, I have departed very far from the tension in my shoulder. And in a sense, no longer in touch with it. The alternative way of not going into stories and interpretations about our sensations is to just feel the sensation of tension and let it be just tension. No past, no future, just tension. No cause, there might have been a cause, but we're not concerned with that. No resolution of the tension, just tension. Just to offer mindful attention to what is, as if what is is allowed to stay there forever. This is okay. But what that does, it creates kind of a mental space or room. The attention to something gives it room. And something like tension then has room to relax. There's like space. There's almost an instinct in the muscles themselves to relax if we're not feeding it more and more stories and ideas. And so this idea of just holding attention and awareness gives it space to begin to not be reinforced by the stories and make space for it to relax. Some things at this elemental level that are pleasant sometimes actually get stronger if we hold it in awareness. But if we bounce off of it into the world of stories and ideas, we might lose touch with even what feels wholesome and good. So this four element meditation is to drop down to the elemental or the fundamental sense layer, sensation layer of experience and then give lots of room for it and not kind of get pulled up into stories, interpretations, past and futures. And this allows for a very important process. And so the art of this is whatever happens during this meditation where there's physical sensations themselves, whether it is emotions, even if it's a lot of thinking, locate the way it's being manifested in physical sensations and keep it so simple that you just stay with the sensations that are part of it and letting this physical sensation, the body compost it, letting the body process it, not your mind, not your heart, just the body, just the sensations themselves. And to help with that, to keep focused on some sensation which is predominant, is that you can breathe with it, breathe through it. If there is no predominant something that grabs your attention, that then you refer to the body to feel it, just stay with your breathing. And there's something profound that happens when we give this kind of breathing room to the sensations of breathing, just the sensations. Each in-breath has its own sensations, each out-breath has a sensation. And that's the focus of the meditation. Just whatever is happening, how is it felt and experienced in the body as sensations? So sitting, assuming your meditation posture, and to settle in, taking a few long, slow, deep breaths, letting your breath return to normal, and continue in the exhale to relax your body, settle in. Your body will be the meditation hall for this meditation. And then, check in with yourself, and what is the predominant experience of the moment for you, within you? And how is that felt in the body? What sensations in your body are most pronounced, that feel like it would be good to just hold it in awareness? And noticing what sensations are there. Tightness, looseness, pressure, weight, softness, warmth, coolness, movement, expansion, contraction, hardness, pulling, twisting, opening. Keep coming back to this fundamental, elemental level of experience, before stories and interpretations, just the sensations for now. Breathing with it, being with the sensations, making room for the sensations. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. If you're in your thinking, you're probably not feeling the sensations. But if you're thinking a lot, are there any physical sensations associated with that? And if so, let those sensations be the place of mindfulness. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Whatever's happening, refer it back to the body. See how simple you can be with it. Simply feeling the sensations associated. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. To be able to step away from the incessant thinking mind, to relax and to be settled in the body. In the body breathing, the body sensing, can be a place where we can find some peace. Peace from the incessant thinking. From time to time it might feel like a vacation, like a place of safety. And may it be that all of us find our way to be at ease and safety, resting in our own physical experience in our body. So the body becomes a home, a place of rest and ease. Even if the body is difficult, it's possible to find place within, to be at ease and at peace. May it be that all of us, each individual one of us, and all the people we know and out into the world, may everyone find peace with their body, rest in ease and comfort in their body. May there be a freedom from incessant thinking and reactivity and meaning making, just breathing simply, just being alive is enough. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And on this Valentine's Day, may it be for all of us a metta day. Maybe there's a way that everyone can be our Valentine. Who we look upon with kind regard. May we have metta for all beings. May we have metta for all beings.
