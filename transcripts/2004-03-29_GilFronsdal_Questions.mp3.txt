 It's nice to be back. I've been away for a month teaching a month-long retreat at Spirit Rock and it was really a wonderful thing to have done. It was one of the probably the most satisfying retreats I've done, atop many retreats. Partly because of the great-strength extent because of how profound it was for the participants. There was a wide range of ways in which the retreat had impacted the people who were there. It was a very deep practice on many different fronts. Partly it was because I think I've taught a month-long retreat in February before and Spirit Rock every year does two retreats back to back, one in February and one in March. Some people will stay for both months. This year we had 23 people who stayed over from February to March. There's a lot of continuity and that added to some of the stillness or the depth of the retreat. One of the marvelous things that happens to some human beings when they engage fully, completely in some activity is by the time they finish it they feel kind of emptied. Have you ever had that experience? Well that's how I feel. I just couldn't get myself to think of a topic to give a talk about today. I felt like I just emptied myself. I didn't have anything more to give in terms of giving a talk. So I feel a little bit regretful since you've come here and you're also sitting here quite eager and ready for something to happen. But perhaps you could all leave. Perhaps instead this would be a great time for us to do a session of questions and answers. I'd like to do that periodically and we haven't done it for quite a while and you've had a series of guest speakers and maybe something has come up. It also gives me a chance to kind of get a sense of what's going on for you guys in terms of your practice that I wouldn't have a sense from if I just talked, you know, if I just had a monologue. So would anybody like to ask? You know, one thing I did some years ago, we did this some years ago, many years ago I remember, and I asked for a question and then I asked for another question and then I asked another question. I didn't answer any of the questions and then we spent the whole evening people just asked asking questions and it was really profound. I think people who, anybody remember that? Anybody there that day? That you were there, remember? Wasn't it profound? It was surprisingly profound and there is something really significant in the human being's ability to ask questions. In Zen, they put a big premium on our ability to ask questions that the Dharma unfolds much more strongly and more powerfully as we ask questions as we go along. Rather than thinking the Dharma is something or practice, spiritual practice something that's given to you and then you kind of know the truth or know what to do x, y, and z. It's rather something you discover on your own partly through your questioning, your ability to inquire into what's going on and what's happening. In Zen, they have this idea that every situation you find yourself in has a request of you and then so that your task then is to figure out what that request is. So it's kind of like you go with this question. What is the request of this situation? What's the situation calling forth, asking for? Some Zen people will like to kind of massage any situation with different questions. I mean the question, what it was called for here or what is it to be free in this situation? Where's the compassion in this situation? What is real in this situation here? So to ask questions and the ability to learn how to ask questions, when I studied with one of my first Zen teachers, he had made that very explicit that he didn't want to have a lot of interviews with us until we had reflected a lot on our concerns, until we could kind of distill in our concerns what he called the kernel of the issue and then we bring that kernel of issue, a question to him and say this is what the real issue is and often as we know people ask questions and it's not really the kernel. One of the tricks of the trade of people who receive questions like Dharma teachers who receive questions, I shouldn't give away my tricks right, but it's a very very important one and you can just turn this on yourself, is if someone asks a question that is more philosophical in nature, then to ask in return why do you ask? Why do you ask that? And then often you'll find out oh it's really an expression some very deep concern they have in their life. Someone asks questions, what do Buddhists say about rebirth? Well I could sit here for the next hour and tell you what Buddhists say about rebirth and I'd completely miss that person, why the person's asking the question. You ask the person you know why are you asking that and the person might say oh my parents just died and so they try to grapple and come to terms with their parents dying and that's a whole different conversation then, than if you just take you know treating it as philosophy or metaphysics. So do you have any questions? Yes please. Could I make a request? Yes. Could you repeat the question because a lot of us can't hear from the people who are saying it? It's really good request and people have over the years have tried to hammer this into me and they they usually put a sign in front of me here and repeat the question and it's really embarrassing someone who's a mindfulness teacher but being reminded now I think I'll remember for the rest of the time. Thank you and now I'm accountable. Or people can speak up too. So please ask a question. What's your question? Yes. What's the view and the motivation for meditating? So someone has Naropa on his sweatshirt. I wonder if I'm being tested. Those Tibetans are coming here and they're gonna. Please ask me why, tell me why are you asking? It's a good question and I'd like to ask, find out why. And I realize how important it is to have that. And so that's where I'm asking this question. Great. So his question is what is the right view or what's the right motivation for meditation or what's the motivation for meditation? And he says he grapples with this a lot in his life, in his practice, you know, his right view, what the view, the view is kind of the understanding or the orientation or the attitude by which we meditate and the motivation is the motivation, the intention for motivation. And the answer that comes first off my heart because I feel it's a, you know, for me it's a heartfelt issue, is to feel really happy that you're working with a question and that working with a question and looking at it is something which never ends. To come to final answer to that question of this is the view, this is the motivation, I think is to do it as service, but rather over time that changes. And I've seen in myself that's changed over time and it's been fascinating to track the changes. And so to keep that going as a question, as a concern, and and not, you're kind of always asking that question and coming with new answers and not settling for any answer, I think is really the best way to do it. It reminds me of a famous story of Suzuki Roshi. I think it had to do with Ed Brown asking him a question. And Suzuki Roshi, at some points as Ed Brown was walking away, spoke out and said, the most important thing and Suzuki Roshi had this great timing. So, you know, people always try to get the essence of Zen from him. And so I finally, you know, the most important things, then he paused and Ed Brown just stopped to distract, he was ready to hear. The most important thing is to figure out what the most important thing is. Now, I don't think it was meant as a joke. I think it was also meant as, you know, that question that, as I said, in beginning to ask questions and keep asking, what is it? What is it? Is it is the thing? So what's the right view of the right motivation for meditation? And we have some 80 people here in the hall. Would some people like to offer some views and motivations for meditation? What is it for you today? Or was it been this year? What was it when you started? In my lifetime, I've noticed a tendency toward imbalance, extremes, addictions, all kinds of other issues. And when I first sat in the early 80s, my first long retreat, it wasn't, you know, wasn't all that great. I mean, you know, didn't know what to do, what to expect. It was a big thing that happened. But I noticed a little bit of equanimity after the retreat, very good boss relatively quickly, because there wasn't a song that particular at that time in that community. And now all these years and travels later, I don't really know, you know, if that's my particular motivation. I know it's a side effect of the practice. And I know that I'm kinder to myself and kinder to others as a result of a long period of time. But I don't really expect anything. So I don't know my motivation. So Richard says he doesn't know what his motivation is at some level. And I think probably that goes with the number of people here, probably there is, but it was a time in my practice where I couldn't discern any motivation, but I sat twice a day anyway. I thought it was kind of odd. But it's what I did. And so Richard said that, you know, when he first started sitting, his life was quite imbalanced, going between extremes of various things, addiction and stuff. And he was quite surprised in sitting 24 hours a day in silent retreat, that at the end of the retreat that there was a certain level of equanimity that he found. And that over the many years of practice, he's found that he's become a kinder person from doing the meditation practice. But he doesn't quite know why he does it. That's not the reason he does it, to become kinder. But he notices that it has this effect on him. Are there motivations or understandings of why you meditate? Mark? So there's things between living skillfully and unskillfully. And often for many people, living kind of life as it's kind of presented to us, end up having a lot of unskillful habits and unhealthy habits, I suppose. And then meditation practice is one way to develop healthy or skillful skills, habits that help us in our lives. That's fair enough. And one of the interesting things about using the word skill and unskillful is that, for me, the definition of what skillful and unskillful depends a little bit about what the purpose is, what you want to accomplish. So would you like to offer something else? Kind. So it comes down to being kind, coming from the heart, being present, being alive. And so that which is skillful is that which moves you in that direction. And that which is unskillful moves you away from that. So one motivation for, a series of motivations for practice is to move in that direction with our life, to be kind, present, come from the heart. Yes. So at first meditation was a place to find some security or safety or refuge in the life falling apart. But then she found that there was a place beyond words that understanding came. And it seemed seemingly at the same time there was humor and laughter and smiled more at the things of the world. Yes. So meditation or mindfulness allows him to step back and kind of observe or watch what's going on in a more objective way so he can see where the choice is about how to act, what to live by. And that way hopefully live a wiser life. Yes, Meeta. pro the So meditation provided some kind of peace from or in the middle of all these negative emotions and then as you started meditating then you found this wonderful reciprocal relationship between meditation and the teachings and ethics and various things. The more you meditate the more you want to hear the teachings or learn the teachings. The more you learn the teachings the more you want to meditate. Sounds like it will never end. I'm sitting here tonight doing meditation and I'm just really still thinking of them and I'm thinking, you know, maybe I just need to let others think and say. And then all of a sudden my foot falls asleep, my hip gets a big pain and my knee went crazy and I'm sitting here and I'm just feeling just really mystical. And all of a sudden I just have this compassion and there's things still with all this stuff in mind and knowing I didn't have to do anything. Beautiful. So she had she has three big issues going on in her life which she's asked to make a lot of decisions about. So she came here to sit and she decided that maybe in sitting here she just let go of it and just sit and see what happens and what happened was she was very uncomfortable sitting. And in the discomfort of it there arose all this compassion for herself. And with that compassion came the understanding that she doesn't need to do anything. The wisdom of knowing you don't need to do anything. There is wisdom at the end of the retreat on Saturday I think. There were five teachers leading their retreat and we all got to give our little you know advice for leaving the retreat. It's a big deal to leave a retreat after a month or two of silence. And that was my advice was assume that in many situations you come to over the next days and next week that nothing needs to happen. If there are pauses in the conversation nothing needs to happen. If there's pauses in your day nothing needs to happen. Maybe nothing needs to happen for a while. And there's wisdom that. Are we moving on? We're ready? I mean assume everybody had a motivation for coming here today to meditate. I mean it wasn't you as you walking down the street and someone didn't just push you in. But I guess people are shy so. So are you satisfied enough with you ask great question. Is this good enough for you? Yeah. We can go on. Go ahead please. People think they're going to be off. Eight or nine people and they were fascinating people. But I can math not to do anything but emotionally just kind of write down. I've been just puzzling with this all day trying to kind of figure out how to be with that. Or is this an insider. I'm just not quite sure how to work with that. I think that yeah. How to be alone with others. Yeah. I don't want to pull back. Oh. Well you know sometimes we have to sometimes we just live life too busily and we expect to be able to add a little bit of spirituality on top of an excessively busy life and it'll make it all work just beautifully. And it's possible, no possibility is that no sane person should ever talk as much as you did over the hike. It's not a matter of figuring out a better way to talk. It's figuring out how not to talk a little bit, take breaks. So that's one possibility. And but I think your question is good and to explore that. I think really it's your exploration to explore. How is it when you interact with people? How is it when you talk? Is there desires or expectation? Is there a way in which you listen which is tiring? Is there excessive eagerness in the conversation that is tiring? You know how is it you engage in conversation? And one way to discover that is also to experiment with different ways. So there are eight nine people on the hike. So you might experiment with eight or nine different ways of having conversations and then see which one is more rejuvenating, which is more tiring, rather than just using normal habits of how you talk. Last week, Pam Weiss spoke on, most other things, the word appropriate. And she gave the gloss of the Chinese word as made of three diagrams, meet, each, teach, teaching. Are you familiar with that word? Could you comment more on that idea? Because it is exactly that looking for the question for position and sound. Meet, each, meet, each, and teach. Meet, each, and teach. I didn't know that about the character. And one of the occupational hazards of a teacher who has been teaching for many years is they can talk about anything. So I don't know if that's wise for me to just kind of start talking freely about this topic. But I'll say if you asked. It's been on my mind a little bit today is there's a Zen poem, Chinese Zen poem, that has a line in it that says, it, and here it probably means reality. It responds to the inquiring impulse. So this is inquiring, this questioning of reality, this inquiring and being mindful and being engaged. And what's this? What's this? That there's somehow something is returned to you in that process. It's not just something that simply you're doing in your own personal mind, but somehow reality, the world, other people respond somehow to the inquiring impulse. So meet, each, and teach. If you meet something, then really meet something, meet a situation, meet another person, then there's an opportunity. And appropriate? I don't know how to, I don't know how to weave in appropriate into all that. But she spoke of how to, I think she was talking about beneficence, how to do good. And then one does good things by doing that which is appropriate for the moment. There's no absolute platonic ideal of the good. Did she give the quote of the famous story of the, the monk asked the Zen master who'd been a Zen practitioner for a lifetime, and the monk asked, she gave that story? You know, what's, basically something like, you know, what's your essential teaching and what have you learned? And he responded, an appropriate response. To me that's, that is the story she's talking about. So what's a teaching of a lifetime, appropriate response, a beautiful story. And again, it lends itself to not having some kind of fixed dogma that you fall back on, but rather it's really what's alive right now. It's in the living situation right now where you find the truth, you find how to live, you find how to respond. What's the, what's the request of this situation? And that's always going to be, you know, be unique to the living situation you find yourself in, and to go carry along some old teaching you have, you know, and they may not work. You have to find where the life is in this situation. So they have then also in the Zen tradition, the idea that a person never, a person's practice is never finished. Whereas in the Theravadin tradition, they have an idea that, you know, a person's spiritual practice comes to an end when the greed, when there's no more greed, hate or delusion in the person's psyche. But in the Zen tradition, they don't, they don't posit an end to practice. You might come to a situation where greed, hate and delusion is eliminated in the psyche, but the person still has to live. And every situation you encounter is a new, unique situation. And so you have to bring your mindfulness and your understanding, your compassion to bear to understand how to meet this situation. And that's a practice that never ends because you always come into a new situation. So every situation is an opportunity, a appropriate response. Meet, teach and teach. I think that's great. I was, I've been kind of wondering only in little bits, but for quite a long time. I guess I often feel like particularly in my meditation, that my whole mind and body feels too dense. There's no room for a question. And that sometimes I do manage to ask, how is it that I can cultivate a questioning mind? And so far, I haven't figured out anything to move that along. It's just, it's something that's very important to have this question in mind. The practice often feels kind of flat. So he says that the practice often feels kind of flat. When he sits his mind and body feel kind of dense. And in that kind of dense situation, he doesn't can't quite muster up or find the questioning mind. But the question of mind seems to be very important for him. And the kind of the paradox here is that in asking that question, he's mustered up his questioning mind. So one of the things you can do, if you feel something's getting in the way of some ideal that you have, like wanting to have a mind of questions more fully or more. And what you do is you bring your mindfulness to bear on the obstacle and explore that, question that, what is this? What is this? And the question doesn't have to be more complex than the question, what is this? And so then you go and investigate your the denseness and see what that's what's going on there. See if you can penetrate the denseness, the denseness of the mind, the denseness of the body. And you might be surprised what you find if you penetrate it. I was just wondering about your own practice. Because I know you have a family now. So you know about the theater. So I imagine, I don't know I don't know if you meditate, still meditate two times a day or not. So Helen's asking me if, my own, about my own practice. And now that I have a family with two kids, she can't imagine that maybe I'm, I still meditate twice a day. And so how do I sustain, you know, the benefits that come from meditation? And no, I don't sit twice a day usually. Sometimes I do. What I try to do is sit once a day. And I used to sit very kind of regularly first thing in the morning when I got up. And I still try to do that. This morning I got 20 minutes in before my son ran in and plopped himself down on my lap. And sometimes I get longer, sometimes I get shorter, sometimes I don't get any. But then if I don't sit in the morning or sit very long, then I'll try to do it later in the day when there is some space in the day and get it that way. But if I sit once a day, I'm content with that. And in terms of this, you know, you use the word stillness, the quality of my mind in terms of being still or being active. I know I'd have a higher quality of a mind or higher stillness if I sat more. If I sat all day, it'd be great. But I'm not actually trying to pursue having a still mind as possible. There's a wonderful balance between kind of a balance that's constantly changing where the balance is for me between sitting and meditating and getting the benefits of meditation and then engaging in the world that I live and learning from that. And like Smita said, there's a typical relationship between teaching and meditation. There's a typical relationship between what I learn and what I learn about myself and life as I try to engage in practice in my daily life. And then I bring that to my meditation. And then what happens there, I bring that to my daily life. And so I feel like it's kind of a dynamic system together. And so that's how it is for me. I hope that that was all right with you, not to have a regular talk. I appreciate it a lot, the questions and the comments. It felt rich to me.
