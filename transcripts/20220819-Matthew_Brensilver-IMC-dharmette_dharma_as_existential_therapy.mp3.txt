The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So, uh, yeah, welcome. Good to, uh, good to sit with you.
This is, uh, Bertrand Russell. All the labors of the ages, all the devotions,
all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined
to extinction in the vast death of the solar system and the whole temple of
humanity's achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of the
universe of ruins. Or from the Zen tradition, may I respectfully remind you,
great is the matter of life and death. Life slips quickly by. Time waits for no
one. Wake up. Wake up. Don't waste a moment.
Maybe, maybe it's just our grandiosity that makes life seem like it's no big
deal. I know. Like it's not the freakiest of freak accidents that were even
alive. And so this week I've been, been making the case that there are, there are
many mechanisms of action in the Dharma. Many ways where healed and nudged
towards awakening, started with attention training and said the Dharma's also a
cognitive therapy, an exposure therapy yesterday and today Dharma as existential
therapy. So how, how can we, how can we be adults about our, our existential
situation? Great is this matter of life and death. Now existential psychotherapy
suggests that the failure to deal with four core existential challenges is linked
to a lack of fulfillment or psychological symptoms. These four challenges of death
and meaning and freedom, not in the Buddha sense, but freedom to make of our
life something. And lastly isolation. And these are themes for all of us in one
way or another and maybe sometimes turning away from them or even something
like denial can be adaptive for, for a time. But in the end the chickens come
home to roost. And we want to prepare our heart before it's too late. Dharma is
not, I feel, not necessarily a perfect cure for all of them, but at the least
it's a very deep consolation. It really does help our heart acclimatize to
an itch, an impermanence to groundlessness to the radical openness of
all things. Our heart needs a lot of time to acclimatize to that. And some of
what we're doing as we practice is giving our heart bearable doses of
groundlessness. So death, death, that all that is precious and dear to me is of the
nature to change. I think I, some subconscious level got into Dharma
practice because some part of me knew that I was utterly unprepared for the
task, for that task. Yeah. And there are, you know, there are only those of us who
have grieved and those who, who will grieve. And so in our practice, we
practice being softened rather than hardened by an itch. And in some ways,
every moment of purification, the heart is actually adapting in its own way to
the loss. And the antidote to a bad death is living a valued life. And that's part
of what the Dharma, a Dharma life feels like to me. It's like valued. I value it.
Yalam, the kind of link to existential psychotherapy, says an existential
position holds that the world is contingent, that is, everything that is
could as well have been otherwise, that human beings constitute themselves,
their world and their situation within that world, that there exists no meaning,
no grand design in the universe, no guidelines for living, other than those
the person creates. Whatever meaning we make, we're gonna have to make it. The
Buddha said that the world trembles in all directions. That's the skills
translation, trembles in all directions, groundless, no ultimate foundation for
anything we build. Anything we build, a life, a democracy, a species, even a
civilization, nothing, nothing is guaranteed an existence, nothing exists on
its own, everything owes its existence to many other things. But we must build, we
must still build and build well. Poet Philip Apelman, face-to-face with death, we
realize the meaning of life is inside our lives, not outside them. We cannot
impose on our experience meaningfulness that we have not ourselves built into
it. Our true philosophy of life is whatever we choose to do from moment to
moment. The sum total of our actions at a given time constitutes our philosophy of
life. We're gonna have to spend our freedom, spend our life, what will we make
of our lives. I saw this documentary about Bette Cohen, organized
around the song Hallelujah and he spent some years in Zen Rinzai monastery and
just one line caught me, said something like, sitting in a meditation hall
for four or five hours a day, you kind of get straight with yourself. We get
straight with ourselves and cut through the pettiness and the idealism and the
naive fantasies, what will constitute our philosophy of life. And we come to
appreciate our aloneness, no matter how deeply we sense interconnection or
abide in non-duality, we are in an important sense alone. But how lonely
does it feel to be alone? And the Dharma trains us to get very comfortable
being alone. And being alone reminds us of everything else. So in all these tasks
the Dharma is relevant and may add, you know, one more existential issue to
death and meaning and freedom and isolation. That would be, what do we owe others?
What do we owe others? What do we owe each other? What do the divisions across space
and time mean? Someone on the other side of the globe, someone yet to be born, what
do we owe to them? A lot.
We learn that too. Do the best you can until you know better than when you know
better, do better. It's Maya, right, Angelo? So I will pause there. Yeah, thank
you. Thank you for, for having me and conscious my kind of style just to throw
a lot of stuff your way and so you sift through the value and the rubbish, yeah.
And hope that something's useful. I appreciate, appreciate the opportunity
to be together. Yeah, thanks for, for having me and welcoming your substitute
teacher. I'll be back sometime in September, I think maybe late September.
And yeah, I wish you all a good day and week and all the rest, yeah. Okay, thank
you. You, you be well.
