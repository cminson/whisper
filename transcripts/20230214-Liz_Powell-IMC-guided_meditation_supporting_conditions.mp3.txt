 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Start with, let's maybe do a 30-minute meditation, and taking your time to settle in, recognizing whatever is present, whatever conditions of body, emotions, mind, whatever is coming with you into this meditation, simply aware of it. No need to be for it or against it, simply beginning with, what am I aware of? And taking your time in finding a posture that is supportive for conditions as they are right now. You don't always have to sit or stand or lie in the same position. Sometimes we need to adjust from day to day. So whatever will support awareness while also being easeful enough that you're not fighting the body. Sometimes it's helpful to scan the body in a leisurely way from head to foot, just recognizing any particular prominent sensations that stand out, receiving them, and if there is any tightness or tension to which some ease or some softness can be brought. Perhaps allowing yourself to release a little bit in that area if it's possible. Sometimes it's possible to release with the out breath, taking a normal breath in, and then releasing. And as you scan the body, if there are any areas of tightness that are any condition that cannot be softened, allowing that just as it is, receiving the sensations as they are. And continuing the scan, perhaps the use of the out breath, or the in breath to bring more energy if the body and mind are sluggish or not quite awake yet. Gently, from time to time, very softly, you can bring in the note, what am I aware of now? Receiving experience. It may hang out for a brief flash or it may be here for a while, just receiving whatever is most prominent in the awareness. Recognizing what's here. That can be as simple as feeling it, sensing it. Sometimes it may be accompanied with some word or words. Other times it's just sensation like this, feeling like this. Or activity of the mind like this without needing to fuel any particular thinking, just receiving and recognizing it as another sensation, another occurrence. Allowing the experiencing, the feeling, giving it some space and time. The sensing. No need to check it off and hurry on. Taking your time. What am I aware of? Relaxing if possible, receiving, allowing. Noticing if there are any attitudes present that something should or shouldn't be here. Just noticing that, recognizing it and allowing what is here to be here, to arise and pass in its own time. There's no right or wrong. Simply relaxing, receiving, recognizing, allowing whatever is most obvious. What am I aware of? What am I aware of? What am I aware of? What am I aware of? What am I aware of? What am I aware of?
