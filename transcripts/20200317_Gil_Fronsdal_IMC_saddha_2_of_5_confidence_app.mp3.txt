Saddhā  (2 of 5):  Confidence  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on March 17, 2020  
 
 
I am going to continue with this series of short talks on 
faith,  based on  five aspects of the Pali word saddhā. 
One aspect of this word is translated into English as 
‘faith’ – this is the most common translation. Yesterday I 
talked about the quality  of faith, and today I am going to 
talk about confidence.  
 
Faith is some thing important and that has value  – faith 
supports and guides us. For Buddhists , it’s faith in the 
practice, and this helps make us feel safe in this world 
and to find freedom. Having faith that the practice does 
that becomes increasingly challenging when our life, our 
world , becomes  more  uncertain .  
 
It’s useful to remember the way the Buddha’s own quest 
for enlightenment beg an. He went off to search for 
enlightenment in order to address the fundamental 
human conditions of sickness, old age, and death . What 
he discovered was an answer to t hose concerns. Then 
for many years , he taught a practice that was not simply 
one of coping , stress -reduction, or  having pleasant 
experiences in daily life. The practice was originally 
designed to deal with the fundamental, existential issues and challenges  that we humans have.  
 
To be up against those challenges  in a big way  – death, 
sickness, old age – can be quite a ferocious challenge. 
To have the motivation and strength to do the practice 
in the face of these challenges sometimes takes a lot of 
faith. It takes conviction that , “Yes, this is possible .”  
 
The degree of faith called upon var ies greatly  
depending on the circumstances of  our life. Someone 
whose life is going relatively well might say . “I don’t 
need any faith .” But for someone facing huge 
challenges , it’s not  often  so clear what helps, what the 
path is. Even the Buddhist path can be questioned : 
“Really, it works for this as well? ” To tap into a deep 
faith, conviction, and trust in this path  of practice is 
sometimes necessary so that we can give ourselves 
over to the practice. We trust the practice enough to 
place ourselves solidly on the path of practice  – rather 
than on the path of  collapse or fear. At first, faith or 
belief in the practice – as a way to go forward – may be 
untested.  
 
The second aspect of  saddhā  is confidence. To sit and 
walk the path with confidence is part of the saddhā  that 
supports us. Confidence is different from faith. We can  
have  faith that something is important and useful , but 
that faith can be at a distance.  It’s like we have a 
treasure  and know that we have the treasure, but we don’t actually use the treasure. The confidence of 
saddhā  is what gives us strength to actually engage in 
the practice. We have confidence that it is worthwhile. 
The greater our challenges, the more useful it is to tap 
into our confidence.  
 
Or, if we don’t have enough confidence in ourselves, 
sometimes it’s useful to borrow confidence from other 
people. That is one reason why it’s so useful to meditate 
together with others , or to have dharma friends. In being 
around friends or teachers  who may practice more than 
you, you can be inspired to borrow  – or to be  infused or 
inspired by – their co nfidence. Confidence,  and faith to 
some degree, is contagious. It isn’t just viruses that are 
contagious.  Lots of good qualities can be caught from 
other people also. Our inner life can resonate with other 
people’s confidence, goodness, dedication, and faith.  
 
Sometimes if we don’t have enough confidence 
ourselves, it can be useful to tap into it through other 
people. We do this for the purpose of testing, engaging 
in, and doing the work  of the practice, so that we can  
find out for ourselves that this work s.  
 
Certainly , it is important to have confidence in the 
practice.  And i t’s useful to have confidence in one’s self  
– to have enough confidence to say , “Yes, I can do 
this.” I say “enough  confidence ” carefully. Enough is 
enough. Just enough to be able to do it. It doesn’t have to be heroic  – just enough to get us to the next sitting, to 
engage in the next breath, to show up for t his breath , or 
this moment of mindfulness. Just enough to have some 
conti nuity of practice through the sitting, through the 
days. Then slowly it can build and build. You don’t start 
a marathon by sprinting ; you start a marathon just 
enough to be able to keep going and going.  
 
Having just enough confidence to go along with practice 
and dedicate yourself to it is enough. It’s helpful to h ave 
confidence in one ’s self. Also, sometimes it is helpful to 
practice with others , because other people can have 
confidence in you. As I said yester day, “Other people 
can believe in you.” To feel that other people believe in 
you, and that you can do it can be invaluable when the 
challenges are large : “Yes, you can do it. I value you. I 
appreciate you. I believe in you. I know you can do it. ”  
 
One rea son to meditate together, even if it’s online, is – 
I hope  – that there is a mutual spirit of , “I believe in you. ” 
We value the people we are meditating with . We notice 
them enough that our hearts sing, appreciate and value  
them.  “Yes, you can do it. ” Maybe better  or richer is : 
“Yes, we can do it. ” It isn’t just the individual ; rather,  we 
are doing it together and supporting each other. 
Confidence in practicing. Confidence in oneself.  
 
There’s also confidence in the goal of practice. There is 
a goal to this Buddhist practice. Some people call it a goalless goal , because it’s not so much an attainment of 
something , as it is the shedding of all the obstructions, 
limitations and ways in whi ch we cling and get attached , 
so that  – without those attachments  – we can discover 
an unshakable peace.  We can experience for ourselves 
what it’s like to feel at home, happy, contented, and 
profoundly  at peace. To just be here.  
 
I like the idea of just being here, content with this 
moment  – not the contentment that makes us lethargic 
or complacent. Rather , it is the contentment that keeps 
us open and available for whatever needs to happen in 
the next moment. We’re confident that we can meet 
whatever  comes our way.  
 
For me, it’s the mindfulness practice I learned through 
Buddhism that has given me unshakable confidence 
that I can be mindful , that  I can find my way. If I can be 
mindful, I can be safe. If I can be mindful, I can find the 
appropriate wa y to engage in and respond to whatever 
comes my way.  
 
I hope that th is response is one that contributes to the 
happiness and well -being of everyone, especially during 
this time when so many people feel challenged by the 
dangers of the virus.  
 
Thank you ve ry much for our shared practice together 
this morning, all two hundred  of us. It’s immensely valuable that we can have this experience together.  
 
Tomorrow morning we will sit, and then I will talk about 
the next part of saddhā , which is conviction.  
 
May you all be well and take good care of yourself.
