Dharmette : Deep Letting Go  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by

One of the important  questions that some 
people  face is : “If you really let go deeply, what 
is next? ” What do you do then? Some people 
are afraid that if you let go deeply, there is 
nothing left. You’ll end up being a spiritual blob – 
a couch potato : free, but with no motivation, no 
reason to do anything, no self to do anything , 
nothing to do.   
 
But when we let go fully, we are still left with a 
heart. The heart responds; the heart can have 
wishes. Some people have tried to express what 
the responsive heart is like  when practice goes 
deep, and there is deep letting go . In a sense , 
there is no more con cern about  oneself .  
 
What does the heart want?  
 
I want to read two poems that I think express 
this heart. Both of them are in the form of 
aspirations or intentions . The responsive heart can have an intention. In Zen there is one’s  vow, 
based on the idea of intention. When you let go 
deeply, then you live your life through this vow. 
The vow is your deep  intention. My sense is that  
the vow is not something that is assumed , but 
something that gets expressed  in the heart . 
Here are the two poems of aspiration.  
 
May I be a guar d for those who need 
protection,  
A guide for those on the path,  
A boat, a raft, a bridge for those who wish to 
cross the flood.  
May I be a lamp in the darkness,  
A resting place for the weary,  
A healing medicine for all who are sick , 
A vase of plenty,  
A tree of miracles.  
And for the boundless multitudes of living 
beings , 
May I bring sustenance and awakening , 
Enduring like the earth and sky , 
Until all beings are freed from sorrow  
And all are awakened.  
 
This was written by Shantideva , an Indian 
Buddhist monk in the Mahayana tradition , “May I 
be a guard for those who need protection. ”  
This next poem  is from a very different religious 
tradition. Maybe you will recognize it.  
 
Make me an instrument of your peace.  
Where there is hatred, let me sow love.  
Where there is injury, pardon.  
Where there is doubt, faith.  
Where there is darkness, light.  
Where there is sadness, joy.  
 
O Divine Being,  
Grant that I may not so much seek  
To be consoled as to console,  
To be understood as  to understand,  
To be loved as to love.  
For it is in giving that we receive.  
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned.  
It is in dying that we are born to eternal life.  
 
This is by S aint Francis, a Catholic monk.  
 
The heart’s aspiration is to offer itself : to give , to 
support  others, to respond to the suffering of the 
world. S aint Francis puts it in the context of an 
instrument of your [God’s] peace , as his is  a 
theistic religion . It’s as an instrument of peace, 
of letting go.  Then there is the wonderful mutuality at the end , “In pardoning, we are 
pardoned . In giving , we receive. ” 
 
Some interesting question s for people whose 
practice involves letting go is , “To what degree is 
there something to receive the letting go  – into 
which you can let go ? Do you trust your heart? 
Do you trust what is there? Do you listen to 
what's there? And do you trust it enough that 
you are willing to live your life from that place? ” 
 
My guess is that not a lot of you are interested in 
living the life of S aint Francis  – a life of deep 
letting go and poverty. But both of these monks 
let go in a deep way. It isn’t that you are 
supposed to become a monastic. But is there a 
deep aspiration for you to live by , which is not 
about yourself , but about the world and others?  
 
That aspiration is so deep ly a part of who you 
are. It is not giving up who you are , or a sacrifice 
of yourself to give, and support others. It is who 
you are. It is the opposite of a diminishment. It is 
giving life to who you are in the heart.  
 
May I be a guard for those who need 
protection,  
A guide for those on the path,  A boat, a raft, a bridge for those who wish to 
cross the flood.  
May I be a lamp in the darkness,  
A resting place for the weary,  
A healing medicine for all who are sick,  
A vase of plenty,  
A tree of miracles.  
And for the boundless multitude of living 
beings,  
May I bring sustenance and awakening,  
Enduring like the earth and sky,  
Until all beings are freed from sorrow , 
And all are awakened.  
 
Thank you.
