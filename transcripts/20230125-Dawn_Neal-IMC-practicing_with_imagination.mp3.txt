 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So just a few brief notes about the practice, an invitation that you incorporate these, however makes sense for you today, your mind, your practice. I'm going to talk about relating to thinking, especially imagination in the practice. The Buddha invoked a lot of similes and visualization and imagination, and all of these are forms of thinking, one form or another, used to instruct or guide. Now I'm going to focus in on imagination in particular, because as Gil mentioned on Sunday, sometimes it's considered a little bit of a taboo in the practice or a no-no, and I want to clarify that it's a natural property of the mind. Just like our stomach's secret bile, our brains, our minds secrete thought, and imagination is part of that. So there's no need to be down about it when it happens. For the purposes of practice, it's just helpful to notice that it's arising. It's just like weather or some kind of other natural phenomena. For the purposes of mindfulness meditation, it's helpful to notice when imagining is present and when it's absent. Present or absent. And for the purposes of meditation practice, it's also helpful to notice imagining that takes us further away from the present moment or brings us closer to the present moment. The kind that takes you further away for the purposes of meditating isn't so helpful. But you don't have to be down on yourself about it if it happens. It's just noticing. Just noticing. What's less commonly talked about is that there are forms of imagination that help us be more present to actual embodied experience in the moment. And that is helpful imagination. For example, hearing the sounds outside the center right now, there is a way of allowing that to help the mind feel like it's bigger. In a way, any sound occurring is happening inside awareness. So a little flip of imagination can help awareness feel more spacious because it's incorporating all sounds. More helpful than an internal dialogue about that sound. It shouldn't be happening here. Blah, blah, blah. Another one is when the eyes are closed, noticing the brightness of the eyelids and allowing that to inform a sense of brightness in the body or the heart. And then there's the breath, right? For years now, I found it very helpful to notice the textures of the breath on the nose or the lip or even inside the body. Perhaps inside our bodies as ripples or waves or at the contact point a more textured breath being like burlap, a softer, easeful breath being like silk. These little bits of imagination can help draw us closer in. And then sometimes perception itself can shift as long as it brings you closer to this moment, to clarity, to simplicity. It's helpful, skillful. And when in moments that you might today feel simple, present, settled, it can be beneficial to let go of imagination altogether. Just coast on the moment. Appreciate the changing nature of your experience. Some. Allowing imagination, working with imagination today, if that feels like a fit with your practice, please enjoy your walking meditation.
