 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Go. Okay. Okay. All right. So hello. Hello, everyone. Lovely to be with you. Welcome. If you're new, welcome. If you're an old-timer, welcome. If you're returning after a while, lovely to be in this space and time together. And also welcome to folks on YouTube who are joining us because this is live streamed also. So. So. So. Practicing. Practicing kindness, practicing loving kindness, practicing neta and the other Brahma viharas, the other practices of the heart. So the theme I'd like to bring in today is this realization, is this realization that when we practice, when we treat ourselves, others, and also what arises in our heart, in our mind, emotions, maybe even challenging emotions, fear, anxiety, etc. When we treat everything with gentleness, with kindness, instead of pushing them away, instead of being aversive towards them, hating them. If we share kindness, if we share metta, if our attitude is one of metta, then, then it feels like the world is responding to us with metta. Because we form our own perceptions, we form our own world, the world that we live in. It's similar to when, say, someone is angry or, or, or upset and goes through the world feeling upset and angry at everyone and they, they feel that everybody's angry at them. This is a very hostile world. So creating our own reality with not with all of our actions, quote unquote actions. And in Buddhism, this is fun, actions also refer to actions of the mind. So thoughts are actions of the mind. Speech is actions of speech and of course actions in the world, what you do, but your thoughts, the way you think, the way you react, the way you frame something or reframe something, they're all actions, actions of the mind, the mind door in Buddhism. So, so however we act, quote unquote, act again, actions of the mind, however we act in the world, for every action, there is a reaction, right? There is a sense of how we, if we are spreading, if we perceive, if we are sending or sharing or have the perspective of, of aversion, anger, fear, anxiety, all of that. And of course that's how we perceive the world to be. We perceive the world to be a very unsafe and unfriendly place. Whereas with Metta it, we, we live in a world in, in our, we perceive a world that is kinder because we are being kinder to ourselves first and foremost and kinder to others. One last thing I want to say to set the frame today is the story of why the Buddha or how the Buddha started to teach Metta. Many of you may know this story, but I like to bring it again tonight. So it is said that a group of monks were sent by the Buddha to a forest to practice diligently on their own. And the tree spirits were very upset to have their peace intruded upon by these monks. So they scared the monks away and they created ghastly images and, and smells and the monks were terrified. So the monks run back to the Buddha and say, Oh Buddha, please send us anywhere, but not that forest. It's a scary, scary place, trembling. And the Buddha, the sense of humor, he says, well, actually I'm going to send you back to the very same forest, but I'm going to give you the only protection you need. And that's when he taught them. The story goes, Metta, the practice of Metta, sharing, loving kindness, good will. So they trusted the Buddha, they came back, the monks came back to the forest and practiced diligently, loving kindness, good will, kindness for the tree spirits. And the story goes that the tree spirits after a while, they decided they actually liked the monks. They started to care for them, protect them, and they lived happily ever after. So, so whether you take this story to be an archetype, the point here as an archetype, the Metta as an antidote to fear, Metta as an antidote to fear the perceptions. And also you can think of an, the archetype of the story is that the monks in their mind, they were creating the sense of lack of safety. They're afraid this world is a dangerous place. Oh, this forest is awful, terrible. Gosh, this is awful. And then they come back with a sense of Metta, where the tree spirits, whether or not they exist, but just sense of Metta and kindness and good will fills their heart and they feel happy and practice happily. So, so we are not so different from those monks. So I think I have set enough of a frame for our practice today. So I'd like to invite us all to settle, settle in our chair, arrive in our seat. And whether you're sitting, standing, lying down, turning your gaze inward to this body and inviting it to relax, inviting it to soften when the body relaxes, the mind can relax. Can you invite this relaxation in the body into stillness, not moving, not moving as an act of kindness to yourself to invite yourself to be still. When the body is still, the mind can be still. The body keeps moving. The mind keeps moving. Turning the gaze inward and connecting with the breath in the abdomen, sense of refuge and kindness and goodwill. You know whether your body is tired or sleepy or anxious, how ever it is. Can you open up wholeheartedly to this body however it is right now? Offer safety and kindness. Oh dear body, relax. It's okay. It's all right. Just be breathed. This coming to practice together for your own sake and the sake of others is an act of kindness in the space of practice. Every breath is an act of kindness. Taking refuge, calming, settling, connecting with your intention, a cultivating goodness. I'm going to start to rise. Can we meet them with kindness, not with judgment? Same way that say beloved little puppy has started to wander away. You notice it's playing in another field. You don't kick it. You be kind, gentle, you laugh with goodwill. Oh sweetie, it's okay. It's all right. Come back here and settle. Come back, settle on my lap where I can pit you. Let there be the same sense of kindness, gentleness to your thoughts, to your heart, your emotions. Even if they're challenging ones, your body and your mind, can you offer them safety? Invite them to sit on your lap so you can pit them. It's okay, fear. It's all right, anxiety. It's okay. You're just doing your thing. Hello backache. Thank you. If judgments arise or doubt arises, am I doing this right? Is this the right way? This is correct. Invite the judgment or the doubt also to come. Sit on your lap and be petted. It's all right, dear. It's okay, come. It's all right, offering it safety. Non-judgment. Kindness. Letting your body, your heart be relaxed. Letting your body be relaxed. Whatever arises, treated with kindness. If nothing is arising, it's just the breath, just quiet. Impute the breath with kindness. Each breath, breathing in kindness, breathing out kindness. Simple. No need to make it complicated. You You You You You You You You Let there be an attitude, an attitude, a perspective of goodwill, the actions of your mind, your heart. As much as possible, even towards what is difficult, even if you have aversion towards something, can you be okay? Allow. Offer grandmotherly patience and kindness, even to the aversion. Say when the child is cranky and upset or crying, the wiser old your grandma doesn't become perturbed but understands that the kid is tired maybe, or is hungry, or is hungry. As patience, there is love, knowing the causes and conditions of giving rise to this. So let there be grandmotherly mind. You may not know, you don't need to know all the causes and conditions. What's arising in your heart, in your mind, in your body. But you can have kindness. Grandmotherly mind. Towards whatever is arising. And whenever you're ready, let there be a sense of expansiveness. In your heart, your body, expanding, this grandmotherly perspective, pervading all around you, permeating through your life, all the aspects of your life. Kindness, patience, goodwill, all the people in your life. Sharing your grandmotherly mitta, grandmotherly mind, goodwill of it with them. Whatever comes to mind is welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And if thoughts are arising, can we be kind to everything, everything? And as we bring this practice period to a close, can we offer kindness, safety, grandmotherly mind to whatever arose, whatever arose or did not arise, no judgment, no judgment. We showed up. We showed up as well as we were able to. And offering generously this goodness, trusting there is goodness here, cultivated within ourselves, there is goodness, offering it to all beings everywhere, may all beings everywhere know their own goodness, may all beings everywhere, including ourselves, be happy and free. Thank you all. Thank you for your practice. So we have some time for reflections. If there are any questions, comments, complaints, maybe there are aha moments or anything, you can raise your hand or you can type in chat. If you type to everyone in chat, I'll read your name. And if it's just type to me, I'll be private. So what came up for you? What happened? Hello Lars on YouTube from Sweden. It's very early morning for you. Anything that shifted for you, anything that you noticed, perhaps, especially with the grandmotherly mind? Was it easy to offer grandmotherly mind? Did things shift? Private chat, may all beings everywhere know their own goodness, lovely, reframes the situation. Thank you. Jerry. So it was difficult initially to have a relationship with the grandmother. And then it's interesting how a word that my grandmother was, had many children and even more grandchildren. I remember close to 30 and so grandchildren. So I was one of them. And the younger ones, much older ones for some of them could be my parents. But she had a term that she used and it was pet. And I would ask something, oh pet, do you want some juicy fruit gotten? And so that word pet, just like, oh, there it is. And I never thought of that word in many years. And it was like, oh, that's warm. That's kindness. You don't have to, whatever else comes after that. So it just, it was a click of a switch. But until then, it was seemingly, I guess, a little bit academic. But I got that word and I thought, okay, I'm here. So I hope that helps others. Oh, that's very sweet, Jerry. It brightens my heart and helps me connect. That's so sweet. Oh, hello pet. You know, just so sweet. Just one word has so much kindness in it. That's very sweet. Thank you. That's lovely. Thanks for sharing that. Katrin, please. Thank you, for sharing that with us. I was having a. In daily life practice because I wanted to be meditating outside and some grass and. There were people were loud, everything like, and it, it just felt like, oh, this day has been so hard already. And I just wanted to meditate on the grass and now there's these people. And I was really mad at everyone and mad at myself and. Just feeling so bad. I was like, I, I'm ruining my one chance to get calm. And of the day. And on my way home. So I was the kind of hustling home to like, I was like, I don't even want to be inside, but I'll go meditate. And this, I was passing a neighbor and the neighbor smile, like smiling waved and. I just stopped and I like took out my AirPods and I asked her about her tomatoes. And she was like, they're actually this guy's tomatoes. And then he came out with his 10, like 18 month old and the mom. And suddenly we were all having this really sweet conversation about tomatoes. Like three generations of humans just connecting. And then. And the rest of that felt so good. And then. And the rest of that walk, everything changed, like everything that had been like. And then the moment that I was in the dark and like Icky just suddenly like opened up and felt so beautiful. And transformed everything. And it was that choice, the choice that I, it was a hard choice for me to make to stop. And just say something kind to her and then allow that moment to open and to receive the sweetness. Of the, of the connection. And I, I do the practice, but I did a different practice and I wouldn't have been able to do it without the teachings in my ears. So thank you. Thank you, Catherine. That is so beautiful. Oh, what beautiful practice you did in this session. Thank you. That's so gorgeous. It's met time. So in all of its beauty and it's the jewel, it's the jewel of the mind. And I took the action of the mind to saying something nice, opening up the perception, right? The perception is the same evening, same walking home, same everything. The perception just shifted. Like. It's just one moment. Oh, that's so beautiful. Thank you. That's great practice. Love it. Gene, please. Thank you. Thank you. I felt like your guidance was helping me. Maybe start to build a muscle that I don't have already. And I was kind of channel channeling my. Kindergarten teacher. He used to hold me in her lap and rock me. And I've been dealing with, you know, trying to deal with chronic pain and a lot of fear around that and kind of, you know, I'm really happy to be able to have that kind of. Grief and remorse. And it's really hard. You know, I, I definitely resist it. So I think this was a good kind of first step, but it really does feel like a capacity I have to build, but I'm not sure I would have had the. Courage or opportunity without that beautiful guided meditation. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. I think there's this possibility of, oh yeah, here. And there's this memory of this kindness of this teacher and the visceral, the feeling, the physical feeling of being rocked on their lap. That what a gift that you remember that. And you have that available to you to, to reach into and support yourself with that. And just the kindness, just that level of gentle kindness. And I think that's, you know, really with, you know, meta is not so much a hammer, like, oh, may you be happy. Maybe. Oh, sweetheart rocking gently. So that's exactly a gene. I applaud you recognizing that. And, and opening up to it more and more. Thank you. Lovely. Yeah. So a couple more reflections. Let's see. Jennifer says very, very peaceful for me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And the next one is, and it is reminded of the vase that Kwan Yin carries. It is said that the jar contains. And never ending supply of compassion. Yeah. Thank you. Who says Michelle Lou for that reminder about Kwan. One more respect. One more reflection privately fits with Diana's guidance from last night. May this uncomfortableness be held with kindness and ease. Yes. Oh, lovely. Beautiful. And I'm going to put my hat on YouTube, a nice smooth quiet session this evening after an active day. Thanks. Nikki. You're so welcome. Yeah. Quiet tonight. Yeah. Quiet, very peaceful. Just, just gentle. It was a gentle rocking of the breath. One more reflection privately at work today. I had a difficult conversation with an old friend and was still feeling the effects. I was able to release it during the meditation. Thank you. Beautiful. Yeah. Powerful. Powerful to have this. The space of gentleness so that challenges can be released. Can. And soften. So. So dear community with the same gentleness with the same grandmotherly mind. We're all invited to, uh, to join each other in small groups of roughly size three. And, um, the invitation is to share one thing about how this practice was for you. And, um, then the next person will say something and then the next person will say something and I'll come back to you. Just one nugget. And again, from your own experience, not asking, not directing, not managing the group, just showing up how you are, just offering what you have, if you wish to, with, uh, to be held witness. And you can also offer silence when it comes your turn and say, I pass right now. I'm just holding a passionate space for everyone that that's okay. You might change your mind and the next future rounds. So take care of yourselves, take care of each other and really enjoy, take advantage of the support of space. It's beautiful community that this is going to open the rooms and you can join up here. Okay. The rooms are closed. Everybody's back and I see some smiles, which is wonderful. It's always nice to see smiles when you come back from the room. So, so we are at time. We have lots of wonderful practice reports before we went into the room. So we'll, we'll close now together and appreciating the time that you have all spent cultivating kindness and grandmotherly mind, gently, gently, gently, uh, with all the memories that have popped off for you. I love couple that people share it, the word pet and the being rocked on one's knees. Very sweet. So thank you all. Thank you for your practice for being here, cultivating your heart. The benefit of all beings may all beings be happy. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Thanks everyone.
