 It's good to see you all here. Tonight we're going to talk about the Brahma Vahara's. How many of you are new meditators? By that I mean like less than a year. Okay so the reason I ask that is to know you know where to kind of hear my talk about the Brahma Vahara's. So the Brahma Vahara's are called the divine abodes. So it's it's Pali meaning divine abode and they're really attitudes. They're ways of being and so they have to do primarily with how we present ourselves both to ourselves and to others and I like to think of them as kindness, kindness practices. Now that you've been practicing meditation for a while, mindfulness, you're probably noticing things that come up for you all the time. Ways that seem to be the way you feel about yourself right? Sometimes when I sit I notice that all I can think about is judgment. Self-judgment Oh why did I do that? I should have done something different. Oh if I was only better why can't I be a little more equanimous? How come I always react that way? And so there are all these states of mind that come up when we're sitting that have to do with the ways that we look at ourselves. So tonight we're going to spend some time talking about how to influence those mind states. So you know the thoughts come and go. We don't have to react in a certain way but we tend to have habitual patterns and so maybe there are ways that we can influence what comes up in our minds and the way that we're going to talk about doing that is really through the use of mindfulness. So the Brahma Vahara practices are practices that soften the heart but strengthen the mind and that's why they're interesting to practice. We're not going to talk too much about the different practices we're going to just talk about what they are and what their values to us are and and how we might use them. So an abode is a house right? It's a place to be, a place to stand and all of these things have to do with where we are. They're called divine abodes because they represent an ideal. Something that there's an ideal way of interacting with ourselves and with others. I want to start with a poem you may have read before or heard before but it seems particularly applicable to what we're going to talk about. It's called Kindness by Naomi Shehab Nye. Before you know what kindness really is you must lose things. Feel the future dissolve in a moment like salt and a weakened broth. What you held in your hand, what you counted and carefully saved, all this must go so you know how desolate the landscape can be between the regions of kindness. How you ride and ride thinking the bus will never stop, the passengers eating maize and chicken will stare out the window forever. Before you learn the tender gravity of kindness you must travel where the Indian in a white poncho lies dead by the side of a road. You must see how this could be you. How he too was someone who journeyed through the night with plans and the simple breath that kept him alive. Before you know kindness as the deepest thing inside you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing. You must wake up with sorrow, you must speak to it till your voice catches the thread of all sorrows and you see the size of the cloth. Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore and sends you out into the day to mail letters and purchase bread, only kindness that raises its head from the crowd of the world to say it is I you have been looking for and then goes with you everywhere like a shadow or a friend. Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore then it goes with you everywhere like a shadow or a friend. That's the idea of the Brahma Vahara's practices that help us to adopt this way as being our natural state, our natural abode, our place of standing. So there are four Brahma Vahara's. They are metta or loving kindness. This has to do with loving kindness displayed toward the people around you and yourself. The second is karuna, compassion. This has to do with a special kindness shown to those who suffer which includes ourselves. Mudita which is sympathetic joy. This has to do with celebrating the good fortune of others without envy. The fourth is upeka or equanimity. This has to do with balance and it's basically being able to accept what is. Those are the four. Loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity. They deal primarily with relationship. They're not in isolation. It's the way that we are with ourselves and with others. It has to do with being fully present and facing whatever our fears are because until we recognize those fears we can't be kind to ourselves. We don't even know what we're being kind about. So when we meet someone we don't like, what happens? There are things that come into our minds. How do we interact with people that we don't like? Do we avoid them? Do we push them away? What's the style that we have? Suppose someone does something to us that's really hurtful. What do we do then? How does it feel when someone treats you in a way that is truly unfair? What happens inside of you? How does that feel in your mind, in your heart? Can our heart stay open when someone is hurtful to us? What does that mean to stay open when someone's hurtful to us? It doesn't mean that we need to condone something that is unwholesome. It doesn't mean that we have to stand in place and let someone hit us in the head. It only means that we have to control the way that we react to them. The path of kindness is about controlling our reactivity to what happens so that we have some freedom in what happens and we don't just react. Do we have a bent? I have a bent toward judgment. I wouldn't even ask the question. I tend to be very judgmental and so it's something I have to work with a lot. I notice myself making judgments as opposed to discernment. You know it's where you you a judgment is I say this is good or bad. A discernment is it's different and I choose between those differences. That makes any sense to you. Sometimes we can get stuck on self-judgment. Oh why did I do that? That you should have seen me the other day I got a speeding ticket. Ouch! I felt so stupid. Then I thought it was just a speeding ticket. You know I have to pay the ticket. I could also spend a lot of time beating myself up about it but that's just making it more expensive. So what do you do when you see someone begging in the street? Now this person is a little unsavory and maybe you're a little afraid of them. How do you feel? Are you scared? Are you fearful? Are you angry? What's this person doing here? Do you feel guilty? These are all ways we have to know what these feelings are in order to be able to discern other ways of being. They're all common reactions but they are just that. They are reactions. A lot of the mental tendencies that we have are really rooted and are not being kind to ourselves or to others. Are not understanding what's really happening. I remember talking to Paul Haller one time. He's the Abbot of San Francisco Zen Center and I had just come out of a meeting where everyone was pretty much beating up on me because I had done something that some people felt was unfair. I didn't invite them to an event I didn't know they wanted to go to and I said oh that's just horrible people are beating up on me. I wish I'd never done that and he said you know I think it's a good idea to make it a fair fight. Don't beat up on yourself. Let them do it. I thought you know that's pretty interesting. Not a bad suggestion. There's no point in adding to that grief and suffering. So is it possible to train our minds to be otherwise than reactionary and how can we train our minds to be more kind? What we want to do is get to the point where the practices of loving kindness and compassion and sympathetic joy and equanimity arise spontaneously. So it doesn't become a case of I should be doing this or we criticize ourselves because we're not doing this but they just arise as a natural condition of having gotten used to it where it becomes our mind habit. So that's what we want to do is develop a mind habit that allows those things to arise naturally when we're in a particular situation. So I'll give you an example of something that happened to me recently. There was and this is coming up in several ways I have to admit it's really writing on my mind so there was an event that occurred and I wrote a letter saying this is the way we feel. We want this to be there was a group that I belong to and the group had become very fractious and people were arguing with each other it didn't matter always there was an argument and it became so unpleasant to be in this environment where there was just always an argument that those of us who were responsible for the group getting together wrote a letter and said we want to have a place where kindness is the environment that we operate in and that's not what's happening here. So we understand that there are different ways of interacting and you're welcome to take this and go elsewhere with it but here we're going to treat each other kindly. Well so the letter went out over my signature and a woman came up and she told me how much she hated this letter she was really angry about this letter and I could feel the resentment rising in me and the energy was rising and I was getting ready to defend myself and say see see see see and instead what happened is I thought well she probably is feeling very threatened and so I stopped and I said was there anything in the letter that you thought was good and she said well there probably was but I just disagree with the letter but at the time we got into that place I no longer was in that place where I was ready to go out and do battle you know the adrenaline had kind of gone down and I just let it pass it turned out it didn't didn't have to argue with her and I didn't have to defend myself. So what's happening in this is it started both with mindfulness and with an intention. So first I had to notice that I was getting riled and that I was about to lash out and do whatever was going to come next but also I had the intention of not I had the intention of being kind that's what the letter was about it was this is how we want to react so if I'm going to then immediately jump into arguing with her then you know I've lost my case so that's what we're talking about is trying to do that and the way that we do that the way that we get to the point where that becomes spontaneous is that's where we put our minds we think about how we're going to behave we have to know how we're behaving now we have to know what it feels like to be kind we have to know what it feels like when we're not being kind. The Buddha said what a person considers and reflects upon for a long time to that his mind will bend and incline so unless we know we're never going to be that way there's a there's a way of being there's a philosopher who said a good way of adopting new characteristics is to pretend you have them and what happens is you tend to develop them it's quite remarkable so let's talk about these four the first is meta or loving kindness this is wishing well for ourselves or for others it's really simple wishing well it's possible to be angry with someone and still wish them well but it's not necessarily easy and it has a lot to do with accepting ourselves kindness to ourselves has a lot to do with accepting ourselves it has to be motivated this loving kindness this wishing well for others has to be motivated by something within us that wants to be by a favorable intention it can't be motivated motivated by fear or aversion I'll give you some examples of those in a moment meta has been likened to a soft rain that penetrates the heart and softens it relaxing our defense mechanisms you know that's what it is those defense mechanisms that get us going it's been combined it's been compared to the relationship between a mother and her child when a mother first bonds with her child she'll do anything for that child wishes that child everything in the world that is the most wonderful that's the feeling of loving kindness we're gonna do a practice around that in a little while but I think I'm gonna leave it for a moment when I talk about loving kindness it's not a mushy feeling good thing it has a lot of energy and strength today I was talking to a woman whose brother in law has developed cancer and her husband who is the older brother is really distraught because he can't seem to convince his brother to do certain things so his brother has a suffageal cancer and he smoked all his life so he wants him to not smoke and eat well and he's giving him all of these instructions and he can't understand why his brother doesn't accept his health he keeps saying leave me alone go away I don't want to hear from you and I said you know what his brother wants is for his brother to say to him I'm here for you no matter what an important part of loving kindness is the fact of being unconditional it can't be I'm going to give you love if you love me back I'm going to give you love if I tell you if you do what I tell you to do I'm going to give you love if I get my outcome it has to be totally unconditional I love you even if you disagree with everything I said right it's that feeling of acceptance to the other person when I first started practicing meditation I actually began with loving kindness meditation that's kind of the luck of the draw at the time but I was very I was very depressed very seriously depressed and I sat and what in the practice of loving kindness meditation what you do is you wish well for yourself and for others you say a series of phrases and you repeat them over and over again and you always start with yourself so that's what I was doing I was wishing myself well so I would sit for an hour and just say these phrases to myself over and over again I never actually got past myself I was so needy I kept saying there's got to be something and it felt it felt specious you know it felt like there was something wrong with it but I just kept doing it doing it and doing it and then one day I was completely overwhelmed just completely overwhelmed everything changed and what happened is I realized I had done the best I could do that all these things I was beating myself up about word ways that I was trying to convince myself I needed to be but that I actually was doing the best I could do and I started crying and I was crying because this practice of continually wishing myself well cause me to really develop a compassionate care for myself I really cared for myself and that was such a beautiful thing to realize I cared about myself I could stop beating up on me and it was unconditional it was accepting who I was that's a very important part of it so we wish well for others we wish well for ourselves and it has to do with really accepting the way things are now each of these each of these qualities has a near enemy and a far enemy so loving kindness is wishing well the near enemy of loving kindness is selfish affection that has to do with something that has hooks connected to it you know that's the I love you if you love me back I love you I'm going to offer this to you if I get what I want so that's the unconditional part of the near enemy is selfish holding on clinging kind of loving kindness the far enemy is ill will that's where we actually wish ill will like oh I hope you trip over that right and we've all had those feelings right that that is the opposite of of loving kindness where we actually wish something bad to happen there are lots of ways that for that to happen it can be a cutting comment it can be a put down I've I've known some some perfect squelches I've wanted to use you know I have exactly the right thing but it's not where my heart wants to go the second quality of kindness is corona or compassion empathy compassion so this has to do with accepting the seeing the suffering of others and wanting wishing to help relieve the suffering of others that's compassion the first thing we have to do with compassion is actually allow it into our experience so compassion is not saying oh that thing over there is really bad I feel really bad about it no it's that thing right here next to me where we put ourselves into that very experience compassion is spoken of as a quivering in the heart you can literally feel it you know there's like a kind of movement in your chest and you're thinking it has to be distinguished from sadness and grief I'm going to talk about that in a minute it's really a sense of interconnectedness of mercy compassion has to do with not having separation between you and the other but really a unity it means willing to bear the burdens of another you can't bear them if you're pushing them off to the side they have to be part of you it's listening listening for the cries of help and being available for them the near enemy to commit compassion is pity now the thing about pity is that it really has a feeling of superiority to it now when you're when you feel pity so towards someone you say oh that poor person but they're really separate from me has nothing to do with me that's them over there there's a distancing that helps that happens and it's as if we're trying to protect ourselves from it when we see when we use some efforts for compassion that have pieces of pity in it we're kind of implying somehow that there's there's something wrong about the other person I'm going to help you because you can't help yourself as opposed to I'm going to help you because you could be me not thank God thank God this hasn't happened to me it's this could be me it's just a shade difference and the difference has to do with the energy that is involved right so there's an energy in all of this it's not passive there's real engagement one of the things that we do in hospice is we make a big point of the fact that sometimes it's not so important what you do as it is that you show up that you're there that you witness what's happening that you're right there with the person accompanying them it's a very important point we had one of the things we do is we celebrate people's birthdays this is a residential hospice at Laguna Honda in the city and we always celebrate people's birthdays so this particular day was Henry's birthday and Henry was a schizophrenic and alcoholic and I don't even know what his illness was I've kind of gotten so that I don't don't pay much attention to that anymore but he one of the conditions that he had was that his head was sort of bent over forward like this so you couldn't actually look him in the eye by looking straight at him he had to kind of look under to look at him and he drool once in a while that he was a really sweet man really sweet man so it was his birthday and he was sitting there and there was somebody new who had organized the birthday and she had a list of things that had to be done you know put out the cake open the present do all these things so everyone had gathered in the common room and he was sitting there sort of playing with his cake and he was it was really great he had red frosting and he ended up with red frosting all over himself and he loved it just loved it well this person said well open his card open his card so I opened the car and then she said open his present open his present and one of the other residents said let him open his own present he can open his present and I realized that by helping him we were actually denying him his own experience it didn't have anything to do with compassion was totally different what happened is he finally did open his own present and everybody left and he was still there eating his cake you know he was having a party everybody else was doing something else he was quite beautiful compassion arises in the spirit of namaste you've seen people putting their hands together bowing and saying namaste namaste means I bow to the me in you it's that recognition so compassion is that connection that dealing with suffering because it is my suffering not just your suffering it's my stuff I have another another poem I'm going to read just because I absolutely love this poem and of course my sticky has fallen off wouldn't you know it here it is this is called the same inside it's by Anna swear walking to your place for a love feast I saw at a street corner an old beggar woman I took her hand kissed her delicate cheek we talked she was the same inside as I am from the same kind I sensed this instantly as a dog knows by scent another dog I gave her money I could not part from her after all one needs someone who is so close and then I no longer knew why I was walking to your place because it's so beautiful it says having met this woman once I really let her into me I was totally in love with her she was no longer the old beggar woman on the street one of the things I mentioned before is that sorrow and grief are not what compassion is so in addition to pity as a near enemy sorrow and grief are near enemies also the thing about sorrow and grief is they tend to be kind of depressive right when you see suffering and you become depressed you're sort of entering into the suffering and it's sort of taking you over it's a very downward feeling whereas compassion has energy to it the other night this group that I told you about we finally dissolved the group and I was sad about it because I had started the group and there were some other people who were really being helped and they were sad and they'd been crying I went home and I was sitting in my chair and I could just feel these waves of sorrow just my whole body would kind of vibrate in these little tiny movements of sorrow and I thought wow this is really an overreaction which is what it was it was an overreaction but it still it was real you know I was sitting there with the sorrow and then I got an email from my colleague who had outlined this four-step program we were going to do this and we're going to do this we're going to take care of them this way and we and I went oh I wrote him a response and I said let's slow down and nothing has to happen immediately and all of a sudden the act of saying this is what needs to be done brought my equilibrium back and I was no longer overcome and overwhelmed by that sadness I was able to be compassionate about it concerned about these people without having it dragged me down and and you know sort of bury me into the feeling of the emotion of it because it takes a certain amount of buoyancy and energy to carry out the compassion compassion spar enemy is cruelty and we all pretty much know what that is cruelty is totally devoid of mercy it's the force present in all forms of intolerance we can't see ourselves in the other person and so we can't show them mercy the third quality of kindness is moody tah sympathetic joy and I actually love this one I love moody tah it's a very fun thing to work with sympathetic joy has to do with really rejoicing in someone else's good fortune first of all I like rejoicing and it's nice to have an excuse why not I don't care whose it is we can rejoice in it anyway if it's the near enemy of moody tah is exuberance now exuberance is a little different because it's kind of an overreaction and there's a certain desperation about it oh boy I'm so glad you won the lottery but there's something strained about it you know the far enemy of moody tah is resentment envy jealousy I can't rejoice in your good fortune because bad things keep happening to me it involves the comparing mind and we get lost in that comparing mind another way this happens is that people will dampen a victory by pointing out that the competition was weak right and I started putting a putting a damper on someone else's joy that's also part of the resentment the far enemy of sympathetic joy there's this house in the region where I live up by Point Reyes National Seashore it's a really beautiful place to live and we have a lovely house you know sitting there but down the road from us is this magnificent house and it has out buildings you know it has it has slate carved slate decorations on the outside of the house it has cherry wood inside it's a magnificent place it's truly gorgeous and when we first moved there you know we noticed this house and said wow and we started referring to it as the envy house and so I was thinking about that so I said you know we really ought to call it the moody tahouse and my husband said moody tahouse I said yeah you know let's just rejoice that they had this house and so we started doing that we just started calling it the moody tahouse and you know we've gotten to the point now where when we walk by this house we have to introduce all our friends to this house it's like we own this house is our moody tahouse it's really wonderful we get a lot of joy out of this house God knows I don't want the house but there's that that initial sort of craving oh that's so beautiful you know I really like that but what we've discovered by just calling it our moody tahouse is that we don't have to have it and we can still enjoy it and that's the spirit of moody tah you know sympathetic joy oh this is wonderful how wonderful the fourth quality is you Pekka mental equilibrium balance and you Pekka actually it's translated it's kind of it's discerning discerning rightly viewing justly there's a certain accuracy about it it's an unshakable balance of mind unshakable balance you can hit my hand it comes right to the same place that's equanimity whatever comes to be able to hold whatever comes it's really about acceptance it's about not reacting it's about being with what is it's a very spacious place equanimity because you're not putting yourselves into little narrow channels I have to do this I have to do this I can't do that it's a very spacious place and it has to do with being able to accept all the changes that keep coming in life being in balance is actually a very important part of kindness because it doesn't have to do with doing the impossible it just has to do with seeing what is true seeing what is true and saying ah this is what's true being able to hold that it's seeing with understanding so you're not pushing it away you're not pulling it to yourself you're just saying this is what's happening the near enemy of equanimity is in dear indifference okay you know what when you start noticing what's going on in your life you find that there are things that you like things that you don't like and things that you're neutral about so indifference is a little different than neutral indifference is has a feeling of aversion to it indifference says I don't care about it which there's a charge there the far enemy of equanimity is craving I want to change this I hurt I've got to change it I don't like this I've got to change it it's working in the world where you realize that there are things that come and go and sometimes you like them and sometimes you don't like them and we all have preferences so it's living in that world where the the eight worldly wins praise and blame success and failure pleasure and pain fame and disrepute all of these things exist all the time equanimity says that we can hold these as they come up because we realize they change there it's not static they come and go that is humans we tend to attach to those things that are pleasant and push away those things that are unpleasant and the equanimous person sort of holds all of it and says ah ah ajahn cha talks about equanimity and he says he says the way to cultivate equanimity is to learn to let go so if we let go a little we have a little piece if we let go a lot we have a lot of peace if we let go completely we have complete peace kind of scary isn't it but basically equanimity says no matter how I might wish things to be this is how they are it doesn't mean we don't care about how they are it just means that we recognize it and so we're not buffeted by the changes that occur in life so I had another story but I think I'm gonna leave it here let me just summarize what this is so we have metta loving kindness which embraces all beings coruna compassion which embraces the sufferings of others mudita sympathetic joy which in brief embraces others prosperity and good fortune and upecca equanimity which embraces the good and the bad the hot and cold the loved and the unloved the pleasant the unpleasant so those are the the practices those are the feelings that we want to engender to be able to live in the world where things are kind where that's what comes from us upecca equanimity so what I'd like to do is I'd like to end with a little loving kindness practice but I want to open this up to any questions or comments that people might have question about the second one the compassion I'm kind of thinking it through your talking but what if a person tends to take that to an extreme not practicing metta for oneself so are you you at the end you're saying you're supposed to balance all these four practices so that you're giving that compassion to yourself as well as to others yeah I can give you an example of that actually last week I was I was with it the cancer help program and we had a retreat going and a friend of mine who was from the Sangha died in over Thanksgiving and there was a memorial here for her last Tuesday and I was doing this retreat up in Marin and I left there and I was driving down it's about an hour and a half down here and and as I was driving down I was thinking oh why am I doing this this is really crazy it's just a memorial service and you know I've got this other thing and I'm gonna have to drive back and be back there tonight and then go home and and I realized that I was so tied up with how important it was for me to be helping other people that I wasn't taking care of the fact that I needed to come here and say goodbye to my friend I mean it's a perfect example of that it was inappropriate diligence it wasn't being kind to myself it wasn't showing compassion for myself and if we can't show compassion for ourselves loving kindness for ourselves we can't really do it for others either the intention is extremely important right it's very addictive yeah right thank you for that question it's a good question anything else yes yes although at the time what actually happened to me was other people judged me and then I beat myself up in addition to them judging me yeah I did well it's arguable whether I cared about them but yes it's true yeah what I realized whether there were a lot of steps to it but one of the other things I realized was that the people who I felt had been I felt that I had been unjustly judged no I had these flaws but basically I got caught in something that wasn't my fault and so there were some people that I blamed for that happening and so that they constituted the people that caused this judgment to come down on me and they were they were people that for a long time I couldn't feel any kindness toward and in the same way that I eventually got to the part point where I realized that I was doing the best I could I've come to believe that they're doing the best they could do also that is I no longer ascribe evil intentions to what they did does that make any sense but it didn't happen all in one I did not believe in the fairness of their judgment that's correct but it but it didn't change the fact that I I continued to make up stories where if I had done x y and z it still might not have come down the way it did you see what I mean you know if I had let's say there may be a case where oh here I'll give you a quick example there was a woman at the cancer retreat last week who was very anxious when she first arrived and I made a lot of effort to make her feel really comfortable and welcome and so on and then I was kind of gone on Thursday and Friday of the week and on Saturday morning I came up to her and I said I haven't seen you for two days I feel really bad and she said I just wrote on the evaluation form that you were very nice and you've been rejecting me for two days now that was unjust but it was still her experience that she felt rejected by me whether it was true or false so I could have been saying well that was really stupid and in fact I thought just our talking about it had made it okay but it turned out it wasn't okay and she called up early this week complaining that I had not treated her fairly so I called her again so there are steps you know the things that happen though she wasn't malicious and I wasn't malicious and still there was misunderstanding so you have to leave space for things to happen the judgment may be unfair but from another perspective it doesn't look so bad that makes sense is it anywhere in the area you wanted to have your discussion yeah well I think all of us have experiences like my father used to tell me that I was I was really great I could do anything I wanted to do and in the same breath every time I wasn't perfect he'd tell me how terrible I was over and over again and I kept buying into that cycle with him for a really long time and to the extent that my relationship with him as an adult was very strained and so when he was very ill before he died I went to visit him and he was afraid to go to sleep because he was afraid he wouldn't wake up again and so what I did for that whole weekend is I sat with him and I pretended when he fell asleep that he didn't hadn't fallen asleep so when he woke up I'd carry on as if we'd been discussing something all along and in the process of doing that while I was just sitting there with him and watching him and watching how afraid he was I suddenly realized that I couldn't judge him either that I had no right to judge him and that changed everything yeah yes it's the same spirit it has to do with I bow to the me in you this is what in a master is right I bow to the me in you I acknowledge that we share something so that it's not so much so it's just that spirit I don't want to make too much of that it's just it reminds me of that same connection where you're not separated from someone but we are the same yeah yeah so there's a co-feeling that exists rather than you have you are suffering and I'm over here fixing your suffering it's I'm sharing where you are and I desire to to relieve your suffering right that's not helpful yeah it's very it's it's a fine line and it's where equanimity comes in and joins compassion where you don't get sucked in that you you maintain an equipoise no you're sort of in balance with it you're not blown away by it and that's an important part of compassion you there has to be some energy for movement okay so what I'd like to do to to end the evening is to do a little loving kindness practice so the way we do the practice is we choose some phrases usually four phrases and we repeat them over and over and we start repeating them with ourselves so for example we might say may I be filled with loving kindness may I be safe may I be peaceful and at ease may I be happy so we wish ourselves well in the normal progression what then happens is you go on to choose a benefactor so after you've been saying these phrases for yourself to yourself for a while then you choose a benefactor someone who has done something for you that causes you to feel very well inclined toward this person you offer the phrases to that person and then you go to a friend and then you move to a neutral person you know like the bagger in the grocery store somebody you don't know that you're just neutral about and then you go to an enemy you don't start with the hardest enemy you start with you know somebody you just don't like and you wish them well and so it's a practice of wishing people well and it really has to do with the change in your heart that's engendered by wishing people well that's the goal of loving kindness meditation it's also a concentration practice because it's a focusing practice so unlike mindfulness where you you watch where your what your mind is doing you're watching your mind in this case you're focusing your mind because you're repeating these phrases over and over again so it's sometimes a way of it's complementary to mindfulness and sometimes a way of kind of calming yourself you find you're really kind of spacey you can do a little loving kindness meditation and then move into mindfulness okay so let's just practice it for a little bite so if you'll take a comfortable position and what we'll do is I'll say the phrase and you just repeat the phrase to yourself silently we'll just try this for a little while may I be filled with loving kindness may I be well may I be peaceful and at ease may I be happy may I be filled with loving kindness may I be well may I be peaceful and at ease may I be happy may I be free from harm may I be free from suffering may I be strong in spirit may I be free from fear may I be free from harm may I be free from suffering may I be strong in spirit may I be free from fear may we be filled with loving kindness may we be well may we be peaceful and at ease may we be happy may we be filled with loving kindness may we be well may we be peaceful and at ease may we be happy may all beings be filled with loving kindness may all beings be well may all beings be peaceful and at ease may all beings be happy may the merits of this practice be for the benefit of all beings may you all be happy
