Practice Note: Marbles in a Bowl

An image I like for the mind or awareness in medit ation  
is that of a wide bowl . It’s quite open and large at the 
top. It’s nice for kids to put a marble in  and see it spin 
around. The marble goes around and around , or back 
and forth, up and down . But eventually it comes t o rest 
at the base  – the central , lowest point of the bowl.  
 
The idea in meditation is to have stability of mind , to be 
centered in some way.  Conce ntration involves 
centeredness, but it’s not centeredness where you try  to 
focus on some -thing one-pointedly with your 
awareness . Rather, it is to have the mind, your 
awareness, your whole sense of being, come to rest at 
the center point , like the center point of a bowl. You 
can’t force that. You let the ball go back and forth and 
around . But the momentum  or the gravity of the ball will 
work in such a way that eventually the ball come s to 
rest in the middle.  
 
In the same way , your mind may be like many marbles  
running around , and you can’t exactly fight that. But by 
letting go, making space for waking up to it , and being 
clearly awake that you are thinking  – as oppose d to just merrily going along with thinking  – all your marbles  will 
eventually  come to rest in that center .  
 
Being in the center is quite open to everything else . The 
sides open to all the marbles  going around and around,  
and open to the world . The mind is  open , available , and 
inclusive of it all . And when you come to rest , you are 
resting in the middle.  
 
It may help to have an  idea that there is a center point 
for the ball inside yourself . For some people it is the 
object of their concentration . It could be  the breathing, 
some part of the breath , some place in the  body that 
you imagine is your center . It isn’t that you focus on it 
one-pointedly, as much as that you compose yourself 
there . You rest there, open there, come back there,  and 
settle there . Let that be the center of gravity . Let that be 
what’ s most important, the place  you relate t o, the 
reference point for you  – as oppose d to having your 
thoughts of past and future w orries be the reference 
point s. Instead, l et that center place be the reference 
point , and let everyth ing else just settle into that.   
 
In walking meditation the reference point  might be your 
feet as you step . Include everything , but let the feet be  
the center , and everything will roll back to the feet as 
you walk back and forth.  
 
I hope you enjoy your morning. I’m happy you’re here.
