 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Greetings, everyone. It's a delight to be here with this beautiful sun god. And I should have mentioned this yesterday at the outset. I had a wonderful visit from my daughter and grandchildren last weekend, but they all had coughs. And I've been fighting off a sore throat all week. And yesterday I could barely talk. I could barely make sounds with my voice. So I hope it'll be a little bit better today, but if it's a little bit scratchy, you know why. So let's begin our meditation today as we've done every day this week by, first of all, leaving all our concerns, preoccupations, agendas, worries, and responsibilities outside the door for the next 30 minutes. So take a moment to do that. Put them out there carefully, knowing that you can come back to them when you're ready. And then we'll begin again our meditation by inviting Sati, awareness, our best friend, to the forefront. This is so helpful because as awareness becomes strong, we can see when unskillful thoughts begin to arise. And then we have a little opening in which we can make a choice not to pick them up. So, you know, bring your awareness to your posture, balancing, aligning the whole body. You might want to adjust a little bit back and forth, side to side. And now connecting with the earth, feeling the connection of the body on whatever is supporting it, your cushion, chair, your bed. And imagine the words going down deep into the earth. And now inviting the grounding energy of the earth to flow up through the seat, through the spine, providing stability, maybe confidence, assurance, you're here on this earth. And then as the energy flows up the spine, we let it exit through the crown of the head. And now we can open to the energy of space. You can imagine that the body is suspended from above by that invisible thread. Now, ideally we have a comfortable posture that is both grounded and spacious, balanced, stable, open. So we'll begin by relaxing the muscles of the face, softening the forehead, the eyes, between the eyes, the cheeks, the lips, the tongue, the jaw, the neck, relaxing the shoulders, the arms, the hands, the torso, and the belly. Relaxing in the legs, the feet. And let's take up residence in this body, just as it is. As we become more and more present in our bodily experience of breathing in and breathing out, maybe a subtle joy that arises simply from being present. So now closing the eyes, breathing in, being here, breathing out peace. And now we're going to take a deep breath in and breathe out peace. And now we're going to take a deep breath in and breathe out peace. Breathing in, I'm here. Breathing out, I'm okay with the way things are. Here in this body breathing, breathing out peace. And with our receptive awareness, maybe a subtle feeling of joy and really being present in this moment. Breathing in joy and breathing out peace. So we shift to inviting joy on the in-breath. Breathing in joy, breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing in joy, breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Peace. Peace. Peace. Peace. Peace. Right now, I'm okay with the way things are. The body, however it is, is doing its best. The mind is doing its best. I don't need to change how things are to be okay. This moment is enough. I'm happy that I don't have to fight with the way things are. For a minute, just imagine the, the well-being of the contentment, the happiness of being okay with the way things are right now. Now, without really using words, we'll breathe in the well-being of contentment and breathe out peace. Breathing in well-being. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. And if the mind should wander, because that's what minds do, come back with a smile to breathing in the well-being of contentment. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Coming home to safety, there's room for all of me here. I'm home in this body, in this moment. Breathing in safety. Breathing out peace. With quiet joy, calm, the well-being of contentment. I'm safe here at home. Breathing in safety. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Breathing out peace. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. No matter what the circumstances are, if we have clear awareness, we can always find a way to be peaceful. And we can offer this to everyone. So by abiding peacefully ourselves, may we offer all beings, ourselves included, safety, peace, happiness, and freedom. Thank you. Thank you.
