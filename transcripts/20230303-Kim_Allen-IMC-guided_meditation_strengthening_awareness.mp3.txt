 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. All right, so let's go ahead and get started as you're settling in and saying hello. Now finding a posture for meditation. Just sitting, allowing yourself to feel the body in the sitting posture. Feeling the contact where you're sitting. Your seat against the chair or cushion. What you're lying on. Just having a sense of being here. Sometimes meditation is called taking the one seat. You take your seat in the middle of experience. The aim, in a sense, is to stay there. Not get drawn away by things that come and knock on the door or wave at you through the window. You're just sitting in your seat. Resting. And yet you're aware of all of experience. So we'll expand our awareness piece by piece. So beginning first with this sense of the body sitting in the room where you are. You can feel the space around you. And then opening further to other aspects of physical experience so you can sense the sounds. There's the sound of my voice. There may be other sounds around you from the household or from nature outside. Or maybe you are outside sitting in nature. And then opening to the sounds. And then opening to the sounds. And then we become aware of the inner experiences in the body. So allowing awareness to include the sensations of breathing. The inner sensations of the body. Feelings like the clothing against the skin. The awareness of the spine. The energy of energy through the body. And then you can use these to enter into awareness. Now we're beginning to include also the mind. Different aspects so noticing if there are any emotions present in your experience. That may be very clear or maybe not. Maybe there's just a general mood. Or maybe the mind is quite neutral and there are just emotional shifts now and then to see how it is and include those in awareness. All while sitting in one seat, not getting drawn in. Thank you. Thank you. So we're going to open the space of the mind. Just open the space of the mind so that those come in and out the way clouds come in and out in the sky. The space of the mind. Hold the thoughts that come and go. Thank you. Thank you. Now letting the mind be so large and vast that can even hold our background assumptions and views. Ways that we see the world. Just one more aspect of the mind actually. And then we can see things too or phenomena that can be seen and held in the vast stillness of the mind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So we've allowed into awareness. The space around us, the sounds, bodily sensations, emotions, thoughts, views. These are all things that we can be aware of. All of experience can come and go in its multitude of varied forms. We can also ask what knows this. When we turn to include even the knowing in the realm of what we can be aware of. So just resting. Totality of experience. And allowing the sense of practicing or observing to fall away. That too is extra. How much is this? How much is this? How much is this? How much is this? How much is this? How much is this? How much is this? How much is this? When you notice that. Gather what energy is available. And put it back into awareness. Restrengthen awareness and rest there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Feeling how it can fill and pervade. Experience. Such that. It's a part of nature. And what a valuable way of being this is to bring to the world. And to bring to the world. How much struggle in the world. Trying to get this or that trying to stop this or that. It's not that we would never make any movements or choose any actions. But to bring to the world. So it's not that we're never going to make any movements or choose any actions. It's not that we're never going to make any movements or choose any actions. And seeing. So it's not that we're never going to make any movements or choose any actions. But that we're bringing to the lurching around and imbalance. That's so much characterizes. Our unaware life. From us. Into others into the world. Since awareness is not something that we just hold for ourselves. It's more like something that's available. We increase its availability. And that's a gift to the world.
