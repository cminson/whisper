 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning. Welcome once again. Good to see you, those who I see, and good to see all the good morning welcomes on the chat. It's really been lovely being here with you, connecting with this Sangha. Thank you. So we're continuing today, moving in the elements now to the element of space. And yesterday I sort of hinted at this way that we're moving further and further into the ineffable, the unseen, the more towards emptiness. And as I'll say a little bit more about later, a little bit more into mind, into the nature of mind. So we'll do a practice starting to... Our practice this morning will be a meditation about space. And I want to read you a quote from the suit I've referred to a number of times, 62. And this is again the instruction that the Buddha is giving his son, Rahula. And this is what he says, Rahula, develop meditation that is like space. Arisen, agreeable and disagreeable contacts will not invade your mind and remain. There's a phrase in there I want to bring your attention to, which is he says, just as space is not established anywhere, so too Rahula, develop meditation that is like space. This idea that your meditation, just as space is not established anywhere, and that you could have a meditation that is not established anywhere. And that is an interesting idea. And it's also a little unnerving for our systems that we are we're used to settling on objects. We're used to landing somewhere, recognizing it, having our perception, name what it is, and then having an opinion about it, or at least a vedna, a feeling tone of pleasant or unpleasant. So when we land on space, there's this... there can be this uneasiness and immense neutrality, and I'll speak more later about how useful this neutrality can be and how useful it is to not be established anywhere. But as we move into this meditation, I want to name that you may at times in the meditation, sort of be a little like, what am I paying attention to? And that's natural, because we're shifting. Instead of paying attention to objects, we're paying attention to the space, and that can be a little different. So find your comfortable meditation posture, and we'll begin, as we always do, sensing our contact with the ground. Letting yourself feel the ground through the seat, through your legs or feet. Let your attention be aware not only of the pressure and the contact, but also of the ground beneath you, of the place where you're sitting. Let yourself land, land here right now. Let yourself grow roots. Notice the parts of your body that have some tension and see if you can bring some ease or relaxation, particularly in the shoulders, around the eyes. Let the belly soften. And let your attention come to the breath, and just feel the flow of breath. And see if you can find a place, a way of connecting with your breath that has some sense of ease in it. It might be as we played with yesterday, sensing the whole body as you breathe. It might be finding, letting your attention ride with the breath as it flows in, and then as it releases flowing out. And as you feel yourself established in this place, sensing the body, feeling the movement of breath. No need to be resistant or push away thoughts as they arise, simply allowing them to float with the breath. Breathe in and breathe out. And begin to pay more attention on the exhale. Follow the exhale. And as you notice the exhale, let your attention follow it as it leaves through your mouth or nose or both. Follow the exhale and ride to the breath, right out to beyond your lips and nose, right into the space there. And begin to have a sense of your attention in this space just beyond your body. And when you inhale, you might notice that the attention comes back in and then on the exhale, allow it to flow out again into that space. And with each exhale, perhaps allowing your sense of that space to expand, getting a little bit larger. And after a few breaths, you might find that you can just allow your attention to rest in the space, even as you inhale. And then with the exhale, allowing your attention on the space to get a little broader, a little bigger. Perhaps extending a few feet or more. Beginning even to fill if you're in a room, filling the whole room in front of you. If you're outside letting it extend out. Maybe as far as first the closest object. Begin to explore a little what it's like to have your attention on this open empty space. Notice if the mind struggles a little bit to land somewhere. Or notice if there's some stillness or peace. Or just calm in the space. You don't need to make it a particular way. Just explore it. And allowing this sense of space to expand as far as it's comfortable. It can keep expanding out and out. Go through the walls. Let your attention go out through the walls, beyond the walls, if there's walls in front of you, to what's beyond that. So that you allow yourself to have the space outside the building. And if you're outside, allow your attention to expand further and further. The objects are not a problem. They too are made of space. So just let your attention flow right through them. And really attending to them in any detail. And just on the space. Letting it extend maybe as far as the horizon. You might notice that there's moments when there's just sort of a little confusion. Or even an unease. And just notice that. Or there might be moments where you feel almost like you're falling into the space. And then giving up any effort. And just come back and feel your body landed on the ground, sensing the breath. And then begin to notice, just imagine that you could breathe out to your right side. So now imagining the exhale coming out the side of your head instead of out the nose. And letting that exhale take you into the space to the right side of you. At first it might be a little awkward. Your attention will come back in as you inhale. But then begin to allow your attention to rest. And with each exhale, allowing a little more, a little more expansion in your attention. Again, allowing yourself to sense the whole right side of where you're sitting. Perhaps in the room or out into the space or outside. And then going through the walls, if you have walls and beyond. You need to feel the vastness. It's empty open vastness. You might even, if you can, sense your attention going out into the sky. The limitless sky. And then again, dropping all effort. Noticing if there's any tension that's accumulated in your body and letting that soften. Feel yourself anchored here. Feel the flow of breath. And continue by breathing out behind you. So allowing the exhale to take your attention back behind you. And this is sometimes a little more challenging because we're not as aware of the space behind us. But I encourage you to sense it. As you do this, you'll tend to rest further back into your back body. Perhaps softening some. See if you can sense the space not just behind your head, but behind your back. And letting this sense grow out further. Perhaps with the exhale or perhaps it just naturally your curiosity leading you outward behind you. Let your attention go out behind you through the room, through the walls, out into the vaster space as far as is comfortable. Perhaps it'll be out into the distant sky. Perhaps just a little beyond what you know is there. And then again, relaxing, feeling your body. Noticing if there's any tension. You don't need to work hard at this. And then letting your breath now go out to the left side. Becoming aware of the space to your left. Close in first. And then in your own time, in your own way, expanding out. And then letting that go. Feeling the body landed here. And then very gently inviting your attention to breathe out in all directions. Letting your attention get broad and open. You might notice that there's a way it moves, that it feels like it moves around. And then you might find moments where it just rests in the open space, not landing on anything in particular. Not even landing on any particular point in space. Let yourself sense the sky above you, through the roof, through the walls, the trees. Sense the space behind you. Let yourself rest into all this open space. Might feel like resting in a soft cloud. Might be a little uncomfortable or unfamiliar. And that's okay. It only needs to be as big and as broad as you choose. Notice in this open space that the objects don't interrupt it. That the space even might seem it goes right through the objects. That the objects can arise or having a sense of them, but they don't disturb the space. The space continues. You might notice as you rest in this space, perhaps this space continues right through your own body. That this open emptiness also includes right here. And in this open empty space, there are objects. Sounds might arise. Sensations in the body will happen. Thoughts float through. Sensations of the heart in the emotion. Let them all come and go. Nothing needs to be resisted or pushed away. But allow yourself to stay resting in the space with this open, relaxed attitude of allowing. Allowing everything to come and to go. And you simply rest in this big open space. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If your attention contracts and comes back. Okay. Just begin again, opening back up to the space. And allowing yourself to rest. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
