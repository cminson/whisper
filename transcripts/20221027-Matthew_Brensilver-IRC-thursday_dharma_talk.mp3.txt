So, you may or may not have noticed that Gil and I are a little different, you know.
I'm not just saying this because he's not there, I'd say this right to his face.
We have very different approaches to oatmeal.
And I personally feel like he's playing it a little bit fast and loose with your oatmeal.
In order to sit, the six a.m. sit, he comes and sits, and he kind of get down there pretty
fast and get boiling water from the tea station to get it going right away, right when Sangha
service starts.
And if the timing all goes well, it's done at about six fifty-nine, yeah.
And through the whole thing, he's super chill.
I show up at five forty-five, just put on my apron and start worrying.
And you think that I couldn't mess up oatmeal, but you lack imagination.
And I basically worry your oatmeal into existence.
Checking on the fire, reading the water ratio many times.
And if you taste fear in the oatmeal, that's me.
All of that is the preface to today's topic.
Presslessness, worry.
So we think generally, we think we do things because we need to do them and things need
doing, but we think we do them because they need doing.
But part of why they seem to need doing is because the alternative of doing nothing is
kind of grim.
And sometimes I've received kind of a meditation instruction that something like do nothing.
Like really do nothing.
Any time you notice that you're intentionally doing something, doing something with your
attention, even bringing your attention to the anchor, breath, body, any time you notice
you're doing something, drop that intention.
And of course there's some things that we find, well, we're not doing, they're just
going, but one of the implications of those sorts of practice is that we're doing a lot.
We're doing a lot to the moment.
And the impulse to do something to the moment runs deep.
And so we start to recognize the ways we recapitulate busyness in our practice in the same way
we structure time and scaffold this hour into that one.
And a lot of practice is actually not what we start doing, but what we stop doing.
And the Buddhist path actually is a lot about stopping.
And before we do something, of course we need to do lots of things.
Just to be here together, a million things have to happen, a million things are happening,
all the wheels under the ship that are moving.
We have to do lots of things.
But before we do something, it's good to be okay doing nothing.
Because when we're okay actually doing nothing, when we do something, we do it well.
So a century ago Freud said anxiety is a riddle whose solution would throw a flood of light
on our whole mental existence.
And indeed it said that restlessness is kind of tumbling energy, so leaning, tumbling forward.
That's said to be with us until very deep into the path of freedom.
So what is this kind of ambient restlessness?
We actually have to stop to even see it.
And in samsara, in this realm, this kind of just our world, our world, but with, I use
that word samsara to emphasize the kind of first noble truth-ness of it.
And in samsara there's this sense that there must always be another item on the menu.
That there's always something to fix, that the moment always feels maybe just subtly,
but subtly incomplete.
That's maybe another kind of synonym for dukkha, for suffering or unsatisfactoriness, maybe
we say incompletion, not bad, just incomplete.
And in our restlessness, in our agitation, there's a sense of being kind of stuck in
time, sandwiched uncomfortably between past and future, and a sense of that kind of tumbling
energy becoming.
Sense of being out of a joint, of something missing, a sense of like kind of some idealized
version of myself is just out there, not quite within my reach, but it feels like almost.
And when am I going to catch up with them?
And so there's this kind of disjointedness in that.
And ignorance is often said to be the root of suffering, that kind of like base ground
condition for the arising of suffering, that it's the failure to know something, to perceive
something, to recognize truth.
And I get that, it's certainly true if we're confused about basic features of human life.
It's very difficult to be deeply happy.
And so I get the potency of ignorance as a force in suffering.
But if I had to pick a force that feels even more primal, a force that can deform our minds,
in a very pervasive way, it probably would be fear, probably would be fear.
And in this sense of worry, restlessness, which is not exactly fear per se, but in the
movement of the worry and the restlessness, you can kind of sense the vigilance bound
up with it, and the scramble of trying to cobble together a kind of life.
And the movement of restlessness seems at least in part to be just this small creature
grappling against helplessness.
We talk about liberating insight into a Nietzsche, impermanence, unreliability, uncertainty,
that kind of like core Dharma theme.
And indeed when we know we're in a kind of river with no banks, where we are that river,
part of that river, not separable from that river, we start to know that kind of sensorially,
actually know that.
Nietzsche becomes a refuge, but in a way before Nietzsche is a refuge, we grieve Nietzsche.
Our heart has to acclimatize to Nietzsche.
And that takes a long time, I don't even know how long that takes.
So anxiety is said sometimes to be a particular relationship to uncertainty, namely intolerance
of uncertainty.
It's a particular relationship to a Nietzsche.
And restlessness, this worry is maybe just like our heart and mind, like just grappling
with a Nietzsche, grappling with the unreliability.
And we have the sense that, yeah, it's like it's left to me, it's left to me to govern
samsara, to shore it up.
And worry, worry becomes the device we use to govern Nietzsche.
So virtually every desire that we have, it includes our existence in it.
And that means is that change, illness, mortality, this poses a kind of fundamental challenge
to the human psyche.
And the priority in virtually all moments is ensuring that there will be more moments.
The priority is shoring up samsara to make sure that this moment is on a trajectory towards
okayness, that I'm going to be okay.
And so we're kind of standing guard over our own security, insecurity.
And this is our sense of safety, of security, safety is always about the future.
It's about the next moment or some time in the future.
And so safety is almost by definition about prediction, prediction, anticipation.
There's one researcher, she said something like, just like our phones are, we're kind
of our humans are always on auto, auto complete, like our brains are on auto complete.
And so, you know, whatever the phone fills in, good day, good night, good, you know,
and it's like for us, this thought, we have this feeling, we have this image, we have
this sound, we hear, it's like, okay, auto complete.
What was that?
Where did it come from?
Where is it going?
What does it mean for me quite innocently?
And said that our brain is a kind of prediction machine always generating hypotheses about
what is coming.
Does this moment predict okayness in the next one?
And so you see this process at a micro level each moment of our practice sometimes.
We kind of graft onto the story of me, the story of my life, the story of my retreat.
And we're compulsively trying to evaluate if the trajectory is in towards goodness or
badness.
And we interpret and often over interpret the moment, tacking that on to our kind of
autobiography as the next chapter, the next little mini chapter, where am I going?
And we are looking really never to be startled, never to be startled, to be anticipating sufficiently
that nothing is a surprise, that everything fits in to the model of what we think is real
and true and who we think we are.
And the kind of way that we, you know, the way we leverage our understanding, we leverage
our past, everything we've learned to predict what's coming next.
And so in a deep way we really tie ourselves to what was, what will be, what may be.
We tie ourselves to the karma, to the kind of what we think we've learned from our past,
which is both wisdom, but also delusion.
And we use that as a way of understanding what this is, what's next, am I okay?
Is this okay?
And the present moment is just the kind of, the way I put it, it's like the present moment
is just the kind of the canary in the coal mine of the future.
This moment is really just a test to see if it's going to be all right.
This moment is a kind of down payment on some other moment, but that other moment never
comes.
The Buddha described this as bhavatana, the craving to become, and that subtle kind of
energy of leaning forward.
And that's the characteristic of restlessness and worry, it's hindrance.
And tranquility, the dimension of this path, the tranquilizing side of this path, tranquility
is about releasing ourselves from this flood of becoming, this torrent, to become settled
enough that some of those mechanisms of prediction, anticipation that we feel actually safe enough
so that we don't need to stay oriented in the same way.
And so a lot of what we do here is we just, we're coming down, but in a deep way.
And then we're exploring what is reality, what does it look like, how does it feel when
we are settled?
Ajahn Sajjito.
You're not going to be free from anxiety by getting things right because then comes the
next thing and you've got to get that right too.
Some things are always going to be new and sometimes you're going to get it wrong.
So you never get confident through getting it right.
Sometimes comes through establishing your roots within at your center.
You're prepared to get it wrong, okay, learn, doesn't matter, try again.
We're natural like trees rooted but flexible.
Trees don't grow in straight rows.
Trees like to grow with each other but with enough space, not too close, not too far apart.
But with the feeling we're here, it's okay.
Then your roots will grow and your balance will extend because that's the nature of things.
Then as you get centered, the qualities of goodwill, aspiration, enthusiasm, joyfulness
start to spread.
It's the nature of the heart when you've established the center.
Just as May said, be still and wait for the help to find you.
There's a clinical model of pain that says that pain is the prediction of bodily harm.
Maybe this is part of why pain can feel so unbearable is the sense of it's projected
into the future.
Pain is the prediction of bodily harm and so that very moment, the moment of pain is
somehow glued and bound to a sense of the future.
Sometimes that's important, right?
Sometimes the pain is indicative of tissue damage, but much of it is not.
Much of it is a kind of false alarm and got me thinking about just about dukkha, about
suffering and the kind of the pain that's a fault, the pain of like having your hand
on a hot stove versus the pain, for example, in chronic pain where the signal of the pain
is no longer a true alarm about bodily damage.
It's a false alarm.
It's real, but it's a false alarm.
And it got me thinking about dukkha, that dukkha, it's a lot of dukkha, is less like the hand
on the hot stove and more like a brain-generated false alarm.
And so we're learning to establish more safety amidst all of the false alarms.
We are learning to distinguish what is an actual, yeah, what is an actual, actually
needs our attention versus what is a kind of just another false alarm that has the feeling
of urgency, but is just the endlessness of samsara.
This is a scientist, Helene Slater, I think is her name, talking about what happens since
of what it means to be present.
She says, our main contention is that meditation gradually brings the practitioner more and
more into the present moment, thereby progressively abating deep, predictive processing in the
brain.
We contend this not only reduces episodic future thinking and decision-making, but also
explains more unusual kinds of experiences reported by meditators, including loss of
self-other distinction and the cessation of time.
That is, if awareness rests in the here and now, all mental processes that involve abstract
and temporally deep processing should fall away, including one's sense of self-time,
space, and body representation.
We suggest that meditation reigns in the mind's habitual tendency to abstract away from here
and now until all phenomenological distinctions stop.
Metaphorically, we suggest that meditation prunes the counterfactual tree.
Coulda, shoulda, woulda, the sense of approaching some fork in the road, the sense of what could
have been, what might be, the sense of which way samsara might tip.
What I want, what I don't.
And so we are dropping in more and more deeply to the present, whatever that is.
What does that even mean?
Yeah, until more and more phenomenological distinctions stop, where we're doing less
and less sordid, we're dropping more into this kind of sense of the bottomlessness of
the present.
And the sense of what could be, what might have been, the sense of even like any sense
of alternative to this moment, the sense of the potential alternative, that sense of what
might be, starts to drop away.
And to do that, we have to stay, have to, in some sense, acclimatize to a Nietzsche,
in some sense, feel safe enough, protected enough, tranquil enough, enough sense of refuge
that we are okay becoming totally defenseless to the moment.
And to do that takes a lot of compassion.
To make peace with the imperfection of the human condition takes a lot of love, a lot
of compassion.
Just to stay, to stay here, to stay with this experience, to stay with this retreat takes
a lot of compassion.
And there's a sense of, you know, we're not going to be able to sort of think our way
out of a Nietzsche.
And I talk so much about dukkha suffering, because there's something about it that is
just almost unbelievable, you know.
The Buddha said, Comprehend dukkha, comprehend it, and, but when it's here, we can't help
but have the sense that the universe has gone off its tracks.
And to make peace with dukkha, a Nietzsche, a not self, selflessness, to do that takes
a lot of love.
Because, you know, I feel like before dukkha, Nietzsche, and natta are insides, before they
free us, we have to grieve them.
And that takes a lot of love, a lot of compassion.
As Pema says, to be fully alive, fully human, and completely awake is to be continually
thrown out of the nest, to live fully is to be always in no manned land, to experience
each moment as completely new and fresh, to live is to be willing to die over and over
again, from the awakened point of view that's life, death is wanting to hold on to what
you have, and to have every experience confirm you, congratulate you, make you feel completely
together, to experience Nietzsche groundlessness in a way that is not terrifying, takes a lot
of love, because groundlessness will make us love or make us hate, and we're trying
to put our heart in a posture such that groundlessness does softens rather than hoardens our heart.
That is love meeting goodness, compassion, love meeting suffering, and love meeting
pain, and there's always pain, and so you see the necessity of this kind of care, and
our life, a country, a civilization, a species, nothing is guaranteed in existence.
Everything depends on everything else, and that dependency, we want to take that into
our heart deeply, and so love and loss, these kind of two fundamental currents of the human
realm mean like compassion is utterly necessary, and compassion, I feel, this certain kind
of tenderness, this love, this heart quivering in the face of suffering, not overrun by it
but quivering in the face of it, this is woven into the whole of the practice.
So much of the path of practice, the way we grow, feels like a kind of shedding, feels
like often has the flavor of grieving, and we may not even know what's being lost, what's
being pulled out from our hands, what practices is actually taking from us, what we're shedding,
but it often, not for everybody, but for many people, feels like grief, and I believe for
everyone at some point on this path, it feels like we're relinquishing everything.
And so this kind of willingness to grieve is important, but that is not compassion itself,
like grief is, in a way, we let grief enter our heart fully, but then the movement of
compassion is completely enveloping that grief with love.
And there's a willingness to grieve, but that's not the last word with this, it's the love
ultimately holding that.
And so much of our restlessness and our agitation, is it kind of like, yeah, just things grow,
the tides of suffering grow, kind of often out of this cauldron of just our unwillingness
to be with the simplicity of dukkha.
And we kind of build so much out of that, because we're always constructing this timeline
and this trajectory of where this moment is going, is it going right, do I need to tweak
something, because of that we're, yeah, we start to make and interpret, often overinterpret
the kind of moments of discomfort or whatever it may be.
And sometimes I shared like the kind of thought experiment of like, if I accidentally unknowingly
took a medicine that was not anti-anxiety, but like pro-anxiety, yeah, angiogenic, just
like I took something and without knowing it.
And as that drug onset, the sense of my life would start to collapse, I would start thinking
a lot about why I'm feeling so terribly, why I'm feeling so anxious, so restless.
And I would try to understand, well, what is wrong with my life, with me, with the people
I love, what's wrong with all of this.
And even after that drug wore off, those stories that I concocted might be quite leave a kind
of mark in me.
I might maintain a certain kind of allegiance to those stories that I concocted as I tried
to make sense of how badly I felt in that moment.
And those stories would be a way of trying to explain, neutralize, squirm out of the
feeling of restlessness.
And maybe a lot of our life is like this.
A sense of the subtle wrongness, the sense of subtle risk, the sense of the trajectory
of my life isn't quite right.
What is this?
What is this?
What's wrong?
What needs fixing?
What needs tweaking?
And it's such an innocent habit, and it's not without its value, yeah?
But the way we're always compulsively trying to read the tea leaves of our body and trace
out the wrongness of samsara is not so useful.
And so we just stay.
We bear with imperfection, bear with uncertainty, bear with the loose ends of any human life.
And then the stories that we do build, they'll be richer, more nuanced stories, more
powerful, and we'll also know that no story is the final story, that every story is at
least a little bit wrong.
And so our worry, our worried thoughts, a kind of attempt to medicate our agitated mind.
But thoughts don't really serve as kind of, they can't digest feeling so well.
So we feel them with love.
And then there are subtler and subtler forms of agitation, and we keep loving those to
the death, as a teacher, shins and yang would say, till the mind, not leaning.
Because this hindrance is associated with regret, restlessness, worry, regret.
And yeah, regret.
So the way that we feel let down by our past, and some of the harm we've done, regrets we
have, and of course this too is a place for compassion, a place for love.
And just like compassion, compassion is love meeting suffering, maybe we say forgiveness
is love meeting harm.
And that's not condoning, cosigning harm, but it's love meeting harm, love meeting
harm.
In this case, harm we may have done.
And we become accountable in a deep way.
This is a path of non-harming, but it's not idealistic, and not expecting perfection.
There will be loose ends, but we become radically accountable to harm we do.
And we do that in a way that does not compound a sense of guilt and the story of Matthew
and what's wrong with me, and why did I do that, and how did I let myself down, and it's
kind of like negative ego trip, as somebody said.
Not that, it's this very sober appreciation, it has nothing to do with the self, it's a
very sober appreciation.
I did harm, and something in me does not want to do that again.
And we actually marinate in that harm.
This is like we marinate in the pain of that remorse.
I just, I make a practice, I just let that burn into me.
I let it burn in in a way that does not compound the story of self whatsoever.
That it is still pain, but I let the pain burn into me so that it consolidates my motivation
to be careful with people's hearts.
And then when we've extracted all that we can from that episode of harm from our remorse,
when we've extracted all of the wisdom from it, we totally forgive ourselves.
Enough.
That's it.
I have derived everything I can from it.
I'm not going to try to get any more from it.
That's it.
I forgive myself.
I've learned this deeply.
I've learned the lesson of that pain deeply.
And then we let it go.
And so I've said this work around restlessness worry, using worry to govern the future.
I've said that many of the alarm bells that go off in our minds are false alarms.
But not all of them.
And so much of our anxiety is about not knowing the agitation that arises out of uncertainty.
So we actually do know how the story ends.
Everything changes.
That's how the story ends.
Ajahn Shah's very famous teaching about holding up a cup, I would say, this cup, which holds
my tea quite admirably.
This cup is already broken.
Because I know it's already broken, I can enjoy the way it holds my tea now.
Maybe we trace that out.
This cup is already broken.
This land has already burned.
This country has already come and gone.
I'm already dead.
You just see what it does to your heart.
And for me, in the wake of that, in the wake of those kinds of reflections, what's left
is just love, love and the question of how to spend it.
Is that for a moment?
