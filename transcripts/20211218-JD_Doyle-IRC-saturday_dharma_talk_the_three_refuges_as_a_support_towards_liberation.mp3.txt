Welcome everyone, want to check the sound, make sure it's okay. Good, good. I
understand there was a request that Flora, my dog, offer the Dharma talk today.
Unfortunately she's unavailable so she just wandered off and will not be able
to do so but I think she appreciates the kind attention because this has been a
long retreat for her. So occasionally she does chime in in the background as
you've heard.
So this journey that we've been on together I feel so grateful to each one
of you and honored to be able to be here as part of this Sangha, as part of this
practice community. Really grateful for the dedication of each one of you to
practice so fully and wholeheartedly. And we are at that time in the retreat where
for many of you you may have noticed at some point today the mind beginning to
go into the future, into a different container if you will, the places that
the mind will go as we move from this container of the retreat that we have
created together. And the questions about how do we continue, how do we continue
to take refuge, how do we continue to cultivate and nourish that which we have
been practicing together. And so tonight I'd like to tonight this afternoon I
would like to offer a talk about taking refuge. I know we took refuge at the
beginning of the retreat taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha.
And so I wanted to talk a bit about how I find that taking refuge can really
support us in meeting the complexity of our lives and how we can orient towards
this way of taking refuge that helps support us in orienting in a different
direction than the refuges that we may habitually or be pushed towards from
forces of habit or cultural conditioning. So I wanted to start with a simile
which I love that is offered for the refuges. And so in this simile for the
refuges and I'll just share this from Bhikkhu Bodhi. This simile compares the
Buddha to a lotus flower, the paragon of beauty and perfection. Just as a lotus
grows up in a muddy lake, rises above the water and stands in full splendor,
graceful while rooted in the mud. So too the Buddha, having grown up in the world,
abides in its mist untainted by the defilements. The Buddhist teachings of
the true Dharma is like the sweet fragrance emitted by the lotus flower
giving delight to all. And the Sangha is like the host of bees who collect
around the lotus, gather up the pollen, and fly off to their hives to transform
it into honey. I really find this simile so lovely about the three refuges. I
think the refuges can feel a little dry when we just think about them but when
we think about them as being this embodiment of the lotus. And it's almost
its simplicity and I really, another reason why I love the lotus is because
before there were images of the Buddha in human form, the statues that we see now
on altars, the lotus flower was one of the symbols to represent the Buddha. And so
I think this is such a useful for us to remember this image. The beauty of the
lotus flower, the mud, the fragrance, the bees, the water, all of this connected
together. And in the simile, we are reminded that the lotus flower is not
separate from the mud. In fact, if we remove the lotus flower from the mud, it
would not survive. Just as we are inextricably bound to the world that we
live in, we are interconnected and individually alone, separate, plucked up,
put on some cloud or in a cave somewhere.
Why would it be for us to survive? We are inextricably connected to one
another. And in the simile, it says the lotus grows gracefully untainted by the
defilements. Now this may not be a language that we use in our common
parlans. The defilements are what we have talked about during this retreat as
greed, hatred, and delusion. And perhaps during this retreat, you have had moments
that you have felt a degree of grace, of just a little bit of loosening of that
force of greed, or aversion, or a little less confusion. Kind of being able to feel
a little bit of release from that tug of craving, or at least noticing how greed
and hatred and ignorance may arise and pass away, that they are part of our
lives, and then can we still remain rooted as these forces of life come
through? I kind of like to think about the lotus, you know, kind of maybe the
wind, like greed, hatred, and delusion, and can we stay rooted when these forces
come through? Like the lotus flower in the pond.
And in the simile, the teachings of the Buddha, the Dharma is represented by the
fragrance of the lotus. So the fragrance of the lotus is the beauty of the
teachings. And this I find heartening because of its availability. Anyone who
walks by the lotus has access to the fragrance, access to the teachings. It's
not something that we have to buy, or capture, or cling on to. The fragrance is
in the wind, and we have to avail ourselves of it. The Dharma is available
here and now. And as was mentioned many times during the retreat, the Dharma is
the way things have come to be, the conditions of the world that have given
rise to this moment. And currently this moment that we are living in has such a
host of changes, challenges. There's some myriad conditions that we can point to
that are challenging and difficult, that the Dharma can perhaps bring some
beauty to. One only needs to pause to think about the world around us, the
larger world that has been surrounding our retreat container, global climate
change, the pandemic, the heightened focus on racial inequalities in our
country, all of these conditions that surround us. And yet, and at the same
time we can find the practice of the Dharma to help move us through these
very complicated challenges. And one of the things that I remember by thinking
about that this Dharma is available is the ability to remember to not turn away,
not turn away. Can I learn to be with the world and not turn away? This is the
part of the mud, right? That maybe at some point in your life you had an
experience as a child playing in the mud and it was fun. And generally as we get
older, we forget that sense of the mud might be being fun at some point and
we remember more how arduous it is to have to clean up from the mud. But the
mud is essential. Chikna Khan has said no mud, no lotus. You know, there it is, no
mud, no lotus. And then he continues, most people are afraid of suffering, but
suffering is a kind of mud to help the lotus flower of happiness grow. There can
be no lotus flower without the mud. Without suffering, there's no happiness. So
we shouldn't discriminate against the mud. We have to learn how to embrace and
cradle our own suffering and the suffering of the world with a lot of
tenderness. And the care with which he's inviting us to bring our mindfulness
practice, this wholehearted practice, noticing that sometimes we're afraid,
afraid of the suffering and reminding us that this suffering too is a part of our
life, that it's not because we did something wrong or something happened is
that the joys and the sorrows are all a part of our life. No mud, no lotus. The
other term that you have probably heard Chikna Khan refer to this is
interbeing, that there actually isn't a separation between the mud and the lotus
that we enter are. Just as we enter our with each other, we enter our with our
communities, we enter our with the earth, we enter our with the lotus, with all
beings, all people. And as we consider in this simile the Buddha as the lotus
planted in the mud, and we think of the Dharma as the fragrance that emanates
from this interconnectedness of the teachings and the Buddha, we're invited
to remember that we the Sangha are in the simile the bees. And here we are, and I
can feel the hum that we've created over our week together, this hum. And I know
people have felt it even in our virtual space, this real force field of our
hive of our Sangha. And I love thinking about the bees. I don't know about you,
but when I go out to my garden and I see the bees on the flowers, I can feel my
heart just enlivened. This mutuality of the bees and the flowers, really seeing
that interconnectedness and action, the bee not harming the flower, the flower
not harming the bee. In fact, they are both enhancing each other's existence. And
we now know that, you know, bees are essential for the ecological balance and
biodiversity, and that the ecosystem services provided by bees, the pollination,
the food chains that we're part of, that they protect and maintain so many other
plants and animals. So it's not even just the bees and the flowers, but then we can
think about the seeds and then all of the other ways that bees can contribute to
genetic and biotic diversity. And so in the simile, we the Sangha are the bees who
collect around the lotus, gather up the pollen, and fly off to their hives to
transform it into honey. And I love this way that, you know, we take the teachings
of the Dharma, of the Buddha, and we take them into our hives, into our hearts, into
our communities, and here into our homes where we're all practicing, wherever
we're practicing, and transform it into sustenance. Transform it into something
that can help us maintain the nourishment and sustenance that we need to meet all
of the challenges of our lives. And so I think the simile is so apt because it
provides just this one image that can help us remember all these three
components of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. And as we remember that, I
think it can help, helps me anyways, kind of let go of that sense of separation, the
sense of isolation and individualization that can happen when I feel like it's me
in the world trying, trying to create a world of peace and harmony and beauty. And
if I can remember the sense that there's the Buddha, maybe the Buddha within,
maybe the Buddha historically, and the teachings that are available, and then
these Bees that I'm a part of, and I don't feel so isolated. There's a beautiful,
there's these beautiful verses by Zen teacher Robert Aiken Roshi, and I'm
gonna share one of them that I just find so wonderful. And these are verses of
blessings, and so one of the blessings is when people praise me for something, I
vow with all beings to return to my vegetable garden and give credit where
credit is due. When people praise me for something, I vow with all beings to
return to my vegetable garden and give credit where credit is due. This sense of
mutuality, so the praise comes along and yeah, maybe taking it in, but
remembering that it's not me, it's not mine, it's not myself, and then you know
after praise comes the blame, and then the fame, ill repute, the worldly wins. And
so even though we have accountability and responsibility in it, we can also
disengage ourselves from the personality of that, and remember that we are
exist in this mutuality, that I am my vegetable garden, vegetable garden is me, I
am the mud, the mud is me. And so as much as I set out my intentions to not cause
harm, there will be times that I do cause harm. And my intention to be mutually
beneficial might not always bear fruit. And this is where for me the practice of
our mindfulness is such a powerful component to taking ourselves into the
world. And we can continue with this practice that we've done all week of the
four foundations, and how the Buddha invites us to attend with mindfulness
internally and externally in both internally and externally, so that we
contend with this deep care both to ourselves and to our communities. And by
mindfulness, I really want to call in this practice that we've been doing, where
we're focusing our awareness on what's happening in our bodies, in our hearts, in
our minds, in our bodies, and then in the bodies around us, the bodies of the
world. So remembering this aspect of interconnectedness, of non-separation.
And during our retreat, we eliminate some of the inputs of these aspects of what
we're going to be mindful. We kind of create a place of practice, of solace, of
container. And as we're moving into this next type of retreat, we're enlarging
that. We're really bringing in to our focus, the relational practice, and taking
our Dharma into the fullness of our lives. And I don't know about you, but when I
leave retreat and I'm feeling all ease, it does not take long for me to
encounter a person to all of a sudden see those habit tendencies that I thought
were released somewhat arise in the presence of another. The impatience, the
irritability, all of those emotions and challenges are still around. And yet there
also is this field, this field that has been created of compassion, of kindness.
And I think I can hold myself in a way so that I can remember that I'm still
learning, that I am still a learner, still meeting life as best as I can, and
that sometimes I'll meet it beautifully and that sometimes I'll fall down into
the mud and get swept up in the complexities of the world. And so we
have this intention of being skillful and beautiful and kind in each moment. And
then we meet as best as we can each moment. My teacher and mentor Larry Yang
has shared this, he calls it his personal mantra that he's developed to
navigate through complex dilemmas and social issues. And so this is his mantra.
Can I be mindful and loving of whatever arises? Can I be mindful and loving of
whatever arises? So that's where it starts. If I can't be loving in this
moment, can I be kind? If I can't be kind, can I be non-judgmental? If I can't be
non-judgmental, can I not cause harm? And if I cannot not cause harm, can I cause
the least amount of harm possible? I so appreciate this framing because it helps
us know that, you know, there are these gradations of experience that we have
this intention perhaps, as I do, to be mindful and loving with whatever arises.
And sometimes I'm tired and sleepy or busy or whatever and something arises and I
need it. Can I still try to be kind? Can I try to bring in the most that I can in
that moment? Can I cause the least amount of harm possible? And I think to me this
is really helpful because I don't always know the most skillful action and yes
sometimes it is important for me to act. And so I can acknowledge that I don't
know and this is my best action given the current conditions. And the other
reason I appreciate this is because historically what I would generally do
in this regard is I would turn to fear and not act and engage by disengaging.
And so with our practice we are now encouraged to engage, to tend, to attend
and check in with ourselves to see what is possible in this moment. We pause,
and we engage. And sometimes our skills haven't caught up yet and we make
mistakes. And so for me this is a big place of action because historically as I
mentioned this walling off and disengaging felt much more safe. And I
don't know about you but there's a way that I was taught to armor my heart
throughout my life to take care by creating walls so that the refuge I had
was an armoring. And what happens is that the armoring gets thicker and thicker
and thicker and then my heart I found didn't have as much capacity, didn't have
capacity to be me or with others. And I also consider as I reflect on this the
walls that are built in our world, the walls that we build around communities,
the walls that are built, keep people in, keep people out. And so I think about my
practice of trying to engage and that I might not always be able to engage from
this place of meeting the moment as mindful and love as I would like. And
yet can I be kind or can I be non-judgmental to see what is possible?
One of the things that I find that has happened is that the pandemic has
created an opportunity to see some of this uncertainty even with more clarity
than is usually available in our lives. That so many aspects of our
life have been impacted. That what we consider essential for our lives, our
food, our water, our physical contact has all been put in this place of
uncertainty. How do we engage with each other through this uncertainty? Where do
we look for refuge? And then this current reality is built on the historical
fabric that has been decaying and praying for decades and centuries. And so
that we often can see now the fruit of the pandemic has impacts that are
disproportionately distributed in our society and the communities that have
the greatest impact, those people who are continuing to deliver food or create
drive or be in the hospitals, maybe the same communities that have been
marginalized historically. And so it's so easy to feel adrift and overwhelmed and
then wander in this sense of confusion and judgment. And how do I move? How do I
engage with this myriad of the world and the
violence that is around us?
And the depth of our practice that which we've been doing here can be used to
address all of this. One of the things that I find that can be addressed with
our practice is that we can bring in this place of our practice to know that
it actually has more capacity than we know. That we can look and bring our
awareness to the dukkha, to suffering, to this complexity with that which we're
practicing with. This is a quote that I find so useful from Tubton Children, who's
an American Tibetan Buddhist non-author and teacher, and she speaks to how
Buddhism in the West sometimes uses mindfulness in a way that is just as a
panacea and not as the deep transformational practice that it is.
She says, my concern with Buddhism in the West is that there's some block to
really looking deeply at what dukkha means, what suffering means. People want
light and love and bliss. Many people come to Buddhism to achieve a better
psychological state and feel better about themselves, and that's fine. We can help
them on that level, but that's not the depth to which the Buddhist teachings go.
If we don't spend time considering what dukkha is, then we won't seek liberation
and awakening. Instead, we'll use the dharma only to make our samsaric life a
little bit better. That's one of my fears for Buddhism in the West, that we lose
the liberating aspect of the dharma.
So she says that there's a block to really looking deeply at what dukkha
means, and so I would invite us to use this practice and when that sense of
fear arises that we may notice because we've been practicing to hold, to turn
towards, and to hold it and to engage in the complexity of this dukkha, and not
just rest at that place of comfort. I also have a history of coming to
Buddhism for support, for a way that I could feel just a little bit better, and
yet, what would it be like to believe in the capacity of the Buddhist teachings
to liberate our hearts and minds from greed, hatred, and delusion, to believe in
the capacity to unbind our hearts and minds?
And I do think there's a place for this love, light, and bliss. Maybe you've had
moments of that during the retreat, and I think that supports us. As we reach
these places of challenge, the peaceful abiding can support us at the same time,
so it's not an either-or. We don't need to throw that part out. In fact, that
essence of the beauty that arises when we have those moments where we have felt
just a little bit of freedom from the defilements of greed, hatred, and delusion
can support us in that inner confidence, the faith on this path of liberation.
And it can allow, we can be resourced, we can allow ourselves to be resourced by
that spaciousness, and by the peace that arises in our meditation practice.
Because it's really necessary for us to remember and pay attention to the body in
those moments when we are not afraid, when we are not afraid to know what that
feels like in the body, when we are calm and contented to have the taste of what
that feels like in the body, and then to remember the capacity of the practice to
transform and not settle for just a little bit more comfort, not to shrink
this vision of the Buddha's teachings, where it's just about getting a little
more comfort for me, maybe for a few of my friends, maybe for my sangha, and then
everyone else, well, you know, maybe when I have more, more something, you know,
more bliss or more enlightenment, then I'll bring them in. And so the Buddha, when
the Buddha speaks about liberation, the Buddha doesn't say liberation is the same
as being pleasant. Sometimes I think, especially because of an association
perhaps from the Christian heritage of heaven, that we think that liberation is
heaven. Hmm, maybe it is, you can let me know when you get there. And I think that
if we think that liberation is pleasant, we may miss the beauty that arises right
in the difficulty. I don't know about you, but there are circumstances that I've
been told that are challenging or difficult, that I found that when I
actually am fully alive for them, that there has just been tremendous beauty.
Albeit, you know, it may not have been the way I wanted things to go, but there is
the capacity, potential for beauty. I had the great honor and opportunity to help
shepherd my dad through his death, 2005. And it was an incredibly intimate,
beautiful experience that I had to really un-armer a lot to spend that amount of
time. I went and lived with my parents for a while during it. I had to really do a
lot of work to un-armer, to be present with my parents for a period of time
that I could help shepherd the family. And it was ironic because, you know, I've
often been seen in my family as someone who's chosen not to be involved, because
although we say it's a little push-pull, because of some of my identities, people
have thought that, you know, there may not be a place for me in the family. And so
for me to show up at a time in the family and to support and to have it be
such an amazingly transformative and beautiful experience for me to bring my
practice to, was really liberating. Not liberating necessarily in terms of
enlightenment, but liberating in the idea that actually, wow, that was amazing.
Like, I was able to be of service in a way that I wouldn't have thought possible.
And so I was able to use this capacity of the practice of the compassion of the
kindness, frankly, for myself, the compassion and kindness right here to be
of service to people who are the reason I'm alive on the planet. And so when
we speak about liberation beyond the capacity to feel pleasant in this
moment, I think the Buddha is speaking to this capacity to attend to the
complexity of emotions that are arising, this capacity to be with ourselves and
our communities in the world.
One of the other things that I'd like to mention in terms of an image that is
useful for me in understanding this complexities and how do we stay with it
is this term that is used frequently or in political circles around drain the
swamp. And when I think about the Buddha being the lotus sitting in the mud, my
sister had brought this this image to my attention and she's a biologist. And so
she was very incensed about this term drain the swamp because it is a misnomer
biologically speaking. That one of the problems with our country historically
has been that we have drained the swamps, that we have gotten rid of this
richness of these marshes and swamps that are one of the biologically most
biologically diverse places on the planet. The salt marshes that we have by the
coast are the places of nurseries for countless plants and animals and they
are so rich. And this attitude of wanting things to be nice and clean and
pretty and discernible and categorizable not in the mud has caused a sense of
control. Let's just clean it up, okay, paradise and put up a parking lot,
right? And yet if we can deal with this disruption, this flow of the marshes,
the muckiness, the complexities and have our practice to know that even if we do
get sucked into the muck and lose a boot, you know, someone in our sangha is going
to be there to pull us out. And so I think this is part of this relationship
to diversity if you will, complexity, inviting in the beauty of our communities
and not walling off from that switch different from us, that which is other,
that which feels uncomfortable, uncertain. And so I think that we can invite in with
our mindfulness and our hard practices, ways that we can meet ourselves and we
can meet each other. And that brings us back to the refuges.
And can we consider the refuges as an offering a manner of protection from the
tendencies of the heart, mind to cling towards what is pleasant, what is known,
what is familiar. And that the refuges can offer that support for the uncertainty
of this complex, diverse, challenging world. And so this teaching of inviting
us into the process of taking refuge is profoundly different than the process
of taking refuge that we are generally invited to into the world where we protect
ourselves by accumulation, by separation, by force, by knowing more.
With the refuges, we're invited into a framework that is based on interconnectedness,
on kindness. We're invited to recognize and turn towards the world, not away.
We're invited to recognize how we also are impermanent in this world,
that we are in this stream. We are not separate.
And I'd like to end with a part of a poem by Joy Harjo, who's our current U.S.
poet laureate, also a member of the Muskegee Nation. And it's called Speaking Tree.
And I thought I would end with this because it relates to the idea of the lotus.
So she says, now I am longing to be a tree planted in a moist dark earth between
sunrise and sunset. I cannot walk through all realms.
I may be a yearning. I cannot bear alone in the dark.
What shall I do with all this heartache?
The deepest rooted dream of a tree is to walk even just a little ways from the place
next to the doorway to the edge of the river of life and drink.
There are trees talking long after the sun has gone down.
Imagine what it would be like to dance close together in this land of water and
knowledge to drink deep what is undrinkable.
Let's just sit a moment and allow the words to rest and letting go.
Thank you so much for your kind attention.
We'll have another walking and movement practice and be back at 5.30 for the
next time.
