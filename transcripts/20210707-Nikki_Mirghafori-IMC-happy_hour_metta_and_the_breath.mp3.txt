 Oh okay got it here so hi hi formerly hello and welcome to happy hour everyone so so for the theme for our practice tonight um I wanted to bring in something that I have recently learned from this book I've been reading called Breath by James Nestor I think I mentioned it some sessions ago and um interesting fascinating book um and one thing that's interesting is some um some study some research that he cites about um exhale exhale being very important and salutary so I want to bring this theme in together with our practice and and merge them together so here we go so so what I knew but discovered again from this this book is that we can only speak when we're exhaling we can't speak or saying when we're inhaling inhale then we talk and then we take another inhale and and um it turns out that again according to to some study is that exhaling fully exhaling completely and elongating the exhale can calm settle quiet the mind and have some effects on not just breathing but the parasympathetic nervous system and and so physiologically can be supportive and helpful now combine that with a tradition of chanting I'm not a big chanter but the big tradition of chanting in both in buddhism and christianity and the many different traditions in the world and um and it turns out that apparently um five and a half in breaths and out breaths per minute is kind of the optimal cycle and also some people some studies suggest having a quicker in breath and a longer out breath so it turns out that what he was suggesting is that if you take some of the famous familiar buddhist chants and christian chants they are roughly the same length the length that it takes to do the chant is about five and a half six seconds uh which translates to this five and a half in breaths and out breaths per minute so oh I thought wow that's an interesting um discovery a coincidence so I've been exploring this the past few days and I've been chanting and and elongating my exhale um and exploring the you know the calming physiological effect with the cultivation of metta cultivation of goodwill cultivation of um well-being in a way well-being internally well-being internal externally for the benefit of all beings so this is the theme I'd like to explore um invite us to explore together tonight and or this morning whatever your time zone may be and see how it goes so so um and given that our practice here primarily is about metta let us explore let us play around with the metta phrases elongating them as if we were chanting singing them and you're welcome in the space you are to either say them out loud if you want first um or maybe kind of hear them in your mind um in your mind's ear uh but be silent but kind of make here exhale elongated so this this idea of of well-being internally goodwill internally goodwill externally so you know in the past we've played around just to put this in perspective um when especially when we did the series on metta we've explored images we've explored different nuances of the words we have explored radiating we have explored so many things and now here we're going to explore the breath the duration of the breath together with wishing well for ourselves for others so something new in this exploration i'm excited i've been having fun exploring it and excited to share it with you so so let's begin let's settle let's settle into let's settle into our bodies is arriving arriving is feeling the breath feeling the breath the in-breath and the out-breath nourishing this body and inviting the sit bones to relax to give their weight to the cushion to the chair to the earth hiding our lower legs to offer their weight to the earth and our feet the entire lower body i'm inviting the inner abdomen as if there were a line a vertical line internally aligning our body relaxing around that this vertical line is both having a sense of integrity around it with our spine straight and also relaxing around it softening the chest neck shoulders arms and hands our face our jaw the eyes resting in their sockets letting the breath move through the body as it will letting it be natural for now in the practice of mindfulness we let the breath be natural receiving it just as it is later in our cultivation practice today with mitta cultivating mitta we will explore lengthening the out-breath with the metaphrases but for now let the breath be natural you you you you you now if you would bringing felt sense the image of someone you care about someone who is easy for you you don't have a complicated relationship with them when you think of them sense of safety care warmth maybe a smile shows up bringing them to your mind's eye their felt sense is alive as present as possible now best to choose someone who's alive if possible if you know your way around this practice there's no longer grief it's okay to bring up someone deceased also as long as they bring up joy and gladness the sense of the felt sense of this being this person this being could be a pet or a child let's offer them the metaphrases you can say them out loud or just say them silently in your mind's ear hearing them elongating the exhale experimenting I'll offer the long phrases for this purpose may you be safe from inner and outer harm dear one may you be safe from inner and outer harm dear one may you be safe from inner and outer harm dear one may you be safe from inner and outer harm dear one now the next phrase will you have joy in your heart dear one May you be happy and have joy in your heart dear one. May you be happy and have joy in your heart dear one. Next phrase. May you be healthy and have strength in your body dear one. May you be healthy and have strength in your body dear one. May you have strength. May you have ease. May your life unfold with ease dear one. May you have ease. May your life unfold with ease dear one. May you have ease. May your life unfold with ease dear one. May you have ease. May your life unfold with ease dear one. May you have ease, may your life unfold with ease, dear one. Now in your own time, experimenting with a longer exhale and the inhale can be half inhale, it doesn't need to be a full inhale, it turns out. Half inhale is fine, but exhaling fully in your own time with the phrases. As you wish, whatever works for you, experimenting. Be slowing it down. May you be safe, dear one. May you be happy, dear one. May you be healthy, dear one. May you have ease, dear one. May you be safe, dear one. May you be safe, dear one. May you be healthy, dear one. May you have ease, dear one. May you have ease, dear one. Experimenting perhaps with saying the phrases out loud, see what it feels like if you can, if you wish. Just the calm that can come, the elongated breath, when the feeling of air, lacking air that might come up, it will go away, a sense of calm, stillness, the air hunger will go away, interestingly. May you be safe, dear one. May you be happy, dear one. May you be healthy, dear one. May you have ease, dear one. May you be safe, dear one. May you be happy, dear one. May you be healthy, dear one. May you have ease, dear one. Keeping the image of your loved one. May you be safe, dear one. May you be happy, dear one. May you have ease, dear one. May you have ease, dear one. May you be safe, dear one. May you be happy, dear one. May you be healthy, dear one. May you have ease, dear one. May you have ease. May you be safe, dear one. May you be happy, dear one. May you be healthy, dear one. May you have ease, dear one. Notice the air hunger will go away, a sense of calm, synchronicity as if the breath becomes synchronized with the wishes, with the images. A sense of alignment arises after a while, after a sense of air hunger goes away. A sense of alignment arises after a while. A sense of alignment arises after a while. A sense of alignment arises after a while. A sense of alignment arises after a while. A sense of alignment arises after a while. A sense of alignment arises after a while.

If you wish you can put the palm in your heart center in the middle of your chest to connect with yourself. For this part, if you have been saying them silently in the past so far, I do invite you to try saying them out loud now. See how it goes, what do you notice? May this being who is me be safe receiving the blessing. May this being who is me be happy. May this being who is me be healthy receiving the blessings. May this being who is me have ease in this moment. May this being who is me be safe letting go of the end of the exhale. May this being who is me be happy and joyful. May this being who is me be healthy. May this being who is me have ease in this moment. Continue to say it in this way or say I if you like. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I have ease in this moment. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I have ease in this moment. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I have ease. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I have ease in your own time, with your own rhythm. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. Now turning the wishes or goodwill or metta, radiating it outward to the entire world, from our heart to our heart center, touching ourselves first, radiating out, touching all those who are near us, near and dear and far away. May all beings everywhere be safe. May all beings everywhere be happy. May all beings everywhere be healthy. May all beings everywhere have ease. May all beings be safe. May all beings be happy, relaxing, letting go the end of the out breath. May all beings be healthy. May all beings have ease. May all beings be happy. May all beings be healthy. May all beings have ease. May all beings be safe. May all beings be happy. May all beings be healthy. May all beings have ease. As we bring this practice period to a close, offering the goodness of our practice to all beings everywhere, sharing the goodness generated, even if we might consider or judge our practice to have been shoddy, trusting there is goodness here, there's goodness generated in this cultivation and aligning our actions with our intentions of goodwill. Sharing this goodness together as a song of far and wide, generosity and gratitude for this breath, letting go of the merits generously, letting go of the out breaths. May all beings everywhere be happy. May all beings everywhere be free. Thank you for your practice. So, today we experimented with the metafreezes, saying them out loud, actually, and exploring, elongating the out breath as if we were chanting, not quite chanting, but as if we were chanting, elongating the out breath especially, and the in breath letting it be as it was half full. And exploring, exploring how the mind can actually be more quiet, become more quiet, with this kind of breathing, make more space for the cultivation of metta. Because the mind is not going here and there and everywhere. In some ways, you know, I've explored, I've described the practice of metta as a three ring circus, whereas there is the image of the loved one, the dear being, there is the feeling of metta, and then there are the phrases. Here now tonight we had a four ring circus, we're juggling four balls, and the fourth one being the rhythm of our breath. So what I noticed and would love to hear what you discovered, that as I've been experimenting with this breathing technique, at first there's a sense of air hunger that comes up when the out breath is elongated, and the in breath is half full, and then there's a sense of calm and peace. The mind becomes more quiet, and I feel as if I've meditated for a long, long time. Right now, even though it's been 30 minutes and I've been talking most of the time teaching, it's so interesting. So I'm curious what you explored, what you discovered, what worked, what didn't, and you can type in chat if it's to everyone. I'll read your name as well as your reflection. If it's just to me, then I will only read your question or your comment, not your name. You can also raise your zoom hand. Yes, and bring your voice into the space. So please don't be shy, especially if you haven't spoken, share it in a while. I would love to hear from you. What did you discover? This is new. Bleeding edge. Neil, please. So I found saying the phrases aloud made this complicated. It felt like there was a lot going on for me. I don't even always say the phrases when I practice metta. Sometimes I will just say the last word, happy or something. So saying the whole sentences and saying even the longer versions to try to drag the breath out, it made the metta less accessible to me, I think. Yeah, thank you for that observation. And how are you feeling now afterwards, given all the complication of the juggling of these balls? Or at the end of your practice? Well, right. I mean, there was a settling. I mean, you talk about feeling settled. I could say things started to be less bad at the end. That's not quite the same thing as feeling settled. So it left me wondering if I would do this more and get better at it. Perhaps it won't be as bad, I guess. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Interesting. Well, it's an interesting exploration. And maybe some other things need to be explored. So let me mention something. So really appreciate your reflection, Nia. So maybe something to explore is elongating the breath, but with reciting them silently, maybe that would make it less busy in the mind because saying is, or maybe just, maybe it's too much to add in one go. So that might be actually something to explore and experiment with. And yeah, getting another reflection here saying similar to you, don't go away, Nia, saying I had a similar experience. My mind was trying to keep up with the pacing of the phrases, but it felt like I wanted to go slower. So I muted the audio so that I could try it on my own. Great. Okay. So it seems like maybe the phrases out loud and this pacing could feel like too much, could feel like too many balls juggled. So, and I appreciate the person who sent me the reflection. So yeah, trying to go it on your own pace, trying to slow it down, trying to go. And yeah, and another thing that could actually maybe exploring this would be to try just one phrase, just try one phrase. And that could be the repetition. It could be that we're rotating or going through the four phrases and the breath, and it's just too much to keep in mind. And I'm confused the phrases at some point where I was too. It is a lot. So, so with the what I was exploring actually, what I was exploring earlier this week was, was in another chant, which is actually a Mahayana chant, which was mentioned in this book because the meta chant again, the meta phrases can be more complicated. So, so I'm just thinking about ways to explore. So, Om Mani Padme Om is what I was exploring. Om Mani Padme Om. And that has a rhythmicness or rhythmicity that can be helpful in maybe doing meta to that. So we can explore. This is fun. Thanks for bringing this up, Neil. We're all exploring this together. Stephanie says, not sure if my camera is off or on. I can't see you, Stephanie. I'm not sure. So, but, but say saying the phrases out loud felt so good. It felt energetic and I enjoyed my hearing my voice blending with yours, Nikki visualizing my friend added energy as well. Thank you. Great. Thank you, Stephanie. Thank you for that reflection also. For adding that the energizing aspect because that's also another thing that saying the phrases out loud can do kind of this energizing. We can't fall asleep because actually that's what chanting does usually on retreats we do chanting at the end of the evening so that it brings up energy. So you don't fall asleep. So, so, so many different, you know, we're exploring here together and figuring out what can work for ourselves. So, Diana, I see you let's make this brief because we're running out of time for the group. So, so, getting of the meditation, I didn't feel right. It's the world at all. At the end, I had just much calm, and was really at peace. I have a question about the in breath but happened because I was trying to get enough going and I was setting up. And then, how do you pace the in breath. Yeah. So thanks for that report. And the question Diana so so according to this, this, these studies, the in breath so it's in breath can be half full. And this is kind of a practice so in breath can be half full. It doesn't have to be full, and the out breath, the exhale needs to be more, more complete. And in fact, this method is taught to athletes to to run or swim and kind of like in training to take a half breath, not filled along fully but can have breath and exhale, extend or exhale as long as possible as a training. So, so that the body can take in more air and the calming effect. I know, it feels like that. But yeah, but then, but then it then it kind of, there's a sense of calm that overcomes the body when one gets used to and again we're exploring you're being scientists of our own mind and body. Jerry says the extension of the expiration over the inspiration was very calming. Yeah, yeah. Thank you, Jerry. Yeah, it tends to be very calming. So, so great. Thank you all for these reflections very interesting what we discover how to tune it for ourselves how we figure we're our own way through this, these are just skillful means just skillful means of what might be supportive for you. So let's turn and practice in small groups in breakout groups of size of three and as always we start with 15 seconds of silent meta for one another and then share as much or as a little exploring this and. And here, the rooms are created with metta for yourself and metta for your fellow travelers. Okay, have fun. Welcome back. The rooms are closed so we have just minute if there are any reflections that you like to share from from what you discovered talking with each other, please don't be shy. So raise your hand type in chat. What did you discover Jerry says reinforce the calming effect being with others. That's great. Thanks, Jerry. Any other reflections. Any thoughts any questions. Last chance on this practice. So, actually, let's take a little pool and we see if this is possible. Would you like to see how can I do this poll quickly. No. No, this is not going to work. Okay, let's try this. Let's try. Let's try. You can try your reactions. So if you want to try this, this practice again here in different ways. Do a yes in your reactions. Choose, choose a the green bar. If you don't want to try this ever again, and happy or do the red the x mark and if you click on reactions I think you'll see the. You can vote. Okay, so we have 10 yeses. No no's. Okay. All right, so we had. Okay, great. So, all right, well we will try it maybe we'll try it a little differently next time, but yeah lots of yeses no no's. So, okay. Will explore violet has her hand race play what violet. It's seven oh one so I'll formally close but I would do want to hear from you. I want to give the chance to people to leave but but I do want to hear from you so is it quick or is it longer. Tell me. It's quick. I just wanted to say, I usually force myself to focus on the in breath to stay awake so I liked the permission to just do the out breath this time. Nice, nice. Great. Thank you. That was quick and that was a lovely contribution. So on that note, the permission to to really focus on the out breath which can be calming relaxing. Maybe we'll bring this again we'll explore different ways of practicing in this way and thank you all. Thank you for your practice and exploring. Thank you all may all beings we be well may all beings be happy, including ourselves. Thank you. I'm gonna
