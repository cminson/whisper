The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Okay, so here we go.
So for today's exploration, continuing with Vedana,
the second foundation of mindfulness,
we'll be exploring today noticing feeling tone,
or valence, or hedonic tone,
all these different translations for Vedana in Pali, V-E-D-A-M-A.
Noticing simply when an object arises in a sense door, any object.
Noticing how when there's contact, when there's contact with consciousness,
there's always, there's always either a sense of pleasant, unpleasant,
or neither pleasant nor unpleasant, which we say short-hand and neutral.
So pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
And it's always together with the object, it doesn't show up alone.
The same way that the color of a book is always with the book.
It shows up, but it's the color, it's the quality of color.
The same way Vedana shows up with the object as the way the mind perceives it.
So today, the invitation that I'll have after we settle with the breath and the body, as usual,
is to notice our relationship to pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
And the same way that a map maker, a cartographer, goes out and surveys the land and just notices what is happening,
just notices with awareness, with mindfulness.
We too, we notice, we become aware of what our relationship is when, say, pleasant arises.
How does the mind relate to it?
Oh, interesting, okay.
Not trying to squash the relationship, not just observing, gathering data, becoming mindful of, for example,
does it happen that if there's something pleasant, we kind of get fixated once more?
If it's unpleasant, we try to push it away?
Let's become curious.
If it's neutral, do we ignore it, become bored?
Let's explore, let's become mindful of our own landscape.
So with that, I'd like to invite all of us to get into our meditation posture,
if you need to lie down, or if you need to move and shift and sit up straight, or perhaps.
And closing your eyes.
If that works for you, or letting the gaze be very soft,
right in front of you, down below,
and relaxing the eye muscles.
Relaxing the forehead.
Letting the forehead be soft.
Letting the jaw be relaxed.
Perhaps opening the mouth.
Taking an out breath.
Relaxing the jaw, letting the jaw close on its own.
Lighting the neck and shoulders to drop.
Chest to be soft.
To be soft.
So be gentle in this moment with yourself.
And with whatever arises.
Inviting your abdomen to be soft, to relax, to receive the breath.
Inviting the arms, the hands to let their weight down.
Inviting the sit bones, your bottom of the chair or the cushion.
To fully relax as if hugging the chair.
As if they're tiny little suction cups.
Landing, connecting to the chair, to the earth.
And letting the center of gravity of your thoughts, of your awareness to drop.
Come down, down, down from our heads.
Down into the chest, to the abdomen, further down into your sit bones.
Lower abdomen, the sit bones, connecting to the earth.
Receiving the breath.
The lower part of the body.
Our bottom, our legs and feet.
The lower part of the body.
Letting the whole body be relaxed.
In fact, let's take the next five out breaths.
Letting every out breath.
Letting go of more tension, more holding.
And you think your body is completely relaxed, still challenging yourself to see if there can be more tension let go of at the next out breath and be surprised.
As you land more deeply, more deeply into this body.
Into the present moment.
And letting your breath be natural, just as it is.
Simply received by the body, the body knowing how to do this.
No need for volitional control, just be aware.
Breathing is happening, that's all.
Breathing is happening, that's all.
Breathing is happening.
Breathing is happening.
And now as you are landed, present with the body and the breath.
Inviting awareness to be available as if you are sitting in the field of awareness that first holds your body and breath.
And it's also available to notice the feeling tone, either pleasant or unpleasant or neutral.
What arises at the sixth sun store, not going out, but staying, staying, landing, present with the body and breath.
And as objects arise, for example, objects of the body door, sensation arises.
You notice the sensation.
And then some pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.
And then allow yourself to notice the relationship of the mind to the feeling tone.
Is there a sense of calm just noticing?
Is there aversion?
Is there a clinging?
Are there stories in the mind?
Simply noticing the Vedana and the relationship of the mind to it.
