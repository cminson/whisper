The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Here we go. So hello and welcome everyone to Happy Hour. Lovely to be
together in this space and to practice together in community. So for today's
practice, given what has been happening on the international stage the past few
weeks, I have been dedicating the sessions of Happy Hour to different
practices to support us in this new world that we find ourselves with with
the war zones and different practices. And for tonight, I think the practice
that I'd like to bring in and support us with is a practice of equanimity.
Equanimity as a support for compassion and equanimity again with a sense of peace,
peace, sense of abiding in equanimity, arriving to it through a calming of the
body, through the calming of the body, the energy body we've worked with at the
past couple of times. And in a way continuing that, I think maybe calming,
centering, arriving is really what can be really helpful and supportive because
on top of that, then the practice of compassion can be more stable instead
of veering into empathetic distress and grief and overwhelm. So we really need
a basis, a basis of calm, base of stability, a basis of groundedness,
especially when times get rough in the world. So that's what I'd love to
invite us to to practice together both for our own sake, whatever is
happening in on in our own lives or challenges or bodies or whatever is
going on. That doesn't stop. It just when when there is more suffering in the
world, maybe it even intensifies our own suffering, our own individual
situations. And for all of this, we need the basis for happiness can is peace.
The Buddha said, peace is the highest bliss. Peace is the highest form of
happiness. And when we first hear that, maybe it's a little quizzical
because peace perhaps seems so settled, you know, there's not a lot of
happiness or bliss to it seems kind of like peace. We think of pieces. Oh,
just peace. Or as happy is like, Whoa, I want that. I want to be happy. I want
to be. Yay, that's where the juice is. Happiness is good is great. Bliss is
great. And yet there is a deep, deep seeded, sated, a deep sated joy to
peace that includes that subsumes joy. Bliss is really the highest bliss. And
we can see that for ourselves experientially. If you if we think about
it, maybe we don't get it because these things are not concepts in such a
constant, you might have the concept that actually does not really
correspond to the true exploration. And I'll share with you that for myself
having explored this path, this meditative path for for decades now. Yes,
states of joy, states of bliss, delicious, yummy, wonderful. Yay. And
the states of peace, deep, deep peace are the most blissful, the happiest
state of all. So, so given that this is happy hour, the states of peace are
the epitome I would I would claim of happiness. So and of course, they
serve as the basis for for equanimity, for compassion practice, for
meta, for all the good, beautiful gifts of the heart comes from peace. Of
course, they can lead to peace also, but come out of peace. All of these
practices are related. They connect to each other. It's like a cloth. You
take a thread, you pull it, the whole cloth is one thread, even though if
he's like, Oh, this is this part of the cloth, it's this part, but it's
just one thread. So so with that, let's practice together. Let's
practice being peace. Let's practice being peace together. So
arriving, arriving in your seat, whether you need to move or shift
right now to be more comfortable, this is the perfect time to do it.
Moving, shifting, perhaps even lying down if that's what your body
needs. And then arriving, arriving in this body, landing in this body.
Here, here.
Here. Can we invite this body, this living, breathing body to
soften, to let go of any tightness or holding?
And also releasing, releasing preoccupations and thoughts, worries,
entanglements. Of course, we all have lives full, complex lives. And in
this moment, bowing to all the complexity, perhaps smiling at it
all, saying, thank you, I'm taking a moment of refuge. Right now,
entering this temple of my heart, entering this temple, entering a
temple, taking refuge. In peace, for the sake of stability, for
the sake of groundedness, for the sake of myself, and all beings
whose lives, mind touches directly and indirectly.
Release, release with each breath. Release, landing more deeply
with each out breath special.
Letting the breath relax and massage an internal
massage, any area of the body that is tight, tense, this expert
therapist, this breath, massaging the neck and shoulders.
Moving to any other part of the body that is tense, the attention
moving with the breath, internally massaging, releasing.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
Let the breath be nourishing, calming, soothing to the body, to the heart.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
Allowing yourself to feel, really feel the entirety of the breath, the beginning, the
middle, the end of the breath, the abdomen, the chest, wherever it's felt.
As a soothing balm.
Calming, the biting in peace, the breath peaceful, creating the space internally.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
Letting the body relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
As if the body is held in this peaceful, loving space, internally, externally.
Nothing to do, nowhere to go, but just to be breathed, undulating each breath.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
If thoughts arise, discussions in the mind, let the peace hold them, let the peace inside
and outside hug them, they don't have to be pushed away or squashed, let them be held.
This undulating ocean inside, outside, there's plenty of space, expansive, there's plenty
of space, no need to be perturbed, plenty of space.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
Letting the breath relax and massage the neck and shoulders.
The breath healing, soothing through the heart center, through the abdomen, through the whole
body.
At some point, maybe the mind, maybe awareness, meets more peace, clicks with, yeah, there
is peace, there is calm in the middle of the storm, it's here, it's always been here.
Awareness clicks, connects, and settles more deeply into the still point.
However small it might be, it's here, it's always been here, and always will be.
If at any point it feels lost, it's okay, trust, it's here, trust it's here, let the
body and mind relax, the breath, be the guide, the gentle loving, gentle loving guide, the
entirety of the breath, to reconnect.
The breath healing, soothing through the heart center, through the whole body.
The breath healing, soothing through the heart center, through the whole body.
The breath healing, soothing through the heart center, through the whole body.
The breath healing, soothing through the heart center, through the whole body.
The breath healing, soothing through the heart center, through the whole body.
The breath healing, soothing through the heart center, through the whole body.
The breath healing, soothing through the heart center, through the whole body.
The breath healing, soothing through the heart center.
The still point inside, outside, expansive.
Still point, so expansive, space of peace, whether or not we're aware of it or connect
to it in this moment, or as much as we're able to connect with it.
Womb, the space of peace, is a womb of equi-poise, equanimity, the risings and passings, the
comings and goings, the 10,000 joys and 10,000 sorrows, being breathed, being breathed,
being breathed,
realizing there is so much more you can contain than you've realized.
Being peace.
The breath healing, soothing through the heart center, through the whole body.
The breath healing, soothing through the heart center, through the whole body.
The strength, the power of peace.

And as we bring this practice period to a close, knowing that our peace, our peace is
the biggest gift to ourselves, to those in our lives and all beings everywhere, offering peace.
Peace starting from within, not hatred, not ill will, but peace.
Love, offering our peace, this cultivation as our gift to ourselves, to others expansively.
May all beings everywhere have peace.
May they be free.
Thank you for your practice everyone.
So I'd love to invite you, if you would like to share some reflections, you can put them in chat.
If they're typed publicly, I will read your name, if they're just typed to me, I will only read your reflection.
And you can also raise your hand, your zoom hand, you'd like to share reflections.
And you also understand if you rather quiet tonight, it's okay.
But what arose, what did you discover, what worked, what didn't?
And again, offering any insights for the benefit of others, for the benefit of others.
Could be questions, aha moments.
One reflection here privately, the meditation this evening is supporting my focus on Anicha, Tukka, and Anatta.
Impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not self.
Many marks of existence, thank you for that reflection, and yeah, thank you for saying that this is supporting that beautiful.
Scott says, very grateful for the space.
Another reflection, peace means non-violence. Yes, exactly.
Larry asks, wondering if peace and open awareness are the same? No, they are not.
This practice I was leading you was not a practice of open awareness.
It was a practice of actually bringing the breath into awareness as the energy body, calming, calming, and then to actually bring peace into your awareness.
It was not directed, it was not open awareness, because open awareness is open, spacious, undirected, wherever awareness goes, it goes.
So these two practices are different.
And their point, their objective is different also.
Thank you for that question.
Catherine says, I was sitting in the garden, being with the sunset, and when I was done, I felt like flowers.
I felt the flowers as my friends. Oh, that's sweet. I love that. The flowers is your friends. The flowers is all of our friends.
Thanks for bringing the flowers in, Catherine. I feel them in the space. Yeah, sweet.
Yeah, another reflection. Privately relieving anguish. Relieving anguish, yeah.
May it be so. Anguish doesn't serve anyone in the world, ourselves or anyone else for that matter.
Not in a state to be supportive. So I'm glad it's being relieved through this practice.
Ah, so we're feeling pretty quiet.
So before I set up the groups tonight, I wanted to say a few words about engaging, how to engage in the groups, in the small groups,
especially as there has been some requests to give more guidance, more instructions.
So please consider the breakout groups as sacred space, sacred space, both for yourself and specially for others,
as a way to really respect each person's experience.
So please consider, first of all, being embodied, being embodied. It's not a place to talk from your head and just blah, blah, blah.
Maybe you actually don't say anything and you just hold witness, kind, compassionate witness for others. That's perfectly okay.
And if you choose to share, if you choose to speak, please speak from your own experience. I, me, my experience.
And it's a way of, again, not trying to impress others, not trying to educate others.
You're just sharing what feels safe and comfortable for you in order for others to hold you witness.
You're speaking for your own benefit. I say it again, you're speaking for your own benefit, not benefit of anyone else.
It's a very different way of relating. You're speaking for your own benefit. It's quite revolutionary.
You're speaking for your own benefit.
I'm going to say it one more time, you're speaking for your own benefit and you only speak from your own experience, not asking questions of others, probing others, commenting on their experience.
Please don't. You're not here to facilitate in small groups, or especially if you act as a therapist or other helping professions, please leave that outside.
Leave their profession outside. Here, you're only speaking from your own experience. If you wish, maybe you're just being silent. That's okay.
But do not reflect. Do not give advice to one another.
Be very careful in this sacred space. It's a very beautiful sacred space of relating to one another.
We really learn how we can be different with friends and family and others. This is a precious sandbox.
Don't take it as small groups. Here we go. Chatting. Please don't. In fact, also be very aware of the time.
The format I like to suggest from now on is that you don't do a monologue for like two, three minutes and then pass on.
No, each person will just say one nugget. Just one nugget. And then the next person will say a nugget about their experience. And then the next person says something about their experience.
And then again, the first person. And then you go around. It's a spiral format. You go around and around just sharing.
And it comes to you. You can say pass. I'm holding witness tonight. I'm just holding other. That's okay. Just relating in this way.
In a very different way. It's not just go chat amongst yourself. So I really want to take time tonight.
Again, you're speaking for your own benefit. Please do not manage or facilitate.
Just spiritual friends, a space of spiritual friends and entering with respect, entering this temple with two other human beings whose lives are as complex and dear as yours are to you.
So, so having said all of that, having said all of that, I'm going to create groups and take a moment here to do a bit of rearranging, arranging.
Okay, I think I have one more thing. I have the groups. Okay. So, all right, all set. I'm going to open the rooms.
Oh, no, I need to recreate the whole lot. It's always happens. Numbers change.
So meditate with peace, meditate with peace as the counts keep changing.
Okay. All right.
So, so opening the rooms, take care of yourselves and each other. Here we go.
The groups are now closed. Everybody's back. Any reflections you'd like to share from, from the breakout groups and what it was like, especially today with extensive invitations as how to be in the group was a different, I wonder, in terms of the reflections.
You're welcome to raise your hand if you want or type in chat.
Raise your zoom hand because if it's your physical hand, I may not see it.
Any reflections about the practice, about what you discussed?
Short one, 30 seconds.
Ah, nice. Nancy says we were all appreciating the silence between sharing. Beautiful. Oh, I'm so glad there was a lot of silence. Nice. Esther, please.
Hi. I appreciated the instructions. It helped me to relax. Actually, it helped me to feel like safer. And I like, I appreciated the framework.
I felt that I could open up within that framework.
Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you for that reflection. Appreciate it. So feeling safer and can open up. Great. Thank you. Barbara.
I also appreciated the instruction. I think my tendency would be to ask a question and I refrained. So there was much more quiet reflection. So had a different feel to it.
Great.
Great. Beautiful. Thank you for that. And Meredith, please.
Hi. Thank you. Yeah, I also, I'm an over-talker.
And I found the silence comforting.
Great.
I also found a tiny tad of dialogue with someone extremely helpful.
Nice. Great. And I appreciate that it seems like the dialogue came out of the silence, which is a different way, right? To have a dialogue.
Yeah. Beautiful. Thank you for that reflection. Yeah. Thank you all. Thanks to all of you for the reflections that you share. This is very, very helpful.
So I think maybe moving forward, always giving more instructions about going into the group and, oh, we're out of time now. One last reflection. Catherine says, love the flow and connection created by sharing small jewels one by one.
Beautiful. So thank you all. Thank you for your practice.
Being peace for yourself, for each other, for the whole world. May all beings know true peace and be happy. May all beings, including ourselves, be free.
Thanks everyone. Be well. Thank you. See you on Friday. Bye.
