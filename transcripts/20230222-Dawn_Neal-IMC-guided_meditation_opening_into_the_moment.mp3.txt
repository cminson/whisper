 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning. Good morning, IMC Global, SONDA. Nice to see you. I just love looking at all these greetings, these warm greetings in the chat. I'm seeing the weather report from different parts of the country, different parts of the world. It got really chilly here in the Bay Area last night and yesterday. So I hope wherever you are, you are comfortable, dry, feeling the warmth and the friendliness. It's just inspiring to be with all of you. So we are at seven o'clock Pacific time. And so invitation is to drink in any of the good feelings from the greetings and the chat. And to start to consciously bring those into your heart, into your mind and savor them, savor them. Enjoy the refuge of SONGA. And then taking a deep breath or two. Allow your gaze to soften. Perhaps your eyes to close. Really intentionally relaxing, softening your eyes. Allowing the breathing to return to normal. Maybe a slight smile to come to the lips. It softens and relaxes the mind. It softens and relaxes the muscles around the mouth and the face. And softening the tongue. Softening the eyes, the face, the tongue sends a message, a message to the rest of the body that it's okay to relax the parasympathetic rest system. And attuning to your surroundings. Acknowledging whatever is in the space that you occupy in this moment. Perhaps noticing the contact of your feet or your buttocks, the floor or cushion or chair. Noticing the contact of your skin against clothing or air. Perhaps your hands are touching each other or your lap. Allowing, allowing yourself to be here, immersed in this moment. And really scanning through your body. Noticing any sensations, areas of tension, relaxation, cool or warmth, solidity or spaciousness. Turning into the aliveness in the body. The sensations of your body breathing or perhaps all the little pulsings and tinglings that let you know you're alive. Hmm. Now scanning through the heart and mind. Noticing any contraction or openness there, scatteredness or settledness. And inviting kindness, kind awareness of all of it. Opening to being generous with this moment. Allowing the heart, the mind, the attention to settle on. Whatever keeps you most easily connected to this moment. Breathing, sound, sensation, metta, whatever it is. Sowdling. Sowdling. Sowdling. Sowdling. Sowdling. Time to time, relaxing, opening further into the flow, into the flow of the moment. Inviting the experience of now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. as the mind and heart settle, perhaps noticing, knowing, the space of between, the arising, the passing and the space between sound, between an in-breath and an out-breath, between thoughts or sensations, maybe settling, softening into the space at the bottom of the out-breath, for allowing the next in-breath to refresh the awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
