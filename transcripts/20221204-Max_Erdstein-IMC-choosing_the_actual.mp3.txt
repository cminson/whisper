 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So, good morning again. And it's very sweet for me to be back here at IMC on a Sunday morning. It's been a few years since I've been teaching in person in the morning. So, I'm happy to see that it's going again and great to wish I could see your whole faces. Hopefully soon, things will feel like they're getting back to normal, kind of a new normal in a way. But that's, you know, what is normal anyway? There's always a new normal. I was thinking about how nice it is, how nice it feels to sit in the meditation posture. And, you know, if you've been meditating for a while, you know that we develop certain associations with the posture meditation. Whatever it looks like, you know, for each of us, it's going to be individual in a sense, and you know, what makes sense for our body. But to get into the meditation posture, which I think is physical, but it's also mental, you know, there's a wonderful teaching in the classic Buddhist text, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, by Suzuki Roshi, who was the founder of the San Francisco Zen Center, and I know I came into my mind, but it says something like, when we assume the posture for meditation, and I was kind of thinking, yes, when we assume the posture for meditation, oh, that means that's the posture where we can focus, right, and concentrate, and clear our minds, and settle our minds. But he doesn't say that. He says, when we assume the posture of meditation, we can accept things as they are. And just that flavor that this practice is not really about mastery, you know, it's not about accomplishing something, figuring something out. Maybe there's some of that, or some of that comes along, but it's much more, the flavor of it is about receiving, accepting. So in my mind, when I remember that, it's like this switch gets flipped from mastery to surrender. And mastery, you know, it's like there's a lot of ego in that, I think, you know, and there's a lot of me, and I'm going to do something and get something, or maybe I won't get something, and that's awful too, it's worse. One of my teachers says, the only thing worse than someone who thinks he's not enlightened is someone who thinks he is enlightened. You know, they're two sides, kind of, of the same coin. So, so in this posture, in this physical and mental posture, we can accept things as they are. And then when we accept things, and accept this moment, and accept ourselves, we're not searching for some particular state of mind, or some particular thing, we're not looking outside of this moment, but it's more like whatever the state of mind is, we already have it. So, that's a little bit of my preamble to this quote, this teaching that I came across recently. You know, with these things on the internet, it's hard to know if it's, if it's apocryphal, or, you know, where does it come from, who said it? It's attributed to Joseph Campbell, who is, apocryphal means that it's of kind of unknown origin. Yeah, yeah, I think. Yeah. Yeah. We'll have time for questions after. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, it might be apocryphal, and it's attributed to Joseph Campbell, but whoever said it, I think it's great. And he says, we must be willing to let go of the life we planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us. You know, when I saw this, and I thought, oh yeah, that's really the Dharma, that's really this practice. And I think for many of us, the doorway into this practice is really the Dharma, that's really the Dharma, that's really this practice. And I think for many of us, the doorway into this practice is in some way or another, the plans we have, plans we had, the picture we have of who we are and what our life is about, in some way gets disrupted. And it may be some difficulty, some unexpected difficulty, some change in our health, our physical or mental health, some change in career or relationship or whatever it is. Life has a way of, not going to use bad language of messing with our plans. Life kind of rubs our nose in it, sometimes. And so, we must be willing to let go of the life we planned. And when I saw this, it reminded me of one of the early teachings I received when I was practicing here. I've been involved with IMC and Gil since around the year 2000, 1999 or 2000, so it was wild. And I was in my early 20s and I remember taking, this is my memory, it could be apocryphal, but my memory is taking a walk with Gil and Gil saying, talking about something and Gil saying, when life gives you or when you have the choice between the ideal and the actual, what do you choose? And I said, well, the ideal, because the ideal is ideal, right? Shouldn't we want the ideal? And in my memory, he said something like, Max, the ideal doesn't exist. He said, oh, yeah, right. So, I think in a way this teaching is pointing to this decision, this choice that we often in our mind have of the ideal versus the actual. And the invitation of this practice is to choose the actual, to come back to the actual, to come back to what's happening. Because all there is is the actual. And, you know, of course we want the perfect something, whatever that means, the perfect teacher, the perfect partner, the perfect parents, the perfect, you know, but that doesn't exist. You know, it doesn't exist maybe in the way that we think about it. But I think the great realization of this practice, or the great offering of this practice, is to discover a certain kind of perfection in the actual, a certain kind of completeness in this moment, when I'm not comparing it to some other moment in this meditation, when I'm not comparing it to, oh, I was a lot better last time, or so, so, so. You know, when we're fully immersed in this, it's perfect. It's perfectly itself. And this is, I think this is a gift of meditation, and it's also a gift that we can bring into our life, with people in our life, to experience them as perfectly themselves. You know, not comparing to. And, you know, with the holiday season, it's often joked that this is the great test of our practice, of our wisdom, of our equanimity, right? You know, going home for the holidays, whatever that means. And so can we let go of the holidays that we've planned, and be open, be willing to have the experience that's waiting for us? There's something about planning, I think. Maybe it's just that meditators notice, we notice our planning a lot more than folks, maybe, who don't meditate. We just sit and stew in it. But I remember early in my practice really getting this visceral sense that there is a payoff to planning. You know, I mean, of course, planning is a good thing in life in general. It's good to think about the future, and organize ourselves, and make plans. But there's also a way that I found for myself that this mental function of planning, and mapping out the future, and projecting myself into the future, that functioned in a way of relieving a certain kind of tension, you know, the tension of the unknown, the tension of uncertainty. Oh my God, what's going to happen? I have to make a decision about that? Okay, well, I just, you know, plan it out. So this, you know, it's just helpful to see that, to see the way that whatever is happening in meditation, whether we're daydreaming, whether we're fantasizing, whether we're planning, whether we are lost in the past, in memories, in nostalgia, there's a function, there's a reason, you know, it's not random. And there's a certain kind of payoff in that. And often we find, or often I find, that when this moment, when the actual, when there's something uncomfortable about this actual moment, then that's when it's like, well, maybe there's a kind of pleasant fantasy that could be substituted right now. Or maybe there's a kind of some planning and figuring out that I can substitute right now and focus on that instead of, you know, the discomfort, the physical discomfort, or the mental discomfort in this moment. So just to notice, just to notice this. And I think once we've lived for a little while, you know, we sort of notice or figure out that planning has a kind of limitation to it. Life doesn't seem to ever, you know, at least in my experience, go according to our plans. And that's a good thing, I think, because the plans I had 20 years ago may have been great plans, but were also by their, by definition, by they were limited. They were limited to what I could see then, what I knew, my life experience, they were limited by, you know, the circumstances of that time. So I'm glad, you know, my life hasn't unfolded according to some idea that was stuck 20 years ago, or 30 years ago. And you know, my kids who were in grade school, and, you know, sometimes say I wonder, you know, I wonder what I'm going to be when I grow up and what you know, one of them, at least at this moment, one wants to be an artist and an astronaut. And the other one wants to be a YouTube star. And, you know, great. But you know what I say to them, you know, there will be ideas and careers and opportunities and interests when you're grown up that probably haven't even been invented yet. And so keep an open mind, you know, and be willing to try new things. And so I think that's what this teaching is about. It's like to stay, can we stay open and not get caught and stuck in, because planning, and that's kind of dead. It's like an abstraction. And then when I remember that, and I come back into this lived experience, this lived moments, like, Oh, yeah, there's a lot more going on that I that I'm not even I can't even see. And to stay open to that. I also think that it's it's tragic when we get so what I want to say so I think that's a very, very tragic story. In this area in Silicon Valley. It's a it's a recurring news story that high schoolers and college students, you know, Stanford is right, right down the street here. And I don't know the particular details of any one particular case. But having been in, you know, in in that community myself and I was an older student at Stanford who helped to look after some of the younger students in the residence halls. And we had mental health crises and suicide attempts and things like this. And when if I'm a young person, and my whole sense of who who I am is inextricably intertwined with achievement in a certain way, and, and, and getting, you know, the thing that I've set out to do and accomplishing that. And if you're able to do that, and then all of a sudden you hit a wall, and you for whatever reason we can't that can be very disorienting and destabilizing. And so, you know, to let go of the, to be willing to let go of the life we have planned. This can be a life and death thing. You know, this is, this is, this is real, you know, and how, how, how tightly do I hold on to something, some idea that's not serving me well. That's not even true. That's not, you know, and we think, Oh my God, these, these kids have such a amazing future ahead of them, and, and, and can can offer so much to the world, but, you know, we can get get caught in something. So, you know, I think about this, and I was, you know, just this on this topic of young people, it's not only young people, but it's you know, I think it's especially an issue among younger people can be. I was at a lecture by the great physician and psychiatrist Gabor Mate, some of you might know who he is. He, he wrote a very important book about addiction. It was called In the Realm of the Hungry Ghosts. And he has a new book out called The Myth of Normal. And, and he was asked, and so he gave a talk and then he was, he was asked, how can we not screw up our kids? You know, everybody laughed and then he said, it's too late. Well, then he said something quite wonderful, which I have been chewing on for all these years. And he said, he said, just love them. He said, just love them and let them teach you what they need. And isn't that, isn't that wonderful? You know, that I noticed with my kids that they're each different. They come, come, kind of come into this world with their own personality and temperament. And, and I think we each have our own destiny. We're each on our own path. And so to be careful of that, you know, for me to be careful of you should do this and this and this and then this and, you know, and then your life will be like this and you'll be happy. And one of my friends whose father was a, was a medical doctor, a physician, he said, I'm going to give you total freedom in life. You can be any kind of doctor you want. So do we do this as parents? Do we do this as partners, as friends? And, you know, it's such a gift to be present and connected enough and respectful enough to another person that we were perceiving who they are and letting them show us who they are and what they need and responding to that. You know, there's a kind of softness and flexibility of mind that is hard. You know, it's, we have our, we have our issues. And so in this practice, you know, it can be, if we let it, if we let go of our agenda, I think what's supposed to happen. I think what I'm supposed to do, how we're supposed to be. If we let go of that, we can just love ourselves, you know, just love other people and let this moment teach us what's needed right now. You know, and sometimes what's needed will be a lot of care, a lot of kindness, a lot of compassion, you know, this sense of meditation as just pouring the water of compassion over our heads. And then sometimes what's needed is a little, you know, sit up straighter, you know, follow the breathing, come back to the breath, you know, open the eyes, stay here, sharpen the mindfulness. And you know, so to be sensitive, to be responsive to what this moment is asking us. And there's no formula, just like I think with parenting, there's no formula. In life, there's no formula. We're, we're responding. We're meeting the moment, we're responding. And maybe, and maybe this can be most challenging with the people in our life who we think we know the best. We know them all, I know. I know what they're going to say. I know how they are, you know, and that is understandable, you know, but it shuts something down rather than opening it up. And what it does is it freezes ourselves and others in a certain moment in time. And it doesn't, it doesn't allow the possibility that this person has changed, that I've changed, of course we've changed, you know. And so, for myself, and I offer that, as we go into, you know, this holiday season, which can bring up a lot of different emotions for a lot of different reasons, but sometimes it is about complicated relationships with people we are familiar with, familial with. You know, can we stay open to the actual and what's in front of us and not letting it be so clouded by history and memory and ideas. And then it's like, what could have been frozen is really alive. And that creates possibilities, you know. When we just show up and we're present, just like in sitting, we're present, we're open, stuff is going on, maybe unexpected sounds, maybe unexpected feelings in the body, unexpected thoughts, and we're just open to it and stay with it and respond to it. When we bring that into our life, there's more chance for possibility, for serendipity, for connection. And so I always, I love to, you know, when I remember, when I'm present enough, to just stay open to these moments of connection. And they're not necessarily these deep conversations. They may be going to the store, the grocery store, to buy something, and in the moment you connect with the person, or connect with the checkout person, or this or that. It's great. It's great. Maybe I'll end with this quote, another quote, another teaching. And this is something I quite like. It's from Kosho Uchiyama, who was one of the great Buddhist monks and teachers from Japan in the last century. And Uchiyama Roshi, Roshi means, you know, kind of respected teacher, Uchiyama Roshi was known for having, for offering these retreats in Japanese, they call seshin, just like a kind of meditation retreat. But he called it a retreat without toys. And the toys in his mind were the walking meditation, and the chanting, and the dharma talks. So these are kind of the elements of a retreat, you know, the sitting and walking, and then the talks, and then the meetings with the teacher, which is called, you know, in Japan, dokusan, or practice interview, and the chanting. And so those are the toys for him. So get rid of all the toys. So what's left? Well, just silent sitting, and then silent bowing. So they would have a period of sort of service, where normally maybe they would be chanting, but they would just do the silent bowing. Maybe it also like stretched their legs or something. So what interests me about that idea of a retreat without toys, or a practice without toys, is that I get a feeling that there's something very pure about it in a way. There's not even a talk for someone to kind of put something in your mind, or say, hey, do it like this, or think about this. It's just, you're just there with yourself, you know, and just meeting yourself over and over and over again. So I haven't done one of these, you know, I think he did a hundred day one when his teacher died. I think normally they were like seven days. So I'll let you know if we do something like that here, but don't hold your breath. But he says, so, okay, so he says, to fall in love is ecstasy, but marriage is everyday life. Everyday life has rainy days, windy days, and stormy days. So you can't always be happy. It's the same with meditation. There are two kinds of meditation transmitted in Japan. One understands meditation as ecstasy, and the other understands meditation as everyday life. You know, so if we have some idea in our mind that we should be experiencing ecstasy, whether in our meditation or our life, you know, reliable to suffer, reliable to be disappointed at times, reliable to struggle and resist the actual experience of what's happening, because I have this idea in my head. But if meditation itself is everyday life, whatever the weather is, you know, then, oh, okay, that's something I can settle into. That's something that every single one of us not only can do, we're already doing it, you know. Someone once asked Suzuki Roshi that's then teacher, something like, it's like, this practice is impossible. And he said, yes. And then they said, if it's impossible, how can we do it? And he said, you do it every day. You know, you're already doing it. So he goes on to say, I don't know if I should keep going, but maybe I'll just share a little bit more. He goes on to say, a basic concept in Buddhism is that subject and object are one. The significance of this depends on whether you interpret the samadhi of oneness as a psychological condition of ecstasy that mystically transcends the limits of the everyday mind or whether you actually practice it in your daily life. So what does it mean to practice this oneness in our daily life? And for me, that means to be fully in the middle of our life without resistance, to show up and to be totally here and just do this and just do this. And when it's time to drive the kids to soccer, that's what we do. When it's time to meditate, that's what we do. When it's time to eat, enjoy your food. I remember one of the early days of Tassajara, this Zen monastery that we have in Carmel Valley, the Japanese teach, you know, I think in the 60s everybody smoked maybe, but the Japanese teachers would come and they would say, don't walk and smoke. You know, when you smoke, sit down and enjoy your cigarette. Be at one with what you're doing. And we don't use that example so much anymore. But whatever life gives us, can we keep our awareness? And so he says, it is the practice of continuous awareness in the midst of delusion without attachment to delusion or enlightenment. The practice of continuous awareness in the midst of delusion. Isn't that great? So it's like, not quite that we're going to remove delusion. One day we're going to remove all delusion and there'll only be what? Clarity, enlightenment, peace. It's the practice of continuous awareness right in the midst of delusion, which is also called our life, you know, without being attached to what happens. There was a great scroll teaching in the meditation hall that said something like, don't remove delusion. Don't even seek the truth. Isn't that what we're... this practice is? Don't remove delusion. Don't even seek the truth. To me, this means to return to the actual, you know, to choose the actual. And the actual moment, the actual experience is much closer, is much more alive than any of these labels, you know. And then maybe there's a way that these two forms of meditation that he's talking about, they meet somewhere in the middle and become one in the middle. And we can experience the beauty and completion and joy and wonder of this ordinary moment in our everyday life. Thank you very much. Do we have time for questions? Yeah? A little bit? Okay, so if anyone has a... yeah? I have a question that I guess is just... like this? Yeah, hold it real close to you. How's that? Yeah, good. Okay, I have a question maybe a little more talking and nuance about the actual versus ideal. I think what confuses me and comes up a lot is when I hear actual and acceptance, it quickly turns into complacency. And when I hear ideal, I hear a different set, you know, of aspiration and tension. It seems more drawing. And the example I was thinking of is like, and maybe this is apocryphal, to use the word of the day, you know, the sort of picturing someone like Nelson Mandela, whose actual on many days was whatever his experience was in prison, right? Very actual. And yet there's an actual that was also that he was actually the potential of a transformative change. So how do you be present to the actual that's the taste of your food, your feet on the floor, and also the actual that is bigger? And I think that is not complacent. That is maybe what drew you to that word ideal and draws me. Yeah, beautiful. Yeah, great question. So, you know, I agree with you. And I think that there's a way that we're drawn to the ideal, you know, and there's probably something wholesome and productive and beautiful in that. And then also something that's not that great in that attraction to the ideal. And like you said, you know, what's beautiful about it is that the human imagination can conceive of the way things can be better and should be better. And that's important. I don't think any of us would, you know, be ill served by having the widest, deepest, grandest aspirations for ourself and for our life and for the world. So that's important. And then the other side of that is how do I relate to that ideal? And is the ideal something that I'm measuring myself? Is it a tool to just hate myself more? You know, well, look at the, look at Nelson Mandela. He didn't complain. Why am I complaining? You know, the coffee's cold. You know, that's not that great, I think. And so how do we, you know, I think it comes back to, you know, kind of like I said, the posture, the relationship that we have to these ideas and to these concepts, can we use our hopes, our dreams, our aspirations to inspire us, you know, to set the direction of our life in a wide way? And then can we skillfully know when to set that aside, especially in the experience of meditation? Yeah, I want to, you know, my goal is to really deeply understand these great refined meditation states and this and that and that and that. Great. But when we sit down to meditate, if I'm thinking about those refined meditation states, that's not going to, first of all, it's not going to help me get there. And it's also, I'm totally missing what's happening right now. And it may be what's happening right now is I'm caught in a loop of thinking about these great things. That's fine, as long as we're aware of that. But so is there a way, maybe as you're pointing to in the question, like that the actual and the ideal sort of merge, that we are connected enough to use the ideal in a skillful way to know when to let it inspire us and to know when it's getting in the way. And actually, the way there, whatever there is, is only through here. There's no other place that I can train on the breath than this particular breath in this moment. It's like, well, I'll be with the breath in about five minutes. That never tends to work. Well, or the next Sunday or in the next retreat. So many times I've been on retreat, I'm planning out my next retreat because in the next retreat, it's going to be a little better. The next retreat, I'll really be present. It's like, hello, I'm here on retreat right now, but I'm thinking about the next retreat. So this is what our minds do. But I think there's an important place for ideals and for idealism. And one of the other ways that those loop back and connect is the more I'm actually present and aware of how things are now, that can give me an understanding and an inspiration for what needs to change. If I'm not aware of how things are, then I'm not necessarily conscious of the problems, the deficiencies, and that could be speaking personally, that could be on a societal level. You know, hey, the more I connect with whatever it is, this company, this group, this thing, there's something about this community that doesn't feel right to me, needs to change or needs to grow, needs to be included. If I'm, oh, it's a Buddhist community, it's perfect, that's a kind of idealism. But if I'm really here with the actual, then I see with clarity how it is and then can be inspired to do something and change something. So I think it can act against complacency if we let it. But it's a great question and it's a nuanced thing. Thank you. I have three kids in college and they're all coming home for the holidays and they all came, oh, that's better, and they all came home for Thanksgiving. And this was the first time it happened just like this, you know, them all coming back to this house. So my question is, I understand how to love them, but they don't always understand how to love each other. And it was interesting and a little scary for me to watch them get back together and old feuds spark up and things like that. Do you have any thoughts on how I can help them with that process? Yeah, yeah. In about ten seconds I'll... The first thing that came into my mind was that I can imagine, and just remembering from my own experience, there's a way that, especially when young people go away to college, it's an exciting time and this thing. But there's a lot of different kinds of pressures. And there can be a lot of... I want to say, like, you know, trying on different personas, different kinds of people, you're in it, you know, it's the first time you're on their own, but that kind of tension. And then when you come back home, it's like, not only, you know, maybe is it a comfortable place or a place where you can kind of let go of some of that tension, but it's also... It's sort of like when you've been on your best behavior all day and then you come home and scream at someone at home, which you would never do at work, or you would never do, you know, because it's like all that willpower has been spent up trying to be likable and this and that and studious. And then you kind of... It's exhausted. And then you kind of come home and it's like, all right, it's free for all, you know, and just let the demons come out. And so I don't know exactly if that's what's happening, but, you know, I think that, you know, as a parent, what we can do is to, you know, is to love them and is to, you know, as much as we can create a space where maybe underneath, you know, whatever, you know, if you come back and there's anger and there's kind of, you know, maybe underneath that anger is some sadness or some loneliness or some fear, vulnerability. So if there's any way that we as parents can help them touch into and express, you know, some of the maybe closer, you know, more, you know, emotions that might be driving some of this then that could be helpful. But I, you know, I think, you know, they're old enough now that they, you know, might need to be responsible for their own actions and impact on others. But, you know, that's what I would say. And then hopefully they'll be gone soon. So back to their wonderful lives. But, you know, that sibling relationship is such a complicated thing. And it's my daughter, my two girls who are 10 and 8 and then a little boy who's much younger. But my daughter was asked to write an essay about the most influential person in her life. And she chose her sister. Her younger sister, two years younger. And she said, my sister is my best friend and my closest. And, you know, she's always there for me. We walk to school together every morning. We sleep in the same bed. She protects me when my parents are upset. She cheers me up when, the youngest is very funny. And she kind of makes me laugh when I'm nervous about something. And so I read this to my wife. And my wife had kind of teared up. And she was like, who are these girls? I don't recognize them. You know, because they're fighting and they're this and they're that. Of course they're close. But I think that from inside a sibling relationship, it may look and feel very different than it looks to us. You know, and to also remember that, that they have this unshakable bond, hopefully. Two of mine are twins. Yeah. Boy-girl twins. Yeah. The trickiest pairing there can be in any siblings. What did you say? Two of mine are twins, boy-girl twins, which is the trickiest, most fraught sibling relationship, according to those studies. Wow. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. So it's complicated. But we don't really see what they have. And so, yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Good luck. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.
