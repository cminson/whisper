 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. And then with another moment, taking another inhale, slow exhale. May awareness fill this heart-mind, inviting receptive awareness into the forefront of your attention. Allowing awareness to take in the full scope of experience. Sound, sensation, the visual field of the closed eyes. And then dropping in, perhaps, the inquiry. What is the attitude of the heart and mind right now? Whatever that is, holding it lightly, allowing, receptive allowing. Relaxing, receiving, letting be. If it is the habit of your practice, allowing whatever anchor you use to be part of what is known in the mind. Perhaps knowledge of the breath emerges. The body itself, perhaps just awareness of mind itself, mental phenomena. Receiving naturally, no effort, no problem. Noticing sensations, impulses. Especially noticing, is the mind relaxed or tense? Is the heart relaxed or tense? Is the body tense or relaxed? No need to change. And it's okay to invite the relaxation in. Allowing the mind, the attention to touch and be touched by whatever comes up. Easy, lightly. Allowing. Allowing. Allowing whatever is unfolding in experience to be known. Simply known. Allowing. Allowing. To drop in a wisdom reflection question. Are you aware? What is obvious in this moment? What is the attitude of this heart and mind? The mind is wondering. Notice the experience of mind wandering. The mind is calm and peaceful. Notice. What's this moment like? What's this moment like? What's this moment like? What's this moment like?
