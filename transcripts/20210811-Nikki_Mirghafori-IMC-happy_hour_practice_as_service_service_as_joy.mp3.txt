 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So, hi, hi everyone. A warm welcome to HAPPR. So nice to be with you. So, for today's practice together, I'd like to consider the theme, the consideration of our practice, our practice as service. What if our practice is service to ourselves, to the world? And this practice, HAPPR, this practice of celebration, cultivating joy, cultivating metta, cultivating kindness, cultivating goodness. I want to share a poem as inspiration and this poem is called Service is Joy. It's by Rabindranath Tagore. I spell the name R-A-B-I-N-D-R-A-N-A-T-H. Tagore, T-A-G-O-R-E. It's a very short poem. I didn't memorize it. I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy. Isn't that a great poem? Gives me a lot of joy. I'll read it one more time. I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy. So with that as the theme, with that as the inspiration, what if our practice, our practice is offering, our practice is joy. What if our practice is service, service to ourselves, service to others, practice as joy, practice as joy, practice as service, all of these the same exploring the equivalence of practice, practice in general, but here in particular practice of metta, cultivation of kindness, goodwill for ourselves, for others. As service, as cultivation of joy as service, service as joy, practice as joy. So that's the invitation for tonight, for this afternoon, this for this moment in time, wherever you are, for our practice together. So having set the frame, let's begin formally. Ah, let's land, let's land in our bodies. Landing in this moment in time. Arriving in this body in this moment, whatever the circumstances, connecting connecting the felt sense of the sit bones on the cushion or bottom kissing the earth, our feet kissing the earth, our body softening relaxing into the earth, kissing the earth so Connecting with the breath. Slowly slowing down the breath. Slowing down the in-breath. Just here relaxing, slowing down the body. Into this moment unwinding, slowly giving yourself space. Slowing down your body, your heart, your mind, your breath. Maybe breathing to the count of five and breathing out to the count of five. Letting go of the counting, slowing down even more. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You If you find If you wake up to the mind having wandered Ah, Dear mind, oh sweetheart, it's okay. This of the nature of awareness of knowing of the mind to think. It's okay. Seeing clearly what is arising in this moment, what's thought. Smiling at it. Hello, solid. High, friendly, light hearted. And landing back, landing back. No need, smilingly, landing back. With the body, with the breath. Enjoying, enjoying this process of sitting and being breathed. If we don't judge ourselves, if we don't reprimand ourselves, force ourselves, expect a tight way for things to go a certain way in our practice. To have aspiration, but not expectation. Practice can become easy, practice can become joyous. Practice as joy. See if you can give yourself space. To relax, to soften, to slow down, to enjoy. A moment of quiet, of solitude, of turning inward, of just sitting and being breathed. Thank you. Thank you. Now can there be a sense of breathing in well-being, breathing in goodness, gladness, good wishes for yourself, breathing it in? As if it's offered to you in each breath, feeling your body, feeling your lungs, and then breathing it out, with each out breath sharing it with the world. May I be safe in the out breath, in the in breath, in the out breath, may all beings be safe. In breath may I be happy, out breath may all beings be happy. In breath may I be healthy, out breath may all beings be healthy. In breath may I have ease, and then turning it around and sharing it expansively with the whole world, just as I wish for myself. May the whole world, all beings have ease. This might be reduced to just one word, if you synchronize it with the breath. Breathing in, pea, breathing in, safe, safe. Breathing out, safe. Breathing in, happy. Breathing out, happy. As a wish to all. Breathing in, health. Goodness, breathing out, health. All beings. Breathing in, ease. Breathing out, ease. Or just simply breathing in, goodwill, gladness, wellbeing, whatever word, single word works for you. Breathing out, the same for the whole world. Maybe just simply that. If it's starting to feel complicated. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can we consider our practice? Breathing in goodness, breathing out, shining out goodness onto the world, as service. Practice as service to ourselves and others. Thank you. Breathing in, goodwill, friendliness. Breathing out, goodwill, metta, love, friendliness. Trusting that you are needed. You are needed. Your service, your participation in life in the unique way. Your service that you show up is needed. Trusting, trusting your participation, your service. Your service is needed. Breathing in love, breathing in metta, breathing out metta. Trusting your participation, your service. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well metta, love, be breathed and not yours, simply offered, trust. Trusting that love is offered, compassion is offered. You are held in it by the universe. Your service is offered, and your participation matters. Your cultivation is service to this goodness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. With goodwill, friendliness, for others, may all beings be well. Thank you. If any thoughts or judgments come up, I can't do this. This is hard. My mind's a mess. I'm a failure. I can't do this practice. You don't have to believe any of these thoughts. Smile, smile, breathe with them. Take them along as you breathe in. Care and breathe out care. Let these judgments be transformed, if any, through the breathing in and out of love and care, friendliness. Invite them to breathe with you. See what happens when you invite the judgments to breathe in goodness and breathe out goodness with you. Do it lightheartedly. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Reconnecting with the framework as if we're sitting. Ah. And offering our practice, bowing. And offering our practice as service, as joyous service, putting it on the altar, the universal altar of goodness, service to ourselves, the deepest sense, service to all beings in a joyful way. When we offer out of generosity our hearts get. There's a joy that comes. Here please have the best of me, the best I have offered in this moment. Regardless of how I judge it to have been, if my mind was distracted, if I was sleepy or in pain or anything else. This is the best way I could show up. I did my best, letting go of any judgments, putting your intentions, your beauty, your goodness, of your cultivation, of your service on the altar. Letting your heart be uplifted with your unique contribution. You are needed. You are needed. May all beings everywhere, may all beings be well. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Thank you all for your practice, for your participation. You are needed. Can you take a moment to take that to heart? You are needed. Your participation is needed. Your practice, your practice as service to yourself and all beings. Your practice as joy, not forced. So we have time for reflections, for questions, for comments, especially if you haven't shared in a while, especially if you're new, would love to hear from you. And if you type in chat to me privately, I won't read your name. If it's typed to everyone, I will read your name and the reflection. And also you can raise your Zoom hand. I would love to hear your vocal reflections, questions, comments. One reflection, breathing in loving care for myself, breathing out loving care for others. Lovely, beautiful. Thank you for that. So powerful. So powerful. Ah, Alison says, showing up tonight is an extreme act of loving kindness towards myself. Ah, yay. Thank you for showing up and it's also an act of loving kindness towards all of us and everyone, all beings everywhere. An act of service. Yeah. Mary Christine says lovely words. Thank you for that, Alison. And I see hearts lit up by others. One more reflection before we go to Diana's raised hand. I sometimes have such an urge to bring goodness into the world. It's nourishing to think my practice is this gift. Oh, yay. Oh, oh, that makes my heart lit up to no end. Oh, that's so beautiful. The urge to bring goodness into the world. It's nourishing to think my practice is this gift. Yes. Yes, it is. Absolutely. Oh, yes. Thank you for that. My heart lights up, feeling that, resonating with you with that reflection. Thank you. Thank you. And again, I'm honoring when you sent it directly to me, I won't read your name and if you'd send to everyone, then I read the name. So that's, as I said, honoring that. So, Diana, please. I just wanted to say that I was watching you a little bit during the meditation and it was inspiring because I kept thinking you seem to be having such a good time. You seem to be having fun. And I really mean that doing this, I didn't have a sense that you thinking about dinner tonight or anything, you seem to be there enjoying yourself, truly. And so that's, that's fun for me to say that kind of spreads. So thank you. Thank you, Diana. Thank you for sharing that. It's, it gives me great joy that this medium, you know, in the past, it would be just audio drum. I mean, audio drum is fantastic and it's great to be able to listen. And yet I think it is nice to have the visual, right? The visual and it delights me to know that, yes, I was having a great time. I was my, I was delighting in this practice. I was delighting in this practice of, oh yes, breathing in all the aspects that I was sharing with you. I was practicing myself, which is giving me so much joy to be practicing with you and practice it just connected with this. So yeah, thank you, Diana. I'm delighted that inspires you, that supports you. Thanks for saying, thanks for saying that. Sweet. Yeah. Lovely. Any other reflections? Yeah. Appreciation from you too. Thank you all on YouTube for joining. Thank you, Cedric and others. Any other reflections, questions? I see a thumbs up. Is that a raised hand? Let's see. You want to share? Is that? Yes. Cedric, yes. Oops, I think we had a, you're muted again. I wasn't sure if you wanted to raise your hand, Cedric. Or that was a thumbs up. Asked you to unmute and then seem like, anyway, I think we're having some technical difficulties. So tell you what, I think what we'll do is given that it's 6 48. We'll go to small group practice. We'll go to small group practice. And when we come back, we'll reserve a couple of minutes at the end for reflections and raise your hand again, if you would, Cedric, to, yes, you log on. Oh, got it. Yeah. Sounds great. Okay. Got your message on YouTube. So, so let's turn. Let's turn to, uh, practicing in small groups together. So considering that you are needed, your participation is needed. You are needed. So, um, supporting yourself, supporting each other, knowing that your practice, your way of showing up your unique expression in this world, in the way that you show up is, is a gift is, is service is service the way you show up for yourself and showing up for others. We serve each other in this practice. So I will create the rooms now, the breakout rooms and, um, let's take the first 15 seconds as usual, uh, to just care for yourself, care for others in silence, in silence, meta for yourselves for others, and then share as little or as much as you wish. And here are the rooms and they are open. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other.
