I’m fond of the word ‘respect. ’ It’s a substitute for the 
word ‘mindfulness. ’ The reason I like the word ‘respect ’ 
is it suggests care and a certain degree of honoring 
things as they are. I also like it because the Latin root 
literally means “to look again. ” When we do mindfulness 
practice, in a sense we’re acknowledging something in 
the present moment. We’re recognizing something with 
some clarity, not just letting it casually drift by in a way 
we hardly notice. With clarity we actually acknowledge 
and recognize what’s happening in the moment, 
whether what’s happening is the in -breath or the out-
breath, whether it’s noticing your thinking, a feeling , a 
sensation in your body , or sounds around you. When  
you acknowledge it with mindfulness , it’s almost like you 
look at it again  or anew. What is this thing?  
 
You might experiment this morning with “re-specting. ” 
Give what arises in the present moment a second 
chance to be acknowledged  or registered, and be really  
present for it. It isn’t just a matter of respecting . It’s also 
looking at something, being present for something, and being still. Be present for your breath , and in some soft, 
relaxed way , be still in your awareness as you allow 
yourself to experience your breathing. When you do 
walking meditation, be present for your legs and feet as 
you walk. Let something inside be still as  you observe 
that, and be  with that.  
 
So respect everything and be still.  I hope you enjoy your 
morning.
