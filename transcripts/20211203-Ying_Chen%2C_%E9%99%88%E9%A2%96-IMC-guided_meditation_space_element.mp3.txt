 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome, greetings. Today is Friday. Please do for us in the Pacific time zone here. Again, I wanted to do a sound check and see if it's okay. Okay, so there are some questions about recordings where you can find the recordings of this talk. They can be found on audioDARMA. So audioDARMA.org. And you can find by dates or by the teacher's names. My name is Ying Chen. And so that will be the way to find the recordings. Okay, thank you for letting me know about the sound. So we will begin momentarily. It takes a little bit of adapting and learning to work with sound. Because what I hear in my own head, in my own body is different from what you hear. And today, I will share the sutta that I've been speaking about for this week, maybe towards the end. So we don't all have to get occupied by reading the sutas. But I will be sharing a link at the end. So maybe just take a few moments to settle in. We'll begin with the arriving sequence again. If you like, you can close your eyes. Gently, softly. Arriving. As if you're arriving in a quiet meditation hall. Bring some gentle kindness, softness, and quiet as you settle in. Taking seat. Really taking your seat. Feel the contact of your body with the chair or the floor. Know that you're sitting. Arriving here on your seat. Feeling the contact of your feet on the ground. Supported by Earth. Maybe there is a sense of a whole body landing, landing here and now. Maybe a few long deep breaths to allow yourself to settle in. Becoming available however so slightly to the lived experience right here and now. Sound. Movements of the breath. Contacts of the body. Being available evokes a sense of opening up the awareness to receive. Not wanting anything to happen, not driven by our preferences, our wishes. Just open, open up, surrender to whatever shows up. Align ourselves physically from ground up. Sitting like a redwood. Align our hearts and mind, along with the uplifting body. Align with aspirations. Align with a good will. Align with non-harming. For me I feel a sense of ease, at ease, when there is that inner alignment with integrity, value and goodness in our heart and mind. Softly and gently open to the felt sense of the Earth element. The contact of the bones with the Earth. Firmness, dance. Settling downwards. Resting in the felt sense of Earth element in this Earth body. Maybe the sense of a stability may come in your strength, like the big pillar holding the structure of this body. Feel the quietness of the bones. Stillness. However so slightly. The Earth element in the backdrop of our awareness. Becoming available to the felt sense of air element. Wind moving through our bodies. Re-enacting and falling of the belly as you breathe. Expansion and contraction of the torso. Different kinds of vibrations and buzzing in the body. Dropping out of ideas, beliefs. Feel and sense into the elements. Alive. Flesh, each moment, flesh. Come here. Open and expand our field of awareness to receive space. Space that holds the Earth element, this body. Space inside of the body and outside around us. Gentle opening and expanding. Receive space. Space all around where the sound travels. There may be a felt sense of spaciousness in your being. However am I show up. There is a slight opening of the torso. Being available to space. Different qualities of the felt sense of space. Lightness. Openness. Sometimes there may be slight brightness to it. Or darkness. However it shows up for you. Different elements are held in space. Relax and ease into the space. There may be a different kind of stillness related to space. A delicate kind of a space, stillness. Quiet. As if you can hear the sound of a silence. Expiriences can arise and pass. In this vast spacious field. And the space is unmoving, unmoved. And the rest of the meditation. You're welcome to stay with space. Or receive any other experiences that may seem prominent for you. Thank you. Releasing concepts, ideas. Let yourself not away into the space. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The Buddha said to his sound, rahula. Rahula meditated like a space. When you meditate like a space, pleasant, unpleasant contact will not occupy your mind. And space doesn't trouble by the things that happen within it. The vast spaciousness. All experiences are free to be themselves. Emotions, thoughts, sensations in the body. All experiences are free to flow in the vast field of spaciousness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If there is any form of well being, oh some goodness that are bubbling up. Allow them to permeate in the vastness. Let your whole body and mind and heart be nourished by the sense of a well-being. However much there is available to you. You you you
