The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

And then we can settle into the meditation and adjust your posture if needed.
Whenever you're ready, it feels comfortable for you and you can close your eyes.
We'll take a few deeper breaths in and out.
In the Outbreath you can let go of everything that this day has brought you so far that you're anticipating for the day.
Really let yourself sink into this present moment.
And we can feel our feet on the surface beneath.
We're going to contact there in the form of maybe pressure, hardness or softness, warmth or coolness.
We can feel pressure of the buttocks on the seats.
And the complex that the hands are making with each other, maybe on your legs and your lap.
We might feel how just attending to these contact points helps us to settle in a little bit.
Maybe you can settle in a little further by inviting the body to relax.
We made a body relax. We made a forehead relax. We made a jaw. We made a shoulders relax.
You can tune in if there's another area in your body that feels some tension or discomfort and invite that area to relax.
You can tune in to the mind as well and invite the mind to relax.
And sometimes that works. May the mind relax.
And we can open up to whatever is present in our experience, whether it's something in the body or something in the mind.
Be aware of whatever is on the foreground, whatever calls our attention naturally.
Be aware of whatever is on the foreground, whatever calls our attention naturally.
And when you do that, paying attention to whatever is on the foreground, whatever is most obvious.
And sometimes the wish comes up for it to be different than it is.
We want something else to happen or we want this aspect of our experience to go away.
We want to get quiet and still.
We don't want as many thoughts. We don't want to get lost in thought.
We can be aware of those movements of the mind, the wanting mind, wanting this or that, mind that thinks that if we get what we want everything will be okay and will be satisfied.
The mind that doesn't really recognize that that's not going to happen, that satisfaction doesn't last that long.
Maybe for the next wanting arises, next craving or attachment.
And I can simply observe this movement of the mind. You want something else.
You don't have to change it or judge it.
Just recognize it.
If it is present, maybe you're feeling really okay with whatever is happening.
It's wonderful and just observe that the okayness.
If we do experience the wanting mind, then we can make space for it, open to it.
Maybe bring some lightness to it, like, oh, look at me wanting again.
Knowing that this is an ingrained pattern of the mind.
Something that might eventually dissolve, but will take a lot of patience and seeing it pattern over and over and over again.
So we can just start now simply by recognizing and acknowledging.
