 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good morning, all. How wonderful to be back with you. Ah, yeah, I have to say, this early sitting, this early sangha community, so nourishing, all these people. They're warm good mornings, and beginning the day this way with practice and reflection on the Dharma. It's a wonder, it's a wonder, much gratitude to the whole IMC community. So, before we move into our reflections on the precepts, sitting together this morning, and the theme that we will unfold a little bit later is our ethical sensitivity. Ethical sensitivity that develops through our mindfulness practice. So, maybe keep that in mind as we move into the sitting. How we grow into being all the more in touch with ourselves, and how our actions have an effect. So, let's begin by taking our posture. Taking a deep breath to connect with the whole body, to connect with this whole body here, settling ourselves in an upright, supported, alert, but relaxed posture. And to let the breathing, to let the breathing adjust our posture, to move us ever so slightly into alignment with full breaths all the way in, all the way down, the lungs, the diaphragm, the breath all the way down to the hips, letting that open us and align us. So, studying ourselves from the inside out, aligning from the inside out. And as we align, letting go of any obvious holding or extra tension, and sensing the release of that relaxation. So, having studied the body and aligned the body, connected with the body, now to deliberately establish awareness, some intention. If noting is part of your practice, noting the in breath, noting the out breath, noting the in breath, noting the out breath, noting the out in breath. You You Attentive as we breathe in the tentative breathing out To let the breathing body be our guide for attention and release You You You You You You You You You You You You To allow the breathing body to guide us Toward relaxation and release You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You The relative Simplicity Of the breathing body As our guide Toward release Relaxation You You You You You You You You You And as this sitting comes to an end A deep breath And a moment of appreciation For yourself For your practice this morning For the sensitivity that that develops May each of us benefit And may that benefit ripple out Through our actions Of body, speech and mind To benefit all beings
