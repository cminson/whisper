Dharmette: Equanimity  as Space in the 
Heart

There are practices we do in Buddhism, which are also  
the attitudes or  mental s tates we are trying to develop.  
We talk about the practice of mindfuln ess, so that we 
can become mindful. We practice generosity, so we can 
become generous. We practice equanimity so we can 
become equanimous. Equanimity is one of the great, 
practices and also attitudes to have in life. It is good to 
be reminded of it  from time to time, because a good 
dosage of equanimity is useful in all  our lives.  
 
The Pali word fo r equanimity is upekkhā . The 
etymological root of the word means to have an 
overview of something, to have a bird’s eye vie w. You 
are not caught in the midd le of it. Imagine yourself at a 
very noisy  gathering of people in someone’s living room. 
Everyone is yelling, talking politics , and y ou can hardly 
get a word in edgewise because it’ s all so busy and 
active. You are  in the f ray. Then for some reason, you 
go out on the balcony , or you go  to the bathroom. When 
you come back to the edge of the room, you stand by 
the door  and look in. You  see what’s going on. You can feel the  difference between being  outside  of it looking in 
and not being caught in it, versus being in the middle of 
it, and completely caught in the drama of it all.  
 
Equanimity is that stepping back, or having the 
overview, where you see what is going on, but you are 
not in the  fray. You are not los t in it, n ot caught in the 
details. To step back and have a bird’s eye view or an 
overview of the situation  is a way of not identifying so 
strongly, not being caught in the reactive mode, where 
you are constantly reacting to what’s going on . Rather , 
there’ s an ability to have some space in the mind and 
heart to not react – and t o see.  
 
One o f the aspects of equanimity is not being a loof or  
indifferent , but instead, it is not giving in to automatic 
reactions to your situation. The situation might impact 
you. You might be at the edge of the room looking in 
where people are arg uing. You might feel discomfort;  
you might feel compassi on; you mig ht have a feeling 
related to it;  but you are not reactive . You are not taken 
over by your impulses . You are not on automatic pilot in 
what you think, w hat you do, or what you say.  There is 
space for it all. There is kind of a balance, because you 
are not giving in to the swings of reactivity, even though  
you’re not aloof or indifferent.  
 
A number of things can be  helpf ul in the cultivation of 
equanimity. One is to remember that it’s always an overview. How far do you have to step back to see the 
whole situation, as opposed to the pa rticular detail of 
the moment?  Step back… and step back… and step 
back. What is the large r picture?  What’s going on here 
in the larger picture? Sometimes the large picture is the 
whole room. Sometimes it is in the context of time. 
Sometimes, if you see someone who is angry, the larger 
picture is the challenges they’ve had in their life : “Oh, 
with those kinds of challenges, no wonder that person is 
angry.” You see it in a wider, bigger view.  
 
Sometimes we take the bigger view as we consider the 
human condition. In terms of e quanimity towards 
ourselves, it i s easy to take our particular situatio n, our 
particular suffering, our pa rticular challenge  as so 
important . Because it i s happening to us, we take it 
personally. When we ta ke things too personally, there i s 
not much eq uanimity. If you can understand that  you 
are n ot alone in your challenge – not dismiss ing or 
diminish ing it – but understanding  that this is a common 
phenomenon, whatever challenge you have. There are 
people with health problems, people with relationship 
problems, people with personal psychological problems. 
There are  all kinds of things we can experience in the 
human condition. And to realize you are not alone  can 
loosen up the idea that it’ s personal. Ma ybe you have 
had the experience  of meeting someone who has the  
same situation that you do. And suddenly you relax:  
“Oh, you too!!” You a re seen by someone. You know it is not just you. One of the teachings of Buddhism is to 
step back far enough to see it as part of the human 
condition, rather than something that is intensely 
personal  – me, myself, and mine .  
 
How do we  step back? What is the bigger picture? What 
is the overv iew of the situation we are in  that allows us 
to have space for it, to be spacious around it, to not be 
claustrophobic, not caught in the middle of the dynamic 
of it. Part of the reason I  like the co ncept of equanimity  
is that I associate it with having lots of space. The 
difference between being claustrophobic, with winter 
fever, in a small c abin with all of your relatives  all winter 
long, versus finally being able to go outside, and you get 
great vi stas, lots of space, the vast panorama of the 
mountains.  Walking by yourself on the  mountain trails, 
you can love all of your relatives. But in that cabin, it’s a 
little hard.  
 
So, ho w do you make space in the mind?  I associate 
having lots of space in the mind as almost synonymous 
with equanimity. How , with mindfulness,  do you create 
space ?  
 
Sometimes people bring a certain attitude to the ir 
mindfulness, particularly if whatever issue is going on 
for them is intense ly personal. They focus the 
mindfulness firmly on that issue  – and they’re glued 
onto it – to fear, for example. “That fear is so important. I’m going to be mindful of it!” Maybe we are not 
supposed to be so close. What kind of overview can you 
have? Can  you have a more spacious, wide  angle lens 
to hold it? Maybe then there can be some eq uanimity to  
it.  
 
Again, it  is important to remember that equanimity is not 
indifference. Equanimity is not aloofness. As a 
brahmavihara , equanimity is a kind of love. So, with an 
overview of the situation, chances are you can look at it 
more wisely . You can see it more respectfully, for what 
it is. If you are glued to it, if you are caught or involved 
in it, there isn’t the respect of seeing something clearly. 
Maybe th ere can be the space to love it – to have some 
love, or kindness, or friendliness in the situation.  
 
In the space of the mind, if there is love, what is it? 
Even just evoking the word or the concept, “love”, can 
change the whole inner eco logy. “Oh! Love. I don’t know 
if I wa nt to love this, b ut at least I don’t have to be so 
judgmental .” So, make space for something else to 
happen : equanimity – to have an overview, a bird’s eye 
view, or the large perspective  of the situation .  
 
One more thing that can be helpful to have the wide 
perspective equanimity in a given situation  is to 
consider, “What’s best for everyone concerned?” When 
you are involved in conflict, in a difficult situation, it is 
very easy to take a “me versus you” sta nce. Sometimes, we are in the camp of the other people, and we deny 
ourselves. Sometimes, we are in our camp , and we 
deny the other people.  But what’s best for all of us? I 
think somehow, approaching interpersonal challenges 
and difficulties with, “What is  best for everyone 
involved? What is best for the person I’m in conflict 
with? What’s best for me? Is there some way we can 
find our way together to what’s best for the group as a 
whole?”  I think that is another avenue for interpersonal 
equanimity. It is a  very different perspective from how 
most people operate. People often consider, “What’s 
best for me? What’s best for you?” It is not an “either or” 
kind of a thing, but it’s both. W e can all benefit. We can 
find the greater good for all of us.  
 
I encoura ge you, from time to time, to consider the topic 
of equanimity. When you do, ask, “What is the 
overview? What is the bigger picture that wo uld allow 
me to have more space – space  in the heart, space in 
the mind  – for whatever is going on? ”
