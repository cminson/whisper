The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Thank you. Welcome. It's so good to have you here today. Thank you for writing all
the way. It's really great. So maybe let's start. Let's arrive. I know at least the way
my mind works is like when I'm going to start something in my day, I work full time. So there's
always like that. I have to do something. There's something else that I need to do. It's kind of like
that inclination of the body, like, okay, what's my next thing to do? What's my thing in my list
that I have to do now? So I'm like, now it's like, okay, maybe I don't need that attitude. And
let's, let's arrive. So I'm going to invite you to do the three breath journey. And basically, I'll
try not to guide you too much. I really want you to go on your own way. I'll explain it then. We
can go there. That's basically if you want to close your eyes or not. That's fine. Just lower in
your case, watching nothing special. And we're going to follow three cycles of breath. Like really
feeling in the body, the inhale. Just notice what happens in the body when you inhale and then
exhale. And just three breaths at your own time. And just like if it was the very first time that
you're breathing. So let's do it like that. So let's close your eyes and I'll let you do it by
yourself.
If you want to keep your eyes closed, invite you to notice how you are, how is your body, your
level of energy, are you tired, are you sleepy, hungry, thirsty, relaxed. How is your body?
I'm going to invite you to notice with a very kind attitude as you're asking your best friend. How
are you? How are you now? What is your body telling you?
I'm opening the eyes and coming back. So this is the second meeting we have. We have five series of
five classes where we're going to go through meditation. There are many traditions. We have here
Vipassana tradition from the Theravada Buddhist tradition. You don't have to be a Buddhist to
meditate. Anybody can do it. There's no quizzes. There's no project. Sorry, right now we still have
to keep them. We'll get there sometime, but I'm just going to put it in here. But no, sorry about that.
It's anybody. Anybody can meditate. I don't know. I just remember moving. You see how the mind works.
Ratatouille. Anybody can cook. Anybody can meditate. That really gives me an example of how volatile
the mind is. Even though I'm talking and I'm trying to present something to you, my mind just got
into this movie and it was just transported in time when my kids were little. Wow, look at what
the mind does. My body is here and the mind time travels. Trying to remember memories. Fixing the
past. I think that's one of the things we tend to do a lot. Predicting the future. Trying to
write down all the possible scenarios. How is it that's going to happen? Especially if we're kind
of problem solving. Mindfulness of the bread is kind of our entrance, maybe. It's always there. It's
so accessible. We start the series with mindfulness of the bread. Now, today we're going to start
working about mindfulness of the body and trying to explore how it's helpful. What is it that we're
doing with mindfulness of the body? Meditating in the body. On the body. Yeah. I wonder some
I asked a little bit at the beginning. We met last week. We did mindfulness of the bread. I don't
think it's like they're separate things. Mindfulness of the bread. Mindfulness of the body. I think
at the end of the day, everything starts to, yeah, it's like a fabric. Everything. All the threads
are crossing and creating this incredible fabric that is the meditation. I was wondering how
how was this week. You were here. And I wonder if there's any observation or comment besides what
you already said. If not, that is totally fine. So mindfulness of the body. The body is this
incredible creation, isn't it? It does a lot of things without us asking it to do. Our heart is
pumping, air coming in and out, distracting the oxygen, taking it to the different organs,
digestion. I mean, there's a lot of things that happen. Doesn't need a comment. And even walking,
avoiding obstacles. It's like we just don't think anymore. It just happens, isn't it? It's an
incredible, incredible thing in the body. It's not only kind of a shell where we are present in
the world. It's an incredible source of wisdom and information if you want. There's so much that
the body can tell us. But oftentimes, we need to learn, relearn to relate to our bodies. I think
nowadays, I think I have mentioned that before, we tend to see our body through the eyes of others,
or through views, opinions, the way we were raised, what we're supposed to look this way or that way.
I think if we look at the teenagers, for example, the body image issues are huge,
create a lot of social anxiety, and it's like, wow, we're robbed of our body in some ways. In
meditation, when we bring the body into this practice, we're trying to see our body from within.
It's not about how it looks. I like it. I don't like it. My hands are too small. My feet are achy.
I don't know. My hips don't like to be something. I can't think of a thousand complaints. But now,
we're going to try to go inside and see our body from the inside. So we're going to see what is
happening in the body. I guess as you are right now, if you bring attention to your body, what do
you notice? Not what you're thinking about the body, but what's happening in your body? What can
you feel? What is it? What are you feeling in your body? Yeah, what else? What inside you
noticing? Are you cold? Are you warm? Are you thirsty? What are you asking? There's so much
happening and like, wow, I'm not paying attention. Has that happened to you that you're working and
you delay going to the bathroom until the last possible minute? Like, okay, I just need to finish
this and it's like we're totally ignoring our body. If the body is hungry, I think the worst thing we
do to our bodies is to sleep deprivation, working until late, waking up early, going to work, like,
go, go, go, go and until the body just protests and like, you really have to stop. So one of the
interesting things about mindfulness of the body is that it helps us change the attitude. And you
want to sit here closer. Thank you. It's how we relate to it. How do we look at the body?
It's our body's aging, it's getting older, we could be in good shape and everything, but we
tend to have certain attitude towards our body. And then what we're trying to do with mindfulness
of the body is kind of switching that. Okay, let me see if there's a different perspective,
which I can look at my body. So I'm going to invite you just for a moment to close your eyes
and maybe go from your head to toes, very, very slowly.
Notice whatever is more clear.
Is there anything you hadn't noticed before? And perhaps notice that there are sensations that
kind of appear and disappear. It's micro tensions and it's here that goes away.
Now I'm going to guide you a little bit. So let's bring the attention to the head, to the face.
Notice the muscles of the face, maybe softening, noticing the lips and the jaw.
Becoming aware of the weight of the head. Maybe you need to adjust the posture so the head is
nicely balanced, top of the shoulders. I'm going down the neck to the shoulders,
allowing your arms to fall with the weight, with the pull of the gravity.
And soften your hands. I'm moving the attention to the chest, the heart center.
Perhaps becoming more aware of the breathing of this body breathing.
Noticing the expansion and the relaxation.
I'm going down the belly and softening the abdominal wall. There's no need to hold any
tension there. You can let go, soften. Even if it's only a little bit. Notice the contact
with the chair or the cushion. Maybe some tension in the upper legs and the glutes.
Going down the knees and the lower legs, the feet.
Maybe you notice when you bring the attention to the different parts of the body.
Notice the parts that are tight. The one that's always the case is my tongue up against the
roof of my mouth. And when I start noticing the body, it's like, my tongue is way up there.
Let's let it relax. For me, it happens that when I scan my body, I try to see myself sitting
outside of my body. I just want to see from outside what is happening. I just take my
mind out of my body to see ourselves from the outside. I just try to see from the outside,
from the body to mind. I see sometimes that is very interesting. When I just close my
eyes, see myself outside sitting and from the head to toe. And it actually, because whenever
the mind diverts, I just try to see that. So you're trying to picture your body? Is
that it? Kind of like if you were... I just take my mind outside of my body kind of things.
I want to see from the outside what is happening as an afternoon from the outside things. I
just try to play with that. So what if you stay inside? I invited you to try and see,
go inside and not seeing or picturing. I mean, we say see or use these words, but like feel
it. How does that feel to be in your body? Not so much going... No, look at yourself.
I think I know what you mean. Like looking from the outside, but go inside and what is
this body? How does this body feel? I invite you maybe to experiment a little bit. And
I think what you're doing is fine. Just go and see yourself. But maybe I'll invite you
today or we're going to do another couple of meditations. Just stay inside. See what
happens. And maybe the tendency is, no, I want to go outside. No, I did that right now.
I did that right. I'm telling you, I also experiment that thing. Seeing from the outside
what is happening. Like when you're just saying that I'm just trying to make it long or hard
or something, I want to see from the outside what is happening. So I do both ways. Yeah,
so this actually gives me interesting that to play with that. Yeah, that's good. That's
good. But maybe if you decide just for the sake to see how things move, like if you're
going to sit during meditation, like, okay, decide to this 20 minutes, whatever, I'm going
to stay in the body. I'm going to feel in the body and see what happens.
Do what you were saying. The interesting part is if you are trying to see yourself from
the outside, you've separated the mind from the body. You've put your mind out there.
Now you're looking at your body. And the whole point actually is to be kind of within mind
and body. When you put it out there, it becomes a mind exercise, not necessarily a meditation
exercise within the body. The other thing that I would suggest you consider is, which
is fine, by the way, it's part of the experience. There's no right way to do this. What works
for you is what works for you, right? I just wanted to comment.
Yeah. And I think what you were saying, let's not make meditation a project. Like, if I do
this, I'm going to reach this state. I'm going to do that. Like, meditation is something
simple. It's not brainwork. It's just to just sit and stay. And especially if you're emphasizing
mindfulness of the body, we kind of want to dwell in the body. We want to, okay, I want
to know what you're telling me. That's a lot of information coming from there. And I don't
know if you know this, maybe. And when we bring the attention to any part of our body,
the mind doesn't go away. It's eventually going to get distracted because that's what
the mind does, isn't it? But it kind of gets anchored in the body. So we want to do that.
We want to pay mind. Come here. The mind is always doing stuff. It's always traveling.
It gets distracted so easily. And that's the nature of the mind. But we're inviting, hey,
come here. Sit here. So we say we have a meditation object. So it could be the breath. And we're
not thinking about the breath. It's not like, okay, now I'm inhaling. Now I'm exhaling.
It's like, okay, oxygen in, CO2 out. It's just more like riding away, like surfing the
breath. Yeah. So it's like, okay, I know I'm breathing. It just, you become very intimate
with your breath. When we go to the body, it's like you become very intimate with your
body. You can bring the attention to your hands. You can bring the attention to your
feet. Or there's something else in your body that is calling your attention. For some reason,
I tend to bring my attention here to the diaphragm, the solar plexus. I tend to gravitate to
that because I kind of feel my breath. But at the same time, I'm very connected to my
body. And that changes. It's not always the same. And just listen, like attune to your
body. What is it that my body is telling me? What is helpful right now? You want to make
sure I'm keeping track of that. Without Tanya, I need to pay more attention to the time.
Okay. What else I wanted to say? Oh, one of the nice things about mindfulness of the body
is that it helps us with your kind of training. Like if something happens to you, there's
always kind of the comment from the mind. So I don't know. I just, when I was coming
here, the street was closed. I'm like, oh, the street was closed. Oh darn, I'm going
to be late. Oh gosh, I should have left 10 minutes early. Like it's like, wow, the street
is just closed. Nothing else happened here. Just go around. But it's like, okay. So there's
a lot that we add to the experience that is extra. Then that's what the mind does, isn't
it? And mindfulness of the body help us to manage that a little bit. And why does it
matter? What does it matter? The comments, the commentary, the narrative of the mind?
Have you seen those nature shows where they're the animal that is in the prairie and they're
just telling you, sometimes I feel my mind is just like that. Like I go through my day
and like having a raider inside my head telling like rehearsing, what is it that I'm going
to say? How should I say it? It's like, wow, sometimes it's like, when I started practicing,
I started noticing that voice in my head. It's like, wow, you're loud. How can I focus
if you just keep talking to me? So mindfulness of the body help us first become aware that
that's happening. And just to be, to see the experience for what it is. I think nowadays
you see people in the streets, everybody's on their phones, listen to the podcast. People
go for walks. They're always doing something else. It's like we're filling the time. It's
like we cannot, we don't want to have the time not even to think or to be present. With
mindfulness of the body, the invitation is the contrary. We want, we want that internal
silence. I want to see what my experience is. And what's the experience? And what's
the commentary? I'm from Columbia. And so we see football that I think is going to soccer,
but I call it football because I call it soccer. And so they, my family will watch the marches
on TV. And it was very interesting because then, okay, the game is starting. So everybody
in front of the TV, so they will put the image and turn the sound off and turn on the radio
because the narrators on the radio were just extraordinary. They will tell you so much
stuff with that energy and like they will make the game such a fun thing to watch. And
if you turn the sound of the TV, like, no, such and such is throwing the ball, very boring,
very plain. It's like, you know, we want the commentary because it makes it so exciting.
It's so cool to watch. And I think that's what the mind does. The march is happening.
The game is taking place. And you have the narrator in the radio telling you all these
amazing stories talking about the players. So that and such and such. The wife just
gave birth to a kid. It's like, what does that do with anything? We're just watching
the game. And that's basically what the mind is doing often. So with the mindfulness of
the body, we're like being here. Again, it's not a project. It's just come and sit. It's
a kind attention to what's happening in the bread, in the body. So let's do another guided
meditation. Unless you have any comment about, have that experience about the narrator in
your head? Can you see it? Have you noticed that? How does that feel before I move further?
Like right now, what is that narrator in your head telling you? Like, okay, don't say anything.
If I say something for those who's going to think about me.
I was just thinking about actually Balthorama.
Excuse me?
I was thinking about actually Balthorama. That is a local player from Colombia. When
you mentioned about that, I was thinking.
Your mind went there. So just for a moment, just going to your mind, okay, we're here
at the center, you're listening to me. What is the comment in your mind? What story is
rolling in your mind right now? Can you see it? Can you notice anything? Are you, oh,
this is boring. I hope it ends soon. I should have such an insight or it takes you somewhere
else. Yeah. All right. So maybe let's do something interesting. I'm going to invite you to stand
up for a moment and to really, really get in touch with our body. So maybe with the feet,
hips width apart. So you have your nicely balance and just maybe move your shoulders
a little bit. And I don't know, like loosen up, whatever way works for you. And I said
noticing the weight of the hands of the arms. Okay. And notice the weight of the body, the
hips, the tight on the feet. Notice the pressure against the floor and any sensations in the
legs. And really be like notice, like close attention to all those sensations. What are
the sensations in the feet? What are you noticing pressure? Is there achiness, maybe some kind
of pain or tightness and going up the legs, up to your hips, up the back, the shoulders,
the head. If you move a little bit side to side, notice what happens. Like the weights
moving from one leg to the other. As you keep moving gently, bring your attention to your
hands. Notice what your mind is. What is the mind doing? Okay, come here. Check these
hands out. Just maybe feeling how they feel a little heavier. How can you feel the, even
the air around the hands? There are so many nerve terminals in our hands, so much information
going there. And maybe bring the image of your hands. Can you remember how they look? Any
opinions that you may have about your hands? And now go inside your hands. As sensing vibration,
the tingling, cold. Going up the arms to your shoulders. And let them fall. Let the
gravity pull the shoulders down. Stop resisting gravity. And if you pick
your shoulders, you may have ideas about them. Maybe that place that gets so tight when I'm
working or the way they look. And then go inside your shoulder.
And feel the, the solidity of the shoulders. The softness. The tightness.
I'm going to the head. Notice the weight of the head. It is heavy. And see if you need
to move a little bit to adjust it so it doesn't put pressure on your shoulders or your neck.
And go down again to your feet. Maybe starting to feel a little tired or the body feels heavier
than a few minutes ago. I feel for a few seconds I'll invite you to, to move the attention
to whatever part of your body that calls for it. Notice the attention kind of gliding from
one part of the body to the next. Let's go back to our seat.
Thank you.
What did you notice? How was that?
It was good. When I was giving awareness to certain parts of the body I felt like, yeah,
I'm sensing this more now, but I'm like putting my mind there, you know. And I was also like,
my mind was also wandering off and coming back.
Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's what we do all the time in meditation is we do, okay,
come here. It's coming back, coming back. And image that works for me. It's like a helium
balloon that is attached to something heavy on the floor and the wind is blowing and the
balloon goes, okay, I got you. Come here. I'm not going anywhere. Yeah. Something else.
What happens with the mind overall? How do you feel more relaxed? Do you feel more grounded?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's so much all the time. I mean, we cannot pay attention
all the time to everything. It would be crazy, isn't it? I mean, it would be very complicated.
But when you look, it's like, wow, there's so much going on. And it's like tuning a radio
sometimes and say, okay, what is it? What's going on? So let's see. Maybe not that we
have a huge amount. Maybe we can split in two and three. So just if you want to get together,
you know, a little bit of groups so we can have a little bit of a discussion. Paul, you
want to sit with them? So yeah. So let's do a little bit of, let's start by introducing
yourselves and respond, not react, that pause between the stimulus and the way you're going
to talk. And you can see it in other people, their body language. You can see the tension
in people. If you see, if you come into a room and there is two people fighting, they're
not talking to each other. You can sense it. It's like, what's going on in here? I guess
it has to do with our mirror neurons or something. We know that, like, that doesn't look good.
You know when somebody is not okay. And that's information. When you go, I don't know, for
example, you go to the supermarket and the person that is helping you, you can see that
it stands, it's like, oh, it's an opportunity to give a little bit of kindness here and
try it. Like, say a nice word to somebody that seems a little uptight and that can make
the whole difference. There's so much to learn. There's so much information coming from the
body. The more we attune ourselves to our own body, the easier it is to attune to others.
So yeah, it's a great gift. Thank you so much. Anything else? Any other comments?
All right, so I think we have a little bit of time to talk about pain, physical pain
and how to deal with it during meditation. I think that's one of the difficult things
if you had had chronic pain or just even a regular headache and you don't have access
to something analgesic or something. How do you manage that? So I think there are layers
on layers with pain. There's the actual physical pain, like the something that is not working,
like the knee, the hips, I don't know, something. And then there's the commentary. It's our
attitude towards the pain. So it's not that you're not going to need analgesics, but it's
maybe it's the way you start to relate to your pain. I had COVID about a month ago now.
Oh my gosh, it was awful. It was so awful. And like I can see my mind, oh, poor you,
like look at that. And look at all my complaints in the mind. I was feeling so miserable. Like
wow, shouldn't be, I applied a little bit of mindfulness here. Like okay, maybe, yeah,
it's uncomfortable. Is I'm not okay. And maybe I just need to rest. And it is okay to rest.
Like all the commentary in the mind, like no, you should be working, you should be productive
or when the fever kind of lighten up, it's like okay, I'm feeling better. I should check
email. It's like no rest. It's the attitude that we have towards what's happening in
our body. More specifically to physical pain sometimes. I don't know, like a pain in the
knee. Just notice the pain. And then notice the, what are you thinking? What are you telling
yourself about the pain? And yeah, there's, I mean, you can talk, there's a lot of people
who have a lot of experience working with pain and mindfulness, but overall what we
could say is just notice it. Like be, instead of trying to distract yourself, what if you
pay attention to the pain? I don't know. It's a pain in the knee. Is it always hurting?
It's like, it's nonstop of, oh, look at that. It's kind of comes and goes, seems to be moving.
Go around the edges of the pain. Like maybe even get curious about it. We're not trying
to heal the pain with mindfulness, but maybe start removing those layers extra that we
add the commentary and see what happens. Have you ever hit a toe against, I don't know,
the leg of a chair, of a table? That hurts, isn't it? But then like you hurt yourself.
Yeah, that's painful. But then you start adding first, you may come up with very colorful
words about what happened. And then it's, oh, how stupid I am. And like all that comes
after that. Like, yeah, that hurts, but all the things that we add into it. So, yeah.
And also to, to honor our bodies when the body is in pain, even in meditation. If you
have tough times and you see when I practice your meditation, find a posture that supports
you. You can lay down on the floor. Like really be comfortable. They say that the Buddha had
a bad back, leading his life and that oftentimes he needed to meditate, laying down. I know
a couple of teachers here that their meditation posture is laying down because of the physical
pain. So there's no such a thing that the only way to meditate is sitting down. That's
another thing to consider. Honor your body, listen to your body. So not only physical
pain, but I think nowadays our lives are so busy all the time and we just do and do and
listen to your body. That's what, what, what is it that my body needs right now? And sometimes
something so simple, a glass of water, just move a little bit, get some fresh air, like
honor your body. It's such an amazing source of information.
There are any questions or comments? Have you tried walking meditations? Have you guys
done walking meditations? Yeah. How is that? What, what do you think of it? I like it.
You just, I think it's nice because you're just so concentrated, right? Like on the flow
of it all. I think it's easier for me to get a result like that. Just like walking rather
than sitting and trying to meditate. Mm-hmm. It works for you. Yeah. Any of you who doesn't
like walking meditation? Yeah, nothing is what she was mentioning, right? Because generally
we don't give that much attention when you walk, you know, right? And during all the
meditation it is actually a sort of quite bit of stuff that, okay, that's what is happening,
right? And after some days I see that I get a rhythm, the same rhythm I just used in that.
And second thing I want to mention that last time when I was doing the group, group meditation,
that kind of actually gives us a lot of inclusiveness and energy. Yeah. That I feel that after some
days I did not need to actually go through that. I was actually following the flow, the
normal flow of the group and it actually gave a lot of peace in the mind. Okay. Yeah.
So when you notice, when you have those kind of experiences, we tend to focus a lot on
what is not pleasant, isn't it? But notice the body when there's something pleasant.
Like sometimes when we sit, we're just sitting here meditating. There's something in that
feels so good. So how do I know it's good? How does my body know that I'm like this?
Like just get very curious about it. And maybe I'll just finish with a brief meditation
and sounds meditation. That's another, I mean, it's the body, isn't it? It's something that
is touching our body. We can do sound meditation when you're eating, like savoring what you're
eating, taking pain attention to the texture of what you're chewing, the smells, all that
stuff. So I mean, the body is incredible. There's so much to do. So let's, let's find a
meditation posture that works for you right now. And if you want to know that we're sitting
on the floor, if you want to lay down or feel free to, to do so. All right. So closing your
eyes, taking a couple of deep breaths. Let's start with a three breath journey. Notice
that, follow three cycles of breath very closely. Noticing the sensations in the body. Where
do you feel those breathing, those breath, the air coming in and out? Get very curious
about your breathing.
It's softening your body. Stop paying attention to sounds around you. It's not about trying
to figure out where they're coming from, but it's just receiving the sounds. Noticing
the silence.
Notice what happens in the body when you're, when you direct your attention to sounds. What
happens to the breathing?
What happens to the breathing?
What happens to the breathing?
When I ring the bell, stay with the sound until you cannot hear it anymore.
What happens to the breathing?
Sound meditation can be so powerful, especially when we are overwhelmed or too excited.
A few months ago I was in a retreat and I was in such a state, I just couldn't sit down.
It was just so hard. I think it was a very short retreat. I need to concentrate. I need
to get there and say, oh my gosh, it's the second day. This is going to be a waste of
time. I just couldn't sit still. I went outside. I sat in one of the benches at the center.
I could hear Route 17 and the river nearby the center. I just sat there for, I don't
know how long, just receiving sounds. After that, my mind was collected. It was like,
wow, I really believe that sound meditation can be very powerful. If there is intense
emotion and the breath is not a good place to be because it's very agitated, try the
sounds. We cannot control them. Just come and go, come and go. There's something about
it that tells you, okay, this too is going to pass. The sound that comes and goes, this
also is going to end. I don't know. There's something about that synchronization. Highly
recommend it. Do it in nature. It's particularly powerful. It reminds me that I'm also part
of nature. I'm not only the spectator here and nature is over there. That reminds me
of my, I belong here in nature. I'm part of another creature in this landscape. I find
it quite wonderful. Is there any other questions, comments?
So my center we go for the practising. He's the founder and he just created all those.
I was so awake. I didn't feel sleep, but I was so awake with that old sound effect.
There are some wonderful creations that are just beautiful to listen to. But what I see,
what happens to me personally, I start getting very intellectual. It stops being a meditation.
What instrument is that? How does it? Okay. My mind gets very activated. That's why sometimes
without planning, it's very simple. You can do it anywhere. You just sit down in the bus,
in the train. I don't know what you're commuting. Just listen. It can be really, really powerful.
I think there's something very interesting about contemplating on an object that is continuously
changing and that you have no control. I think in a way, control is an illusion. There are
certain things that, yeah, I'm going to come to the center, but in life we don't have very
little control. I think we saw it with the pandemic and all that. These gentle ways to
look at the change in nature of things, it's good. It's very supportive. It's very healing.
That's my opinion of it. I would like to close with an education of merit that the benefit
that we have received here tonight, it spreads to everything we get in touch with. Our families,
friends, people we don't know, strangers, and that it benefits all beings. May all beings
be free of suffering and the causes of suffering. May all beings be in peace. Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for your practice. Thank you for being here today. Thank you.
