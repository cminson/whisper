The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So today I will cover the tranquility factor of awakening and the
concentration factor of awakening, so the fifth and sixth factors. And these
factors of awakening, the way that the instructions are in the Satipa Tanasuta,
it does not say evoke these, make them come forth or it says recognize when
they're present. And then when they're present, support them and maintain them.
And I think the reason why it says that is that this, the seven factors
awakening are a byproduct of doing mindfulness practice. And as the
practice begins to have some momentum, it brings forth within us a clear and
clear capacity for awareness. So mindfulness practice is bringing forth
an abiding, a living in a state of awareness, a way of being aware that's
maybe very individual, how different people recognize that they are aware.
Some people may be more with thoughts, some people are more with other
perception, perceptive ways of being. Some people feel awareness is more like
consciousness, it's just a broad field, a state of attention. There's a heightened
sensitivity that comes naturally. It's like whatever, for you that is
awareness, that if you relax deeply, you can't turn it off. In a relaxed, quiet
state that's not distracted in thoughts, awareness will be there. Just no way
not to have it. And so this natural state, somewhat natural state, becomes
strong, becomes pervasive. It's kind of like if someone, you know, it's like
now it's gotten light outside, so or light in this room, if I come in here
and it's dark, I don't see anything. And then slowly the light, the Sun comes up
and slowly gets more and more light until finally, maybe you don't see it this
way, but the natural state of the room, when the Sun is up, is to be able to, is
to have light and be able to see it. The whole room is then in awareness in a
kind of effortless way. So the Sun of awareness dawns and grows within us
until awareness becomes stronger and there's heightened clarity of what's
happening in the present moment. And that heightened clarity lets us distinguish
between the trail that leads to suffering, the trail leads to stress and
reactivity, and the trail that leads to peace, to wisdom, to happiness. And to
be able to see that distinction, then it can bring a lot of joy because then
there's, we know where the path is, we know the trail to take, we know what
trail to avoid. And so it might not be easy to avoid the old habits, but at
least we know there's a difference. Some people don't even know. And then
slowly we break the old habits and we begin following a healthy way of being,
the trail to happiness and to peace. And this brings a lot of joy. It's very
much associated with the joy of being able to practice. Finally, meditation. And
I know meditation is a good thing. And the way I was living my life didn't
work or there's no peace or no freedom in the preoccupations being lost in my
life. Meditation seems to be a path of happiness, of following a trail towards
something that's really good. I feel so much calmer and settled when I meditate
and effects the rest of my life, the rest of my day. So certain delight and happiness
can arise of knowing this possibility to practice. As we really start coursing in
this practice more and more, there's a way in which that joy, that delight gets
stronger and stronger. And it's almost as if it becomes not just an
evaluative joy, like, oh, I'm so glad I have this practice, but there's a kind of
a joy that comes from being absorbed in the practice, just kind of coursing,
cruising in the practice. And it's almost like an algae given of petting the cat.
As we stay with the practice, stay with the practice, the cat within us begins to
purr. The wonderful delight and joy comes up. And that's, some people then
describe, surprised by this strong feeling of joy that wells up as they
meditate. Sometimes it can be somewhat intense, and now some people call it
rapture or something. At some point, the movement of this doctor's awakening is
that we're following the path of tranquility. And so things calm down. The
whole body-mind system begins to calm. And so the excitement, the enthusiasm, the
inspiration of joy, quiets down, and the joy becomes kind of a happiness that's
more embodied, that's more like a deep contentment, a sense of being cozy and
connected in some soft embodied way. And that happiness is then the
foundation for the sixth factor of awakening, which is concentration or
samadhi. And this is important to realize, because some people think
that they're going to develop samadhi, concentration by huffing and puffing, by
straining and trying. But rather, the dharmic way of developing
concentration is to have in place the conditions that support the mind wanting
to get settled, wanting to become unified and absorbed and focused on
something. And that's a mind that is in body that's tranquil and has a certain
kind of happiness in it. And that happiness is the foundation for deep
concentration. And so we're just happy to be here. There's not a question about
being present here and now, because it's the better alternative than wondering
off in thoughts and thinking about our daily concerns or the past and the
present. Being connected here, this body, this mind, this heart, feels so rich, so
satisfying that, of course, we want to settle in. Of course, we kind of then,
almost natural to settle in, to relax, to give ourselves over to this process of
meditation, for example. And there's that happiness that comes with this
path to the factors of awakening, then unifies, brings together all the
fragmented parts of ourselves, so that the unfragmented way of being is Samadhi.
And because then we're absorbed, we're all unified, connected, collected. And
then we have the Samadhi factor of awakening. So what's remarkable about
this? We've been doing this Satipatana now for, I know this is like the almost
the 60th, maybe 60th talk on it, that I've given, gone through all these
exercises. And I've said this before, but it's worth saying again, I believe that
we're building on the momentum of having done the practice all along. Even if you
go back to the very beginning of it and just do the first exercise with the
breathing, it's a powerful thing to do. And if you do it consistently, just keep
showing up and taking your meditation posture and engaging over and over again.
There's a natural process that can begin kind of opening up and moving through
you, or you move through, that eventually can be, you recognize as being the factors
of awakening. When practice is really strong, and for me it's been mostly been
on the retreat that I feel this, the meditation retreats, sometimes that the
predominant experience of the present moment, by far the predominant is the
seven factors of awakening. And what a cool, wonderful thing to do, to not be
anxious about what's happening tomorrow, or what happened yesterday, or be angry
of anything, it just be really peaceful and settled. And all the focus
of the mind is on these beautiful qualities of mind and body, the seven
factors of awakening. And so there's this natural process that unfolds, but it
requires practice, practicing well, sincerely, practicing subtlety, learning
how to practice mindfulness, how to bring attention, how to recognize what's
happening, learning how to relax deeply, how to get concentrated to some degree,
learning all this, all this kind of the path, the world of meditation, so that more
and more you can trust that there's this natural process that's emerging, this
unfolding that can happen that we allow for. If we feel like we're the agent,
responsible for everything that happens in meditation, we're actually short
changing the process of meditation. A lot of meditation is letting go of
thoughts enough, being subtle enough, that we can trust and open up and allow
for something to move through us. And these seven factors of awakening is one
way of discussing this. So I did talk about tranquility, being a bridge
between joy and happiness, and which it is, and then I went from tranquility to
concentration factor of awakening. So where's the happiness? So there are other
lists that go from joy, tranquility, happiness, concentration. The same
factor of awakening leaves the happiness out, not because it doesn't happen
along the process, but for some reason it doesn't need to be there, or maybe
the number seven was a special number they wanted to, so that shows the most
important parts. So what we've done so far, there is the awareness
that's often called mindfulness, the ability to differentiate between what's
healthy and not healthy in our practice, skillful and not skillful. There is joy
in being able to do that. There is energy, the effort, and to choose the
healthy path. There's a joy of being able to do that. Then there's tranquility, and
then there's concentration. So then tomorrow we'll do the last factor of
awakening, which is equanimity. And tomorrow also we'll do a Q&A question and
response session after this YouTube. We'll do it on Zoom, and I'll post the Zoom
link here on the chat, but I'll also post it on the IMC calendar for 745, well,
says YouTube community meeting, and also on IMC's What's New section. Both the
calendar and the What's New are found on the home page for IMC, and you can find
the link there, and there'll be a password required, and the password will be
METTA, M-E-T-T-A, and that'll be clear also. So thank you, and I look forward to
our time together.
