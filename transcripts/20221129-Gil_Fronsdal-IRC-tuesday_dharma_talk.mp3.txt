 In the opening evening, Ying made reference to ritual, in that in some ways parts of this retreat is a ritual. And there is a very important way to think of it as a ritual, if you dissect the ritual into what sometimes are the three component parts. One part is sometimes called leaving, and then there's a liminal phase that's in between, and then there's the return. And the liminal phase is a phase where you step away from your ordinary life in some significant way for something to happen, to be transformed, to be changed, to understand something new, to see in a new way, to take on a new identity, in rites of passage, for example. Something happens in that liminal, that in between space, that place is not defined. And in some cultures, there's a built into the culture liminal space where a lot of the identities that people carry are put aside in those circumstances. It was really clear in Japan, when I was there many decades ago now, they had these public baths where people would go, and steam rooms and all that, and just pay your money, you go in, and everyone's naked. But the class difference, or economic difference, is the social differentiation, which are quite strong in Japan, they were understood to be wiped away while you're in the bath, while you're naked together. And so it's a liminal space where some other way of being could be a different way of people to get, it could be where we're. And so being retreat is a little bit like, could be if you don't mind this kind of language, initiation or rite of passage, where you're leaving behind your life as usual, intentionally, clearly, and then you'll return to it. The world's not going to change that much, since between now and then. You'll go back to the world as it is, but something will happen in here, there's a liminal space that you're in, there's an in-between place. There's a place here where the opportunity, if you want it, is to drop a lot of the identities you have, a lot of the meanings you have, a lot of the history you have, a lot of the futures you have, to allow to clear the space for something new to happen. It doesn't have to be rejection of all those things, but there is a time and place where it's useful to step away from all that. And some of you have already seen that's not easy. Some of you brought a big suitcase full of your life with you here. Or maybe I should be in plurals. Suitcases. But slowly those suitcases get emptied out, and people sometimes report that the first day. There's a lot of concerns, and as the days go along, a lot of the ordinary life concerns stop spinning as much as they were the first day. And so there's this process of emptying out, which is this process of leaving that's important and ritual. And then coming into this new, clear, open, empty, maybe identitilist space. In some rites of passages, they'll take, for a teenage passage to adulthood, sometimes in some cultures they take the name away from you when you go into a slimmerable space. And then you're given a new name that you come back into the world with in a new way. Ordination ceremonies are like that. And you go into a whole ritual, and part of the ritual is you get a new name. And then you come out that way, and you may or may not be called that. But I was ordained as a Zen priest, Zen monk, and when I was in Japan practicing there, they called me by my name, my Buddhist name. And that's for the time that I was in the monastery there, I was Ko-jun. That was my name. Some of them probably didn't even know I was Gil. And maybe I forgot I was Gil in some ways. That would have been lucky, right? And so part of the advantage of sometimes a new name is that a name comes with all kinds of associations, so sometimes you have a new name. But for this practice here, it isn't to get a new name, but rather to... One of the names I was given by a Tibetan teacher in Nepal, I went to see him, and I was going to Asia to practice Vipassana. I was a Zen priest, but I just had some free time to go visit a Tibetan teacher in Nepal. And he said, I'll give you a name. He said, you're mixed chop suey. And because I was mixing it all together, mixing it all up. And this Buddhism. He was kind of a trickster, this particular teacher. I gave him a present of some nuts, cashews, I think it was. And then I went to see him later, some weeks later, to follow up with something we talked about. And he gave me my cashews back. How was I supposed to interpret that? And so I think it's helpful to appreciate or to consider that this is what we're doing here. Because if you're not told that, of course people are going to come along with their usual mindset, the usual way of understanding. You've been yourself your whole life, why should it be any different here? Of course you bring it wherever you could go, right? But do you have to bring everything with you? Did they use superglue to attach you to all the different identities that you have? Or is it just like, you know, Lego pieces they could put together? And then you can take them apart and rearrange them. To what degree? Who are we? We have an expression, I think, in English, around the word, all kinds of words having to do with make, making. But there might be the admonition to go out and make yourself, make your own life, make a life of yourself. And it's kind of a powerful, individualistic thing usually to say. Make the most of it. And it is what you make of it, to people say sometimes. So that similar kind of idea is expressed in Buddhism by the word karma. Karma usually is translated as action, but it also can mean to make something, to build something. And in Buddhism it's clearly understood that karma, the things we do that are based on karma, are building definition, building limitation. And the Buddha's teaching is karma creates limits in us. It's our narrowest of potential. And so, you know, if I, I don't know, maybe I shouldn't use this example, but if I decide that I should be a good idea to be really angry because somehow this recorder was put in the wrong place. She'd been two inches closer to me when I came down and whoever put it there. And I kind of went into a fit here in the middle of the Dharma talk. And the karma of that anger in this kind of situation, it would limit the degree of confidence you have in me. And all kinds of things would be limited by that expression. So there are certain things we do that we limit our potential, we limit ourselves. And some of that has to do with how the identities we make of ourselves. So I did a new thing on Sunday. I hope I'm not one of the last to get on this modern experience, but it was for me, it was the first time, I took Uber. And I sat in the front seat, my family in the back, and I like talking to taxi drivers and Uber drivers now. And he told me all about what he was up to as an Uber driver and how it works and the finances of it. It was kind of fun to listen to him. So I might decide, that's a good profession, and take it up. I can do it between retreats. And being an Uber driver, and that I really want to be a good Uber driver, a compassionate one, caring one. And I would make myself into a good Uber driver. That's what I'd make. And I would have the boundaries, the limits, I'd know how to do that, and I would set it all up and hold it all together, and I would be like a top notch compassionate Uber driver. And that's fine when I'm driving. But then when I come to teach on the retreat, you guys should know I'm a good Uber driver. I do this on the side, I'm not teaching, but I'm a hot shot Uber driver. I'm defining myself and in doing that I'm limiting myself. And so a lot of this karma, a lot of the activities, of momentum, what we hold on to, what we are preoccupied with, our emotions that we get pulled into, they begin to limit us. They create a limit, they create a definition, they create... They lessen the potential for us. And that part of what we're doing in Dharma practice is beginning to shed that limitation so that we can be here in a more unlimited way. So we can step into a wider world of potential. So that when you go out and look at a tree, off the front deck perhaps, one of the trees on the property, rather than looking at the tree and says that is a really good tree, I want that tree. I'm sure everyone can be bought. I'm going to pay enough money to IRC so that they'll sell me that tree. Or maybe I'll just come at night. That's one way to exist with the trees here, right? And you can see my mind gets narrower, focused, smaller, and then I get a little bit afraid, they're going to catch me stealing the tree, and how am I going to do it? It's not a nice world to live in, right? You can imagine. It's probably not a nice world to live in, me even telling the story. It's as silly as it is. But if I go out there to look at the tree and I let myself disappear, it's not about me, myself, and mine. It's not about what I like, what I want, what I want to get. It just... And I don't limit myself by those kinds of thoughts and ideas. Then something opens up. I see the tree in a new way. I see the tree without maybe even I seeing. What is it to see a tree without you being the seer? Of course you're the seer. But you don't have those ideas and thoughts, I'm seeing, this is what I like, this is what I don't like, this is my preferences, I can't wait to go home so I can tell my family I saw a tree. So this me, myself, and mine limits, but what is it to see a tree and not limit it? What is it to be so open and potential that kind of like you disappear, it's just seeing of the tree? What do you see then? Do you see something new that you never would have seen before in the tree? What happens there? So here on the retreat there's a path into this liminal space that we're trying to clear the air in a sense or clear the eyes, eyesight, by the things that limit us in this ritual. The things that you need to do and have you can bring back in at the end. That's what happens in these rituals, you can return and you can pick up whatever's need to be. If I need to be a good Uber driver at the end of the retreat, I'm sure you'll give me permission to go back into that world. But I can put it down here. So there's a potential that we're coming into, that we're creating. And that potential that has already been created here to some small degree for all of us. And as we continue practicing it opens up the field a bit more and more. And rather than looking for how I'm going to have a good experience, how I'm going to go back differently, this is my samadhi, my concentration, and the person next to me is cracking their knuckles too much. Don't they realize that they're disturbing my samadhi? That all that me, myself, and mine is part of what we are limiting ourselves in that way. And so I think we relax. We relax, we open, we open, we relax. And the more that happens, the more we become ready, receptive, free of the hindrances, elated, and confident. These are the description of how the Buddha prepares people through a Dharma talk to hear the teachings special to the Buddhas. The most central key teachings that Buddhas have to teach. He first prepares the audience. He takes the audience on a ritual that somehow the Dharma talk sources he gives are so compelling, so absorbing, so inspiring, that people get pulled into it and they are just focused, present. There's no hindrances operating because they're so present. They're so ready for something to happen. They're receptive. They're elated. They're such a joy. And there's a confidence. Imagine all those things together as a condition or something to see something new. And that's what the language that's used for seeing something new is opening the Dharma eye. And I see something new. So the Buddha prepares people and then when they're prepared, he tells them the teachings are special for the Buddha. And what is that? This is where you're going to get disappointed. You're ready to be disappointed? Yeah? It begins by him saying, this is suffering. No, he doesn't say that. Actually, it's written. It's a narrator of the account that says, and the Buddha gives the teaching special to the Buddhas. And the first word is suffering. There's more. But I'm going to leave it there. Because this retreat is the same journey. We're bracketed. You left the world behind, kind of, with Kim introducing suffering. And now we're on this journey through the Dharma talks in order to come to a place where we see suffering in a new way. Which is not quite the end of the retreat, but which is Friday. So I don't want to, you know, I'd like you to have cliffhangers, even in Dharma talks. So now you're prepared, like, what's happening? You'll come back Friday. And so the teachings for this retreat start with suffering, faith, gladness, joy, tranquility, happiness, samadhi, and then seeing things as they are. Here we have the language of seeing again. Seeing things as they are implies that we usually don't see things as they are. So it's kind of seeing in a new way. And so it's a different process in the process of listening to the Buddha give Dharma talk. But it's still a process, a meditative process that we're preparing ourselves for a new way of seeing. So we come to a place where maybe we're ready to see or hear something new. We're receptive for it. And it's not easy to be ready and receptive. We have agendas, we have opinions, we have stories, we have resistance, we have preferences, we have a whole bunch of stuff that are operating in our mind that are part of what limits us, narrows the potential and possibilities. Certainly the Dharma doesn't want to force you to abandon things you shouldn't abandon. But there is something to be said about being in a liminal space that you temporarily put aside things to allow something new to happen. And I keep repeating this idea, but maybe some of you can appreciate the possibility of some of the concerns and things you want to see happen, your agendas and for the practice here, that maybe you can put them up on the shelf for now. And just realize that's for later. And now we have another... This is a different process here, different task. And the little carrot that I offer you about how valuable it is to put things up on a shelf so you deal with them later, some of the things that you can, is that later you'll have different eyes. You'll be able to see your concerns in a new way that you don't have the first, second or third day of a retreat. And you'll have more wisdom, you have some deeper values, deeper something in which to understand some of the issues of your life at the end of the retreat. So you have to put things up on the shelf until you have new eyes is a can be part of this process here. So today, after Kim's talk about suffering and faith, this journey goes into gladness and joy. And I'm not sure exactly what gladness is. We kind of use it in English, don't we? But how often do we use it? We say, I'm glad to see you. What does it really mean? Does it mean the same as I'm happy to see you? Is it just a kind of ritual expression of somehow high in a nice way? The word is pamoja in Pali. And pamoja can be kind of joy, delight. I think of it as a class of emotions that are related to inspiration, to be inspired. And so to have faith that is inspiring, that's motivating. Faith in the Dharma is meant to be faith that's motivating practice. It's not faith which is wishful thinking, like, oh, something will take care of me and everything will be okay. But it's to practice, it's to engage in some kind of way. And so I've had a few experiences of this kind of gladness, Dharma gladness, in my time practicing when I... I'll clip it up. Like this? Or is it clicking from... You hear it clicking? Oh, is that better now, maybe? Is it because of this was knocking around something? Thank you for telling me. So when I was young in my early twenties, I had a little bit of contact with San Francisco Zen Center. And at some point I decided I wanted to move there. But what I liked about going there was that I had all these... Back then I would think they were called social games that I would play. I wanted people to see me in a certain way. So then I'd behave in ways to try to get them to see me that way, talk a certain way, do certain things. And it kind of worked with my friends. I guess that's where we found ourselves. We found each other because we played the same games. But at Zen Center I'd go and I played the guild games and there'd be no response. And the people would just like, just like, oh. And so because it was so dramatic that I was not getting any response that I expected, I saw them as people as mirrors. I could see myself much better what I was doing. And I loved it. And so when I finally decided to move to the Zen Center, I was so glad. I was kind of just a light and happiness and relief that, oh, now I'm going to go to a place where I'm going to be mirrored. Where I won't get away with these things I'm doing. I didn't want to get away with it. It was so automatic. It didn't seem healthy. And as I was glad, I was happy. I remember feeling the light, thought, this is going to be good. And uncomfortable. But there was a discomfort I kind of wanted. And then some years later, I went and practiced in Thailand. I was introduced to the practice we're doing here. And something happened in that introduction to the practice on retreat that touched something very tender, precious, valuable, deep inside of me that I'd never touched before. And it became essential to me that I had to touch it again. And it became a little bit of a dark night of the soul time for me because I couldn't get back there fast enough. And by that time I wanted to go to Burma because the practice came from Burma. But it was hard to... I think the country was closed to people coming when I went out for my visa. I didn't know that at the time exactly. So it took me about nine months waiting in Asia before I got the visa to go to Burma. But remember, so I got my visa in like... I don't know when it was, but in that summer. So I got there six months, seven months, eight months waiting, trying. So I was in Bangkok, went to the Burmese embassy, got my visa. It's literally a meditation visa. How many countries have meditation visas? And it was three months ago I meditated for three months in Burma. And I walked out of the Burmese embassy and I started skipping and jumping down the street singing, but I won't do that. It'd be painful for you. And you're in a little space. But I sang the words to, you can get it if you really want. You can get it if you really try, but you got to try, try and try. I don't even know who sang that, but Jimmy Cliff, thank you. So I started singing that song because I was so happy that I wasn't going to get a chance to go and practice. Boy, was I lucky. I was like, finally I get to go. So that was Dharma gladness, this delight and joy and relief that I get to practice. This is good. I think that some people come on these retreats regularly, take them for granted. This, what we're doing here should not be taken for granted. This is a phenomenally unusual, rare opportunity in this world, in this world we live in. And only some decades ago, century ago, there were people who had to wait nine months for a visa to go to a meditation retreat. There were people who walked for nine months in the jungles and the mountains to come to find a teacher in order to get teachings. There wasn't so long ago there weren't meditation centers for laypeople to be in. Maybe you'd find a teacher, you'd go someplace in the jungle and meditate. I mean, this is phenomenally amazing that we have this. I just feel so lucky. Sometimes I come to IRC and I pinch myself. Is this real? Wow. And I have a kind of Dharma gladness for being here. So the path that the Buddha describes here is with the faith that we have, the trust we have, the confidence we have. It gives birth to a kind of inspiration that's delightful, that brings a kind of delight and joy, a kind of gladness. And how I understand it as gladness is that it's evaluative. It does involve understanding that we evaluate this as good, this as great. It isn't that we have a wonderful experience, it isn't that, I don't know what, it's kind of an evaluation. Even when things are uncomfortable we say, this is still good. The discomfort of having to face myself and the eyes of my friends at Zen Center. It was uncomfortable but I was this Dharma gladness. So it's evaluative. And so what evaluations, what perspectives, what understandings do you have that gives you a kind of delight, a gladness for doing this practice? Is there anything at all? Maybe it's the brutal honesty that this practice forces on you. You have to see yourself in a way that you don't want to see yourself. You see all kinds of ways in which your mind operates. This is good to see it. That kind of honesty and really waking up, oh I didn't know. It's a little bit embarrassing, I hope they don't have a projector and project my mind on the wall of meditation hall. That would be kind of awkward. But this is what's going on in this mind. This is good and horrible. Not any of you of course, but you know, wow. But to see the goodness of it, to see the value of it can make some people happy. I have a practice. How many people have a practice to work with their suffering in this way? How many people have a practice to work to clinging and to see the limitations they live under? Many people are staying with their limited life and just kind of move it around in between everything so that everything can be fine. But they're not really looking at how we're limited and how lucky we are to have this practice that opens up, opens up. So just to have a practice, we're fortunate to feel the joy, the delight of having a practice. I feel delight regularly in gladness in these teachings that come down from the Buddha, like Kin talked about yesterday. I still find myself amazed at the subtlety, the profundity of the teachings that go on in those texts that are still coming alive and discovering as I go through them. And I feel when I sit down to meditate, I have a gladness and confidence that this is well, not only is it well researched, this meditation practice that we're doing here, it's been well tested before it was released to the public. There's a lot of people who have tested this out down through the centuries and worked out the kinks. This is a phenomenal thing. How lucky we are. To have this inherited, this kind of practice and this kind of teaching, that we have to live with it. So it's kind of gladness, wow. It is not a gladness that's supposed to come with burden and responsibility and obligation, but a gladness, wow. This is pretty cool. How nice. Kind of inspiration, yes. I think Kim talked about mental noting a little bit. One of my favorite mental notes, I have all these favorite notes, but one of the favorite mental note is the word yes. Sometimes in practice, whatever's happening, whatever I'm noting, whatever I'm aware of, yes. Yes. Inhale, yes. Exhale, yes. Think, yes. It's an acknowledgement, but it's an acknowledgement of what's happening. An acknowledgement which is not a no. It's not a, oh no. It's like an acknowledgement, oh yes. This too I get to be aware of. This too is part of the practice. Yes. Oh yes. And so my mind is settled and focused enough. There are times where I've just said yes. Yes. It kept me very present. Kept me present, ready, receptive, delighted, free of hindrances to some degree. Yes, just here. So inspired, ready for the yes, ready to engage, ready to practice. And then we come to this idea of, it's rather unfortunate that the English pronunciation of this Pali word is pity, but it's spelled differently. It's P-I-T-I. I prefer to translate it as joy. Some people prefer to translate it as rapture, sometimes ecstasy even. But I like to have the bar a little bit lower than rapture. And so to have Dharma joy. So what is Dharma joy in this context? How I understand it is that the gladness is part of the inspiration to say yes to do the practice, to show up, okay, yes, I'm going to do this. I'm here to practice. I'm here for this breath. I'm here for this step. Yes. Then we do the practice. Mindful of breathing, mindfulness of stepping, mindfulness of eating, mindfulness of stair walking, mindfulness of brushing teeth, mindfulness of drinking tea. My first kind of, this is a plug for the value of really being present when you're drinking tea, and really present. The first time, the first kind of real opening experience I had in meditation and retreat just kind of blew me away was drinking tea. Wow. Like what just happened? Everything stopped. Wow. How can everything stop? In some ways it didn't stop. I drank the sip. I finished the sip. So I didn't stop. But something stopped. What is this stopping? And so anyway, mindfulness of drinking tea. So yes, this is what we're doing. Really here for it. Remembering we're doing a ritual of leaving the world behind, clearing the ground so we can just have tea, so we can just chew the food, so we can just wash the dishes, we can just do the pots, just chop the vegetables, just clean the bathroom, just vacuum the steps, just this, just this. Now what happens when we start doing just this? What it means is that we're beginning to unify all the different faculties that we have. We're unifying all the different parts of ourselves so it's gathered together, harmonizing, unified in the same activity. So some of you know I told the story a lot, but when I was in Japanese monastery, they sometimes sent me from the kitchen to the dining room with a pot of tea and I had handle. So I would just grab the pot with one hand and carry it down. Boy, I got in trouble for doing it in Japan. You do not in monastery especially because it's kind of like apple pie rice from America, like it represents the country and everything, the white rice, something. But we had to respect it. So the idea was I had to always hold it with two hands. Always hold it with two hands. But the difference, and I learned that in Zen, in Zen there's a lot of things where you do something, you do it with your whole body, you hold it with two hands, or you're really there. My entry into this world of you're really there for one thing, when the monastery, I was assigned to the kitchen and I didn't want to be there. In the beginning I had to chop a lot of vegetables. I didn't want to chop. And the door was over behind my left shoulder and so I would be turning towards the door, like, can I go now? Can I go to a kid's in the back seat? Are we there yet? Can I go now? And I'd be chopping and turning. And I started paying attention, partly because I had picked up a book in a bookstore. Just the day I went to the monastery we stopped in a bookstore. I opened it at random and the writer said, the problems human beings have is they resist their experience. I closed the book. And I went to the monastery. That was like the last thing I read before going there. And so this idea like resisted my experience. So I started chopping and I could see I was resisting. And so I would turn myself back, just me and the carrot. And then I would turn again or pull away or go into my thoughts like a gill, just the carrot. Just me and the carrot. And eventually I learned to just be with the carrot, onions, whatever it was. And I learned a lot about just the harmonizing, the gathering together. So my thoughts, my motivation, my body, my emotions, my sense of purpose, my identity, everything was gathered together, just chopping carrots. It's very different than sitting and meditating and sitting down. So you know, they teach or say, I should follow my breath. Yeah, I think it's kind of a good idea. I should try doing at some point during the sitting. But you know, I wonder what they have for lunch here. I am hungry, but I ate too much breakfast. That oatmeal was so good. And how could I eat so much? I'm dealing with my big belly and it's so hard. And then I did too much yoga, too much stretching and my back's kind of out. And I'm irritated by the person just cracking their knuckles during the meditation. And how could they? And who do I write a letter to? And what's for lunch? And how could I have eaten so much? And my body's kind of tired. And all those things are going on at once. We're fragmented. Most people spend most of their days fragmented in some way. What we're doing here is bringing it on. We're not just trying to be present in some simple way. We're trying to bring all of who we are together so it's all working in harmony. It's all working for the same purpose. It's all gathered and kind of pointed in the same direction. So we say yes to practice. Yes. And then we kind of are giving ourselves over so that our intention is aligned with the practice. Our thinking is aligned. We're not thinking about tomorrow or lunch. We're thinking about this moment and practicing in this moment. Our emotional life starts kind of organizing itself around the delight and the joy of... This is why the gladness and faith is so important. We're happy to be doing this. We're glad to do this. We're inspired. And so this is good. Even though I'm depressed about something that can be in the background, we emphasize in the degree to which we're the goodness of this moment, the goodness of being here, being present. And with time, our body is here. Our body kind of is more supportive to be here, harmonized. Everything begins to harm. It's called unification in the language of Buddhism. The mind becomes unified. The body becomes unified. This gathering together. And one of the things that does is that you're stepping into this liminal space where you're left behind all the ways that you're fragmented. All the other concerns and preoccupations you have, fears that we have, and just there for this experience, just this. And so the joy is a kind of a physiological, biological welling up from inside that it's not evaluative anymore. It's not based on understanding this is a good thing. But rather it's the joy of the engagement with what we're doing. Some of you probably have done things with your body, physical things in your life that you found were really pleasant and enjoyable to do. Maybe sports, maybe playing an instrument, maybe a craft, maybe you read a really good book that really absorbed you and you felt so good. There was a book I read many years ago that I just loved it so much reading it. There was something about the language and what it was about that I would only read one chapter at a time because I didn't want to finish the book. I just felt so cozy and good, just absorbed in just that reading of the book. So if you've ever had that kind of absorptive experience that felt... Then you have this kind of what I'm calling Dharma joy, the joy that comes from unification, the joy that comes from being just gathered together just in this. It's not easy to do this, but I'm hoping that in describing it this way to you, it inspires you to begin unifying yourself. So when you do something, when you go walking down the steps from up here downstairs, can you unify yourself in walking down those steps? Or as I have done, by the time I get down the steps, I realize that I've been thinking about something else, completely something else that must have been important. But by the time I got to the bottom of the steps, I could hardly remember what it was, but I certainly wasn't stepping. I wasn't present so much. It's happened so quickly. I bet some of you, before you get out the door here, you're already in some other world of concerns and thoughts and thinking about something. But how do you go down the steps so you're unified, gathered? Everything is there like I was with the carrots, just stepping down the step. That's the only thing you're concerned with. The only thing you're thinking about, the only thing that's important, is the activity of the moment. Having tea. What's it like to organize yourself, gather yourself together so you're there for the tea? You might even try holding the tea cup in two hands so you can really be just you and the tea. You're going to commune with that tea. Commune with the cup. Some people, like in Zen especially, there was also an idea of reverence. There was kind of a reverence to everything. So when you held the cup this way, the drink, there was a kind of reverence for the cup. I remember I sat next to a Japanese monk who bowed to his tea cup. I said, what? Why would anybody bow to a tea cup? But there's a reverence, this care, this love. So this unification, if it's kind of language, it's kind of idea, works for you, can include reverence, care, respect. It can include love. Maybe how you drink a tea cup, how you walk down the step, is a training in love. Where the love is, you're just there for that activity. There for this. Just this, just this. And what you'll find at times here on retreat is you'll maybe retrospectively, you'll realize you chose to do something or the choice wasn't made by you but by the other one in you who makes all the choices, that's not you, that you did something and it fragmented you. You come back to sit afterwards, wow, I'm now all spinning around and wondering and maybe you started looking at studying everyone's other cars and parking lot and all the license plate numbers. And you know, look at that, that's a bad number. How could a state give that number out to people? And that's a nice color license plate. I should move to that state. And a whole walking period spent walking past the license plates and studying them and looking at them and evaluating them and dreaming about the license plate, you come back up here and your mind is spinning. So, oh, that didn't work. Whereas if you leave the license plates alone and just walk so that it's clean, you're not kind of filling your mind with things that are agitating and new inputs and ideas that fragment you but that keep you gathered together, keep you unified because the unification of our faculties, somehow or other, brings a kind of upwelling of well-being, upwelling of joy, upwelling of contentment. We're kind of built that way. And I don't know, maybe it's just, if you want to be kind of reductionalistic, you just kind of like just massage the serotonin centers in the body when you do that and just giving yourself a good serotonin high. Luckily the Buddha didn't know about serotonin. But what I'm trying to point to here is the idea that this is not a value tip. You're not getting joy for good reason. There's no reason for it. It's because of the harmony, the absorptive harmony of being unified, of being in harmony with whatever you're doing. It seems like our systems are set up for this to happen. It's not easy, but this is part of the process. And that kind of contentment, that kind of well-being, that kind of joy is part of this getting ready, becoming receptive, becoming free of the hindrances. The hindrances are what blocks wisdom. The hindrances are what keeps us from seeing in a new way. It's what makes us elated and confident, to really be with what you're doing in the moment, just this activity. And you'll have a lot of doubts, you'll protest, but eventually if you let go of the resistance in just there, a confidence wells up. I can walk down the steps. Imagine. You go home and you tell your friends, I did it! I walked down the steps. I really walked down the steps. I walked down the steps so fully that I was surprised when I came to the bottom. I was hoping it would never end, because it was so good just to be fully there. So I'm being a little ridiculous, but I'm trying to put points of emphasis. This unification process, which is a natural physiological consequence of all our faculties becoming unified. And it's preparing us for something else. It's also allowing for something here, because every step along this path is a time and opportunity to see in a new way. Every step along the way here, we're beginning to experience ourself in a little different way than how we are normally in our life. And there's a kind of re-education, re-learning, new discovery of life, ourselves, being. And so the rewards are right here in the moment. I don't want to set it up that you're... I don't want to set it up that everyone's waiting breathlessly for the conclusion on Friday that I promised, and it turns out it's suffering again. And if, oh no, all that buildup was for that, I'm afraid to tell you yes. But it's going to be seeing suffering in a new way. We are addressing suffering here. And the talk about gladness and joy and faith and what's coming tomorrow is for its own sake, and it's for the sake of really being able to see the real serious challenges that we have in our life. Human suffering is heartbreaking. It's not easy, it's difficult, it's... some of the deepest, most difficult parts of our hearts. But to really be able to really meet it and respect it and have reverence for it and see it in a new way, we need to prepare ourselves. And that's this process we're doing here. And so it's a wonderful thing that the way to end suffering is to be happy first. Some modicum of happiness and delight and joy and gladness. So may that be in the background of your practice for the next 24 hours, 23 hours, that you're supported by Dharma gladness in such a way that you have a little bit more inspiration to give yourself over wholeheartedly to this practice and to the free practice, maybe to the schedule, to really being here wholeheartedly. And in that wholeheartedness, maybe you start feeling the goodness, the joy, the well-being, the contentment that can well up from the inside, that there doesn't have to be a reason for it. It actually overrides all the reasons we have for being upset about life. It's a remarkable thing that it kind of frees us from the limitation of reasons. And a lot of the struggles people have psychologically, we're living with the reasons we give ourselves for why that's there. And that's part of the limitation we live under. This unification and wholeheartedness is stepping into this more unlimited world of possibility. So, thank you.
