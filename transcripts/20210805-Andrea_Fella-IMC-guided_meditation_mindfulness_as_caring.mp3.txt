 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Connecting to how you are in this moment, often useful to begin by just kind of seeing how we are after a day, doing whatever we've been doing, to just be with ourselves. How are you this evening? Like a dear friend might be curious after a day. How is this being? Is this being available to receive how this being is? A dear friend were to ask us that question sincerely and listen to us. That listening would be probably experienced as a kind of love, connection, care. And so perhaps we can explore the possibility of listening to ourselves as an expression of care, connecting with ourselves with mindfulness, with awareness, being present for ourselves as an expression of connection, heartfelt. Appreciation for our bodies and minds which have been carrying us through this day. How are you in this moment? And then settling back to receive what does your system have to tell you? How is the body receiving body? Maybe tightness or tension or vibration or pulsing or tingling. How is the body right now? It's receiving. No need for it to be any different from this perspective of how are you? Which a friend might ask. What's here is just what's here. How are you in your mind? How is your mood? Are you agitated or at ease? Is the mind spinning, thinking about the day or able to settle in here to this moment? And paradoxically we can settle in here to this moment by recognizing if the mind is spinning. Oh, the mind is spinning. That's what's happening. We don't have to change what's here, just explore opening too. This is how the body is. This is how the mind is. And in the middle of our experience might be the breath. Perhaps aware that breathing is happening, but not focusing on it, just allowing that awareness perhaps to support a receiving of what's here. The breath as it connects to the body. And maybe as the breath connects to the body it can serve to kind of soften the system. There's no need to hold tightly to the breath. If it's supportive for you to stay connected with the breath while being with yourself, allow that to support you. For others of you it may feel simpler to just be with yourself with whatever's showing up in this moment. Through it all, remembering that kind of attitude of care, the care of a friend, checking in. How are you today?
