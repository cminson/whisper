Practice Note : The Nature of  Attention 
Itself

One of the very interesting things about mindfulness 
practice is what we pay attention to , and another is how 
we pay attention. Sometimes we focus and pay 
attention to  particular things , and that  is what the mind 
usually does. It’s always involved in some kind of 
thought or concern. Sometimes we then direct our 
attention to a place we choose. We bring our attention 
to our breathing as a corrective to the mind being 
preoccupied and caught up. We bring it to the breath, 
and stay there , and come back.  
 
But sometimes it’s interesting  to look at the nature of the 
awareness or the attention itself. Rather  than noticing 
what we pay attention to , we notice the awareness 
itself. It’s like having a flashlight. You can have a 
flashlight in the  dark, and you can be looking at what the 
light is shining on. It helps you find some thing . But you 
could also look at the light of t he flashlight. Is it strong ? 
Is it dim? Does it cast a  broad light ? Is it very narrow  
like a laser? Is it flickering ? Is it solid? What’s the quality 
of the light? In the same way, it’s possible to look at the nature of awareness, how we’re paying attention , and 
the kind of attention we’re using.  
 
Attention is very changeable. We pay attention  in many 
different ways. Our a ttention can have a very broad 
view of things. Or it can be narrow. We can pay 
attention to precise details. We can be hesitant or 
flickering with our attention. We can be solid , and really 
there in paying attention. Awareness can regularly be 
hijacked by our thoughts when we’re not so aware . Or 
we can have awareness stronger than our thinking . We 
can know that we’re aware. We can be  aware of 
something , and there can be a knowing of that 
awareness  and of how we’re aware.  
 
People are usually preoccupied wit h what they’re 
thinking about or aware of . Sometimes it is interesting  to 
back away from many of the things we’re aware of , and 
notice somet hing about the awareness itself, and 
maybe experiment a little. Can you open up the 
awareness and make it really big,  almost  as big as the 
room?  It’s wide and spacious , and everything happens 
within  it. Or is it stabilizing to make the attention very 
narrow and precise, like going right into some litt le point 
in your belly? Just feel the movements of  the belly  as 
you breathe , and hook in there, stay there, and don’t let 
it wander away.   
 Is it possible to make the attention more stable or 
receptive , so the awareness feels receptive , like 
whatever happens is okay?  I can hold anything, and 
anything that happens , I could just let it come.  
 
Or can the awareness be a kind of guard, like a guard at 
the edge of a gate that can stay there, relaxed, but 
doesn’t  let anything come in or out through the gate 
unless it’s okay. So it means that your attention is there , 
and as a thought or feeling arises, it says , “No, you 
don’t have to pick that up. You don’t have to get 
involved in that. Just let it be. ” So sometimes it’s very 
receptive, and sometimes it says , “No, I’m here and am 
not going anywhere , thank you.  That thought is not 
going to go anywhere. ” You’re just g oing to let it be, and 
drop it.  
 
So if thi s makes sense to you , it might be interesting to 
see if you can notice something about the quality of 
attention and awareness itself. How it is for you this 
mornin g?
