 Today I feel like talking about what I usually do after the introductory course, and that is the five hindrances. Some of you know what they are very well, and some of you know what they are very well but don't know that. And the point is for you to know it, that you know it. The five hindrances are a very important part of meditation practice, a very important part of mindfulness practice, in that they are those forces of the mind that hinder our ability to be in the present moment. Because they are those forces of the mind that tend to get caught up in various objects of concern and lost in those objects, so that it is very hard for us to stay present. So we get very easily lost in objects of desire, or sometimes in the desire itself. The desire itself is so enchanting and a wonderful feeling, who cares what the object is, just having a desire is great. But often it is the object of desire. We often get lost in the objects of aversion. And sometimes again we get lost in the aversion itself because it is so addictive, the energy of it, the vitality of it that can come, being angry or something. But often it is the objects of anger, objects of aversion. We tend to lose our presence very easily when we get caught by objects of desire, objects of aversion. The other three hindrances are restlessness and anxiety, which is the one. Then there is sloth and torpor. It is the only time in English we ever use the words sloth and torpor is in this list of the five hindrances, but that is what we do. That last one is doubt. And when these things arise, one of these five, we tend to get lost in them. Somehow they tend to cover up our hindrability to the present and aware and connect it to what is happening in the present. One of the very important reasons to talk about this to beginning meditators, or anybody who is meditating, especially beginners, is to warn you that these five hindrances are really common activities of our minds. They are so common that they are virtually universal. Everyone has them. They come with being born, basically. These strong tendencies to want things, strong tendencies to want to push things away, have aversion to things. Just a strong tendency to be full of anxiety about things, or just to have resistance about things that brings on sloth and torpor, or have doubt. And so they are built into almost, they are not exactly in the structure of our psyche, but they are kind of almost like they are built into the structure of our psyche, that they are impersonal. That we don't have to take them as being, oh, this is who I am. This is personally my, you know, I'm the only one in the universe who has any problem with addiction or desire or aversion or anger. Or it's possible to even see these things, and not even see them as being mine, as being personal. It's just the anger, it's their desire. Because if we take things personally, there tends to be a very strong tendency from us to make a lot of other judgments based on that idea that it's personally our thing. I'm at fault, I'm to blame, I'm bad, I'm inadequate, I'm this or that. And we come to all kinds of conclusions. But when we can see a little bit more as being impersonal events and just kind of move through the mind, then, oh, we don't have to get knotted up with all the ways in which we then relate it to our self-image and the history of who we think we are and all that. Just some moves are the universal. The particular forms that these things take and the particular strength they take might have something to do with our particular psychological makeup. The fact that some people desire ice cream and others people desire cocaine, you know, might have something to do with other things besides just the presence of desire. But the desire itself is just kind of almost universal in people's minds, almost in the sense that people who become liberated in the Buddhist idea of practice get liberated from these forces. Short of liberation, when meditation gets quite strong, these five are not operating. But until meditation gets quite strong, we can expect these five forces to be operating in our minds. It's what we encounter as we meditate. So what it means is that when we sit to meditate, you'll notice all kinds of things that make it difficult for you to be present. In mindfulness practice, rather than thinking of those things as being distractions, there's something else for us to pay attention to. So if I start sitting here and my mind doesn't want to stay on the breath but keeps wanting to think about ice cream, what a good idea it would be to have ice cream. Oh, that's just a nuisance. What this strange thought about ice cream. Get away, get away, push away. If only I wasn't thinking about ice cream, I'd be completely peaceful and happy and contented in this present moment. You know, I'm on the verge of Buddhahood and I'm thinking about ice cream. What's going on here? You know, you have this a verso in relationship to this desire of ours. But rather in mindfulness, we actually turn in our attention and just recognize clearly, well, this is what's happening in the present moment. Here's a human being who's having desire thoughts. If I don't clearly recognize it, then if I'm trying to stay with my breath, I could very easily get lost in those thoughts and start daydreaming about the different flavors I want and all the different stores and, you know, sample the different ice creams in different stores and where are they in Palo Alto, the different ice cream stores and, you know, start waiting the ones I've had before and which was the best ones and should it be frozen yogurt or should it be ice cream or, you know, what should it be? And before I know it, the sitting's over. And oh, wait a minute. This wasn't supposed to be a meditation, an ice cream. So we get sucked up into this world. And what we want to do in meditation is to notice that the mind is get sucked up and caught up in that world of having some kind of strong thoughts of desire. But not to get caught anew by judgments, oh, that was bad or I'm a fool or this is getting away my meditation, this is bad meditation. This is kind of like the food. The hindrances are kind of the food that feeds our meditation. It's the kind of compost or the stuff that gets composted into the purity of a concentrated and still mind. So we don't take the hindrances of being bad, even though the word hindrances maybe has connotations of being kind of bad or the enemies, but we take them as being very important things to bring our attention to when they arise. And to bring our attention to them, they become food for our ability to become more present. So there's no thing, we don't think of anything as being a distraction. We see things as being, oh, food for practice, fuel for practice, this is what I'm going to focus on, where I'm going to develop my presence. So it's very important to say this to beginners, because beginners will find the distracting forces of the mind to be troublesome and very quickly come to the conclusion, oh, it's hopeless for me to meditate. Everyone else I'm sure doesn't have any kind of desires for anything, but here I am, I'm lost in my aversion or doubts or whatever, and it's hopeless for me. I'm not supposed to, this is not meant for me after all, I should do stamp collecting. But rather to be told, oh, this is actually the stuff of meditation we work with, how the muscle and mindfulness get stronger is by learning to work with these. And eventually the forces of mindfulness get weaker and weaker, and at some point they no longer have any power over us. And then it's actually very easy to stay concentrated on the breath in a very still, peaceful, easy way about the mind wavering or wondering from that calm focus. But you can't expect to have that kind of calm focus unless you understand really well the forces that tend to keep you away from that calm focus. So that's why we talk about the five hindrances. Not only are there common experiences in meditation, they're phenomenally common in daily life. And so they're the common forces that run most economies, most cultures, desire and aversion, anxiety, doubt, restlessness. So to the degree to which we start paying attention to meditation, it becomes kind of a laboratory to study them in a more refined way, careful way. So when we go back into our normal life, we're familiar and sensitive, tuned in to how the hindrances work in our mind, how they arise and appear, so that they're not running the show in our daily life. Because it's very easy for us to be run. It's kind of like the hindrances grab us by our nose and kind of lead us around, desires, aversions and off we go, kind of caught up in that world. If we want to be free, we have to be able to recognize the hindrances and develop a stronger presence, an independent presence that's stronger than the way in which we're dragged around by these kinds of concerns. The word hindrances is a translation of the Pali word, the Buddhist word nivarana, which means coverings. It's the coverings of awareness, it's the coverings of, it's that which covers the depths of our life, and that which covers something else. And certainly it covers our ability to be present, but also it covers the depth of our intention, the depth of our love, the depth of our capacity for intimacy and contact with the world, and the depth of our capacity for freedom. So the hindrances are really great to study and become familiar with. Mindfulness meditators are expected to become connoisseurs of the hindrances. To become so familiar with them you can kind of smell it coming. You can say, oh there it's coming, there's my old friend desire. And to see it clearly for what it is and by doing so being free of them. There's a story from the time of the Buddha, actually it happens repeatedly. Before I tell you this story, in the night of the Buddha's enlightenment, he is visited by Mara. And Mara in the Buddhist tradition is the personification of all the inner psychic forces of distraction that want to keep you from being enlightened and free, want to keep you asleep, lost in distractions, preoccupations, fears, subversions, all these things. So the night of Buddha's enlightenment, Mara appeared. It makes some sense, he's not enlightened yet and tries to distract him and fails and the Buddha gets enlightened. And you think, well that's good, he lives happily ever after. What's interesting is over and over again in the suttas and discourses that talk about the Buddha's life, after his enlightenment he's revisited by Mara. And you would think if the tradition understands Mara to be this kind of fancy way of personifying inner psychic forces, literary way of personifying them, what are these inner psychic forces doing visiting the Buddha after his enlightenment? But what's significant is what the Buddha does when Mara visits him. Every time Mara comes, the Buddha does not say get lost, doesn't pick up a sword and kind of slice him in two. He also does not invite him to tea. He doesn't give him a big hug and say, hey, let's merge, let's do a merger, let's get involved and go through life together or whatever. All the Buddha says, he says, Mara, I see you. No aversion, no desire, just a matter of fact clear, Mara, I see you. And every time Mara is seen, he goes, oh, I've been seen and he runs away. So the forces of the hindrances are called forces of distraction, that what we need to do is to learn how to see them really clearly and in seeing them clearly will become free of them. And freedom is the goal of Buddhist practice, not to be caught, not to have any constraints, any bondage on our hearts. So the five hindrances are desire, aversion, restlessness, anxiety, sloth, torpor and doubt. And the first two are kind of like opposites, desire and aversion, wanting and not wanting. Desire is very infatuating because the thoughts of desire, the involvement with objects of desire, thinking about desire as wanting, tends to be pleasant. We think about a wonderful holiday in Tahiti, you know, you think about the wonderful things you can do there on the beach and tropical drinks they make or whatever, you know, and it's very pleasant. And so the pleasure of these kinds of is often part of the reasons why they're very much for the reason they're so alluring. Sometimes we go into that as a form of escape. We're not comfortable with being present with our life as it is, so it's much more comfortable to be lost in some wonderful pleasant fantasy about how things could be much better what we want. And it's very easy to spend a lot of time in the world of desire. There's a famous Thai meditation master who when he was a novice monk, teenage meditator, he wrote such a story about how he won the lottery, the Thai lottery, and he became a millionaire in Thailand and he felt really great. And he was all excited. He started thinking and planning about all the big mansion he was going to build and all the people who were going to come and kind of, he was going to wine and dine and all the women he was going to invite to be his kind of whatevers. And he talked about this fantastic fantasy, you know, the results of having won the lottery. And then suddenly he woke up from his meditation and realized not only he had enough won the lottery, but he hadn't bought a ticket. So that really, in his case, it really fueled him, inspired him to practice, to really throw himself into the practice of being present because he didn't want to get lost like that again. But it can be very tempting, very alluring, very satisfying to go into that kind of world because it can be a form of relief from discomfort and stress and anxiety in a normal life. But in Buddhist practice, we want to train ourselves not to escape away from stress and anxiety and difficulties, but learn how to bring our attention to them and bring our attention to them to find some new way of being with them that is satisfying, it brings freedom, it brings relief, it brings release, it brings compassion and love and acceptance. So desire, the forces of desire pulling us away, we can want all kinds of things. It can be very subtle. It can be so subtle, like you're sitting here in meditation and you feel a little bit of a little ache in your knee. You say, oh, you know, this is uncomfortable. What really would be nice is if someone came over and massaged this knee for me, that would be really nice and help. And why don't we design a meditation tradition, a religion, where meditation is really important, but every meditator gets their own personal masseuse. And they would just come around and you sit there in your meditation and after you settle after five minutes, you get 35 minutes of this wonderful massage. That's the religion for me. I'm sure that I can think of a doctor that goes with that and how we're all interconnected and this is the proof of the interconnection. Everyone has their own masseuse. And off we go. It's very, it started with a very little kind of tinge of ache in your knee and off a person can go. It can be, doesn't it be so dramatic as such a great, great new religion based on masseuses. It can be as simple as feeling the tinge and then starting to desire a more comfortable way of sitting. Oh, I wonder if I can just adjust my knee a little bit, then I won't be there. And it's not, you know, bad to kind of be concerned about your posture and things like that, but to be, it's very easy to lose ourselves in very subtle movements of desire. And we lose our presence, lose our what's going on. I've known people who will lose themselves in very small sounds that other people make in the meditation hall. And maybe not out of desire, but maybe they lose themselves in aversion. You know, there's no reason to hear sounds in a meditation hall to be any different than the birds outside. But there are some people who get self-righteous about it. You know, they're disturbing my meditation and this and that. And then they get lost in a hindrance of aversion. And there's a very subtle movement of sound that they felt uncomfortable with. So the hindrances can operate very subtly in their life and they can operate very, very grossly, but they operate. And in the gross forms they take the form of addiction, which, you know, we know is a huge issue, huge problem in the United States. The opposite side, there's aversion. And aversion can be subtle or gross. You can be sitting here and being uncomfortable in meditation and rather than designing the perfect religion that allows for masseuses and wonderful, you know, whatever, you're just thinking about what a terrible, rotten, you know, tradition I've found. I mean, how could I have ended up in a, you know, a tradition that allows you to sit cross-legged in your knees ache and how could, you know, I'm sitting on this cushion that's too hard and, you know, maybe I should burn it and, you know, these people around me and the floor is too hard and temperature is too warm and it's too, you know, this and that. And it starts because we're kind of reacting, erosively, to some little discomfort and that aversion kind of gets carried up into fantasies and ideas that grow and billow up in the whole world of itself. And so it can get quite, quite elaborate. Whole civil wars can be gone. It was very small movements of, you know, aversion. But also it can be very subtle. It can just be simply beginning to negotiate little movements of reprisal. I have a friend of mine, you know, every time his knee hurt him in meditation, he would push back at his knee, hurt it back. Pretty dumb. He didn't realize how dumb it was until he had the knee surgery. And aversion is very tantalizing for many people, anger and aversion, because for a number of reasons. One is that very simply energetically there's a lot of energy that can come with a real good feast of hate and aversion and anger. And some people who don't have a lot of natural vitality, you know, their natural vitality is kind of dampened for some reason, will depend on some external emotions like that to get their energy up, to feel alive and vital. I call, they're the same with desire. I call desire and aversion the caffeine of the soul. Because people whose soul is inner life, it doesn't have a balance. But if you'll come somehow numbed or depressed, well sometimes use desire, addiction, or use aversion as a way of elevating the energy and feeling kind of vital and alive. And so it can be very addicting, both desire and aversion, because of that. Desire can be very alluring because, I mean aversion can be very alluring because it tends to dispel the discomfort away from oneself. There's a very strong phenomenon where people will often blame the environment or other people for how they're feeling uncomfortable. And the inability to look at themselves or look at the discomfort and say, well if I'm uncomfortable someone else must be responsible for it. Or sometimes they do the opposite and the aversion is self-directed inappropriately. Something's uncomfortable here, it must mean because I've done something wrong rather than seeing the situation clearly for what it is. So it can relate to our self-concept in ourselves. And so we get to feel self-righteous and it feels good to be self-righteous. If everyone else is wrong then I'm right. It's possible to get lost in these movements of ill will or desire. Restlessness and anxiety, it's possible to get lost in that. Restlessness is physical, it tends to be kind of a restlessness of the body. Sometimes it can be so powerful, all you can do is to stay in the hall, stay in your meditation posture. The legs feel like they're about to bolt. The feeling of being in the rodeo in a bronco, sometimes a restlessness. It can be quite powerful. You should know it can be that way so you don't take it as some personal fault that you're restless at this particular time. You say, oh, I've been warned. Restlessness might arise as one of the common hindrances. Here it's a rise for me, it's my turn to experience restlessness and I've been told that my job is to get to know it, to feel it. What is it like to feel restlessness? I'm going to become the world class expert in what restlessness feels like. I'm going to feel it in my body, I'm going to explore it. How does it appear? Is it in my legs, is it in my stomach, is it in my chest, is it in my face, my neck, my shoulders, where is it? How is it appear? Is it tightness, is it energy, is it vibration? What does it feel like? What happens if I open to the restlessness and just feel it in my body? Can I open to it and feel it as opposed to let it run me? Because restlessness is not just simply often physical restlessness, but it's often of great motivation to do something, to bolt or to run or to get up or do something. Rather than giving into the motivation of restlessness, which is to lose our freedom, we're asked to feel it and explore it and find that independence of presence that's not going to be swayed by any forces within us. The freedom that Buddhism talks about, the freedom that Americans often talk about is the freedom to do whatever they want. The freedom that Buddhism talks about is the freedom from being run by our addictions, run by our cravings and our fears. It's a very different notion of freedom because freedom to do whatever we want can be quite selfish and it might mask the degree to which we're actually not free at all, but we're just giving free rein to our compulsions. Freedom from our compulsions is to be free, and what you decide to do with that freedom is up to you. But if you're not being run by your compulsions, then you have a much wiser eyes and a much wiser presence to decide how to act. So we see our restlessness clearly and learn how to have an independent presence in the midst of that restlessness. Anxiety the same way. Restlessness is more physical, anxiety is more mental. To hold the anxiety, to see it, to kind of make yourself a larger container of awareness that just holds it. Open yourself like a big, big bowl and you're going to make yourself as big a bowl as it takes to just hold the anxiety in a loving embrace. Tendencies we get into the middle of the anxiety and we kind of taken up by the conclusions of it, the meaning, the voices of it, the ideas of it, and we get all tied up. And rather than trying to get in there and figure it all out and find the solution, what we can do instead is to make the awareness large enough to see it clearly with an independent awareness, an independent presence. Oh, it's just anxiety. It's impersonal, it's just an event. Anxiety is happening. It's just anxiety, name it. It's just anxiety. And then there's sloth and torpor. And sloth and torpor, it was a funny expression that it is, does not necessarily just mean tiredness. Tiredness can just be, you know, you're tired. Though it can be very hard to be present when you're tired. Sloth and torpor is a, maybe back up a little bit. One way to look at the five hindrances is their strategies that we come up with when we're uncomfortable and don't want to be present. When we feel challenged in uncomfortable ways in the present moment, the five hindrances can be instead of strategies to avoid that challenge, turn away from it, or in unhealthy ways kind of solve it. So sometimes if we're challenged in the present moment, we get lost in fantasies of desire. And that's the form of escape. Sometimes we get lost in fantasies of aversion, and that's the form of escape from discomfort, kind of our way of trying to deal with it. Sometimes we simply get restless and anxious and worry. I know, I've known people, not many, but I've known some people who grew up in family environments where for some odd reason the only way that love was expressed, that you cared about other family members, is if you expressed your worry. And if you didn't worry properly, then people think you cared. And so that gets translated into all kinds of later activities of our life where we think that worrying is really what it's all about. We have to worry in order to kind of, we have to be anxious in order to be a friend to someone or be, you know, just get by. And so we don't have to be anxious. It doesn't have to be a strategy of how to cope with life. Rest of the things, in sloth and torpor, then, it can also be seen as a strategy of resistance. If we don't want to be, if we're challenged by something, we can just kind of get tired and drag our feet and whine and complain. This is really obvious in children. You know, you can see in children, you know, they take sloth and torpor to the extreme sometimes, you know, they don't want something. For me, I call it my seer's mind, because when I was a child, my mother would take me sometimes to seers to go shopping. And I hated it. I hated the smell of place. I hated the activity of shopping for clothes. I hated, you know, just, it was just, you know, hell. And so she would take me into seers. And as soon as we walk in, I was so tired. Can't we go home? Can we go? I don't want to be here. You know, how does she have a heart to keep me there with such suffering? And then as soon as we, you know, we'd leave and she'd say something like, oh, should we get some ice cream now? And oh, I was, you know, there was no tiredness. The tiredness vanished in an instant. It was a strategy of trying to avoid, trying to get away from something I didn't like doing. It's kind of a form of resistance. And sloth and torpor meditation can be a form of resistance, a form of hesitation, a form of holding back, a form of dulling out because we don't want to be present, a form of avoidance, a form of holding things at a distance. In extreme forms of this kind of resistance, people will fall asleep in meditation, not because they're sleepy, but because it's a powerful way of turning off and the way the children, for example, will do. Young babies, if they're overstimulated in the environment, they have this mechanism where they seem to fall asleep. And as adults, we have the ability to do that still as in meditation. The last of the hindrances is doubt. And doubt is said to be the most dangerous of the hindrances because it's the one we tend to believe the most. It's the one that will often get us to get up from the cushion and leave or give up or say, I can't do this. We doubt ourselves, I can't do this. I'm not capable of being present or meditating or we doubt the time of day. Well, I'm not sure this is the right time of day to be meditating or this particular time and it seems like maybe more important things to do like defrost the freezer, clean out the garage. And maybe I wonder what I should be doing and are we doubt bigger things? The Buddhist tradition, I doubt, how do I get involved with this strange thing? So doubt can be very powerful because it can undermine our confidence that what we're doing is worthwhile and then we want to give up. And doubt can be very convincing. Remember, all these things can be covers for awareness. So we can get lost in doubt and really believe it and come to all kinds of conclusions that later we realize, wait a minute, what was I thinking? I knew one friend of mine had a fit of doubt on a retreat and the doubts spilled over to all kinds of other hindrances. And before she knew what she was doing, she was on the phone changing her flight for earlier day to leave in the middle of the retreat. And then when she finished all her change of reservations, then she woke up, what am I doing? It was all based on my doubt about why I'm here and my aversion and desire and all these things. Doubt is also a way of resisting being present. Sometimes easier to doubt than to really face something honestly with what's going on. So these are five very powerful forces that visit everyone. And it's best to see them as being impersonal and see them as the food for the growth and development of mindfulness and presence. And not to invite them for tea or anything, but when they arise, when they come up, see them as not as problems to be gotten rid of, but rather things to be seen clearly for what they are and in seeing them clearly for what they are to discover your freedom in them. Another way of saying this is that it's not the desire or aversion or so forth which is the problem. It's are getting lost in it, which is the problem. So we're not at war with having desires or having aversions. What we're trying to deal with is the tendency to get caught up in those things, to have our presence hindered by those things. I call them sometimes, I call them the black holes of the mind. Black holes are these bodies in space, probably you all know, where the collapsed stars, the gravitational force is so strong that light goes in but doesn't come out. And the hindrances are kind of like the black holes of the mind. The gravitational force is so strong that our light of awareness goes in and never comes out because we get lost in these kinds of concerns. One of the interesting things to study as we investigate the hindrances is to study our priorities. Because in some subtle way or strong way, our involvement with the hindrances is not just simply a way of getting lost but also represents a little bit the priorities of what we might think is important to do with our minds, with our precious attention. So is it really what we want to do is get lost thinking about ice cream or vacations or bouts of ill will and aversions. Is that where we want to spend our precious human time that we have? Do we want to spend it lost in these kinds of concerns? Or is it something much more important to be done? And from the Buddhist point of view, there is something much more important to be done and that is to wake up, that is to be present in an intimate and clear and full way for life as it's lived, not to lose ourselves in fantasies of desire and aversion and doubt and all these things. So the practice of mindfulness, we want to then do a number of things. We want to be able to recognize these things. We want to develop a kind of vocabulary of the hindrances and start becoming familiar in the various colors and shades in which they appear in our lives. And then when they do appear, we want to see them for what they are. And one of the ways to do that is to name it. Naming is a very powerful way of becoming free, of kind of not being identified with what's happening. Like the Buddha said, Mara, I see you. Desire, I see you. Restlessness, I see you. Doubt, I see you. And name it. The other thing is rather than believe the story is connected to it and be involved in the storytelling connected to the five desires, there often is a kind of storytelling going on, is to drop down and feel what's going on in the body. Desire can feel like it's leaning forward or this feeling of grasping or various kinds of sensations in the body. Desire is not a neutral mental event. Sometimes with strong desire you can feel yourself leaning forward or you feel a little bit tightening or you can feel something in your body and feel, what does it feel like in the body to have a desirous body? And it's great to do that. It's very freeing because if we stay connected to the story of desire, then it's all too easy to kind of wander off in it. But if we feel it as a bodily event, it's easier to be free of it. One of the great exercises which I recommend to you, I may have done this recently for this group, is the practice of riding out a desire. I talked to you about that recently. Next time you have some strong desire for something, don't give into the desire. But rather bring your full attention to what the desire feels like in your body. And just stay present, just watch what happens to the desire. And if it's stronger desire, the better this exercise. Because desire can have this tremendous feeling of compulsion behind it. It needs to be now. This is crucial. I'm going to explode if I don't get this desire fulfilled. The whole universe is going to explode. This is like it has to be now. But if you ride a desire out, probably within a few minutes or seconds, often that desire will fade away. It's kind of like a wave that kind of crests and then breaks and fades away. And to start having some experience of watching, of riding these waves of desire and watching them fall away, gives us a tremendous perspective of how easy it is to be fooled by the compulsion. And how we don't have to believe the compulsive nature of them. And how there is something on the other side of them which is actually very close by. If we give into a lot of neurotic desires, it tends to just feed that desire, feed that tendency to further desires. But if people get tremendous confidence, people have addictions for example, various things like food or whatever, can get a lot of confidence in themselves if they've had just a few experiences of riding out the desire and seeing it to the end. And one of the ways to help pull in riding out desire is to feel it in the body. What is it with feeling compulsion? What is it happening in your body as it happens? Same thing with aversion or restlessness or tiredness, sloth or doubt. What does it actually feel, more than just naming it, what does it actually feel like? What's the embodied physical experience of it? Whenever we get connected to the physical experience, it helps us to disconnect from the story making. The story making of doubt, the story making of restlessness, the story making of aversion. Occasionally when the hindrances are very strong, Buddhist teachers will recommend that you apply the antidotes, you bring to mind, or raise in your body, something which is the opposite of the hindrances. If you have strong aversion, you bring up loving kindness. You do loving kindness meditation, which maybe many of you haven't heard about. If you have a lot of restlessness, then you do the opposite, which is you just bring your mind on the breath, and you just keep it on the breath unwaverly, unwavering. So you bring steadiness to the agitation, and you hold yourself really steady. One way to do this is to hold the body really still, and let the restlessness kind of course through your body. If you have a lot of doubt, the opposite of doubt is faith. Maybe to reflect a little bit about what you have confidence in, or the faith you might have in the practice. People who have practiced for a long time, there might be a lot of faith to draw upon, which can overcome some of the doubt that gets in the way. And then lastly, one of the great aids to be mindful of the hindrances is to try to have a sense of humor, because the mind does amazing things. The more you meditate, the more you probably be amazed by what goes on in your mind. And just to have a sense of humor, oh, there is desire. Well, that's another trick of the mind, or there's another force that's trying to keep me distracted. And to have a light approach, maybe even a compassionate approach, or a kind approach, accepting approach, of who you actually are in the present moment. Not to take the hindrances, the appearance of them, as another proof that something is wrong with you. But maybe see them as being impersonal. It's very freeing to see them that way. And just there's stuff that arises, and everyone's going to have them. And the point is to work with them, and learn how to work with them, how to learn how to not to be caught by them, how to develop a stronger presence than the strength of the hindrances themselves. So I hope that this talk is reassuring for some of you might be new to meditation, that some of the things that maybe you've been struggling with are the hindrances, and now you realize that they fit. Rather than thinking something goes wrong with you, and thereby have a fit of doubt, and believe the doubt. So what are your thoughts or questions based on that? Yes, please. When you were talking, I was wondering, when you were in the present, I would call it experience, and what you mean in the present. You were eating a meal? Eating a meal as opposed to desiring the ice cream. There's a difference between in your life, being. Isn't there any desire? I'm not sure, Harry. There's a difference between desiring something and eating a meal. And then there's a presence in eating a meal. Oh, definitely. So the desire would be just something that happens in meditation, or when you're not eating. Desire happens all the time. You're eating, though. Should you be eating a meal? Or you should not desire this meal. No, I'm sure in Hawaii, should you not be in Hawaii? If you're in Hawaii on vacation, you should be thinking about being here, and meditating in Palo Alto. What do you think about here? Thursday evenings. My brothers were visiting me, and it was wonderful. And I was thinking about this. Am I having a good time, or am I... No? My brothers did it from far away, and I was enjoying it so much, desiring. Enjoying is a great thing. The problem is not desire. The problem is our tendency to get lost in desire. Or to have desire running the show. So if you're eating your meal, and you're possibly eating it mindfully, you'd be present for it, and you really enjoy it a lot. It's also possible to be ahead of oneself. And let's eat the main meal as quickly as I can, because there's a dessert that's coming in a few minutes. And mostly we're fantasizing about the dessert. That's what we really want. Or it can be desire for more sensual pleasure. Because we've eaten our fill, we're not really hungry anymore. And so it's not the desire, natural desire, arising out of hunger, but it's a desire arising out of a craving for more pleasure. And sensual pleasure, for example, that often fills, you know, attempt to fill, for example, loneliness or anxiety or something. And so it can operate very powerfully while we're eating a meal, that we no longer need to eat, but we're eating anyway, because we're being led by our desire, ruled by our desire. These forces are operating in daily life a lot. And the whole reason for Buddhist practice is to help us become free of bondage to these forces. It doesn't mean we've become free of those forces. It doesn't mean you have to stop having desire. But the question is, who's in charge? Yes, in the back. What are some methods for fighting sleepiness? Does it mean that I just need to go and start watching meditation? Why is it possible to actually continue sitting, but with some effort of the mind to fight it? Well, it depends a little bit on what the cause of the sleepiness is. In America, a lot of people have sleep deficiency. You should do too many things all the time. Maybe they're better off just forgetting about meditation, just sleep for a week or something. So you have to be realistic, I'm trying to say. If you really can't sleep deficient, that's why you're sleeping, forget about meditation. If you're basically getting enough sleep, you're a little bit sleepy or whatever, then there can be a number of things you can do. If you know you're sleepy before you meditate, I like to wash my face with cold water. The colder the better. Sometimes I wash my face, my ears, my neck, my hands, and sometimes even my feet with cold water, and that'll stimulate me. Sometimes I'll do walking meditation instead of the sitting meditation, because I'm not going to fall asleep doing walking meditation. Sometimes I'll do fast walking meditation for a while, and then I'll sit down, and that fast walking brings energy. Sometimes it can be as simple as sitting up straighter. If our posture has more energy in it, you sit up straighter, that sometimes is enough just to keep me alert and awake, sometimes not. Occasionally people will open their eyes, just usually keep their eyes open about 45 degrees, and keeping their eyes open is enough to keep them awake. The pure thing to do in terms of mindfulness is to bring mindfulness to that event of sleepiness. So you bring your attention to how it feels like to be a sleepy human being. You feel the heaviness and the pressure and the graininess, maybe the eyes and the warmth in your cheeks, or wherever way you feel the sleepiness, you bring your attention to it and explore it and investigate it. Sometimes just that investigation brings energy, and sometimes you fall asleep anyway, but at least you're doing the practice up until the point you fall asleep. So that's something. If it's sloth and torpor and not just sleepiness, if it's because there's kind of a lethargy or resistance or a numbness or dullness that's arisen, then you might want to also investigate the physicality of it, the feel what it's like, actually feel what's happening with you. And as you do that, the cracks of what you're feeling, you might notice some other emotion. You might notice sadness or grief or anger, because sometimes a lot of sleepiness and meditation that's kind of sloth and torpor variety is a form of resistance to some of these very strong negative emotions. Sometimes you might ask yourself if it's that kind of dullness, ask yourself the question, what wants to be expressed here? What am I not accepting here? And sometimes that will kind of just, and whatever you're not accepting will show itself. So there's a number of reasons why a person might be sleepy in meditation. And so you need to kind of get a sense of what the reason is to kind of decide what strategy to take. Is it all helpful? Is it too much? Yes, Kirk. Part of what I understood you to say about we have these, the hindrances come up, and again part of that is because perhaps we're not comfortable with the feeling that we're feeling, and it's more comfortable to feel that it's important to invite them. So I guess my question is, I conclude from that that the better we can get at that, being present and aware and mindful of the hindrances, then we can kind of get, at some point, get to the point where we can be aware of what's really, that feeling that's really going to lead that. Yeah, it's not always that the hindrances are covered in some deeper feeling, but it can often be the case. And yes, the more we can get a handle on the hindrances, the easier it will be to be present for what's actually happening in our life. The hindrances are ways of hindering us from being fully present to what's going on. Last one, please. What point, to bring your attention back to your breath, what do you really do? I mean, I try counting, and I can think and count. Because my mind still does the much in my thing, and I can think and count. Sometimes I catch myself at 13 or 14, and bring the character to one. But is there anything else to really focus on the breath? In mindfulness, what we're doing is, primarily what we're doing is sensing and feeling the experience of breathing. So we're not paying attention to the breath in terms of the air. We're paying attention to what it feels like in the body, for the body to be breathing. So the movement of the stomach, the movement of the chest, the sensation of air going through the nostrils here, the expansion, the warmth, the tightness, the tautness, the release, the relaxation. There's a whole sensual quality to the experience of breathing. And so we're trying to rest the attention in that sensual quality of breathing. Because the mind tends to scatter a lot, it can be useful to count the breath, and that can help us get concentrated. If the mind is very scattered, maybe counting is the best thing to do, but you need to then match the power of your scatteredness with the power of determination to really stay there with a count. Usually in mindfulness we don't count, but rather what we do is we make a very simple name, a table for the in-breath and the out-breath. We say in, out, in, out, in order to help keep us present. And in, out is easier to keep track of than ten numbers. So let's do it. So gently close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths. As you breathe out, settle in, relax. And then let your breath return to normal. And also take a few moments to relax, any places in the body that might be easy to relax. Shoulders, face, jaw. And if you get any sense of the place within you where you do your thinking, your energetics or pressure or attention of the thinking mind, as you breathe out, see if you can relax that. And then as if you're lowering yourself into a comfortable bathtub of water, lower yourself, lower your awareness into your body. Settle yourself, settle your presence into your embodied feeling. And then become aware of the body's experience of breathing. And each time you breathe out, let go of any thoughts or concerns that have crept in, relaxing the thoughts or concerns. And then as you breathe out, let go of any thoughts or concerns that have crept in, let go of any thoughts or concerns that have crept in. See if you can give yourself over to the breathing. So you're fully present for the whole cycle of breathing in and out. And then as you breathe out, let go of any thoughts or concerns that have crept in, let go of any thoughts or concerns that have crept in. So you're fully present for the whole cycle of breathing. And then as we come to the end of the sitting, take a few slow deep breaths into your chest, into the heart area, filling your heart area with feelings of tenderness and kindness to yourself. And as you breathe out, relax any tension or restlessness. Let yourself be filled with loving kindness and compassion. Thank you.
