The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So good morning everyone and we can live in a world where we're quick to think that things are wrong
or we can live in a world where we are present on the main road for what is not taking the side roads.
Something is wrong, being alarmed.
So I don't know what this blacking out is that we have, blinking out.
I do know that when meditation gets very, very still and quiet
that sometimes the mind does things that some people call blinking out.
And some of the blinking outs are just interesting, like wow, what was that?
And they can be repetitive.
And sometimes the blinking out is an amazing transformation that can happen from
and it comes from being on the main road of experience, just being present for what is.
So I see that it blacked out again.
And maybe it's listening to me talk about the blinking out.
So I think because I see it, I'll just repeat myself for a way to, it comes back on again.
And for now I think we're just going to live with it
and maybe use as an opportunity to just as a kind of a wake up to letting go.
Because the blinking and blacking out, the blinking out that can happen in deep meditation
arises when the mind is no longer taking any side roads from the main road.
It's just there.
And in not taking any side roads, it's very present for what is without any
being forward against or any preoccupation, any thinking about it.
The input from the world, the input from the world of thoughts,
it's almost like we're not living in that input, we're not living in our thoughts.
We're not living in being a response, we're not thinking about it
or reacting to anything at all.
And we're not taking up residence in the thoughts or residence anywhere.
And when the mind, the heart, the inner life is just at rest with all things
but not caught in anything or resting in anything or taking up residence in anything,
then something deep can let go.
And sometimes it lasts just for a second like what's happening here
where they're blinking out.
So I think what we'll do today is just continue and I will just,
I can see the blinking out and I'll just, as I said, I'll just kind of pause
and most of them are pretty short.
There's some that lasts for a little bit longer
and it seems like we can just be confident that it'll come back on.
And it's, well, I have about ten minutes here and then we'll switch on to the Zoom.
So the last of these entrances is usually called doubt
but it involves a world of uncertainty, indecisiveness, and confusion about things.
And the opposite of this kind of doubt, confusion, and uncertainty is, I think of it as trust.
And for practice of meditation, it's trusting the main road.
That the main road is this wide road that if you stay on the wide road, you're on the track.
But when you take a lot of those short little side paths that go off,
the narrow side paths that go off from the big wide road,
then you go off into the thickets of the jungles, the woods, and the wilderness
where you may not come back so quickly or just put you in circles
or as you're wandering around for a long time before you come back to the main road.
But trusting the main road of practice that just show up, just be present for this,
be present for this, be present for this.
And when the mind starts going down a side path, remembering,
oh, that's a side path just a year.
And one of the side paths is doubt, confusion, is wondering what to do,
and what am I supposed to put, where am I going, and am I able to do this?
Is this the right teaching?
What about this teaching of not self?
And it doesn't make any sense that the Buddhists teach it.
What do they mean by it? And I have doubts about it.
So all these are kind of side paths.
The path to trust is the path of just being present for this.
It's kind of like the path arises as we step on it.
And so if we are looking beyond our next step for the path,
then it's easy to get into a world of confusion and doubt.
But if we trust that next step, then the path arises,
the path appears in the step, with the step.
And the steps are in mindfulness practice is the simple being present
for the obvious experience of the moment, the recognition of it.
And so if there's anything that happens that,
well, this is happening, this is happening, this is happening.
And one of the forms of doubt and one of the side paths people might take
is, well, how then will I take care of myself?
How will I take care of the world if I'm just so simplistically taking this moment, this moment?
Two answers to this.
One is that the primary reference point where we're talking about right now is meditation.
And how we are in meditation might be different how we are in daily life.
We're mindful in both.
But in meditation, that's where we can have this radical simplicity
of just being with the obvious, being present for this, this.
We don't have to solve the world's problems while we're in meditation.
We don't have to solve our problems.
What we're doing in meditation, how we're present for our experience,
doesn't have to be directly connected to solving all the problems around us.
But being present in meditation prepares us to be able to be wise
and considerate and kind in how we respond to things outside of meditation.
So this ability to just keep it simple.
It also teaches us how much we complicate things unnecessarily
because the radical simplicity of meditation kind of highlights the complications,
highlights how we bear away.
And so when we go back into our daily life, we're wiser about that.
We'll notice the kinds of getting preoccupied in thoughts which are not useful
and be able to recognize the way to be in thought and the way to be that is useful
and how we can engage in problem solving if we need to.
And so to have this deep trust, just be present.
Just be present.
And certainly doubts, uncertainties, hesitations, confusions will arise.
And the path of mindfulness is, in the Satipatana, is simply to know,
oh, this is confusion.
This is doubt.
This is uncertainty.
This is vacillation.
This is a lack of commitment.
But this is what it looks like.
This is what it is.
To see it arise, to see it be present, to see it absent,
to see it as a hindrance in meditation.
It's a hindrance for continuing to walk on that main road.
There could be all kinds of healthy doubts that we have in our life.
And there's doubts in daily life.
There's the blinking.
And there's doubts in daily life.
How we have one.
This has to be fast.
Quickly, quickly, then we'll switch over to Zoom.
So I'm back.
So I'll try to finish quickly.
And now, and it's just, you know, it just, this is what's happening.
This is what we're present for.
And in a sense, we're kind of in this Dharma mode here.
I am talking and meditating after the meditation.
But this is a time to not make anything a problem.
And we can have problems later.
We have to address.
And certainly this will be an issue we'll look at and all that.
So there's all kinds of healthy doubts that we can have.
And healthy doubts are ones that encourage us to look more deeply,
consider more deeply, question in an appropriate way.
Unhealthy doubts are the ones that keep us indecisive or confused
or hesitant in a way that without the kind of forward-leaning
or forward-going questioning and wondering what's going on.
And so it'd be able to distinguish healthy and unhealthy.
But in this kind of meditative way of Satipatana,
it gives us an opportunity to see the arising of it.
We can see it when it's not there.
We get a feel for the sense of trust and clarity
when we're just staying on the main road.
And also we can see how we can let go of it when it comes.
Because we don't have to debate it or justify it when we're meditating.
We can trust the main path.
Just be present, just be present, just be present.
And then things like doubt arise and pass and they're not our business.
We just kind of pause for them briefly, maybe,
like with the blinking of the video we have today.
And then we continue on the path.
So thank you for this.
And thank you for hanging in there with us.
I think it's kind of wonderful that we have an issue like this
that we don't lose the connection more than a few moments.
And we can just practice the main path with it and continue.
