 So one more thing that I'll say about these poems before I share a number of them is that a number of poems are the monastics, you know, doing this confident exclamation filled with euphoria. But some of them are worded as if somebody else is addressing the monk or nun. And the way that I'm interpreting this is that they are remembering instructions that they were given and like, Oh yeah, now I understand these instructions, or now that I followed them now I can I'm reaping the fruit of them, or something like this so maybe with that as a little introduction to some of these poems. I'm going to share screen, and I'd like to share some of the different ways in which awakening freedom gets expressed, and I'll do this with a little bit of a different tone, less in the terms of our lesson listening to poetry, and more kind of like, how is awakening expressed, so I'll share screen. And so you can see some of these works, share some of these with you. Okay, here we go. Could I get a thumbs up if from camera David I can see you guys. Yep. Great. Thank you. Okay. So, one of these ways that we hear this awakening getting expressed is by freedom, like we saw an Apadachara poem. And here's a poem by by somebody named Sue Mungala. This is a monk we might understand his name to mean the very lucky one or the most auspicious or something. And it goes like this. So freed. So freed. So thoroughly freed, am I from three crooked things, my sickles, my shovels, my plows. Even if they were here right here I'd be done with them. Done. So, John, I see you mangana. Do John a sumanga that sumanga that stay heat full. So just like in the Apadachara poem at the beginning that she's referring to these farmers they reap the best it's to their fruit. We see this person is a farmer. It's also freed from these work from sickles and shovels and plows and the toil of farming. And this feeling like okay I'm done. Maybe he's done with the sense of being burdened by them, or maybe he's a monastic now and he doesn't do farm work. And then these last three lines do John us among that. And then the next line is a type of meditative experience of deep concentration. So perhaps he's remembering the instructions that were given to him to do this meditation practice to this particular concentration practice. And Paul you could also be interpreted just to meditate and then this is a particular type of meditation, and also to stay heat full. So he has this exclamation, as well as this memory, but he's expressing it by using this word free to be free. Another way that freedom gets expressed is by finding peace. So, here's another monk. This is yes adapter, who is saying one with contented mind who listens to the victors instruction. Having wiped out all defilements, having experienced the unshakable having arrived at ultimate peace is quenched without defilements. So this idea of wiping out the defilements those of you who are familiar with this little bit of Paul the other teachings this is the us of us, we could also sometimes call the taints. That is the central desire or becoming or ignorance so no longer having this not only central desire but the sense of having a sense, I'm sorry, sense of having a self, like becoming, and the sense of stability that is unshakable and peaceful. And then this word here is, is quenched without defilements quenched is parinabhuta, just parinabhana is that word so relating to awakening, the similar one that we know that the Buddha experience. Sometimes we think parinabhana has to do with one's final awakening that is when they die, but it also can be used, just in the sense of awakening, nabhana. So finding peace, wiping out defilements, having some clear stability is another way in which awakening is experienced. One more way is to shatter the mass of darkness. Puna is a nun, her name means full. So it's a little play on words, her, the name, her name, and the way that the poem goes, Puna, be filled with the Dharma, like the moon on the 15th day. When your wisdom is full, shatter the mass of darkness. So the sense of fullness be filled with the Dharma, be like the moon, when it's a full moon, the 15th day is the full moon. So like a full moon. Often we see that being an expression of awakening. And this idea to shatter the mass of darkness, massive darkness we could understand to be delusion and ignorance. So kind of the opposite of what we saw with Padachara, where she goes from light into dark, here is to go from dark into light. Again, that kind of play of a different perceptual experience, just the shift in the perceptual experience. But another way in which we might understand massive darkness is this freedom from the societal beliefs or oppression or some of the darkness of this idea that women can't become awakened. Instead, she is shattering these any of these expectations people might have and she herself is becoming awakened here, just like the full moon. So, another way is fulfilling the Buddha's instructions. This is done by Anand, her name is Samma. Four or five times I left my dwelling. I'd failed to find peace of heart or any control over my mind. Now, it is the eighth night since craving was eradicated. The subject to so many painful things I have through my love of diligence reached the ending of craving and fulfilled the Buddha's instructions. So we see this expression to fulfill the Buddha's instructions to do the Buddha's teachings as a number of ways in which awakening gets expressed, but also this idea of craving was eradicated like this ending of no longer the craving becoming, for example, which is one of the tanks, one of the ossifas, one of the defilements. And then maybe the last one that I'll share about how awakening gets expressed is about attaining the three knowledges, which is quite remarkable. Those of you who are familiar with some of the Buddha's teachings know that the Buddha himself, he described his awakening as acquiring three knowledges. So here is somebody who's saying that they have the same awakening as the Buddha. They have the same experience. This is quite remarkable. This is Meghia, who is a monk. There's also a number of nuns who say this. I'll say a little bit about Meghia. He was the attendant for the Buddha before Ananda. He canceled me, the great hero, the one who has gone beyond all things. When I heard his teaching, I stayed close by him, mindful. I've attained the three knowledges and fulfilled the Buddha's instructions. So the three knowledges, the third one is the one that is really required for awakening, and that is the destruction of the tanks, the eradication of defilements that we saw in an earlier poem. The first knowledge is to see one's past lives. And the second knowledge is to see the arising and passing of beings into different rebirths according to their actions. So these are some of the different ways in which the poems, they're all pointing towards awakening but gets expressed in different ways. So with that, I'll end it and I'll turn it over to David. Yeah, thank you, Diana. It's funny how we almost didn't have time, we thought, for Ron's question. And this was like an extended answer to Ron's question. So just how things work out sometimes. In sort of suggesting many ways that this poetry from these texts can be held, we've this morning with Ying, we just, without sharing screen and seeing the text and sort of the visual aspect we had this introduction, lovely introduction to the poems and some later poetry. And then Diana has sort of shared screen and we've also done some what, shared ruminations in the breakout rooms to sort of, you know, hold the poetry in community, which is part of our study and practice format. And now we'd like to do some, do a little meditation period with some lines of poetry dropped in. And I've selected two stanzas from two quite different poems, but that seemed to me sort of a question and an answer. And I'll drop one in sort of early in the meditation and then at some point later on, we'll probably sit for just about 10 minutes now. So sort of a quicker meditation but just to experiment and explore what it's like to sit with a little this poetry dropped in. So, I trust everyone here is an experienced practitioner, certainly has a practice that they meditate with. So let's, let's just enter into a meditative place, maybe bring some attention as we, as we sit to our inner, the inner experience that we become aware of as we bring the eyes down, rebalancing our attention to the visual sphere, the visual realm to some attention to the inner life. Bringing some attention to the posture and just establishing a meditative balance there between attentive presence and ease. Maybe taking a breath or two in through the nose out through the mouth or a deeper breath to just bring ourselves here and engage again in a little rebalancing. And then with a deep in breath through the nose some additional oxygen to the bloodstream, letting go with an out breath through the mouth, touching in with a sense of ease and settling in. And into this meditative space can drop these verses that I think pose a question that, although framed, thousands of years ago, our question that we all resonate with in our practice. Mountains, oceans, rivers, the entire earth, the four cardinal directions east, west, south, north, and then up into the sky and down into the earth. In this three states of existence, all our experience are impermanent, troubled, unreliable. Where can you find, where can you go to find contentment. Thank you. Thank you. Mountains, oceans, rivers, earth, four directions, three states of existence, all are impermanent, all troubled. Where can you go to find happiness, mind. Thank you. Here, my little hut is roofed and pleasant, sheltered from the wind. So go ahead and rain sky, if you wish. If your mind is serene, free, then I practice ardently. So go ahead and rain sky, if you wish. This little hut here is roofed and pleasant, sheltered from the storm. So rain sky, if you wish. The mind is serene, free, I practice ardently. So go ahead and rain sky. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, David. That was very sweet and beautiful. So now today you've experienced several, I think four of us each shared a way of relating to poetry, awakening poems through reading it out loud and receiving it, and through sharing it, reflecting collectively as a group, and reading different ways that Diana shared using a visual kind of receptor. And then that through meditative experience, so we wanted to maybe open it up for you to share any reflections at this point, or if you have any questions about all these different ways that we've been engaging with the awakening poems. So we have a few minutes for you to share your voices. And if you could use your Zoom hand and be helpful. So Atiti, I see your hand up. Hi, thank you. Not just with these poems, but some of the other ones, you know, I felt like I've noticed in the person who's writing a poem, a kind of frustration with their current life with their husband, a thing. And you know, the way I understand the Dharma is like the path is through acceptance. I know I'm being rigid here, but like I noticed a lot of judgment about them. I'm like, I'm supposed to accept everything and they just didn't accept and still got enlightened. So that's just a thought I get sometimes. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for sharing that. It's very lovely and it's very real for us. Right. And we have our families and we had to do work and lots of activities that demands us for engaging in our lives in various ways. Yeah. And this is definitely something that we all work with and how we relate to them. And I think one thing I'll point out is something that Diana and others shared. That is, a lot of our journey is to cultivate the conditions to allow things to unfold. And often we can't just jerk our way around and thinking that, you know, based on our own compulsive wanting when the conditions are what they are. And we practice really recognizing what is needed in our condition, in our environment, what is needed and trusting the unfolding of this process. And many of the poetry shared in this collection and this collections of mentioned that they've spent their whole life, long, long lives in the conditions that many of us are in. And they keep working with this, when the conditions are ripened in various ways and maybe different unfolding will happen. Thank you for bringing that in. Yes. And I'd like to add something if I may. Often, you know, when we first began meditating was like, Oh my goodness, I had no idea my mind was so out of control. It's only when we have like the mind starts to settle that it really highlights how unsettled it was. And I can't imagine the same thing is happening when they have this experience of complete freedom, then all the ways in which they were bound up gets highlighted. They didn't even know they were bound up then, but it's just becomes really apparent and contrast. I would touch on a point in just adding a comment here to something that Deborah offered early earlier on and that we saw in the Pata Chara poem, which is that sometimes it's in those it's in the humdrum mundane daily life practice that we come to see the profound. And we haven't drawn too much attention to it, but in the Pata Chara poem, it's in washing her feet that she notices this rather profound thing about the world, the way water goes downhill gravity. I think sort of there's a sense of the inevitability of the course of her practice maybe from that point. And so it's, and then the mind becomes settled and still, and then the flame can go out the flame of attachment the flame of craving to intersect a little bit with Ron's earlier question. But so sometimes it's in that daily life. And I think that turns up in the poems that we actually come to see and find the course of practice so it's not necessarily by rejecting, but by entering fully into into the daily round that freedom happens. And I think I would just also say that this may well be how we practice in the modern days, because our, we are not in the same conditions, you know, 2500 years ago, and how we practice, I enlarge is in this form. Working with all of the ordinary activities in our lives. But can we give ourselves over in this ordinary activities as we go along. Any other reflections or questions. Hey, Randy. I would like to say briefly that I thank you for introducing us to these very simple ideas and tell the teachers who know me that I find this so, this message so simple and refreshing. Compared to what I am usually immersed in, which is the great complexity of texts and generation practices in Mahayana that I also hold very close. So I have benefited greatly from your, your very simple and touching messages here. Thank you. Thank you, Randy. Thank you for sharing this. Yeah, all those different ways that we can touch the sutras and the kali kenon collections. So I'm going to pass it on to Diana, who's going to wrap up for the day. Great. Thank you. And I'll just throw in my appreciation for Randy's comment. That's part of the reason why we wanted to do this awakening plans is just to highlight there's so many different ways to interact with the text, as well as there are so many different types of texts. So, it's part of why the four of us we just never stop kind of like discovering things even like during the breakout group. We came up with this new idea like hey we should do this or something so anyway, so just this, this richness and this depth that we're all appreciating. So, and as wrapping up I just would like to encourage you to interact with these poems and a number of different ways. Maybe some of them feel really speak to the heart, and maybe some of them are a little bit more analytical and you can see something or maybe some of them are a little bit head scratching. We'll just allow for the wide range. And then for the next class, which is Tuesday morning, we will be looking at a longer poem. And so we're going to send it out beforehand, so you'll be able to have an opportunity to look at it and then we'll talk about it and discuss it during the class so you'll get an email from us with a longer poem, and then I'll just pass it on over to David. Oh, am I supposed to do something here. It's because we're out of time. I think I'm just going to say thank you and end it for today. Yeah, I think enjoy reading the poem that comes to you this week and with these various ways we've introduced today see, see how it feels I mean be analytical and look for metaphor, you know, treated as a poem, you know that you might come across in a class, but also maybe dip a couplet or a stanza you know group of four lines or group of two lines into your meditation like we did, or read it out loud to see how it feels in the, in the, in the air. At any rate, enjoy this assignment this homework. Take pleasure in it, and, and enjoy. So that's, that's what I'm saying. Take care, we'll see you Tuesday. Thanks for coming. We look forward to that. For you to unmute. Feel free to unmute. Thank you. Thank you.
