 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Derma, here we go. Great, okay. So hello and welcome, a warm, warm welcome, dear Sangha. So let's dive into practicing together, and I will introduce the theme for this evening during the meditation, as I sometimes do, just to mix it up. So let's begin. Let's arrive. Let's arrive in our bodies. Ahh, arriving in this body. Maybe start by three deep diaphragmatic breaths. We'll take a deep breath, hold it for a few seconds, and then let out with a sigh. Let's do it together. Breathing in into the belly. Hold. And release. Ahh. Your shoulders come down, your whole body release. One more. Ahh. Releasing deeply. Let your breath be received in the belly, third one. Hold. And release. You can do more if you want on your own time. Or return, return to natural breath. As we do in mindfulness practice, letting the breath be natural. After you have settled, after you found it. And opening up the body, the body, especially the lower abdomen, the whole body starting from the lower abdomen. To receive the breath, to receive the breath, all the sensations, whatever is present. Opening your heart to whatever is present. With the breath settling, arriving. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Drop in the question, can I be content right here in this moment? Just taking refuge of the breath in this moment. With solitude and silence. Can there be contentment? Can I meet it? Can I stop running, needing more, seeking, becoming? Just in this moment, can I try it out? And if the answer comes back now, can I be content with the resistance? Can I embrace that? Can I hug the resistance with kindness and warmth? If there is any, and if not, can I make space for myself to just be? Rest. Can I put down planning, wanting, needing, becoming? For just this moment, I can always pick it up later, but right now can I experiment with releasing into peace, into just this radical acceptance? Thank you. Thank you. And if you notice that your mind has picked up something else, the thought, plan, and becoming, it's okay. It's totally fine. Can you be kind with this wanting mind? Oh dear, sweet wanting mind. This is your habit, isn't it? It's okay. All right. Can we let go, sweetie? Can we let go for just this moment? Just putting it down, just being with the breath, taking refuge, being enough, whatever has happened or not happened to be enough. Just in this moment, see what it's like. Breathing with being enough, contentment is kindness. Breathe it in, breathe it out. Try it on for size. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. And we let go of thinking, becoming, wanting, just in this moment. Take peace with the contentment of just being here, being breathed. This moment in time, everything that has led to this. Embracing the bounty, the enoughness, the plenitude, the plenity of the body. The love of this moment. It's not just enough, it's more than enough. It's abundant in so many ways. Can we turn to that? Not turn to the lack what's missing? Yes, we can turn to plenty that's missing, or should or could, but can we turn, choose to turn to the abundance? You're the enoughness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Rest, rest, dear heart, rest. This is enough. Rest. Breathing in, breathing out, rest. Rest. you you you you you you you you you you be kind to the mind, the heart that wants to plan, wants to remember all of that and it's okay can you remind it that it is enough in this moment to just be gently, kindly, lovingly remind the puppy of the mind, the heart that it's enough in this moment there's abundance right here it can rest and be nourished nourished with the breath, with the entirety of the in-breath entirety of the out-breath, just this one breath and then again this one breath, just one breath at a time be nourished by it not planning for five or ten breaths, no just this one and then begin again you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you as we turn to bring this meditation to a close can we embrace and be content with whatever this period of practice was like whether there was contentment or not maybe a whiff of it or maybe not the mind was wondering wanting this and that can we be content with that as a radical act of contentment in this moment this practice showed up for me exactly as it needed to in this moment in time given all the causes and conditions can I accept that can I release into peace with contentment? Yes and trusting that there is goodness here co-created through our practice our engagement our effort and sharing this goodness offering it freely to all beings everywhere including ourselves may all beings everywhere know the taste of contentment ease goodness not as a way to resign it's not a resignation but as a stepping stone for growth may all our collective practice be of service to all beings everywhere may all beings be well may all beings be free including ourselves thanks everyone thanks for your practice so so couple of words one is in societies and cultures where there's always wanting more more more more more practicing with exploring contentment is a radical act it feels quite radical sometimes even unfamiliar feels like resignation and it's not it's not resignation it's a way of accepting contentment turning towards what is enough what is good oh yes it doesn't mean we don't engage with with growth we don't engage with the practice we don't engage with cultivating continue to cultivate wisdom compassion our hearts our minds it doesn't mean that we say oh it's I'm content with just what is it doesn't mean that but there is a level of contentment that's needed with what is so that we don't become a hungry ghost and there is this story of in Buddhism there are these creatures on one of the hell realm levels they have a very very long neck and very narrow narrow long neck and also a very narrow small mouth and they have a huge stomach and they're called the realm of the hungry ghost they're always hungry they cannot get enough to eat they're never satiated they're they have a huge stomach so they're hungry they want more more more but but their necks are very tight their mouths are very small so the realm of a hungry ghost is a pretty tough one and and whether we believe in the Buddhist cosmology we can actually see it as as in this world sometimes we become a hungry ghost we want more more more more more more this more that more that so we we are in this realm of suffering of more more more so turning turning towards contentment to release that hungry ghostness and again just to repeat myself one more time it doesn't mean that we don't engage we don't we're resigned it doesn't mean that we give up we continue to to cultivate and practice but if you explored it tonight the sense of exploring contentment it gives rise to a release letting go like ah okay sense of stability and then actually the mind the heart can be more available more ready more open to engage in a different way not in a hungry way not in a raspy way want this plan this remember this kind of an open it's a different way of being anyway so for tonight's inquiry together the question that I'd like to invite you to explore is how do I how do I experience how do I experience contentment in this moment, how do I experience it, and we'll go around, and each person will say just one word or phrase. Maybe I experienced it as release I experienced it as freedom I expressed it as, ah, my breath feels more free. And then the next person offers something the next person you can also say pass and just hold witness compassionate witness kind witness to everyone you don't have to speak. But let's explore, maybe a couple rounds and then you can open it up for exploring, reflecting together. And remember, you're just sharing from me your own experience you don't ask other people's experience even if what they say you don't understand at all, you don't explore you don't ask them, just just offer from yourself and and receive whatever is offered in the space with contentment so not directing the space. So, so, again, the question that the inquiry question is how do you experience contentment in your body. In your mind, in your heart, how do you experience contentment. How is it experienced for you. Okay. All right, I'm creating the rooms to breakout rooms, be kind to yourself, kind to each other. Here we go. Everyone welcome back so and we have some time for reflections for observations aha moments challenges questions. And especially if you haven't spoken for a while. And the big group would love to invite you to move forward for the benefit of yourself and others. What did you notice with this practice, both with the sharing and the meditation chain. I just wanted to ask a question Nikki that came up and just it prompted in my small group of just the idea that is contentment a synonym or involved with acceptance surrender and love, even just wonder what you might think of that. Yeah, yeah, thanks Jane. Interesting. It has contentment is definitely, you know, I think of a Venn diagram with circles and, and it's not exactly the same as the ones that you named, but there is some overlap, there is some overlap with acceptance but it's not exactly that it has more nourishing quality to it there's more an uplift there's more of a sweetness to it. It feels kind, but it's so, so I think it's it's fun it's it's it's such a I'm so glad you brought that up because it's, it's, it's a lovely curiosity to explore what's these different beautiful hard qualities they're all, they're all a little different and similar and I share this because in the way that when I was practicing with my Burmese teacher Park Syeda years ago and there were these very very nuanced states of mind that he would have me explore and look at and just really, really feel into what they were like and at the first, you know, at first you're like oh this is like that but then you really feel into it or you explore it you're curious like, oh yeah this, this feels different and the qualitatively different side. So, with the question that you raised Gina, I invite you to be curious about the similarities and and nuanced differences between all of that. How does that sound. Thank you, Nikki, that sounds good. Yeah, I appreciate this practice. Thank you. Thanks for that question. Charlie, please. Oh yeah, thank you. Thank you. I missed meditation practice but I did was here in time for our small groups and a wonderful content experience. So very recursive. I guess what came up for me was just kind of, yeah, that feeling of warmth, but also an idea that, you know, contentment is, is, is always available I think prior to my practice of Buddhism. I kind of, you know, maybe accidentally ran into contentment, you know, every so often, but I had no idea that there were ways to, to, to bring about contentment. And in some ways almost that almost at will. And, and, and so so it's just been, you know, it's just been so wonderful to, you know, to be able to do that and then one of the people in my group had mentioned that contentment was like a, like a home and, you know, I thought, you know, is it another, or is it a, is it a type of Brahma Vahara and you mentioned, you know, love and kindness and mind states and so I gave me a lot to think about contentment, kind of the Buddhist joy. It's not, you know, fireworks, it's not, you know, this, you know, very like, you know, super sense, pleasure place, but, but gosh it feels, you know, just feels so easy. Yeah, yeah, beautiful. Thank you so much for these reflections, Charlie, just, just beautiful. So many important points you raised, one of them being that it's available, it's here, it's always available. And, and there's something about the Buddhist practice, about the beauty of this practice that lets us appreciate that. It doesn't, doesn't mean that all conditions have to be perfect, you know, this and that and relationship and finances and the home. It doesn't have to be perfection, you know, there's this sense that an ordinary mind has that, oh, yes, I will be happy. I will be content when X and Y and Z, even helping the perfect relationship. Yeah, that's when I'll be content when I get my degree or all of that. And yet, there's always contentment. It's just this, this beautiful, soft, easy, as you said, and also as you were talking, also realize it, in addition to what Jane was saying, Jane was the beautiful states of mind, it also relates to equanimity. There's a sense of equanimity resting in this, oh yeah, spaciousness of the heart and mind. And, yeah, thank you, beautiful, wise reflections, Charlie. And I smiled when you said in the group, it was lovely and it was recursive. You said, are you a computer scientist? That's the recursion, I was just delighting, I haven't heard recursion in this context. Oh, sorry, dropped my device. I'm a neuroscientist. That was my degree in college, so not as smart as a neuroscientist. Because recursion is a particular term, I thought all the nerds on this call would probably, I've seen Neil, who I know is also a fellow, and he's like, oh yeah, recursion. Anyway, just a, in our joke of a particular way, an algorithm is coded, it's kind of recursive. But anyway, thanks for bringing that in, Charlie, that brought a smile to my heart, that was fun. Great, thank you. Bill says this was educational. I don't remember ever seeing the mind so hungry and to then realize that it is the normal state of mind, of my mind 99.9% of the time. Can we do more of this? Yes. And somebody hearted that request, yes, we can do more. This was such a fun exploration, thank you all. And Serena says I don't think any path owns contentment. Everyone human can be capable of contentment, even with the people who don't follow a particular path. Oh, of course, yeah, contentment is part of the human, you know, all the range of emotions are part of the range of our human capacity. I think what I was saying and agreeing with Charlie is that many of us don't realize that it's available to us. We're all, if we don't have a training, and it could be any kind of training, Buddhist training, Christian training, any kind of training that points to, or stoic training, I don't know, there's so many philosophies, points to contentment. If we don't have a training, we're usually stuck in, in negative states of mind. And so, so for me also this practice really supported me to to get in touch with contentment. So, so thank you all. I feel full and delighted and happy and content with our practice this evening. So much joy, so much joy as we come together and practice. So thank you all. Thank you for showing up, cultivating your heart and mind, exploring equanimity, exploring contentment for benefit of yourself and in service of all beings everywhere. May we all know contentment. May we all be free. Thanks everyone. Take good care.
