 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So I'll tell you what my main purpose or hope through this talk up front. And then I'll kind of give the talk, kind of support that. And that is for you to reflect on your life, to review your life, like kind of your autobiography, through the lens of caregiving emotions, feelings. Like so, you know, kindness, compassion, love, care itself. That's a whole thing I'll talk about. And, you know, it's interesting to look at a person's own life and understand it in new ways and new perspectives. And it's going to be quite freeing, opening, sometimes understanding one's life story even. From a new perspective sets the foundation for further growth, growth in the Dharma even. And, you know, it's not that it's maybe that interesting for everyone else, but you could, for example, probably tell your life story from the perspective of your hair. And if you're old enough, you know, there's been a lot of history about how you've been with your hair. So that would make a story, you know, so different things. So your life story from the perspective of care. So in that regard, then I'd like to talk a little bit about my own, maybe as an example of this kind of way of thinking and orientation. And it brings together some of the different things I've been thinking about lately. So it's kind of topical for me to give a talk on this. And I don't think I gave a lot of thought to caregiving feelings, emotions, motivations until I'd been a Zen student for a while. And then I reviewed a little bit my life at that point. And then I saw, oh, there were probably some influences on me. And the big one that I associated with kind of being compassionate or the value of compassion was my mother. And I think one of the many big impact on me, I grew up a little bit in Italy. And it seemed like in Italy, she was regularly stopping for strangers who were in car crashes. And that seemed to be a regular thing to encounter. And she even bought a big first aid kit so she'd be ready to help people. And support people who were in car accidents. And she would pull over and stop if you saw something like that. And I think that had a big impact on me. She would have this caregiving instinct for strangers and help them out. And I didn't realize at the time that it had influence on me, but I think it kind of went in by osmosis somehow and had an impact. And then I remember both my father and also a little later when I was working for the Zen Center, my brand new student there, and I was working at the bakery. Both circumstances where my father made a donation to some nonprofit. I think it was Save the Children or something. And I thought, wow, people do this thing? Why would you do that? And then when I was at the working for Zen Center, they used to have a bakery called Tassajara Bakery. And so over on Cold Street in San Francisco. So I used to work there. And one day I was up in the office and the person who ran the bakery, a Zen priest, was sitting at his table. Some reason I was sitting next to him. And he got a letter from a local association for the Cold Street Association or something asking for a donation. And he asked me, you know, how much should we give? I probably didn't say anything. I didn't like, what, you give money? And he said, well, I think we'll do $50. And I said, wow, 1979. And so this idea that you would do such things was kind of novel for me, even though I saw it a little bit growing up as well. But it had a big impact. It went in kind of deeply. And oh, this is an interesting way of living. And then as I practiced Zen, my first Buddhist practice, I suffered a lot. And at least the way I understand myself was that at Zen Center, there was very little instructions on mindfulness, none. And so there wasn't any instructions for mindfulness of emotions and mindfulness of your suffering. The instruction was just to sit there upright, unmoving, and just keep showing up for the present moment in a kind of uncomplicated way. Just be there, be there, be there. And so I didn't, you know, I had any thought I should do any difference. So that's what I was told. So that's what I did. And so what it meant was I sat with a lot of suffering. And so that had an impact on me to sit with a lot of suffering and just sit and breathe and not react and not get caught up in stories and reactivity to it and just feel it and be with it. And I felt quite lucky that I didn't have a lot of instructions of what to do with it. Because then the simplicity of suffering somehow became like a tenderizer for the heart. And something shifted and changed. And I don't know if the suffering so much, it definitely decreased. But it started to work on me. And this idea that suffering can work on you or, you know, that it has a chance to work on you if you're not trying to solve it and fix it and, you know, and get away from it or something, but just be with it. But I didn't have a lot of psychological understanding either about all this. And, you know, it was pretty naive in many ways about my own suffering. And then I started, remember, I started recognizing suffering and compassion in other people. And then I started recognizing compassion in objects. There was a statue at the San Francisco Zen Center, it's still there, that was positioned before where you, like you'd come out of meditation in the morning and you'd walk right up against it before you had to make a right turn. It's like, it's right there. It's about five feet tall or so. And it's kind of a sinewing, kind of narrow kind of thing that kind of spirals up a little bit. And I would see this as the embodiment of compassion, like Quan Yin, the embodiment of compassion. I'd go over there and see this. And many years later I discovered that the artists thought it was a flame. And it probably looks more like a flame than what most people think of as compassion. And then also I started feeling compassion in the wind when it breezed against my cheek. And I would look for photographs, I started collecting photographs of Quan Yin, of Kabbaloke Teshvara, of Kanon, and just that's what I did. And I started drawing them and different things. And I think what was happening was that I needed more compassion. And I was also beginning to feel something like compassion arising in me from all this sitting with suffering. And so I was kind of like tuned into it around me to receive it. But some of the tuning in around me, I was projecting it on the situation. I remember telling someone that, that person's so compassionate. And they'd look at me, you've got to be kidding. And so I don't know what I was picking up, but the fact that I was seeing it in the statue, I really needed it. So I was finding it and getting it. And so I don't know how enlightened I got in Zen, but I became compassionate in Zen. And that made a huge difference for me that made you huge. I'm so grateful for it. And at some point I decided to become a Zen priest. And it was kind of a culmination of that. And then it was called a monk. I got ordained as a Zen monk. And then three months later they changed the name to a priest. And I said, what? What did I just sign up for? A whole different feeling of what it was about. And now I'm happy with the word priest, I don't mind it, but technically still M. But the reason to become a monk was in fact to respond to the suffering of the world. And slowly over time, especially in the monastics and life, that something began to settle and open up. And that it seemed like it was just inherent in me to be, I can't even say me almost, like inherent within me, this responsivity to suffering around me. And that's kind of what was, it wasn't like I chose to respond to it, but it's kind of like, that's what you do, that's what happens. But they did take this form that I became a Zen monk. Really the purpose of it was, I thought that the deepest way, fullest way I knew to address human suffering was through Buddhism. I didn't know anything else. I wanted to have, I'd feel like I'd be dissatisfied if I did any other kind of care for the world. And I had other ideas in mind, I was supposed to go to graduate school and was going to do a kind of thing that was, but I felt like I needed to be able to, I felt like I had to for who I am. I didn't want that dissatisfaction or that sense of incompleteness I felt. If I didn't try to meet the suffering of the world, address it, the deepest thing I knew how, which was through Buddhism. And it wasn't like I was thinking of becoming a teacher. I just thought I'd, you know, I would, I thought one image I had was that I would have a little city, like a city storefront or something, where I have meditation, a Zen doe meditation hall, and I'd just have a key and I'd open up, I'd keep it clean, I'd open it up, and people would come in, they'd leave. So who knew that I would spend a year and a half just opening it up and now I'm gaming. And so then being ordained, the idea was that compassion was my motivating force in my life. And that's how I saw it for myself, that that's what I was all about. And then, and for years I kind of still felt that was the case, but slowly something began shifting and I was always kind of late to understand the shift. It's only retrospectively. So at some point I left the Zen Center for practicing there, to practice Bipassana, first in Asia, and then here in this country. And clearly something shifted in the meditation, because meditation no longer became about suffering and about compassion. And something began shifting, and I couldn't tell you what it was, but while things were shifting, I became, and all along in this process, I became more and more acutely aware of how much suffering there is in the world. But what was, I think, really meaningful, important to recognize, is that because I was practicing so much, there became more and more room in me to recognize the suffering, more space for it, for me not to take it personally or for it to touch my own suffering and irritate, like put salt in the wound or something, that there was more, I had greater capacity to be with people suffering and pain, and not somehow wilt because of it or be burdened by it, and this openness is going to... And so that, I think, was a lovely thing to have that. But then I went to practice in Asia, and there was a dramatic shift that happened there, and where my own suffering was no longer a salient issue. And then the practice opened up in a new way, and then something different happened to me. And again, this was kind of also a surprise. And this kind of funny story, maybe funny, sad, I don't know what, was I came to practice in the United States and practice at the retreat center in Massachusetts, IMS, I did a three-month retreat, and that was kind of the first time to practice with Western teachers. And to my surprise, they started doing some of the... The beginning is bangin' on some of the meditations with doing loving-kindness meditation, a little guided loving-kindness. And the first time I did it, I said, oh, this is great. I thought, oh, this is nice, this kind of surprise. But they kept doing it. And for the kind of Zen student I was, you don't talk to people when they're meditating. And also Zen is kind of like a play... Zen is more stoic and stern and like you get to the truth directly, and nothing sentimental to kind of make it, you know, whatever, something like that. That's the way I took it in. I'm not saying that's what Zen is about, but that's how I took it in. And kind of silly, but I did. And so I just did what a reasonable person would do, maybe. Was it teachers would show up to do this guided loving-kindness meditation? I would just tune them out. But at some point during that three-month retreat, this wonderful feeling of clarity and kindness and goodness started to well up inside of me. And then one day they came to do the guided loving-kindness meditation, and I said, oh, that's what they're talking about. Oh. And then I had my own reference for it. It wasn't insincere, it wasn't trying to make something happen. And then when they did it, it's like I just tapped into that and built on what was already there. And so then what happened in my practice, in my life, was that, and I still kind of called it compassion. I didn't know any better. But I think I slowly realized I was more motivated by day-to-day kind of overall with a mood of kindness. And earlier it was kind of like there was a deep underlying mood that I recognized was always there of compassion. But as it shifted to kindness as the underlying mood, I realized that the compassion, as wonderful and profound as it is, involved a certain kind of a little bit more activated internal state for me. And the kindness turned out to be a simpler, less complicated, or less involved state. I mean, the difference here is very little. And so I want to be very careful not to, there's no disrespect or devaluing on the importance of compassion. But I noticed this was a shift happened. And now that shift happened, I still thought I was motivated by compassion. But in fact, over time I realized it was a whole different sentiment than how to be. And it was simpler. And sometimes it would morph into compassion for sure. But it was kindness became, or friendliness or goodwill became the salient kind of interesting kind of expression of what was happening to me in practice. And that kind of felt like the mood or where I was coming from. So that went along fine for a while. And then at some point in the last 15 years or so, you see, I have all these decades, you know, I could review, you know. So it's a slow process, you know, this is not like, you know, sit down and, you know, three day process and get to what I'm talking about. For me, it was like a decades long process of really simmering in the Dharma and letting it unfold. And then I started noticing that one of the salient features that was happening to me was that there was a kind of a peacefulness associated with whatever caregiving, compassion, kindness, goodwill, whatever way I was involved in. There was a peacefulness in it where there was no very little inclination to give into clinging to anything or reacting to anything or being caught in anything or to define myself with it or try to prove myself. Like when I was a new teacher, I felt like when people came to see me, this is like 30 years ago, right? So like I meet with people one on one, I thought I had to give them something. I can't just have them show up and not, you know, have done something useful for them and you have to show something for myself as a teacher. So that's a little bit crazy to have that attitude. But I think it's natural enough maybe in the beginning of a new job like that. And there's this peacefulness settled in and, you know, I certainly wanted to support people and meet them and respond to them best I could. But that extra attachment and need to do something started to go away and it was peacefulness to it all. And I thought this was kind of interesting. Sometimes I felt like it was a little bit people didn't like it because people are some people are really aroused around all kinds of issues of justice and politics and all kinds of, you know, even even sometimes one on one suffering, someone suffering. And, you know, they want you to worry for them. Sometimes you do kind of be alarmed or, you know, that's kind of the language of how we know we care for each other for, you know, angry or something or upset or something. And so sometimes I could feel the tension of being in these situations where a certain expectation of how I was supposed to be didn't match this peacefulness I had. And some people might thought I was aloof or I was worried I'd be seen that way. But in fact, I wasn't I mean, I was certainly given my life over to try to support people in all kinds of ways and do things. And that's what my life is about. And so it was kind of an interesting discovery this peacefulness or non attachment as a reference point for it all. And then the challenge of and sometimes the inner debates, inner lawyers would come up and even tell me, you know, Gil, you're supposed to be a little bit more, you know, upset here or a little bit more attached or something. And so I had to navigate that and wonder about that. And so I still felt, you know, I wanted to care for people and all that. And then I started I was started at some point studying the Pali Canon, this teachings of the Buddha much more. And in some ways, my real deeper study of this early teaching started about 12, 13 years ago. I'm really kind of spending a lot of time in it. And and then a few years ago, I was interested in what the Buddha had to say about compassion. Partly was so important for me. And and I knew that the word for compassion is Karuna. Many people know the word Karuna, K-A-R-U-N-A. And it turns out he's the Buddha in these early texts have very little to say about it. In fact, the only thing he says about it has to do with how you how some about how it's related to meditation practice, how in meditation, you would have boundless Karuna. He doesn't even define what it is. So we don't even know for sure that it's supposed to be translated into English as compassion, because if what we're doing, building on is the evidence from the ancient teachings. So maybe compassion is fine to translate as a translation. But but the fact that I was so surprised to see. And but it's not so obvious because some of the translators translate another word as compassion. So when I read that in the old days, I used to think, oh, that's Karuna. That's Karuna. But it turns out that it's a Karuna is not the word or the concept that involves everyday caregiving. And the word for that is Anu Kampa. So A-A-N-U-K-A-M-P-A. Anu Kampa. And in all the circumstances where the Buddha is offering some kind of care to someone else, it's using this word Anu Kampa, care. And that translated as care. As I said, some people translate as compassion. And occasionally you see it translated as sympathy. But if the Buddha taught, he spent, you know, 40, 45 years teaching out of Anu Kampa. So it seems like a very important emotion because it's the kind of basis of why Buddha taught. If someone asked the Buddha to come and teach for them or even come to their house to have a meal, they would ask, can you do it? Please do so out of Anu Kampa for me. And so the reason why this word is something different than compassion is that the way that it's talked about in the suttas, in the ancient language, is it's always in relationship to caring for the welfare and happiness of others. It's never talked about explicitly about suffering. You know, you want people to be alleviated and freed from their suffering. It can include that for sure, but it's not limited to suffering. It's a broad, wide, caregiving kind of emotion feeling. It's also used in the ancient literature for much more ordinary, simple kinds of care that people provide. Child care providers have care for their children. Teachers, you know, outside of Buddhism, you know, have Anu Kampa, this care for their students. Parents have care for their children. And so, you know, so what is it? Now, it was yesterday, I think. I talked to a friend of mine who has stage four cancer and then starting treatments now. And so I asked him, I spent a lot of time at hospitals and stuff, and I asked him, what would you prefer that all these people who are caring for you, the nurses, the doctors and all that, that they have compassion for you or they have care for you? And he said right away, oh, I'd prefer they have care. So exactly why, I didn't ask him why, but there's something very different with compassion, which is, you know, I based my life on. So I don't want to dismiss, disrespect or diminish its value. But it's a particular kind of caregiving. And I'm thinking about this as I was studying this word Anu Kampa. I realized that if a friend of mine went along, we'd have spent the day together hanging out. And every moment that we were together, every conversation, they were expressing their compassion for me. Like I would start kind of stepping further and further away, like, you know, give me a break. But if they were constantly, if there was a continual feeling, oh, this person cares for me. There's care. I wouldn't feel troubled by it. I wouldn't feel like it's getting too much or a burden. It's a very different feeling to care than to compassion. And so to overemphasize compassion as the primary way to be with people, maybe misses something. And so this care that involves care for people's welfare and happiness. So you can then, you can have that kind of care for someone who's not suffering. You know, someone who's suffering, like the Buddha, met people or practitioners who were not suffering. They were deep in meditation. They were filled with joy and happiness. And he would then care for them by offering them further teachings. They go further into a greater kind of happiness than what they're already feeling. And so I like this word care so much as a translation for Anakampa because it's kind of a humble word. And it also has a double meaning in English that it's to care for something is to value it. And so to offer value, have value for the people you're with or to appreciate them and to care. And then to care also means to offer like there's medical care, we say, or spiritual care or child care or elder care. It's a very common word. And also my friend who was in the hospital, he said, oh, I prefer to have care, right? To compassion. And he said, these nurses who are taking care of me, they're just like inspiring by how much care they have. They care for everyone. You watch them and there's so much care of what they're doing. But I don't think they have. I don't think they're having compassion for all of us, but they're just going around their job and doing fantastic job caring for people. So I think it's possible to care for people who you don't love. It's possible to care for people because love and compassion are kind of high, kind of a high bar sometimes. And so this care thing is a lower bar. You can do it for someone who, you know, it's just a basic, ordinary human activity to care. If you allow yourself to be basic, ordinary human being without preoccupations, attachments and being caught up. And then finally, in the suttas, the motivation for anakampa. They don't talk much about what motivates it, what's the rationale you would have it. It's conscious assume that people have it. When people were, when some of the Buddhist disciples were fully enlightened, he told them to go forth out into the world for the welfare and benefit for others out of anakampa, out of care for the world. So that was a motivating force. But he just told them to do that or expected it. It's just kind of assumed. But there's a few places in the suttas where this word for care is closely connected to the human capacity to respect, to honor, to esteem, or to venerate other people or to benefit each other. This idea of respect and veneration is a kind of strong word. But some people in the West talk about appreciating the sacredness of other people. Inherent, they say sacredness. Or some people used to in the West of divinity, divine in everyone. But this anakampa coming not from suffering. It's not quite friendliness, but it comes from a kind of place of deep respect, veneration. So there's something very, very honor worthy of each person we meet to have honor and respect and care. And you can do that for people you don't like. There are people who are challenging, who behave in ways that are maybe even distasteful or something. And so that's not to say that that's not, you know, that was distasteful what the person did. But even so, there can be this basic care can still exist. So go back to my story. When I started reading about this anakampa, then I recognized that this is the good. I think this concept, at least how I'm understanding it, that speaks to this more recent change I've had, this peacefulness around caregiving. I think that what I'm finding, what I'm living from now is this very simple care that is, for me, is defined by non-attachment, by non-clinging. It's just a simple, ordinary thing. And it can morph into compassion, it can morph into friendliness, all these things. But it has a simplicity to it, an ordinariness to it, and sweetness to it that just seems like that's what has evolved. And now if I look back to kindness, you know, loving kindness or something, that seems like a more activated state. And nothing wrong to be a little bit activated. So if compassion is more activated than kindness, then kindness is more activated than anakampa, than care. And to be able to go about life without always being activated by something, or having to evoke or to make something happen. You know, if the requirement is to always be kind, you kind of have to kind of gear yourself up a little bit sometimes. And then if the requirement is to be compassionate, you also have to kind of go, how do I do that now? And what do I have to do? I'm supposed to be compassionate. Maybe. But for me, please listen to me a little bit. This is a personal story, so I'm not going to say that it should be your way. But anyway, finding this peace, this non-attachment in relation to caregiving, and finding it kind of resonating with this word anakampa, with care, has been really kind of inspiring for me, and feeling, yeah, this is good. It's kind of like, you know, if the lawyers in my mind were arguing about it, is it okay to care for people without being attached? It's like I got the star witness, the expert witness, to come understand, and, you know, made the case that it's okay, yes. So anakampa, just so there's movement towards that to care. So that was my story, and I told the story for the purpose of hopefully inspiring you to think of your story. And maybe you can even find someone you tell it to. Maybe even the telling of it is your discovery process. So you maybe find a good friend who you're willing to kind of stumble along. So what's been your relationship to care? Did you have no examples of it growing up, and no one cared for you? And what happens to some people? It's like the primary background for some people is the absence of it, or worse. And then has anything ever shifted and opened and changed, and what were the influences on you, the impacts on you, as you went through your life? And, you know, what have you learned over your lifetime about your care, your kindness, your friendliness? Or where have you received it? How have you been nourished by it from others, or influenced by others by it? What is your story? And whatever your story is, let's respect it. Let's honor it. Let's venerate it as your story. And see it as a stepping stone for further growth. The more clarity you have about it, then maybe you're ready to kind of find something more, or let it grow, or evolve in new ways that maybe wouldn't have evolved if you hadn't really kind of seen it clearly what it is. So, those are my thoughts for today. And we have a couple of minutes. If any of you would like to ask a question or a comment, you're welcome to do so. Another question here is, peacefulness similar to equanimity from the YouTube. It overlaps a little bit. I think of them as different. I think of peacefulness as less complicated than equanimity. I was thinking about empathy as a way of, it's not quite as intense as compassion, and it's a way of feeling into a person, another person's state. And that that might be closer to caring for someone. Yeah, if you could well be. There's another word that's sometimes translated as sympathy, and the poli-suite does, that often goes together with care. They're a pair. So empathy and care maybe are closely related. Maybe one more. So I think something that I've been struggling with particularly in the events of the last two years or so is exercising compassion for people where the root of their suffering is something that I fundamentally disagree with. Like that their suffering is due to not being able to engage in their own selfishness, for example. And it's to a point that, especially with so much like polarization and discourse around that, that it's extremely fatiguing for me too. And I feel that the answer to it seems to be having compassion for those people instead of responding with more anger, but I'm not sure how to go about that. Well, I think it's completely reasonable to not have compassion for some of the reasons people suffer, but the reasons they suffer, under that there is some kind of suffering. And that is what underlies it that maybe you can connect to. Like so, for example, if I'm really upset and sad and I'm here crying and I've had a really difficult day today, and you go, Gil, what's wrong? What's happened? Well, I just didn't win the California lottery today. So probably you just shrugged your shoulders then, it's like, what's going on here? That wouldn't elicit a lot of compassion. But if you listen to me more deeply, you might say, you know, why is Gil interested in the California lottery? And maybe he's really kind of insecure or something. And I can maybe feel for his insecurity. Is this an idea relevant for you? Yeah, I do think so. Yeah. So kind of listen deeper than the surface. So my friends, thank you for being here. And for those of you online, that Helen and Peter are the hosts for the discussion group that happens after the Dharma talk. So if you go on IMC's website, and I don't know if they're going to put it posted there on the chat, but on the IMC website, it's under what's new or it's on the calendar too. It's on the calendar. You can see the Zoom link and to discuss a little bit the talk and just hang out a little bit in community. And so thank you all very much.
