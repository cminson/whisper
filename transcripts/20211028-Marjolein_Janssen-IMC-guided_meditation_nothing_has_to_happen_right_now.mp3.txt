 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.adiodarma.org. Start settling in, as far as you haven't yet. Send to the posture that is comfortable and still alert. And as you can see, you can close your eyes. That's comfortable for you. We'll start with a little bit of relaxation. I'll guide you through the body. You can pay some very gentle kind attention to each body part. And just this kind gentle attention can help relax just attention in itself. And start with the feet. Just very gently and kindly be aware of the feet. It's very simple awareness of what is there right now. How do they feel? Up to the calves and shins. Knees. The upper legs. Simple awareness. Lower half of the torso. The shoulders. Arms and hands. Neck and throat. Back of the hand. Top of the head. And then the whole head. Jaw. We can become aware of the whole body. Maybe it feels a little bit different now. Is there this short body scan? Maybe not. That's also okay. Be aware, sitting, knowing that you're sitting. When you're ready, you can open to also mental experiences. Maybe there are many thoughts. Maybe it's relatively calm. Maybe there's emotion. Maybe simply aware of what is present. Maybe there's emotion. For just a moment, you can realize that now that you're meditating, nothing else has to happen. It's just this moment of meditation. It's just this moment. Nothing else needs to happen right now. Other than just sitting here and just being. Let go of all other things and just be here in this present moment. I'm just here right now for you. You don't have to make anything happen. Nothing has to go away. There's just simply this moment. Moment of experience. A fleeting moment of experience, constantly changing into something else. I want to be more careful about the lifeS you you you you you you you you you you you you you you mindfulness is back, that we're aware, when we're in the present moment again. And there's no need to be hard on ourselves, that we've just been in thoughts, been away in thoughts. You can simply appreciate the moments that we come back. It's another opportunity to be aware, and to grow our muscle of awareness or mindfulness. We all get lost in thought at times. It's very natural for the mind to get lost. So we can be kind to ourselves if that happens. You can take a moment to share the merit of meditating together. When we're meditating like this, we're on our own or in a group like this. Also in beneficial areas. We're not just in the present moment, but we're also in the present moment. And we're also in the present moment. And we're also in the present moment. Also in beneficial energies arise, even if we had a hard time during the meditation, and if we don't feel very wholesome at the moment, still our intention to be here and meditate, practice the Dharma is very wholesome. The beneficial energies from this wholesomeness we can share with all beings everywhere. We can do that by expressing our intention. May these beneficial energies contribute to the welfare and happiness of all beings. May all beings be free from suffering. May all beings be free from suffering.
