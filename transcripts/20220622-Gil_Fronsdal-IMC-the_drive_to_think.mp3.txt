The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
To say a few words about mindfulness practice, as we sit down to be mindful,
one of the things that we often notice is how difficult it is to stay
mindful. Mind wanders off in thought and fantasy and things. And so a common
instruction is just to bring the mind back. Start over again, over again, over
over. It's also common that if there's a lot of thinking, we do mindfulness of
thinking. We get to know the thinking better. And sometimes only by really
turning towards the thinking and knowing something about it, can it be put to
rest? And then you let it be in the background and you can stay focused on
the present with your breathing or your body or the steps as you do walking
meditation. And one of the things to study or to learn about thinking,
I'll make it before I say this, some people think that it's possible to
turn off the mind, thinking mind and just sit without any thoughts at all. It is
possible to some degree. Thoughts can get so so quiet and thin and almost like
they don't think at all or sometimes it seems like there's no thoughts at all.
But that's not the point of mindfulness. The point of mindfulness is to be awake
to the fact that whatever is going on, to be to notice, so we be mindful of
thinking. But there is, so you can't, you know, you can't it's not so easy to just
turn off thoughts. However, there is something maybe you can turn off that
helps you to be mindful. And that's what I'll try to explain. There's thinking and
then there's the way that we involve ourselves in the thinking. So we might
be very interested in our thoughts. Thoughts are one thing but the interest
is something else. And it's the interest, if it's very strong, is what keeps us
connected to thinking involved. Keep going back or so it's so fascinating to be
involved in those thoughts. It might be that we give the thoughts a lot of
authority. They, they're super important and whatever we think has to be listened
to, has to be engaged in, has to be thought because they have so much
authority, so much credence. It could be that we just delight in thoughts. We
enjoy them so much. And so we just, like we, like, you know, we just, it's the
enjoyment that leans into them. It's like savoring them. It could be that we're
afraid. And so being afraid, we have to take care of ourselves and protect
ourselves. And one of the ways to do that for meditating is to think out all
the scenarios that are dangerous, that are challenging and or have been
challenging. Review of them, think about them. And it seems like I have to do that
because I have to make myself safe. And, and so the way that we feel compelled to
think, even curiosity in thinking, is enough to keep us connected to it. So
there's thinking and then how we involve ourselves in thinking. And that's one
of the things you can study. You can look for it when you're doing mindfulness
practice. And if you discover how you're involved, your contribution, that's not
just the thoughts, but the way you involve yourself in it, that you might be
able to shift. Even if you can't stop thinking, you can shift the way you
involve yourself in it. And in doing so, you might have a lot more choice and
effectiveness in turning your attention to your breathing, for example, to what's
happening in the present moment. Because that very involvement, energy and the
effort that's going to be involved with thinking is a precious resource. Boy,
that's really a valuable part of who you are, that you can engage your
attention in that way. And if you recognize what it is, then you can switch
that and use that precious resource for being here with the breathing. So that
you can do. The thinking might still continue in the background, but you
should let it do its thing in the background. If you're foreground, you
can just stay here. So what I'm saying here today is not necessarily easy to
discover, but boy, is it useful to discover. So from time to time, you
might get interested in how are you involved? How are you engaged with your
thinking? What kind of authority do you give them? What kind of interest,
fascination, apprehension? What keeps you engaged there? So thank you and I hope
you enjoy your morning.
