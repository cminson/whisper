 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Good evening. Good evening. Welcome, welcome. Wherever you might be, I hope that you're doing well. We'll do a little bit of a guided meditation here. Just settling in to this moment, to this experience and feeling what it feels like to be here now. How does it feel in the body? Just in a global sense? How does it feel in the mind? Just in a general way. Is the mind busy? Is the mind feeling sluggish? Maybe there's a brightness, a sharpness. However I might be, with the body, with the mind, can we welcome our experience without pushing any of it away, without quietly demanding that it be different, but instead tuning in to aligning with the experience right now. Maybe tuning in to the experience of breathing. Feeling the body breathe. Feeling the stretching expanding. And they're contracting, non-stretching. Just an easy natural rhythm. Resting our attention on these sensations of breathing. It wouldn't be unusual, wouldn't be surprising. If we find that the mind has some momentum and momentum with thinking, and we find ourselves perhaps lost in thought, a little bit disconnected from our breathing, we don't have to make that a problem. We just, oh, here I am meditating. Very simply, gently begin again with the sensations of breathing. Switching away from immediately moving. By resting our attention on the sensations of breathing, we start to notice how much the mind wants to be making stories or planning, remembering, fantasizing.

Maybe that arise when we first become aware that we've been lost in thought. Is there a little voice like, oh shoot. Or maybe, oh, that's right, I'm supposed to meditate. We can notice those thoughts too. Otherwise we just are hanging out with the sensations of breathing. It can be helpful to set the intention to be with the entirety of an in-breath. And the entirety of an out-breath. Beginning, middle, and end. Oh it just kind of plays out. The entirety of the in-breaths and out-breaths and the transitions between the types of breaths. All the voices, however, haveinternational relate in silence, and, as illustrated beneath the title, are Reyes and Seldby. Their Must-Semitism instances can be Gray. Their Grindings can Fra cumbersome,Certain, samples and images. We might notice there are little subtle thoughts. While the intention is on the breath, maybe a fleeting thought, oh, I feel this more in my chest. I used to feel this more in the abdomen or maybe there's a little fleeting thought in between the in-breath and the out-breath during that transition. We don't have to make it a problem, we're just noticing.
