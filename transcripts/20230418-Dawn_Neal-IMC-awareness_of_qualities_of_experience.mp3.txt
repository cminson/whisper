Take a moment to just notice wherever you are, whatever posture you're in.
What's present for you?
How is your body? How's your mind?
Remove your heart today.
And taking a few moments to soften and relax your body.
Perhaps starting today at the feet.
The contact of the feet on the ground or mat or cushion or chair.
Noticing the weight and solidity of that contact.
Then moving upwards to the calves and ankles and softening the muscles.
The lower legs and the feet.
Moving to the upper legs and buttocks.
Noticing any weight, gravity, pressure, solidity there.
And softening, relaxing.
Moving up into the lower belly of the abdomen.
Perhaps noticing the movement of breath, air, in and out, rising and falling.
Knowing the attention to rest in the moment.
And allowing awareness to fill the whole torso, body, the central body.
Noticing perhaps the openness of the space between the ribs as they flex as the breath comes in.
Soften together as the breath goes out.
Noticing too any tension or relaxation.
Contraction or expansion in the rest of the back, sides, core.
Allowing awareness to continue to fill the body, the shoulders and arms and hands.
Noticing any warmth or cool.
Contact, hands and legs, or each other, or some other circuit.
Inviting.
Allowing.
Whatever is there to be there while inviting softening.
And including the whole body.
While flowing the awareness into the neck.
Inside the mouth, softening the tongue, softening the eyes.
Perhaps noticing any wetness in the mouth.
Wetness or dryness in the eyes.
Allowing.
Relaxing the muscles of the face and forehead.
Cheeks and jaw.
Scalp and ears.
Allowing awareness to fill the entire body.
Even noticing the contact of the body with air, cloth.
Depreciating the space around us.
And settling in.
Opening the field of awareness.
And if necessary or helpful, using whatever anchor of attention.
Works for you. Awareness itself, breath, body and sound.
From time to time.
Dropping in the question.
Where?
At this.
At this.
At this.
At this.
At this.
At this.
At this.
At this.
At this.
At this.
At this.
At this.
At this.

Thank you all for the sincerity of your practice.
So as has become the tradition, my teacher, the invitation is, if you're comfortable,
to put your video on, to do so, and if not, to sign, but to take a moment in silence and
send a pulse of meta, goodwill, friendly means toward your fellow practitioners, the ones
here in the Zoom room and perhaps the ones that couldn't make it might be listening later.
Knowing as you're sending these wishes, you're receiving them.
Thank you.
