 So this is one way of looking at it, I think the eighth week of our introductory course. I think this is the third meeting after the end of the five-week course. And what I want to do this evening is to try to describe the more traditional Buddhist context for the mindfulness practice that we do. Kind of like the core Buddhist teachings that mindfulness practice is kind of traditionally held within. And I think maybe to begin it's illustrative or to begin with a simile that the Buddha used. He was walking in the forest one day with his students and he picked up a handful of leaves from the forest floor. And he asked his students, what is more, the amount of leaves in my hand or the number of leaves in the forest on all the trees? And so his students kind of, well you know, there's a lot more on the forest in all the trees. And the Buddha said in the same way, the amount of teachings that I teach you compared to what I know is comparative to the amount of leaves in my hand versus all the leaves in the forest. So what he taught, he's actually a very small portion of what he could teach, all the things he knew. And I think this is important to realize that you don't have to know a lot. You don't have to be tremendously wise in all the different teachings of Buddhism or all the different forms of spirituality or all the metaphysics of the world or whatever in order to pursue or study Buddhist practice. And what you need to do to pursue Buddhist practice, what you need to know is actually very little. It's comparatively. The Buddha said once, or maybe several times he said, I teach one thing and one thing only, suffering and the end of suffering. And this is one of the simplest definitions of what Buddhism is about, this little handful of what it's all about, is about this very simple thing, moving from a state of suffering or tension or stress or discomfort or discontent or all the different versions we can call suffering and moving to a place of happiness, of freedom from suffering, a place that we're available with an open heart to the world in a compassionate to receptive way. And in a sense, our tradition is kind of poverty-stricken because it doesn't have, you know, it just has this handful of stuff. It doesn't have all of, you know, the forest, which some people would get dazzled and lost in the forest trying to read all the leaves and all the trees. And our tradition is actually very narrow and very simple. And so the focus is to understand suffering and how to become liberated from suffering, how to become free of it and how to become happy. In a sense, you might say that from this perspective, Buddhism is a form of therapy. And so, you know, it has a lot in common with modern forms of psychotherapy. Now, a lot of Buddhists feel very uncomfortable by that comparison. They want to, you know, Buddhism is a religion. It's not a form of therapy. And to call it a form of therapy is to limit it. And the boundaries between therapy and a spiritual practice are kind of getting more diffuse as time goes along here, depending on the school of therapy and school of spirituality. But certainly, Buddhist practice has a lot more to do with just learning how to cope better in yourself and how to have a stronger sense of self. Buddhist spirituality, Buddhist therapy has a lot to do with understanding that the very notion of a self, the very notion of a self-identity itself can be a seed of tremendous suffering. And so it isn't just simply a matter of kind of arranging the furniture on the Titanic, you know, getting a better, you know, sense of self, which therapy can often do. And it's not an important thing to do for a lot of people. But in a sense, from a Buddhist point of view, it's important to arrange the furniture on the Titanic. But you have to remember that it's, you're still on the Titanic. And so what Buddhism offers is, in a sense, is to offer you kind of a different boat, a whole different boat that's actually not going to sink. And that boat is not a boat at all, but is the mind which doesn't have within it the tendency to create suffering. So it's very simple, you know, and maybe it's too simple. It sounds like maybe it's not so spiritual. And people get dazzled by the great spiritual descriptions of great angelic states and great states of rapture and great experiences of white light or great states of wonderful purity or great psychic abilities, you know, great, you know, all kinds of great things that you can get sidetracked by. Buddhism, again, it keeps it much simpler. And in a sense, it's more radical and maybe even more difficult. It's considered to be more difficult to become free of suffering totally than it is to develop psychic powers. So you can choose, you know, if you want to do something easier, you can develop psychic powers. Now, I guess I'm saying that. I guess you can get discouraged. And that wasn't my intention. You know, you just talk impromptu, you don't know what comes out. So a lot of the Buddhist teachings are from different vantage points kind of pointing back or pointing at the importance of this very moment, of our practice and our awareness and wakefulness in this very moment and the choices we make in this very moment. And in a summary, the suffering that we have occurs in the present moment by conditions or causes that are also happening in the present moment. And that there's certainly momentum to past suffering and past conditions that hurt us in the present. But as you really study the mind at the detailed level, you know, we find subtle levels of the mind, we begin realizing that it's in the present moment that the dynamics of suffering get recreated over and over and over again. And so what Buddhist practice tries to do is to develop the kind of mindfulness, strength of mindfulness that really can begin penetrating understanding the subtle movements of the mind and the heart in the present moment, that in the present moment is creating a suffering. Buddhism offers something very, very radical. It offers the same kind of healing that can happen through some forms of psychoanalysis where you go back and review the past. It can heal the same kind of things by a very deep penetrating understanding of the dynamics that are occurring in the present moment around the same suffering, in the sense that we recreate the same thing over and over again in the present moment. And by understanding what we do in the present moment, there is an opportunity to become free from that particular suffering. So the famous Indian teaching of karma, for example, is popularly in India and also popular in the West. It's taken to mean that what you do in the past will come back to you in the future. It's your karma, means that it's your kind of your inheriting the results of your past actions. And there can be kind of deterministic notion around the notion of karma. You did certain things in the past, therefore this will happen in the present, this will happen in the future. The Buddha actually shied very strongly away from deterministic understandings of karma. He said, if karma is deterministic, where the action will always result in a particular result, then there's no space, no room for spiritual life. There's no room for movement towards freedom, if everything's predetermined by what you did in the past. So the Buddha reinterpreted karma, or the word karma, and defined karma as intention in the present moment. Your intention in the present moment is your karma. What choice you make in the present moment sets in motion what's going to happen in the next moment, what's going to happen tomorrow, what's going to happen next year in the way that karmic patterns develop and unfold. So by redefining it as intention in the present moment, it was another way the Buddha was saying, really the key to your life is in the present moment. And this is where we need to wake up. Another vantage point that he wanted to kind of say the same thing, and this is really the subject for today's talk, is the Four Noble Truths. And this is in some sense the key and core Buddhist teaching. If you want to know what is the Buddhist teaching, if you wanted the core of it, and that almost all Buddhist traditions will agree with, it's what's called the Four Noble Truths. And truths in this sense is not philosophical truths, it's not like this great metaphysical truth. If you understand these truths, you understand the truths of the universe in a sense. I see it more as being therapeutically true or pragmatically true, maybe therapeutically true, these truths. They're very important because Buddhism is interested in suffering and freedom from suffering. And these are the kind of very important understandings or framework to understand our life that really can help us see the possibility of becoming free of suffering. So the first, the Noble Truths, and part of the beauty I think of the Buddha putting the Four Noble Truths in the center of his spiritual teachings, is he offers a spiritual practice without any offering of metaphysical beliefs. The Four Noble Truths exist independent of whether there is or isn't a God, independent of whether there is or isn't rebirth, independent of whether there is or isn't some kind of ultimate spiritual destination in the future or in some kind of transcendental realm. The Four Noble Truths is really independent of any kind of metaphysical claim that he said, well, how can I really know? Or maybe we take it just we believe it on faith, but it's just faith, we can't really know for ourselves. So it's beautiful that this core spirit, I haven't said them yet. You have to be patient. So these four are very, I think, very significant and offer, it's very remarkable that he would offer a spiritual kind of core teaching in this kind of way. So the Four Noble Truths, the first is that in this world that we live in, suffering does occur. It didn't say that everything is suffering. Suffering occurs in this world. And some people will argue that, that that's really true or not. But most people I think it's pretty obvious that without some kind of metaphysical kind of play of mirrors, there's a tremendous amount of suffering in this world. I mean, it's astounding how much suffering is. It's just part of the vision that gets born as a person deepens their mindfulness practice and becomes more awakened. Is a more powerful understanding of the degree to which this world is a sea of suffering. Tremendous amount. I mean, we see, we read the papers, there's a lot of suffering. But as we begin understanding our own mind and the amount of suffering, the amount of tension and clinging and fear and hatred that exists in our own mind, we realize that most other people's minds are exactly the same. Wow, there is a tremendous amount of suffering at this subtle psychological level. And these, there's a five billion people we have now in this world, all of them suffering, the same kind of subtle ways all the time. It's phenomenal. It's bad enough just to read the paper and realize how terrible it is. So this is not supposed to be a bummer of a teaching. What it's meant to be is a realistic statement. And some people find it oppressive to hear this, run away. And some people find it to be very liberating, very inspiring to come to a religious tradition, to hear kind of teaching that really acknowledges, yeah, there is a lot of suffering, there's a lot of pain in this world. And, you know, I don't have to pretty it up. I don't have to try to have some kind of metaphysical belief that kind of denies it or have some kind of strange metaphysical belief that offers some hope in the future that kind of softens the suffering right now. But yeah, let's just confront it. Let's just call it what it is. There's a lot of suffering here. And wow, and I've heard people come to me and say, you know, I come to hear a Buddhist teacher and for the first time I feel, yeah, someone understand, everybody else is in denial. And here, you know, how many of you watch the addiction program, Film Lawyers? I didn't watch it. But did he give any numbers for how many people in America suffer from addiction? You'd think so in three hours. Is that all? One in ten, you know. So an addiction often arise because people are often, not always, people, there's something, they're uncomfortable at some level of discomfort. They're uncomfortable at some level of suffering in their present life. And addiction is sometimes an attempt to escape that discomfort, to get away from it, to avoid it. So this thing really to be really realistic about our suffering and suffering in the world is considered Buddhism to be a truth. It's considered Buddhism to be kind of a sacred thing actually. It's a sacred kind of thing to realize that we're suffering. You can say, well, that's a drag to suffer. But from a Buddhist point of view, there's something sacred, something special, there's something respectful, worthy about not the suffering itself, but the recognizing, ah, this is suffering. So Buddhists will try very hard never to turn away from suffering wherever they see it, whether they see it in their selves or see it in the world around them. A Buddhist, as a Buddhist, is someone who actually has a commitment not to turn away from suffering, but to really meet suffering honestly and see this is what's going on in the present moment, not to deny it, to pull away from it, not to pre-deed over or whatever we might do. Just, oh, this is what's happening, there's suffering. So the first noble truth is this kind of neutral statement in a sense that there is suffering, suffering occurs in this world. The second noble truth is a discussion of what the cause of this, that there's a cause to this suffering. And the cause of suffering is defined by this one word, which is in Pali, which is tanna, T-A-N-H-A, which is translated literally into English as thirst. When you're thirsty, you have tanna, you have thirst. And sometimes it's translated into English as desire, but that problem advertises all desire. Desire itself doesn't cause suffering, but it's anxious desire which causes suffering. When there's clinging or anxiety or fear or desperation or holding on tight to the desire, demanding the desire get fulfilled. There's all these ways in which we get involved in desire, which is more than just a desire. We can just let the desire be there or we can kind of get anxious behind it. And it's driven by it or something, driven desire, maybe it's a good definition of tanna. It's driven desire, which the Buddha in the fourth noble truth claims is a cause of suffering. And this is where in my understanding, it gets a little bit subtle. How I understand it is, it's a little bit like this, the kind of suffering that the Buddha is talking about in the first noble truth is a kind of suffering that's born from driven desire. And therefore you can say, well, the cause of it is driven desire. It kind of loops around in itself. It's called sometimes in logic, a tautology, I think. But the distinction the Buddha wants to make is a distinction between, what maybe I can call it, between pain and suffering. There is also pain in the world and their suffering. And this is a different way of using the words than probably most of you use it. So you have to kind of allow for a shift in definitions to understand this. Pain is what happens when we're alive. There is physical pain, there's pain that happens in life. If you stub your toe, there's physical pain. That's pain. If you stub your toe and call yourself a klutz, you've added suffering to that pain. If someone dies and you feel grief, that's pain. If you feel grief and then you feel embarrassed because you're grieving, you've added suffering to it. Suffering is the addition of something extra on top of our experience of being alive, which causes a contraction or a tightness or pain. But it is not there in and of itself, in the experience itself. It arises because we've entered into the experience with a relationship that in its kind of simplistic definition is called tannas, called thirst. But that involves things such as desire has all kinds of forms and shapes. It means clinging for something, it means having tremendous aversion for something, pulling away tightly and contracting, it means pushing at something and striking at it. There's all kinds of ways in which this drivenness takes place. Yesterday I had to do a lot of different things including getting to the hospital. My sister's in the hospital and so I was kind of literally being driven all over the Bay Area by my car and my concerns. It was 5.30 in the evening and I had to find out which hospital she was in. She'd been moved from hospitals. So I stopped at a gas station in San Rafael, Blarsburg Landing kind of, and called my wife to find out if she knew which hospital she'd been moved to. She didn't know. So I go have dinner and after I have dinner I'll call you back and maybe with any of you they've called you and told you where she is. So great. So I was parked there next to the payphone at the gas station. It happened to be just next to where I parked was the air pump. I don't know why I have lots of time now and I never checked the air in my tires so why don't I just check them now. So after all I just bought some gas at the gas station so I felt some right to go and help myself with the air. So I went and started pumping up air and my front tire, part of the edges of it completely balled down to the metal kind of wires that are kind of supported and they were beginning to fray and actually cut my fingers because I put my hand over, my thumb over the, and I don't know if I got none back on the freeway probably the tire would have torn apart because it was really down to very little. So that's just life. That's just stuff. You know it slows you down maybe you know but there's no suffering inherent in that. It's just, oh look at that tire. It's kind of balled. What was interesting to me is what I did in the reaction to that. And I did two very interesting movements. They kind of happened a little bit different times but the juxtaposition of them was very insightful for me. My first, one of the first reactions was interpretation was, oh my god one more thing the whole universe is coming down on me it's just left and right my computer is breaking and my flat tire and this and that and oh and now I'm not going to get to the hospital and I just do not know it's 530 and how in the world can I get to find a place that's open now and you know I have to get four new tires and I forgot to go to a gas station to cost me a fortune and one more thing you know I'm so oppressive life's oppressive and you know something like that and you know probably you kind of have some sense of what I mean you could resonate for something it's once upon a time maybe you felt something like this and maybe and you know and so there was some suffering involved in all this interpretation of things and then a little bit later I realized wow this was a pretty great that I discovered this. Imagine if I hadn't discovered this I could have you know you know it could have exploded on the Golden Gate Bridge and I could have been the bottom of the canal by now you know the tire would have exploded the car would have popped over the railing you know and there's something interesting right this is really great it was really great that I had to I had to make his phone call I just happened to be right next to this gas air pump and I happened to check and wow this really saved me a lot of grief and wow this is a really great thing and I felt kind of happy. Both of them were interpretations of the event both of them were gratuitous the event didn't require any of those interpretations you know you're still it's a black tire and I mean a bald tire and sensible thing to do now is to get some other tires and let's get to work and find them but one of the one interpretation made me kind of very painful and suffering and the other interpretation kind of brought some kind of joy but they're both interpretations actually not having either interpretation just kind of taking care of things was actually kind of a deeper level of satisfaction than the kind of joy of relief but the suffering arose because I contracted around a whole series of interpretations that I kind of and and resistance to interpretations and motivations I had about getting somewhere and getting something done and I had all these desires that I was driven by and having to stop and take care of this tire thing was interfering with my drivenness my agenda the suffering was arising because of this this what I was doing driven by this and the world did not require me to be driven by anything but I had added this to the situation and that was suffering and the cause of that suffering was that kind of drivenness so when Buddhism talks about the four noble truths the suffering four noble truths they're talking about that kind of suffering that we add to the situation where the situation itself doesn't require that level of suffering in and of itself there it doesn't mean that then we go if we become free of all suffering which Buddhism is kind of a promise for it doesn't mean all pain which is the bad news you know we want to have a religious tradition that's you know we live happily ever after what Buddhism offers which I think is a very radical thing and also very realistic it offers us a practice to become mindful of the cause of suffering in the present moment the clinging and the contraction and the hate in the present moment that is causing our suffering in the present moment and understanding that and being honest about and penetrating that then leads to what is the good news in Buddhism which is a third noble truth which is that there's a cessation of suffering there's the end of suffering it's possible to end this kind of suffering you don't have to be stuck with this kind of suffering forever you don't have to be live in the mire of this kind of suffering that it's possible to become free of it now this is a nice thing to this is nice to know that but to be inspired by that possibility is a whole different thing to be inspired that this is something that's really worthwhile for human being to move in the direction of becoming free of all the gross and subtle ways and mostly it's a lot of subtle ways in which we add a kind of drivenness to the situation that causes us suffering or causes of stress or causes of strain or causes us tension and it's for many of us it's a small movements of clinging that add that accumulatively through the day to create kind of a lot of suffering and strain for us but to be inspired that there's a possibility of being free of that and feeling this is really a useful thing and worthwhile thing to want to want to do is part of the function i think of the four noble truths it really is to have that kind of motivation inspiration to feel the possibility of that and often see most most people i think are often motivated or oriented towards some version of the drivenness and some of the drivenness looks really good it actually looks kind of maybe healthy it looks you know like and so we said well well yes i want to be free of suffering but what i really want to do is have a lot of money what i really want to do is own my own house what i really want to do is be in a relationship yes it's good to be free of suffering but what we really want to do is you know you know it cling another way exactly what i really want to do is cling another way that's really worthwhile and then well well buddhism says you know you don't have to cling but wait a minute and then we feel the then we notice i'm really insecure and part of the reason we're clinging in another way is we're so afraid of not holding on to something and that itself that holding on that fear is another form of this extra suffering we have and the radicalness of this thorough going cessation of all clinging is we also let go of all holding to security and that offers a different kind of security when you don't need to have insecurity so the possibility of being free of suffering and that's to be happy to be liberated to be buddhism we call it enlightened but maybe that's an english word that's causes problem for many of us in the west because enlightened kind of lends itself to kind of our our our fantasies about what things but the cessation of suffering is not the kind of mild thing it's not this neutral thing it's actually a phenomenal it is a phenomenal experience the more thoroughly we do it the more tremendous is the sense of of joy of well-being of the experience actually cannot be described when it's thoroughly when the causes of this kind of suffering is thoroughly put to rest the kind of joy or the kind of presence that is born or that shines cannot actually be kind of described in words what it really is so it's very hard then to offer it to people you know this is a goal but you know we can't really describe what it is it's just it's freedom of suffering but to be driven by the goal is just another form of clinging so for noble truth if you really understand it is a protection also that your involvement with spirituality doesn't itself involve clinging or fear or longing for something because rather is to look back at the longing and the clinging and the fear and understand it directly so we're always looking out for something else to provide the answer and the four noble truths says the answer lies inside of you and you need to look at yourself in the present moment and not keep looking outside you can do that for other reasons there's other things to do in your life besides finish to get a bit of suffering but but if you what you want to do is to really understand suffering and be free of it you have to really understand these four noble truths so there is suffering the cause of suffering is driven desire there's a possibility of bringing this kind of suffering to an end and the fourth noble truth is what's called the eightfold path and this is more the instructions for the uh for the ways in which we can um free ourselves from suffering it's recognized that it's not easy to become free of suffering it's not easy to let go of this kind of extra clinging that we add to the situation and we have to have tremendous respect and compassion for ourselves in the work that it takes and in the confrontation meeting with ourselves it's not an easy thing to to kind of wake up and to understand all this so the buddha then offered some pragmatic steps some pragmatic useful tools to help us so we can have to create the foundation to help so slowly we can have the greater insight and begin waking up more powerfully and this is called the eighthfold path and um the first of the eighthfold path is a lot to do with understanding the four noble truths understanding the how what they really are and how they really apply to our life and understand how how to be motivated from that understanding because the importance of this is if you don't understand it if you don't understand your own suffering then it's very easy to look for solutions to it outside of the real cause of it so for example you know if you feel really lonely and so you have this tremendous clinging to what give me an example what would you cling to if you were really lonely somebody to love you you really cling to someone to love you so uh so okay so i really want someone to love me so i think i'm gonna go to the psychic and the psychic is going to tell me how to do that and therefore free myself from the suffering that's to look away from the cause itself which is i'm really lonely and the loneliness causes pain and because i'm uncomfortable with my pain i'm reaching out to cling onto something i don't know if that was a good example but uh we we often import other things into try to help ourselves which actually don't really have to do they might give some relief they might give us some hope which is you know provides a kind of relief also uh but they don't really address the real cause so in in in thailand for example in buddhist countries one example like this is uh people will go and get these amulets from buddhist monks and these buddhist monks some of them you know are kind of into making money so they kind of do it but some of them kind of just do it reluctantly they don't really we're not into giving amulets to people but people demanded from them say okay we'll give you some amulets you know but they don't count for much but people want these amulets because they think it has magic power and the magic of the amulet is going to somehow bring them happiness free them of their suffering that's the look in the wrong direction and what buddhism is really about is turning us mere well part of buddhism is turning a mirror back to understand our own suffering so the first of the eighth full path is to really understand the four noble truths second is the eighth full path is to be let our motivation truly rise out of understanding those four noble truths the third is in the third fourth and fifth have to do with living a life an ethical life that provides a kind of good foundation for developing deeper insight into the subtleties of our mind you need to have a very strong foundation and right ethics in being a kind of basically a decent person if you want to let go of all security because if you are not an ethical person you don't have the kind of inner strength to be able to kind of let go and you have to have a kind of inner core strength and being ethical provides that so this involves all ethical things but in the in the in the they involve right speech paying attention to how we speak paying attention to our livelihood how we make our living you know is it really ethical the way we make living it has to do with our actions in the world you know are they really ethical do they follow some basic rules of decency where we don't hurt other people and then there's such things as right engagement you know being engaged putting effort into our spiritual life putting effort into living ethically and putting effort into being mindful and waking up you can't become free of suffering unless you build unless you apply your effort to doing that you know if you just kind of lay back and say what's going to happen someday you know meditation is great i think i'll sit down here meditate and someday it might happen if i just kind of sit here long enough it's not going to get very far there has to be some engagement in the process yeah so this is the the sixth the eighth full path and the seventh is the practice of mindfulness and the eighth is to practice of concentration of real stability in the mindfulness so cultivating these things makes it a lot it gives a kind of strength within us cultivating concentration cultivating mindfulness cultivating energy or engagement cultivating ethics cultivating motivation and cultivating understanding create an important strength of a strong foundation upon which it's a lot easier than to understand our suffering and learn how to let go of that drivenness at the at the roots of where it happens now mindfulness practice exists within this context and the function of mindfulness practice is is not to suffer and the function of mindfulness is not to is not to ferret out all your suffering not to look for it you're not to go out of your way to look for it or create it but rather the function of mindfulness is to learn how to pay attention to present moment so that when suffering arises in this present moment you're there to notice it and then to be interested in it not to run away from it learn how to be comfortable with suffering learn how to be okay with it so you don't lash out at it don't act inappropriately because of your discomfort and then begin penetrating and begin learning the roots of it the causes of letting go of the clinging letting go of the interpretation oh i don't have to interpret that life is falling down around me and this is one more thing the tires and i don't have to interpret this thing so i swear that's extra it's okay i like all of that the training to be in the present moment then also helps us to be present for the joy that exists in life there's a lot of joy in life also a tremendous amount of joy and part of the vision of awakening is not just simply a great understanding of the suffering in the world but also a great understanding of the tremendous level of a layer of joy that's also a possibility in life that's here and so but we have to be in the present moment to really appreciate that joy also so mindfulness is a training to appreciate what arises in the present moment and to really connect to it as it's happening so connect to our suffering and connect to our joy or in all the variations of it i did a the spirit rock teachers well yesterday we had a meeting where we invited a psychologist to come and speak to us about the issues of abuse because uh the feeling was we shouldn't have better understanding about the abuse issue issues and how the dynamics of abuse and the language is that of abuse in the victim you know how it functions and in our society and so that we can do a little bit wiser when meditation students come and you know and maybe dealing with issues of abuse and we need to be sensitive to those themes and and one of the things that struck me was how what he said was that oftentimes people who are both in abusive situation in the victim situation are really stuck in those two modes often not always but often those people so they're stuck in those two roles those two modes of being both of them are probably tremendously uncomfortable or incapable of being present for discomfort psychological discomfort or conflict within themselves and so they deny and shut down their own discomfort and act out in the external world the abuser he said is often someone who feels as tremendous conflict and discomfort within themselves hasn't learned the skills and the techniques to really be present for themselves and kind of deal with it so they can't face themselves and so they blame the world out there and one of the frightening things he said was that they did a study of children who were brought to hospitals from being physically abused or abused and they studied the parent who'd abused them who beat them or something and 90 percent of the time the parent said it was a fault of the child it's phenomenal statistic there's a fault of the child that they did it and and what he understood how he understood it to be is that the parent was so uncomfortable with their own inner conflicted painful situation they didn't have the tools to look at it and be with it that they had to find and blame their discomfort of something outside of them and they believed it was true that the child was causing their suffering they believed it but it was really because they couldn't be with their own and the victim also people who are stuck in the victim mode oftentimes there's a lot of denial oh they kind of oh i'm responsible you know if i didn't do if i only did it better if i only cooked the dinner better then it wouldn't have happened and often there's a kind of he argued that often for the victim also sometimes there's also a kind of an inability to stay present and for real discomfort and so they act out in unhealthy ways and end up in staying in the relationship longer than they should because they blame themselves i think it's very dramatic example of the power of not learning to be comfortable with suffering and part of what mindfulness does is to is to is a very powerful training and learn to be comfortable and balance with whatever arises in the present moment whatever present moment wants to give you if it gives you joy learn how to be with it without what clinging to it and if discomfort happens in the present moment the same thing learn how to be with it without clinging to it that that is a phenomenally powerful and transformative thing to learn to do and this is a lot of what mindfulness practice is about and it's buddhist kind of context for a lot of people of course just sitting and mindful in meditation and being mindful it's just a wonderful way to kind of become a little bit calmer that goes from the tension um we we're suffering gets created in the present moment and there's kind of and if we kind of continue to be driven which we often are we keep recreating it the function of meditation in part is to interrupt the drivenness so to stop and sit be quiet and just breathe mindfully and be with our breath that means we're not going to be with our stories and our drivenness as much the breath is not drivenness and so we kind of put to stop for a little bit to a drivenness and if we stop being driven in the present moment then we stop fueling the tension that arises and the stress that arises out of drivenness and the body finally gets a chance to relax and so part of what meditation does it allows us to relax and then from that relaxed stance an easeful stance it can be very joyful it's a lot easier to go back and really study and then more subtly the ways in which we're still clinging and as we study the more greater subtlety we can release those and that allows us to look a little more carefully and then we release release that more subtly and as we get that lower and lower more subtle more actually delight and ease gets developed within us until we find that we don't have to cling to anything at all absolutely nothing is not an operating instructions for being a human being then we have to cling except my baby was was born clinging the first thing you did you have a photograph just after he was born he literally was full of blood and laying there and so it's like a second after he was born first thing he did was he clinged onto the operating table when i'm beginning to wonder now being watching this kid grow up is whether part of what growing up means is learning to develop the kind of strength of presence and mindfulness that we learn that we don't need to cling anymore and that the clinging that we do as adults is kind of a continuation perhaps of of necessary survival strategies as babies but which you know we're supposed to grow out of so buddhism is again very simple and maybe it's not even a religion maybe it's just a way of growing up so that was a mouthful so i don't know what to do i don't know what to do now should we uh sit or should we take time for questions and process what i said a little bit both well we can take okay let's take five minutes for questions and comments and discussion yes it's not a question the first time that i've seen the correlation between being in the present non-judgmentally as i'm making this decision to not suffer it's so much like actual meditation in that compassion of recognizing that i'm drifting but gently pulling back this is a decision a decision is a decision with my meditation i'm so bad at that you know in the time that we are attention to meditate or i'm attention to meditate i mean it has wandered hundreds of times and now i finally do the correlation between actual living and the decisions i could make at that moment to not possess experience yes exactly and that's very important in the context of wandering away a lot of people will when they wander away in meditation will interpret oh i've been a bad meditator and then added something which wasn't not part of the operating instructions you don't have to say that you know you're oh this is you this is a human being has wandered away isn't it interesting okay let's get i'm supposed to be i'm supposed to be back in my breath let's come back it can be done much it can be done real compassion that way thank you that was a wonderful yes you talked about staying the moment and keeping your awareness and concentration i know it's funny you could i found that i started listening the past year to jazz when i'm in city or the suburbs driving around it keeps me really focused somehow and i don't really hear it so i wake up more but when i'm in the country and i grow up actually more in the country interesting and what makes me wonder is is um when for example if life is really chaotic then the medicine for that chaos would uh the medicine that particular situation would be in a situation of great stability and health itself be a poison so so when life is really chaotic having something like this music you're playing might really be important and useful to bring you back to some degree of centeredness and presence but if you're in the country and really present there and you know it might be a great state of kind of hell then to have the jazz might actually be agitating so it has to be where you're at just into environment so it's a wise thing in some environment and nothing the other by the door it's so recently you know this idea letting go of all this thingy stuff really seemed like a great idea but no you know these dialogues are me you know even though you know the bruna says like you know it's a good idea to let go or it somehow doesn't seem like such a good idea because it's clint this clint this clinging is who you really are yeah and if you're not clinging who can you possibly be it's um it's kind of like the experience of um of not knowing how to swim and you could throw it into a pool of water and you're flailing about until you realize all you have to do is relax and the water holds you up so what you need to learn is to relax and you'll find out that the ocean of life will hold you just fine without you having needing to have a self you'll just you'll you'll know what to do you'll take care of yourself you'll take care of your people around you really beautifully without having to cling to some self trust and for me the the end result of the Four Noble Truths of Practice is a is a state of ultimate trust yes i'm just wondering um after grand awakening that has a also a permanence follows that absolutely it doesn't it doesn't um uh uh the um it depends on what what you're looking at but um uh as a psychic shift that happens there's the way it's experienced sometimes can actually be very short to breathe um the experience the experience of nibbana or enlightenment that happens can actually be very very brief but it's very very powerful transformation and there are things within our in us they get transformed permanently but the state the experience of clarity the experience of of luminosity the experience of kind of being in touch with this deathless state might only last for a few seconds or a few minutes or a few hours because it's it itself is impermanent but the clinging to clinging to it clinging or believing it clinging to a sense of self for example might be as a permanently lessened so yes i know yes yes well this is metaphysics and uh and uh if you want to talk metaphysics and the buddha says that the that's kind of notion of an indestructible self cannot be found you can believe in it you can just terrorize about it but in your own experience you won't find it and and and buddha was not interested in things you couldn't experience because suffering and the freedom of suffering arises only in relationship to things that you experience and that's all you need to know is to really study that you don't have to be concerned then and there might be and it might not be some ultimate indestructible sense of self there might be and there might not be a great you know creator god but that's not relevant to the purpose of the four normal truths so you can be this wonderfully you know enlightened and at ease and generous and peaceful person either as an atheist or as a theist you know as you wish that's why buddhism is very generous about other religious traditions as you know it's all fine you said yes well this is maybe this is where maybe we have to distinguish uh uh definitions um guilt as a form of aversion aversion to self criticism of self is is a form of suffering involves some extra level of interpretation or clinging or drivenness something remorse where if we've done something that we've hurt someone else and we recognize that pain we've caused someone else and we feel maybe empathetically and you feel that pain and to feel bad about that to kind of feel that pain to feel kind of regret feel bad this is not a good thing you know to go to go out and you know to go out and and um you know and have a car accident car accident and run into someone else and put them in hospital for two weeks and to get out of your car and go kind of swistling down the road and skip things things are just fine everyone and you know whatever that in buddhism but to feel some remorse or some good oh this is a bad thing i wasn't paying enough attention i ran into this person i feel bad that is considered to be healthy in buddhism and that's just a direct contact but to add on top of that guilt to hate oneself or feel aversion towards oneself is different than taking responsibility and feeling remorse i have something it's just that every single death has been involved with the thought no matter what the circumstances that they were conscious they knew they talked and for example one of the families and people that love that person killed guilty when they died very very very common it's very very common oh i don't know maybe so i don't know say this i don't know there's a lot of things i don't know right i just know one or two of those leaves and and so i don't want you know i don't really can't can't answer these questions myself on a kind of great grand in the grand scheme of things but what i see my my trust is in the practice itself so my my response such as such a question is not to try to you know i don't know i can give you know some kind of answers but i really know ultimately but uh my my interest would be not to get the answer from someone else but rather to find out for myself through my own mindfulness practice you know what how is it really for me that's what's really interesting that's what's important for me is to do that do that study for myself and find out in my particular set in my particular situation in the particulars of my life when they come up is my guilt extra or not if you talk about in the abstract it's very hard to find out so so so there's a tendency in buddhism not to you don't believe in listening to me but there's a tendency not to kind of want to generalize a lot but rather to throw it back onto the particular and and and what does it say in a particular moment of your experience because that's where you're suffering and that's where your freedom is going to happen that's where you find out for yourself and that's what you need to do and then everybody you can study other people so in their particular situation so so now we have to do a instant meditation fast so get ready put on put on your seatbelts on your marks get set yes the first person gets the finish line okay one two three breathe just so So congratulations. What's very nice about mindfulness practice is we all get to now at the same time.
