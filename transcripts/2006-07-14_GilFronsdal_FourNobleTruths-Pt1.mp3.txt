 The month before that, I think there was a lot of talking throughout the day, a lot of teaching on my part. And then there's all kinds of ways in which this unfolds. And each day is meant to stand on its own, but each day also is part of a year-long series. And so this year, the series is on the meditation instructions of the Buddha Gave, called the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. And there are a whole series of exercises there in mindfulness practice the Buddha gives. And so we've been going through them over these months. And now we're at the last exercise, the culmination, the climax of the Buddha's instructions on mindfulness. And that's the topic of the Four Noble Truths. And the Four Noble Truths are as often seen as the kind of essence, core teachings of the Buddha. And everything the Buddha teach, taught, everything Buddhism is about can be held or contained within the Four Noble Truths. And if you understand the Four Noble Truths, then everything else follows from that. The Four Noble Truths can be seen as very simplistic. And however, sometimes the simplest equations are the most elegant and simple ones, are the ones that are most profound. And science or mathematics. So that's the way it works in Buddhism. There was a scholarly study, a woman wrote a book some years ago, that she made a claim, based on some very, probably, not very reasonable assumptions about linguistics, that when she looked at the ancient texts, and it came to the conclusion that the Buddha didn't teach the Four Noble Truths. It was later addition to the tradition. And so when Tanisra Bhikkhu, Tanjapa, a scholar-monk, who we know comes here sometimes, read her book, he said, well, you know, I don't really care. Whoever came up with the Four Noble Truths, that person's the Buddha. So whether the Buddha came up with it or it came later, you know, it doesn't matter. It's so important, you know. So, for those of you who don't know what they are, they're usually stated very simply. And often the way they're stated is, the way they're given, the way the game telephone happens, and the time the Four Noble Truths ends up in popular American culture, it's often misrepresented. So the first Noble Truth is simply that there is suffering. And the telephone game brings it to America as saying, life is suffering, which is just a drag to hear that. There's no hope, right? But the statement is, there is suffering. And it's kind of hard to argue against that. There is suffering. There's also happiness. But there is suffering. And the second is that there is a cause or condition that gives rise to that suffering. And then there is, the third one is that there is the cessation of suffering, or there is the cessation of the causes that give rise to suffering. There's cessation. There's the end of this. There's that coming to an end. And then there is, the last one is that last Noble Truth is the path to be walked, to be engaged in, that leads to that cessation, leads to that end. So there's the suffering, the cause, the end, and the conditions, the path that leads to the end. Another way of saying it, which is usually not said in Buddhism, but you could, with kind of a little bit of a likely say, there is suffering and the cause of suffering, and there is happiness and the conditions for happiness. And so the fact that we use the word cessation or end for the third Noble Truth doesn't mean that, you know, it's not just kind of like, you know, a dead end that's kind of, leaves you kind of a limbo with nothing. So it's very simple. There's suffering, the cause, possible to end it, and there's a path to walk it. When the Buddha taught, or sometimes, he would put, sometimes you find in his discourses that he'd prepare people for the Four Noble Truths. He would lay out a whole series of presentations that would lead people to a state of mind, a state of openness or faith or confidence, prepare them so that their mind was primed to somehow understand the Four Noble Truths in a way that was really deeply penetrating. So even though it's easy to understand, it's another thing to have it really penetrating and really have a transformative value in us. And one area where he did it was, he would first talk about things that bring joy. He would talk about the joy of generosity and that would gladden people's hearts. And then he'd talk about the joy of ethics, of integrity, and that would gladden, kind of, inspire people a little bit. And then he'd talk a little bit about, indirectly a little bit about the joys or the happinesses of the rebirth that you'll have if you live an ethical life, a generous life. And then he'd talk about the joy of the people who were born, these beautiful heavenly realms for some time. And that's a nice thing, people would be happy and inspired by that. And then he'd talk about some of the benefits of letting go of renunciation, of living a life of simplicity. And supposedly that would inspire people. And then he would talk about the benefits and the possibilities of getting concentrated. And as he's doing this, he's talking about concentration. People are really getting kind of focused and concentrated on what he's teaching. The minds are getting still, settled, alert, clear, just right there. The mind's not wondering a lot into other things, not thinking about the baseball games. They're just there listening to the Buddha and the minds are getting concentrated. And then, at some point then, he felt the audience was prepared and ready. He would teach them the Four Noble Truths. And because their mind was so ready, they can maybe understand how it applies to their life in a very deep way. So in that sense, the Four Noble Truths are the climax of what the Buddha had to teach. Not to be understood as an introduction to Buddhism kind of thing, but advanced Buddhism. And we prepare ourselves for that. In this discourse we've been looking at this year, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, you have trouble hearing? There are hearing assistant devices there, if that would help you, that you plug into your ear and makes it easier to hear. Or you can move closer. Is it okay with everybody else? Is it working for you now? So how is that? Is that working better? So in this discourse we've been looking at the Four Noble Truths' last exercise. And one way of understanding that is that the earlier exercises are preparing us to really be able to address the Four Noble Truths. Take them on, really let them penetrate into our life. So in the earlier, to be simplistic about the earlier exercises, first there are exercises that are training a person to be in their body, to be embodied. They get calm and settled, use the breath to calm and settle the body. Use the breath to be in touch with the body, to pay attention to the body in other ways. It's going to be embodied, be present for your body, not to be in your body. And then there are teachings or exercises on learning how to pay attention to the simple ways in which our body and mind respond or react to stimulus, whatever is going on. There is something that causes suffering, or causes things that are experienced in a pleasant way or unpleasant way. And we are going to see how we react and respond to whatever is going on at an immediate, felt-sense level. Dropping into not only the body but in the felt-sense level of our experience. And that of course is an antidote from the usual way of experiencing things through the filter of our interpretations, our stories, our metaphysics, our history. It can be very complicated the way we interpret and experience. Often not accurately. So the idea is to come back to what is most primary and immediate to what is happening right here. So these early exercises are really training a person to be immediate here. And then learning to pay attention to the states of the mind. And the states of the mind can be varied. Learning the quality of the mind, knowing how to track it. And so again, that's also about just being immediately present for what's here. And then it goes into looking at some of the patterns of the mind, how the mind actually works. How the mind works in a reactive way with desire and aversion. To see how that works. To understand the cause and conditions of aversion and desire and restlessness and anxiety and doubt. And understand what prompts it. Understand how to let go of it or abandon it. And somehow being able to begin working also with the attachments of the mind, the way the mind gets attached or clings to things. And there's a lot of emphasis in Buddhism in learning how to work with a clinging mind. The mind that is possible to be present. Even though it's present, it's still clinging and reacting and for and against and what's going on. Often in a very deep affective level. Deep emotional level where we act and cling or resist. So learning how to be present for that and see that and not turn away from it or ignore it. But being very wise and be able to connect to it and understand the reactive qualities of the mind. And then, what we did last month, the second to last exercise, is start paying attention to the beautiful qualities of mind that come into play as a person engages in the Buddhist path. So as you kind of engage in this practice, it's not just about looking at attachment and suffering and all that. But as your mind gets settled, concentrated, mindful, engaged at the present moment. Sooner or later, it'll give birth, give rise to some really beautiful states of mind. And there's seven of them. So there's mindfulness, investigation, effort, energy, engagement, joy, tranquility, concentration and equanimity. And these are called seven factors or seven conditions for awakening to happen. So here you get a sense of the development here. Learning how to be present for your immediate experience in your body, your reactivity, your mental states, the emotional reactions and the clinging. Learning how to engage in it and be honest about it and work with it and let go of them. And then cultivating these beautiful qualities of mind. And after all that, then the Buddhist instructions say, now, notice the Four Noble Truths. With all that as a foundation, then notice the Four Noble Truths. Notice how you're suffering. Notice that you are suffering. Noticing what the cause of your suffering is. Noticing how the possibility of ending that suffering. And notice what it takes to end the suffering. Because it's not always easy to let go of the causes. So what does it take? So now the mind is so prepared, maybe quiet enough, concentrated enough, still enough, engaged enough, that when you direct the mind to look at suffering, you don't get depressed. You don't get reactive. It actually can meet the suffering with very wise presence. And in many spiritual traditions that I know of, I've seen in some corners of the tradition, the teaching that if you run away from your suffering, it hurts more. And there's something about turning towards suffering which is very freeing and very important. And certainly true for other people, if you turn towards suffering, just be present for them. It can be very healing and helpful for them. So the same thing for ourselves is a way of turning towards our suffering and really taking it in. And that can be very helpful, just the presence of it. And by this time we're supposed to have a quality presence for that, the ability to really connect with it in a very useful way. And then with that calm, settled mind, willingness to look, then maybe it's possible to look under the surface of what's going on and understand something very deep about the causes and conditions that prompt us to cling, prompt the suffering to arise out of the clinging we have. And some of the deepest-held clinging, suffering born from clinging, comes from clingings that are very hard to see. And so just to go down to El Camino here and walk up to a stranger and say, oh, I'm sure you're suffering and all you have to do is let go of your clinging. It's not going to mean anything, right? Because what's clinging? I didn't realize I'm clinging. But to really see the clingings, like for example, clinging to self, clinging to self-identity, it takes a still, quiet mind to really be able to penetrate that and see it. And then to see the possibility of freedom, enough so you can really let go in a deep way, takes again a prepared mind, a cultivated mind. Am I making sense to you? So this is the climax of what the Buddha had to teach, is the climax of this particular discourse of practice. It's meant to be something quite profound. So today we're going to explore these Four Noble Truths. And we're not going to explore them in the abstract, because that's useful, I imagine. But I think much more useful and to the point for us to explore them or you to explore them in your life, in your own experience, kind of point it back. Can you discover these Four Noble Truths for yourself? And I believe at the beginning of this year-long series, I did say something, didn't I say something about this is a high-risk class? Didn't I even remember that? No? I didn't say that? I thought I wouldn't have a disclaimer at the beginning. Now I tell you, at the end, sorry, I guess it hasn't been risky enough yet. But I take you very seriously to do a class like this, the engagement of practice in order to really make a difference in your life. It means you're willing to engage yourself and take some risks or be exposed, or really kind of engage in ways that may be a little bit unusual if you're walking down El Camino. And so some of the things we might do today might initially seem uncomfortable to you. And you can always adjust and make it more comfortable, as you wish. But there's a little bit of warning, if that's the case. And maybe it won't make you uncomfortable, we'll see. But also, the day is meant, I often notice that some people will come for these Friday Dharma practice days and leave as lunchtime. And some people do it every time, that's kind of the pattern. And that's fine, that's what you want to do. But today, be warned that then you might leave incomplete, because the day is meant to be as a whole, so that we'll go through the Four Noble Truths in the course of the day. And if you leave at lunchtime, then you might just be left suffering. And you leave suffering and you won't have seen the resolution of it. You could just leave now and come back at lunchtime and just give the good news after lunch. So, why don't you, if you want, it might be nice, just take 30 seconds to stand and stretch, and then we'll do a meditation. So take a comfortable alert posture. Close your eyes. And then take a few moments to kind of get into your posture. Be careful with your posture, attentive to it. Maybe sway a little bit or twist a little bit with your body to kind of really settle in and find a good way of sitting. And not thinking about your posture from your head, but rather being inside your body in a sense, and feeling your whole body settling in, being present. And as you feel your body, your posture, if it's possible to enjoy or appreciate being in your body, because it feels pleasant or maybe because you feel some sense of strength, some sense of aliveness. See if you can kind of appreciate or enjoy something about being present in your body with your posture. And then within your body, as part of your body, become aware of your breathing. Notice how your body experiences breathing, the movements in your body, the changing experiences of pressure, tightness, release of pressure, release of tightness. And then feeling your body breathing, and from the ins, as much from the inside of your body as you can, so it's not watching from your head, but sensing feelings within your body. Take a few long, slow, deep breaths. So the breathing helps you connect more fully to your body. The deep in-breath stretch, your ribcage, your shoulders, maybe even your belly, your back ribcage. And then as you exhale, let go, relax, soften your muscles, breathing in deeply. And as you exhale, letting the muscles of your body fall away from the bones. And then letting your breath return to normal, but staying with your breathing, breathing in and breathing out. See if you can allow the breathing to have an effect on you. Allow, see if the breathing can help soften, calm the body and the mind. By directing the energy of the mind to the breathing, the energy of the mind is less and less available for thinking and preoccupation. So the breath is at the center of your experience. Many things occur on the sides, around the peripheries. Thoughts, body sensations, sounds, let them just be in favor of being settled in the breath at the middle. So the breath is at the center of your experience. So the breath is at the center of your experience. So the breath is at the center of your experience. So the breath is at the center of your experience. So the breath is at the center of your experience. So the breath is at the center of your experience. So the breath is at the center of your experience. So the breath is at the center of your experience. So the breath is at the center of your experience. As you stay with your breathing, see if you can cultivate a little bit greater sense of ease, easiness, being easy with how your body is, even if your body feels uneasy. Be at ease with that. As you breathe in and out, see if you can be at ease in your mind. Be easy with the mind if the mind is uneasy or restless. Keep breathing mindfully the best you can and be easy, be at ease with how the mind is. Breathing in, breathing out. Like the breath is the wind moving through waves washing up and down the shore. Breathing in and breathing out. Letting yourself be at ease in your heart, in your emotional state. Even if you feel it easy in the heart, be easy about that. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Each time you exhale, using the exhale as a reminder to let go of whatever you're thinking about, to let go into a little greater stillness or peace. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. And as you exhale, see if you can let go physically, emotionally, mentally. Let go into some feeling of well-being. Even if you feel uncomfortable in many ways, is there some little hint of well-being or sense of well-being that you can tap into as you exhale, settling into it? And perhaps that well-being, its presence maybe can make it a little bit easier to stay with the in-breaths and the out-breaths. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Staying with your breaths in-breaths and out-breaths. If you can't relax, let go into some sense of well-being. Remember the bottom line here, try to be at ease with what is. If you feel uncomfortable physically, mentally, emotionally, can you experiment a little bit as you keep breathing mindfully? Experiment with somehow creating some space or calm or acceptance or allowance or ease around what's uncomfortable. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Letting go of thoughts as you exhale. Breathing in, breathing out. Now from whatever foundation of calm you might have, inner stability you might have, turn your attention mindfully, deliberately, quietly to some way in which right now you're suffering. Is there any way now that there's suffering in your experience? Try to bring that attention to the suffering without now thinking about it, but bringing a calm presence. It might be quite subtle, it might be quite large, it doesn't matter how it is. It might be quite far in the background. Or it might be a current of suffering about something that's not happening here and now but that's part of your life these days. And then see if you can bring an easy presence, relaxed presence to simply hold or be present for the suffering that you have. Breathing in, breathing out. As if suffering deserves your respect and you can have respectful presence of it, getting to know it better, sense it better, not to get rid of it, not to do anything with it except getting to know it better from as calm a presence as you can bring. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Do you have any habits of reacting to suffering that makes it hard for you to bring a calm friendly presence to it? Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. And then come back more fully to your breathing again and for the next two minutes or so, not very long, immerse yourself in breathing so that's all that you're really doing. Your attention is the best you can, connect it to breath for two minutes, letting go of everything else. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out.
