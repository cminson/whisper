 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we are. Good morning, I am CSUNGA. I needed to refresh my own YouTube. It's wonderful to see you all. Good morning, I am CSUNGA. Thank you. Happy to see so many familiar names rolling in and your greetings from all over the place. It's really inspiring to be here with so many people doing this practice. It's a delight. So, good morning all. The topic for this morning is Viriya, Energy or Efforts? And I just want to mention that it's part of a five-part series. Many of you have been to the other parts of the series this week, which is on the basis for roads to spiritual power and meditative success. So, we'll start with a guided meditation. Invitation is to enjoy the chat rolling in if you are, and while you're doing that, to settle into your body. Maybe weave back and forth a little like I'm doing. Feel your weight forward and back, side to side, and come to balance, come to balance in the center. And it can be helpful to start with one or two intentional breaths. A little bit longer, a little bit slower. And letting go of any excess gripping or tension in the out breath. And as you are ready to close your eyes and go inward, and tune in, notice how the body is today, this moment. Any places of holding or relaxation? Any vibrancy or energy? Softness, relaxation, and the other strain, sensations. Noticing this whole body, allowing the breathing to settle into normalcy. And if the breath is a good anchor of attention for you, the invitation is to settle, settle your attention there, rest there. While very intentionally placing attention, awareness, mindfulness at the forefront. Allowing concerns and other experiences, anything then and there, to fade off into the background. And making the intention for this time together in meditation, to continue to return to this moment. A light touch or a firm placing of the heart and the mind and the body. Now, noticing the details of what is arising. Maybe ambient sounds where you are. A myriad sensations of breathing through the aliveness of the whole body. And bringing a sense of interest, devotion, engagement to the details of each in-breath and out-breath, each arising. Thank you. Thank you. Noticing if the mind is wandering away. And if so, just as much effort as is necessary returning, allowing this moment to be predominant. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And time to time noticing if the mind is drifted away, the attention has become loose and re-attuning to the moment. And also noticing if the mind has constricted or gotten too tight. And if so softening, allowing in the moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
