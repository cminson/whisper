I feel some  happiness  to be able to talk about  the 
Buddha’s use of the word  anukampā . The part kampā  
means  “to shake”  and anu means  ‘towards’ or ‘with.’ In 
modern  English,  I like to think  of it as “resonating  with 
others”  or “to have  something  inside  that can resonate.”   
 
I think  the best translation  for anukampā  – this 
resonance  – that I can come  up with right now is ‘care’ 
or ‘caring.’ It’s a basic  concept  that appears  in the 
Buddha’s teachings.  Oddly  enough,  it’s emphasized  a 
lot. Anukampā  is used  much  more  than the word  karuṇā 
– compassion . While  the Buddha  put tremendous  
emphas is on the cultivation  of the heart,  anukampā  is 
never  something  that a person  cultivates.  It’s almost  as 2 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg if anukampā  is an assumed  part of the human  being  – 
that our capacity  to care is innate.   
 
Of course,  we all care for each  other,  provided  that we 
have  somehow  settled  and let go of all of the 
obstructions  to caring . When  we’re caught  up in 
preoccupations,  anger,  greed,  delusion , or fantasy,  it 
might  be very hard to give space  to feel where  we 
resonate , have  empathy , and feel in relationship  with 
other  people.   
 
The Buddha  seems  to assume  that this is the case , and 
that people  will act from there.  Parents  will have  
anukampā  (care) for their children.  Friends  will have  
care for each  other.  The Buddha himself  acts in the 
world  not out of karuṇā, but out of anukampā .  
 
Here  are some  of the things  that the Buddha  says he 
does  out of anukampā.  Maybe  it was a common  
colloquial  expression  in ancient  India,  but when  
someone  was sick and request ed the Budd ha to come  
to see them,  they would  ask, “Please,  out of care.”  It 
could  be out of compassion.  But I think  the request  was 
to visit out of care and consideration.  The Buddha  also 
says that one teach es out of care.  When  people  want  to 
give him food,  he recei ves it out of care – it’s accepted  
out of some  kind of relationship  to them.

  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg One of the things  I want  to emphasize  today  is that the 
word  ‘care’ is a relational  word.  It is a concept  that 
occurs  in relationship  to people.  For the Buddha,  it 
seems  like he assumes  that we live in a relational  
world.  He emphasizes  this a tremendous  amount  – but 
without  using  a word  corresponding  to the English  word  
‘relationship ’ or “in relation.”  I can’t remember  seeing  
this in any English  translation.  
 
How we translate  some  of these  words  from the ancient  
language  can be a little arbitrary . But we find a lot of 
words  that are closely  connected  to relationships . It 
seems  that the Buddha  was regularly  thinking  in ways  
that imply  conditionality.  That’s the English  word  we 
use. Things  exist in relationship  and because  of 
conditions  – in ‘dependence ’ is the English  word  often  
translated  from the Pali.  
 
Things  exist in relationship  to each  other  on the basis  of 
other  things.  Some  things  are said to exist like two 
straws  of reed (the plant ). They  lean against  each  other  
and hold each  other  up. So they exist in relationship  to 
each  other , holding  each  other  up. They  can exist 
because  they’re in relationship.  
 
For the Buddha,  everything  that exists  is said to be 
conditioned.  This means  that everything  exists  in 
relationship  to other  things.  As far as I can read,  the 
Buddha  repeatedly  took the religious  and spiritual  4 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg teachings  of his time and reframed  them  in the context  
of relationship s to other  people.  He did this in terms  of 
what  we might  call ethics , or how we would  relate  to 
people  out goodness : non-greed,  non-hate,  and non-
delusion  – as opposed  to relating  to people  out of 
greed,  hatred  and delusion.  
 
The tremendous  emphasis  on greed,  hate and delusion  
in the Buddha’s teachings  – and becoming  free of them  
as a definition  of liberation  – puts liberation  in a 
relational  context.  Greed , and especially  hatred , have  a 
lot to do with the relational  way we are in the world  and 
with other  people.  Over  and over again,  the Buddha  
came  back  to this. 
 
One of my favorite  ways  in which  we see this is when  
the Buddha  define s a person  of great  wisdom  as 
“concerned  with the welfare  of oneself,  others,  self and 
others,  and the whole  world.” So where  does  this 
concern  for the welfare  of everything  come  from, if it 
doesn’t come  from obligation  or from a logical  idea that 
this is what  we should  do?  
 
When it comes  out of someone  who spends  a lot of 
time meditating,  chances  are that it wells  up as a 
response  to this relational  world  that we live in. We are 
influenced  by others.  We feel others,  and they feel us. 
As this capacity  to settle  deeper  and deeper  grows,  and 
obstructions  fall away,  we touch  into this place  of 5 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg resonance  or anukampā , which  may be close  to the 
English  idea of empathy.   
 
Ethics  then doesn’t come  from following  rules.  It comes  
from being  in touch  with this place  where  things  
resonate  and where  goodness  exists.  It comes  when,  in 
a deep,  heartfelt  way, we feel in relationship  to the 
world  around  us in a way that is mutual  supportive.  
 
The Budd ha seems  to assume  that we are in this place.  
It’s assumed  that as we develop  spiritually  – more  and 
more,  that’s where  we’ll operate  from.  It seems  like the 
Buddha’s care for the world  and his way of engaging  
and teaching  within  the world  comes  out of this place  of 
anukampā . 
 
For a number  of reasons,  mettā , karuṇā, muditā , and 
upekkhā  (loving -kindness,  compassion,  sympathetic  joy 
and equanimity ) come  from a different  place  than 
anukampā . One reason  is that anukampā  encompasses  
all four of these qualities  of love.   
 
It may also be more  basic  and simple.  Mettā  is 
friendliness.  It’s a cognate  with ‘friend,’ so it’s a way of 
being  friendly  and having  goodwill.  It’s a little more  
conceptual  and active  than anukampā . Compassion  is 
really  in connection  to people’s suffering , and it’s also a 
bit more  engaged  or specific.  Certainly  sympathetic  joy 
– recognizing  something  wonderful  happening  – is 6 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg conceptual.  Upekkhā  (equanimity ), as a brahmavih āra, 
is understood  to be a wisdom  factor . It involves  having  
the perspective  of a bird’s-eye view on what’s 
happening , and this too is a little more  activated  than 
the deep,  settled,  quiet  place  where  care exists.  This 
place  of care can then be manifested  in loving -
kindness,  compassion,  sympathetic  joy, and 
equanimity.  But it’s something  much  more  basic,  
simple , and relaxed  – and which  doesn’t require  a lot of 
thinking  or conceptualization.  It’s just resonance  and 
place  of warmth  and kindness.   
 
The Buddha  doesn’t say that this is innate  in us. He just 
seems  to assume  that it’s there , and that this is how 
people  will operate.  I find it very helpful  to have  this as a 
reference  point  – that there  is something  very peaceful  
and at ease  that doesn’t easily  get troubled.  It is a warm  
caring , and a way of living  in relationships  that 
recognizes  that relationships  are important.   
 
From the very beginning,  this Dharma  practice  we do is 
very much  connected  to our relational  world  – to 
people,  animals,  beings,  and the Earth  itself.  Of course,  
in all kinds  of fundamental  ways,  we only exist in 
dependence  on other  things.  We only exist because  
certain  conditions  come  together  to hold us up. We only 
exist because  we’re leaning  against  other  things  that 
are leaning  against  us, keeping  us going  and alive.  
 7 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg In this deep  relational  way of being , what  happens  
when  the deep  abode  of empathy,  connection,  warmth,  
and care comes  from a place  where  there  is no greed,  
neediness,  attachments,  or fear?  Can we settle  in and 
discover  this deep  place  of goodness  within,  and then 
let that be the support  for how we come  into the world?  
If we can do that, I think  it becomes  second  nature.  It 
becomes  a natural  thing  to want  to care for others  and 
for ourselves.  
 
The idea that Dharma  practice  cultivates  and develops  
people  who care in strong  and wise ways  is very 
inspiring  for me. I hope  that all of us, as we continue  to 
develop  this practice , clearly  see the connection  
between  our practice  and becoming  people  who have  
anukampā for the whole  world.  
 
Thank  you very much.
