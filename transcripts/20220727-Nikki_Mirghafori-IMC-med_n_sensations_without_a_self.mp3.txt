 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Thank you. Greetings, greetings, friends. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, whatever the time is. From all the various places you're joining. Wonderful to see your hellos, your greetings, these expressions of metta for each other, for the sangha. Greetings, greetings. So lovely to join you this moment in time to practice together. So this week we're exploring the mind's body, the mind's body. So today we continue to explore that. And without further ado, let's practice together. Let's practice together and explore, explore this mind's body, this body's mind, this mind's body. So. Ahh. Arriving. Arriving wholeheartedly. Arriving. Arriving. And this body inhabiting this body. And allowing, inviting this body to sit tall with a sense of integrity, like a mountain. Upright. And well rooted, like a well rooted tree connected to the earth. Through our sit bones, our bottom, our legs, our feet. Well rooted, connected to the earth. All the while, the top of this tree, tall, reaches up to the sky. And let the branches, the leaves, the limbs. Ahh. Be relaxed. Offering itself, offering themselves to gravity. Letting our awareness, trace, trace the body, the outline of the body. As if we're drawing, three dimensional drawing. Brushing our entire body, first on the edges with our awareness. And then letting this whole body sitting. And then letting it be filled out. Letting the breath be like watercolors. Filling out the whole body. Not effortfully, but let it just happen on its own. All we do, there's very little doing here, if any. Let's just to turn our awareness, turn our awareness, our attention to a particular perception, a way of seeing. And this body right now. Thank you. And as the breath is received by the body, the entire body, the whole body breathing, bellowing. Turning awareness to the entire body, bellowing the breath entering, leaving. Letting the body be relaxed. Let the body be an organ of perception. So that we're not noticing the body from the top of our head, from the control tower. But as if our mind is in the body, in the perceptions, the sensations of the body itself. If you're noticing your breath in your belly right now, say, the belly is sensing itself, the mind is in the abdomen. As if your abdomen has eyes, ears. Trusting, trusting that the body knows how to sense, how to breathe, how to perceive, relaxing, relaxing. It's not hard. Trust your body. Your body knows how to sense. The body as an organ of perception. Perceiving, receiving the breath from within. Thank you. The body knows, senses simply. Sensing the sensations. Whatever, wherever is most prominent. Use the abdomen for this example. The sensation sensed on their own. The sense only the sense. The felt only the felt. No distance. No separation. It's just a sensation. No need for commentary. From the inside of the abdomen of the sensations themselves being sensed. The pressure, the tightness, the movement. The vibration. Maybe even warmth and coolness. Thank you. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you everything we need to awaken is presented to us in the body in this long, rather body we just need to pay attention in a particular way we need to be patient we need to be patient we need to be patient we need to be patient so today, let the body have its own mind the locus of perception, of sensation and the sensation itself the knowing in the known itself not from a far, not from a distance so as a sensation presents itself in the body whether the breath or something else let the mind relax into that sensation be drenched in that sensation from the inside and hang in there, it will become clear on its own if the thought arises I can't do this, what does it mean? and you believe that and you go with it it will take a long time to click and a long time to click or it might never hang in there, trust trust that the body knows how to sense and perceive without the need for analysis and commentary without the need for analysis and commentary without the need for analysis and commentary without the need for analysis and commentary without the need for analysis and commentary without the need for analysis and commentary this particular way of perceiving is not quite clicking yet I invite you to imagine that you, whoever you are if there is a you, you are in diaptament in the sensations and stay, stay with perceiving in this way the whole body perceiving sensations from the inside just points of sensation no need for you just points of sensation just points of sensation just points of sensation just points of sensation just points of sensation just points of sensation just points of sensation and as we bring this sit to a close together holding ourselves with kindness for whatever rose or did not rise we've showed up, we've done our best rise. We've showed up, we've done our best. Whether distraction arose or escaping us or whatever else, it's okay. We've done our best. Even if there was one moment of awareness, clarity, mindfulness that's infinitely more than zero moments. So appreciating that we are planting seeds of cultivation. It's clarity, awareness, knowing, awakening, kindness, goodness and offering this goodness ours and collectively, wholeheartedly, trusting there is goodness here, co-created, offering generously to all beings everywhere. It's not for us to keep, nothing is for us to keep in this impermanent life. Nothing. So sharing our goodness, our heart, our actions, wholesome actions for the benefit of all beings everywhere, including ourselves. May all beings everywhere know their own goodness. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free.
