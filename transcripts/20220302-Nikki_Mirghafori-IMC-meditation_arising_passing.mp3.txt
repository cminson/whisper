Hello, friends. Hello. Greetings.
Whatever time zone you're in, it's lovely to be with you in this moment in time.
So today we continue with our practice with our exploration of the refrain of the Satipatana Sutta, which turns out to be very important, very important as we explored yesterday, the spatial expansion, internal, external.
And today we explore the next part of the phrase of the refrain, which is expanding the temporal aspect, which is the arising and passing away and arising and passing away.
So during the guided meditation, I will make some invitations, bring some invitations. After we've settled with our body, with the breath, I'll bring some invitations for us to explore this temporal aspect of arising, passing and arising and passing away as the refrain invites.
And there's a lot more I'd love to share with you during the brief dharma afterwards, because this part, if you thought yesterday the internal, external dimension was important.
Yeah, the temporal aspect is even more important for reasons I will explain. This is of the highest importance in our practice for the purpose of awakening and for the purpose of insight.
So, so let us begin, let us begin our practice together, let us land, let us land in our bodies.
Landing in this moment.
Arriving, arriving, arriving in this moment in time.
And releasing, relinquishing everything that has come before.
Relinquishing the past. Relinquishing thoughts of the past, as well as the future.
Planned thinking, not that there's anything wrong with planning or thinking in our daily life, but in this moment in time, in this moment in time.
Relinquish what's not needed.
We give up, joyfully we give up.
We release entanglements in order to arrive here.
And this precious, important, ever-fleeting moment of aliveness.
Taking refuge, taking refuge.
In our hearts.
In the goodness of our practice, in the goodness of coming together of our intention in this moment.
And relaxing the body.
Releasing entanglements.
Relaxing the body. All the nooks and crannies that are tight.
Maybe the forehead, the jaw.
Ah, neck and shoulders, our arms, our hands, our chest, the abdomen, releasing, releasing into the sit bones.
The entire weight of the upper body released.
Onto the cushion or the chair.
Your sit bones, releasing the legs.
Upper legs, lower legs and feet.
Ah.
Releasing, relaxing, taking refuge.
Allowing the sensations, the sensations throughout the body to be prominent.
The sensations of hardness, softness, the contact points between the cushion and our bottom.
The sensations of coolness, warmth, softness, hardness at our hands.
Where our hands touch each other or our lap.
The feeling of warmth and coolness.
The feeling of warmth and coolness in our face.
Maybe at the nostrils where the air rushes in and out.
Perhaps sensations of tingling anywhere in the body.
Or the feeling of expansion of the breath, the flow, the pressure.
Internally, pushing, supporting.
This body, this body, it dance. It dance of sensations.
This body, this body, it dance.
This body, this body, it dance.
It dance of sensations.
Anywhere, awareness, sati, mindfulness turns to, it tends to, clearly knows, clearly knows.
Clear comprehension, Sampajanya, it dance of sensations.
Hardness, softness, tingling, flow.
Pushing, heat, coolness.
Pushing.
Movement.
At the touch points, contact points of the body with the cushion, chair, hands, lips, breath.
Or just simply anywhere in the body, these sensations, so many of them.
Let awareness be wide, let awareness be wide to notice, to contain this dance.
And notice how sensations arise.
Let yourself be curious about sensations arising.
See them, witness them, know them arising, come into being, being known.
See them, witness them, know them arising, come into being.
See them.
And sensations passing.
They're knowing, passing, maybe, or something that was prominent, minutes ago or moments ago.
No longer sensed.
No longer sensed.
Can also open to sounds if you wish.
Part of the sphere of awareness, sphere of the senses, sounds arising, sounds passing.
Sensation sounds arising and passing.
River of experience, constant flow, not constant.
A waterfall of experience, so many molecules of water moving, moving, moving.
Giving the impression of the waterfall as a fixed thing, but it's always moving, shifting.
Sensation sounds, pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, feeling-toned, vain enough.
Arising and passing.
Choosing one of the spheres I named sensations or sounds, or feeling-tone, or some people's sounds are easiest.
Or some others, know your own proclivity to be aware of arising and passing of this phenomena.
The temporal aspect of the phenomena.
Choosing one sphere, let's say sounds and stay with it, not switching back and forth.
In the soundscape, notice the soundscape, sounds arising and passing.
Sensation sounds.
Sensation sounds.
Sensation sounds.
Sensation sounds.
Arising and passing.
Sensation sounds.
Sensation sounds.
Sensation sounds.
Sensation sounds.
Arising and passing of thoughts.
Sensation sounds.
A river of experience.
Sensation sounds.
Sensation sounds.
Sensation sounds.
Sensation sounds.
And as we bring this sitting period together to a close.
For having shown up as best as we've been able to, letting go of any judgment, even if there was one moment of clear comprehension, seeing, arising and passing, that's enough.
It's planting a seed, appreciating that you showed up.
One moment is infinitely more than zero moments.
And appreciating there is goodness in our intention, in our practice, in the seeds that we sow individually and collectively.
Trusting, trusting in that inner goodness.
And offering, offering our practice, offering our efforts, our intentions, our actions aligned with our intentions.
Today, this period of practice, the benefit of all beings everywhere.
May all beings everywhere, especially those, especially those who are unsafe, afraid, feeling threatened,
with a lot of suffering in war zones around this world of ours.
Offering, offering our practice, our hearts to them specially.
Not turning away, human beings just like us.
May all beings everywhere, all beings everywhere, including ourselves, be safe, be happy,
have good health, and have ease in their lives.
May all beings everywhere, including ourselves, be free.
Thank you. Thank you for your practice, everyone.
Thank you.
