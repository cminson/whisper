The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So to begin the talk, I just would like you to meet someone around you.
Just as people have come here this evening, some people came with friends, other people just showed up themselves.
So maybe you can just meet someone near you, you can share your name and where you're from.
So the topic today is actually the Dharma of Harry Potter.
So you could also share with each other, what is your relationship to Harry Potter?
Have you seen the movies? Have you read the books? Do you like it? Are you a fan?
So we'll just take about five minutes to just get to meet someone around you.
So as Sean said, my name is Anushka. I actually have come here from San Francisco today.
I drove, braved the rush hour traffic to come here.
And I'll be doing that for the next three weeks, actually.
So my friend and colleague Andrea is a usual teacher here.
And she asked me if I would substitute for her. I think she's teaching on the East Coast maybe, a retreat.
And she had suggested me to come up with some theme for the talks.
So I came up with this theme that's about Dharma and magic.
And the first one that we're going to do is about the Dharma of Harry Potter.
Second one, we're going to talk about the Dharma of time travel.
Next one, we'll talk about the Dharma of resurrection.
And the fourth one is a wild card to be determined.
So how many people came here because they wanted to hear about the Dharma of Harry Potter?
All right, great.
There probably is an equal number of people who saw that title and did not come because of Harry Potter.
So actually, I'm happy I got a chance to put it down in a series because sometimes I've gone to give talks
and there's not the title given ahead of time.
And then people feel a little trapped when they don't know what was up.
And how many people have never seen any Harry Potter movies, never read any books?
Wow, OK, a couple of people.
All right, great.
So I'll try and give enough, like, a little bit of context for you so that you understand what's going on.
But really the focus of what I want to share with you is about the relationship of Harry Potter in this series
to our own spiritual life, to your own path and my reflections on that.
So I started a little late into this, the Harry Potter series.
I'll admit that for the first couple of books, I was kind of skeptical.
Like, it's a big fad, everyone's into it.
I didn't read them and I didn't see the movies.
And then at some point I got the flu and my then girlfriend came and gave me one of the Harry Potter books
and I think it was book three.
And it's sort of written at the level for about maybe a 10-year-old,
which is about what I was reading at that time with the flu.
So I read it and I loved it.
And then that kicked me off in reading the other ones.
And I think the flu lasted for a while because I read the prior books and then I watched the movies
and really got into it.
And from that time I was a fan and started to follow the series.
And this has, of course, been a big international hit, these books.
Like among the best-selling books, the quickest ones to sell out
and the movies have been the highest grossing and all of that.
And for myself as someone who is both a Dharma practitioner, a Dharma teacher,
but also someone living in the modern world,
I was interested in like, what's the connection here?
What's the connection to bringing the teachings of liberation, teachings of freedom, teachings of happiness
and connecting with how things are in the regular and normal world.
So as it said in my bio, I have spent a bunch of time in monasteries,
practicing in retreat centers, long silent retreats and so on.
But also now I'm a person in the world.
So I feel like these teachings have to be relevant to us here in the 21st century.
So that being said, I have read the books and I've seen the movies,
but I'm not a Harry Potter expert.
So if anyone asks me what's Dumbledore's brother's middle name
or what color was the door of this house or so on, I'm not going to know.
But I'm sure there's someone here who will, or you could look it up on the internet.
So a number of different aspects that I wanted to reflect on in this.
So one is, you know, it seems like, well, what's the appeal of this?
Why is there some universal appeal for something like Harry Potter?
So in one sense, it's just a good story, right?
It's like a good story about kids growing up and finding themselves.
And it reminds me of other series that I've read about young people's hijinks
and their boarding school kind of thing.
So Enid Blyton or, you know, some other books and enough Americans are as familiar with those.
But then there's another dimension of this whole series that I think is why it's caught on so much,
which is that it really is a great story of the hero's journey.
So it's really akin to a lot of mythology that has been in the past
and around all different cultures, around a person's quest for some kind of greater thing in their life.
So in this way, I think all of us can kind of relate to that, right?
So Joseph Campbell is the one who wrote about this hero's journey as a kind of template
for mythological quests and for stories.
And it's kind of a template that has been used for a long time that has been there.
You can trace it through Greek mythology or through the Ramayana and South Asian literature
or George Lucas used this in Star Wars as a template for creating the whole Luke Skywalker in his quest and so on.
So I think there's some way in which Harry Potter and his story strikes us on this level too.
So in this kind of vein of the hero's journey,
there are several different stages that the hero usually goes through.
And as you hear about this, think about yourself.
So think about your own life, your own adventures.
And I think in the Harry Potter series, both the whole series is one journey like this
and also each book or film is sort of its own little journey of Harry's life and his friends.
So there basically are three stages in this kind of journey.
The first one is about departure.
The second one is about initiation.
And then the third one is about return in the hero's journey.
So in the first one about departure, there's some kind of call to adventure.
So the hero, the main character, is living their mundane life.
And that could be in a regular house or in Harry Potter's case,
he was living under the staircase in a small room.
I'm not thinking he's very special at all.
In fact, actually having a little bit of a rough time of it.
And then there's something that calls him to a different life.
And in his case, it seems like there was some sort of foreordained thing
that he was supposed to be this great wizard and he didn't know about it.
And then oftentimes people go through then a sort of refusal of the call.
Like, you're not talking about me. Like, I'm too small, too insignificant.
You got the wrong person, et cetera, et cetera.
But then there usually is some kind of supernatural or spiritual guide that comes.
So in Harry's case, he has the people from Hogwarts.
So the wizards, Dumbledore and Hagrid and all these who come.
In the first part of the book, he actually is basically pulled out of his life
and yanked into this other world.
So you could think about this in your life about your own call to something greater.
And that call to something greater could be anything that's been going on in your life.
So for some people, you might relate to this around your own spiritual life.
So like Harry, you might have been sort of living in the state of Duca
under the staircase in some metaphorical or actual way.
Not knowing if there's something better, but feeling somewhat dissatisfied.
And then there's this call, right?
And so the call could come the first time that you hear about freedom
or if you meet someone who's inspiring to you who seems like,
oh, I want to be like that person, I want to know what they know.
It could be the first time that you read about some practice
and something resonates with you about this path, right?
And you feel like, okay, I'd like to go on that, I'd like to come.
You could reflect also on your own guides.
So none of us actually do this alone, right?
So all of us have found some support guides along the way.
And sometimes they're people that we know, sometimes they're just people that we read about or see, right?
People who inspire us or who lead us along the path.
Then there's this need to cross a threshold sort of into the other world.
And that usually brings with it like a lot of fear to do that.
Now this happens on a larger scale, but also I would suggest that for each of us,
actually each time that you sit in meditation, you're going through this process in some way.
So for Harry Potter, he's letting go of his regular muggle world
in which things are mundane and as they seem,
and actually stepping into this magical world.
So this magical world in which time is more malleable,
in which you can run through a pillar and end up on platform nine and three-quarter.
So where things are not exactly as they seem.
So space and time is actually different than it is in the regular world.
And actually when you decide to sit, when you actually decide to sit,
close your eyes and come into presence,
you start to recognize what's actually really true.
So beyond our ideas of what's true, so beyond the appearance of things,
you actually develop the tools with mindfulness, with concentration,
to actually come into contact with a variety of things that seem unusual,
even magical in the regular world.
Now, which is real and which is magical is, you know, we can debate about,
but you come into contact with something that's different from the usual way that we relate to things,
the usual way we relate to time, the usual way we relate to space and so on.
So next comes the level of initiation.
So this is the main journey of this hero and the character.
And usually included in this is a series of trials that the character has to go through.
So again, this also happens each time that you sit,
but it also happens in your broader spiritual path of things that seem like obstacles to your progress.
Now, it might come as comfort to you to know that in this template of the hero's journey,
oftentimes the hero fails at several of these trials.
So in case you feel like that's been your story, then that's very normal and that's actually part of the process.
So usually you get a whole lot of different trials.
And even each time that you sit, you get different trials, right?
So if you sit and try to become present, even as the instructions were today with the breath,
different things come up.
So you get distracted by something.
The knee starts to hurt.
You start to get itchy or restless.
You start to get sleepy.
So all of these challenges come up and then you have to learn to work with them.
And actually it's only through our attempt and fail, repeatedly in fact, that we learn and develop strength, develop skills.
So Harry definitely has a series of trials along every little bit of the way.
There's part during the initiation that also has to do with experiencing something unconditional, like unconditional love.
So contact with something greater than one's own small view of oneself in the world.
For Harry that's like his memory of his mother, his parents.
And I'll talk a lot more about this because I think this is one of the main pieces of the story that relates to the Dharma too.
It's about this meta and conditional love.
So usually the hero goes through temptations, temptations of stepping back, of stepping back into the mundane world.
So it's not just like once you take a step over that threshold, you're like full steam ahead.
So again also this happens to each time you sit sometimes, right?
Maybe I'll go watch TV instead.
I'll go back to the mundane world, right?
Maybe I'll go get a snack.
Maybe I'll call someone or do something else, right?
Then there usually is some kind of in this initiation phase, initiation by some greater figure.
And then actually a death that has to happen.
So kind of dying to oneself, dying to the self that you usually know.
And this is something that happens in the spiritual path both on a moment by moment level.
So as we let go of our identification with each thing that arises as you sit.
But also in the larger sense as we do this in a bigger and bigger way.
So as we actually get into contact more with what's true about who I am and what reality is.
And let go our usual way of identifying with our self.
And then the hero gets left with the ultimate boon, whichever that is, of insight or sometimes an object or something like that.
And then comes the return.
So this last phrase is the return actually.
So it's not enough that the hero goes on the journey and actually achieves something but there's the return.
And then having to learn how to integrate that into the world.
How having to connect with others, having to speak that, share that.
And sometimes there's challenges in that as well.
But from that comes then a certain freedom to live, freedom to be in a different way.
So I was describing also the as you sit this experience of temptation or challenge that comes up.
And in the Buddhist teaching there's also a mythology or teaching about this Mara.
So Mara is like the tempter.
So as you sit in your quest, stable in your posture, trying to be present with whatever it is that arises,
Mara shows up in various forms.
So you could say in some ways that Mara is like the Voldemort figure.
So this is the figure that has all these armies at their disposal.
And in the Harry Potter stories it's like actually the school is under siege by all these armies of different kinds of creatures and unusual beings.
And these are like the armies of Mara.
So what the armies of Mara as we sit are of sense desire, of fear, of doubt, of hatred, of going to sleep, of fading out.
And the description of Buddha's path also describes him sitting through all these under night of his enlightenment
and being able to see through all of these, so seeing through all of these and being able to meet them as they arrive.
So how are you able to meet these though?
So it takes practice.
It takes a lot of practice.
So that's where someplace like Hogwarts is helpful.
So for Harry he went to this training school, he was taken to this training school in which he spent six years developing all these different powers.
And if you look at some of the different spells that he learned, a lot of them require a certain amount of concentration,
so collectiveness of mind, being able to learn how to collect the powers of the body-mind system and apply them in a certain way.
This is actually also what we're doing in meditation too, collecting the power of our body-mind energies that are usually very disparate, very scattered, and then applying them.
So some examples of that in his world.
So there's this connection between Harry and this Voldemort who is like the sort of integrated enemy character.
And there are certain points at which Harry and this character are so connected that Harry starts to have thoughts that are this character's thoughts.
And then he knows that also this character, Voldemort, is able to see into his mind in some way.
So he's supposed to learn how to protect his mind.
So he's being taught by his teachers how to protect his mind, how to have strength of mind, concentration.
One of the main ones also that struck me as similar during watching the movies and reading the books was this protective spell that he does, which is the Petronus charm.
So in this book there are these creatures that are called dementors, which are like the shadowy figures of Lord Voldemort that bring this sense of death and coldness.
And I think in one of the books, it's either Ron or Harry who says, you know, it's like sucking all the happiness out of you.
And in the movies they have this figure come up and you can actually see their face being sucked into this dark shadowy figure.
So how do you protect against this is this particular spell, which is a spell of remembering some time in which you are very happy,
focusing on that and then projecting it outwards.
So for those of you who are here during the meditation that we did, the last part of the meditation that we did, which was this metameditation,
the practice of loving kindness, is actually basically that.
And that spell, if you will, was actually also taught by Buddha as a protection.
It was actually a protection for monks and nuns who at the time were going to meditate in the forest and were spooked by something or someone's in the forest and came running back to him
and he taught them this spell, if you will.
So this practice of loving kindness, of cultivating this pure heartedness, being able to focus that and project it outwards.
So it's the power both of the concentration and of the purity of heart that's important there.
And for me actually that's also one that I use.
So I've actually developed that practice for many years and I use that when I'm scared or I use that when I'm in a situation where I feel like I need protection.
Or even if I'm somewhere I'm walking on a street and I'm feeling like things are a little bit iffy, I start doing that practice.
And it both brings stillness and strength to my own heart.
But also I believe that there is some sense of protectiveness that that gives outwardly too.
But you can experiment with that in your life and see.
So the other dimension that's similar is this sense of the power of metta through Harry's protection from his mother.
So the kind of foundational pre-story is that this Lord Voldemort tried to kill Harry when he was a child.
But he actually couldn't kill him because of the love of his mother.
So the love of his mother basically made this curse that Voldemort gave him bounce off.
And only left him with a small little lightning shaped scar on his forehead.
But it was the intense love of his mom, the unconditional love that was actually protective to him.
And Harry actually taps back into this during many different times of the story.
And this is actually sort of what separates him from this Voldemort character.
So at different times in the story, in Harry's trials and tribulations, he actually does start to get angrier.
He starts to hate someone, so someone who has killed his friend.
Harry's a very loyal person, so particularly when something has happened like that.
And there are many times when he's about to do something that would be basically what Voldemort would have done,
of casting this killing curse or taking revenge in some intense way.
And you can see at that moment he's in this struggle, he's really in this struggle of what to do.
But always he actually lets it go, like he can't do it, he can't actually kill in that way.
And his mentor, one of his many mentors, Sirius, his godfather also tells him
at some point when he's having a lot of doubt about himself and he's getting more and more angry memories
and feelings from this connection with Voldemort.
You know, I feel like something's wrong, I feel like I'm a bad person, all this is playing out in me,
I just feel like angry all the time.
So his mentor says, you know, Harry you're not a bad person, you're a good person who had bad things happen to them.
And you know, it's not just that the world is separated into good and bad, we all have good and bad within us.
What makes us who we are is the power that we have to choose our actions.
That's what makes us who we really are.
So this is an important piece of understanding along our spiritual path too.
So as we develop awareness, as we start to see our own mind-heart system, as we start to pay attention,
we see like we're a mixed bag, right?
Like for most of us our intentions are really a mixed bag.
So sometimes very wholesome, generosity, compassion, kindness, courage, wisdom.
And sometimes less noble, right?
So sometimes there's jealousy, anger, revenge, fear, hatred.
So it's good to recognize those things.
It's really important to recognize all those things and not actually just pretend that you're all one thing.
So the job of the hero is not to pretend to be all good.
It's to have the courage to actually face all of these things that arise.
And then as you see them coming up, your choice is which one do I want to act on?
Which one do I want to use to catapult me into action?
Which ones do I want to speak from?
And that's actually what builds the character that we have.
And in terms of karma, teachings of karma, that which arises within our heart and our mind,
that's not actually under our control in the moment.
But what we do with that, if we're able to recognize that,
that's where we're able to plant the seeds in the moment for the future, for the next moment, for the next thing to happen.
So just like Harry, he found himself had taken birth,
and here he finds himself living under the stairways in this family,
and he finds he has these different powers, and he can talk to snakes and all kinds of things.
We all find ourselves born into a certain family with certain abilities,
with certain advantages, with certain disadvantages.
And for all of us, our path is to recognize our own strength.
So both recognize our strength in terms of the relativity of our strengths and talents and what we can offer in the world,
but also in a broader sense to recognize this potential for all of us to awaken.
So this potential for all of us to access this kind of purity of heart to plant these seeds,
to develop along this way.
So everybody in this room who was here has had, for some reason, has shown up here today.
So you've had some karma has propelled you here so that you get to hear about this
and have been hearing about this, or maybe for the first time.
But that's already your call, right?
It's already your call is here, your call for your journey.
I also want to emphasize this piece about integrity.
So I talked about how Harry was not able to actually kill, and he recognized,
this is the difference between me and Baltimore.
It's like I have love, I have friendship, I have connection.
I have something worth fighting for.
I have something that I want to protect.
And he knew that from his mom and from his friends and from his teachers.
He had that kind of connection.
So the sense of integrity is also a real protection for us.
And in the Buddhist teachings it's articulated as silla, or as the precepts.
And with the precepts, it's like if we're actually an enlightened being,
we naturally will act in accordance with these precepts.
So if we're actually aligned with the way things are,
if we actually have an awareness about our interconnection,
we won't kill other beings.
We won't take things that are not freely offered.
We won't harm others or ourselves with our sexuality, sexual energy.
We won't speak false because we're aligned with the truth.
And also we will tend towards this kind of clarity.
So we'll avoid taking in things that will damage that,
such that we will do any of the other things that we'll regret.
So this quality of wholesomeness of integrity is also an important piece of this hero's journey.
And this is true in so many of the journeys of heroes in many different contexts.
So the sense of ordinary and not ordinary,
I think is also an interesting piece for us to tap into for this kind of practice.
And feel into that for yourself.
That includes recognition of who you are and the complexity of who you are.
That includes seeing that which we have visual sense of
and which we experience energetic are two different things.
That includes also recognizing that there's actually this immense power at our disposal,
if we understand how to cultivate that and how to use that.
Each time that we sit, I told you that it seems like we go through this kind of journey too.
So we go through this journey of being on the threshold, the call.
So the call is actually the call to go deep, the call to see what's really true.
Then we get challenged, as I said.
We get challenged during the time of trying to be present and each time that we do that.
And then there's the return and the integration.
So as we come back again, how do we integrate what we have understood,
what we have seen into the way that we live our life?
So just like in this whole series, there's one big arc, but then there's also smaller arcs in each of the books, actually.
In all of our lives, there's this larger arc of our journey, our journey as heroes.
And also there's many smaller arcs as it happens like this.
And I think it's helpful to reflect on this, not in some sense of becoming overly grandiose
or like arrogant about your life, like I'm the savior and nobody else is.
Because actually all of us are in some way.
All of us are heroes on that journey.
But actually to inspire you, so to inspire you as you go through this.
You're part of this template of this journey that has been human beings seeking this kind of freedom
for generations, for hundreds of years, even thousands of years.
So across space and across time.
And to be inspired also about the choice that we have in that.
So the choice that we have of seeing what's there and being able to work with that.
Being able to sink deeper into the sense of interdependence, of connection with others and acting from that.
And in the end to prevail like Harry did.
So both for your own sake and also for the sake of all beings.
So I'll stop there with my reflections on this because I know you have some fans out here
who I'm sure have your own reflections or questions that you want to share too.
So let's see if anyone has any thoughts that you want to share.
If you have any questions about this or your own reflections as you've seen these movies,
read these books about the Dharma of Harry Potter.
Great. I think the mic's coming over to you.
Hello.
So in the beginning you started off with Harry Potter is not just popular in the US but internationally.
Could you explain or just extrapolate on how like this hero's journey fits internationally?
Yeah. I think the term of the hero's journey and that structure that I described is from a guy named Joseph Campbell
who was kind of an anthropologist of mythology.
So he actually studied myths through all different cultures and kind of pulled this out as like some general template for the hero's journey.
So I think it's from that that we can see that there's something universal about that story.
And like the Odyssey is an example in Greek mythology.
Or in South Asian studies there's the Ramayana and Mahabharata, also the hero's quest in some way.
I was thinking about other films even like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, I think is another one.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
So Charlie goes through this initiation and then there's a big piece of integrity in that too.
It's like who's going to get the Chocolate Factory in the end?
And then everyone else starts to fall out one by one because they succumb to greed,
like eating the giant blueberry or wanting the golden egg or pride or this or that.
And Charlie's about to be out also because he's stolen the one piece of everlasting gobstop or something.
And then in the end he actually just goes back and puts it on the desk and leaves it and that itself is like he's in.
So it seems like there's something very universal about this in many different cultures.
And I feel like that speaks to all of our desire and also the sense that there's something more than what we see here in our lives.
So Buddha described this also.
I feel like that's part of the description of this unsatisfactoriness about this mundane way of life.
Like is this all it is?
It's just like eat and sleep and commute and work and eat and sleep and commute.
Is that all it's about? Is that what we're supposed to do here and then die? Is that it?
Is there not something more in some way?
And it's interesting to read the stories from 2,600 years ago, even of the Buddha's time and of each of the monks and nuns and his own quest.
They all go through some sort of existential angst in this way, like about things.
And for me, someone who also works with leaders as a coach and consultant and things,
all of us are sort of on this quest in some way.
How can we bring forth that which is within us?
How can we each shine in this beautiful, unique manifestation of life that we are?
And not just for our individual glory, but actually for the betterment of everyone.
And just for the beauty of it being there, for the blooming of the flower, something like that.
So to me, it seems like it is very universal in that way.
And then, of course, the popularity of the films and the books also bears that out.
So I was actually in Japan when the last movie came out, the second to the last movie came out in October, November.
And yeah, it was all over in Tokyo and it was very popular there, it seems like.
Do you have any experience with that or are you just curious about it?
I've been in Brussels since last year.
Speaking to my friends about Harry Potter, it's pretty cool.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, there's something kind of universal.
And the interesting thing too is I feel like, you know, even in watching the movies and things,
it's not even Harry himself who's like the most likable character.
It's just kind of like the whole world and the whole configuration of things.
And I think this whole kind of hero's journey that he's on that's very inspiring.
So it both is like good entertainment and it's, you know, great special effects and it's, you know, all the stuff and the relationships.
But I think there's something deeper like that's, you know, pulling the popularity of this whole series that like we can all relate to.
Yeah, thank you.
Yeah.
Is there a microphone?
I don't really need a microphone.
Do they have a recording?
For the benefit of all who can hear this after.
I think also that there's something like that with women characters as well.
For example, Wizard of Oz, Dorothy, I think about her quite a bit, and even Alice in Wonderland.
And there's a similar theme in both of those.
I think both of them were reaching out for something else and thinking they had to go really far away from home to find it.
Right.
So I think the female quest for the heroine's journey is there too.
Yes, thank you. Thank you for bringing it up like that.
I was actually trying to like remove some of the gender stuff from Joseph Campbell's framework is very male in some ways.
So actually his thing about unconditional love is about the goddess and, you know, the temptation is about temptation of women and stuff like that.
So I feel like that's one framing, but I think you're absolutely right.
There's this other, there's a whole other field of characters that have this similar thing.
Yeah, I think one of the things that's really seductive about Harry Potter and about the Narnia books is that the other world is just a closet door away.
I mean, it's just there.
And for all of us, it's exciting to think, oh, if I just closed my eyes, I'm there.
And sometimes you are. So that's great.
And that's the truth.
Like that's partly what I'm trying to convey about this, like why I'm choosing to do a Dharma talk on it, not just because I like the books,
like it's actually there, you know, like this, this sense of magic or this sense of things not being as they seem, you know,
there's Zen saying like things are not as they appear nor are they otherwise, you know, both sides of that, right?
Both sides of that are true.
And when you actually start to pay attention, when you actually develop your concentration and are able to actually pay attention in a moment by moment
to what is reality. So the reality that we see is this series of experiences, series of moving experiences, changing experiences
in the realms of sight, sound, taste, smell, touch, and the mind, right?
The mind and ideas.
So being able to see those for exactly just what they are, it both breaks up the illusion, the magic of solidity of the world as we know it now.
But also it actually gives you access to something much greater, you know, beyond this changing show.
So what is there beyond what we think is there?
And also lets you see that the way that things appear solid, the way that things appear a certain way is not actually just how it is too.
So there is a way in which you can run through the columns, you know, there's a way in which you can do all this stuff, right?
Now I should bear mentioning to you that actually there is a way in which there's descriptions of various magical powers that you actually can develop through meditation, right?
That is not like commonly described or aspired for in 21st century America, but actually spiritual adept.
So if you want to develop the concentration powers of your mind to a very, very refined ability, right?
There is the ability to actually walk through walls.
There is the ability to actually move through space and time.
There is the ability to do all kinds of different things.
Now the Buddha never actually encouraged his people to spend that much time doing that because you can actually develop the concentration and also apply that to seeing into the nature of things and become free.
So he was always like what's better to do that.
In fact, there's some story of, you know, he was traveling with some of his monks and nuns across some river and then someone else from some other school was like levitating over the river, right?
And then, you know, his monks and I was like, man, how come you don't teach us to do that?
Why are we just, you know, taking the ferry across?
And he said, well, you know how much that's worth?
You know, like two gold farthings, like the price of the ferry, right?
So, you know, basically keep your eye on the ball.
Keep your eye on the ball of what we're up to here, right?
So you can like play games in samsara.
You can, you know, walk on this side of the wall and suffer here and you can walk through the wall and suffer there.
Or you can actually like bring that ability to bear on freeing yourself and others.
You know, but just to say like it is actually there, like, you know, there is that ability to cultivate those powers if you care to.
What I would take note of too is that the hero, such as Harry Potter, when he is successful in his journey and he brings not only his friends, but he saves Hogwarts.
He brings, I mean, so many people with him in his own success.
And I really relate to that too here because I'm finding that the deeper I get into my own practice, there are more people that I can draw into a more positive way of living their life as well.
People are asking, what are you doing? What's different?
You know, and so I think the practice brings others with it.
Yeah, I think it very much does and it's very much there in the story too.
And there's different times also in Harry's journey when he's like, I'm going to go it alone.
Like he tries to shake his friends and he's going to do it alone and he never can, right?
And his friends are so loyal, they basically tail him and help him even when he doesn't want them to.
So Ron and Hermione and all of his pals are like, no, we're here, we're in this with you.
And it also calls into question the role of like, who's saving who too?
You know, so Harry becomes a teacher and he teaches them all this patronum spell.
Like he teaches them this kind of loving kindness protection spell.
But then they all also become part of his gang and help him to do what it is that he needs to do.
So they become sort of Dumbledore's army and go out to fight together these plucky teens, right?
So it's very beautiful in that way.
And it's also that sense of sangha, that sense of community, right, coming together.
And Harry starts to recognize that too after a while.
You know, he's sort of like the, you know, they say the chosen one or the designated one and it's just like, oh, this is my role.
But it's definitely not him alone in that too, right?
Anyone else?
Sorry, I have so many questions.
So my question is in relation to the call.
So I work with children and teenagers who have diabetes and, you know, it's different for everybody.
And so some get it where, okay, I have to do this and that to control my blood sugars.
Others don't.
And I think the common thing is some come to some relation and they realize that they have some call and some don't have some call.
So is there, can a call be caused?
Is it natural?
What's, can you describe more about this call?
Yeah, I mean, that's a really good question in particular with something like that, right?
And some of it is just like our recognition of anything as a call.
So this is, this is the benefit of also leading some kind of life in which you have some, you know, spiritual life sometimes seems too lofty,
but like this life of learning, of growth, of development.
So you could see like some kids like they might take it, take it on and like, oh, this is the call.
And actually any struggle, suffering actually calls us to become more aware in that area.
So areas in which we've been asleep, it makes you wake up.
So like I know people who are diabetic and they're very aware of what they're eating, right?
It actually calls them to this different relationship with their body and with food and to be much more connected in that way, right?
And you could see it as that and then actually sort of take that on and that actually makes you a more awake person, a more connected person,
or it could just be like pure suffering and like why me and stuff like that, right?
So some of it is just in our attitude, I think, you know, like our own attitude towards whatever it is that comes up.
So if you think about anything that is a struggle for you in your life right now, right, or has been a struggle in the past, right?
And it could be like a physical challenge that you have, it could be a challenge with some person in your life who's, you know,
at the moment you're labeling a pain in the neck or difficult, it could be a struggle with some kind of situation that's going on,
like financial, emotional, whatever, right?
So all of this can be for us actually part of this call, like we can actually take this as a call, like calling us to a different level, right?
It's calling us to pay attention in a different way, it's calling us to learn, right?
And you might find this to be true that sometimes you try and ditch this call so you ignore it, you're like,
oh, I'm going to move away from this difficult person, I'm going to go over here, I'm going to leave this neighborhood and go over here,
I'm going to quit this job because this guy is difficult and then that guy turns up in another form over here, you know?
So the call is persistent, you know, it's sort of like until you learn what you need to learn or something, you know, that will keep on coming up.
And then once you master that, then the next thing comes, right?
The next thing comes and you gain in that sphere, right?
So in some ways I feel like it's that, that's one of the magical parts is that what seems to be just pure suffering becomes actually this great opportunity, right?
For stepping up and you can learn how to basically like compost all of the stuff that comes through your life, you know?
So then if things are good, they're good, you can enjoy them, and when things are difficult, you can learn to like churn that under,
like work with that, like learn and grow, right?
And I feel like I've seen this so much both in my own life and in working with others, you know, as a Dharma teacher, as a coach,
like people who've gone through incredibly difficult things in their life, right?
And you probably also know this, have met people or you yourself or someone like this.
So some people are just beaten down by life, you know, something difficult happens and terrible things happen to people, you know?
Some sorrow, it's very difficult, right?
So people are harmed, people are killed, right?
Terrible injustices happen.
And some people become like kind of bitter and beaten down by it, and other people sort of learn from that, grow from that prevail.
I think among the elements of that is one, getting out of the like, why me mentality, right?
So as long as someone's in this like, oh, it's just me and, you know, kind of very myopic vision of like, oh, why is this happening to me?
I'm suffering so much, right?
You don't see that actually like at the same time that that very thing is happening to you, it's happening to like millions of other people, you know?
Like it's not just you, that's actually this very like self-centered view that is habitually there for us, but that it's really helpful to see through, right?
So something like actually the template of the hero's journey I think is helpful to be able to see through that, to see like, oh yeah, this is a trial, right?
This is a difficulty along the way, and like step through that, right?
Like this is my call, like this is actually calling me to courage and to awareness, right?
Now granted, if you're in mopiness for a while, you know, so it goes and just recognize, okay, this is mopiness, this is like feeling disheartened, this is feeling like defeated by this, you know?
And then, you know, try and have compassion for yourself also, you know, try and cultivate compassion, but don't let yourself stay there forever if you can, you know?
That's where like you don't, you don't heed the call and you just kind of wallow in that, right?
And then there also I think is the interconnection, so which is there in the series too, of like the connection with others.
So not just the sense that I'm doing this for myself, but like, oh, actually as I do this I'm inspiring other people, or like I have the potential to inspire other people, right?
And as soon as you do that, then it takes you to another level, like you actually gain energy from those connections, right?
So that's also where as the question of like, well, who is the one who is giving and who is the receiver, right, in all of these cycles too, right?
So yeah, thank you for your question.
So we're actually coming to the end of our time here.
So I want to give you a little reflection to do for yourself on your hero's journey.
So what's being called of you right now?
Like what is your, what is your challenge in your life?
What is the thing that you're struggling with?
This could be in your practice, in your life.
What is this area that's some kind of edge for you?
And where are you in relationship to this?
So what's that like for you right now?
Are you trying to ignore it?
Are you struggling a lot?
Are you feeling defeated?
And what's the way that you can work with this differently?
So what's the way in which this dukkha, this challenge, this difficulty can become part of your path?
What is your call for learning in this?
Who are your guides who can inspire you?
People who you know are teachings.
And then can you also, like Harry, resolve to do your best to heed that call?
So to step over the threshold, to meet that challenge, to venture into that unknown.
So knowing that you have at your disposal these powers of metta, of loving kindness,
of your own integrity and goodness, and of your community, your friends, your loved ones,
and of all those who have been on the hero's journey in the past and in the future.
So you're part of that fellowship, that brotherhood and sisterhood, every single one of us.
So as we connect with the togetherness and the connections with others,
we can also reflect on our own goodness and doing our best today here in meditation
and listening to the Dharma and trying to understand.
And we can share these blessings with everyone here and with all beings.
So we can connect again with the goodness of our heart and share the merit from our practice.
May all beings be peaceful and happy.
May all beings be strong and healthy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be free from suffering.
So thank you so much for your attention and engagement today.
And I ask you also to support me on my journey too.
So I appreciate your donations that you make as I embark on the unusual path of Dharma teaching here in the 21st century.
And I'll stick around also if anyone has any questions or something that they didn't feel like they could say in the group also.
We can talk a little bit too.
Thank you.
