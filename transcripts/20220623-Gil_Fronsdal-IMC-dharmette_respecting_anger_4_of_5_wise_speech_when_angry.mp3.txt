The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So here we are at the fourth talk on anger, and today I want to talk a bit
about speaking when we are angry. It's one thing to be able to be by oneself
and to meditate and process the anger that way. It's another thing to manage
our anger wisely when we're in relationship to other people and you
need to talk and work and do things with others. And certainly I hope that the
whole mindfulness approach with emotions, with anger, and there's kind of
deeper looking at it, is supportive for how we engage in the world when we are
angry. So the mindfulness approach to anger is an alternative to expressing the
anger, acting it out, venting it. Catharsis, venting anger is usually not very
helpful. It's helpful for people who have very deep repressed anger and never
get a chance to have it come to the surface, then maybe going to a safe
location like in the forest and you know express the anger to a tree or
something where there's no one or or alone in your room, just to kind of
finally get it up to the surface so you can address it. But generally venting
and anger, cathartic expression of anger, more often than not tends to strengthen
the anger, make more of it and make it grow. And that's why venting
anger to other people that you might feel is usually kind of productive because
it tends to put fuel in itself. The classic Buddhist teaching around
anger is that anger is a fire that burns the person who has it. And so with
venting, you know, the externality of the venting sometimes doesn't allow
the venter to feel the cost, the burning, but in fact it's tremendously costly for
the person who is venting anger. It's not really a release of
pressure. And then, so then one end, you know, expressing the anger or
venting the anger is usually not suggested. Repressing the anger is also not
healthy. This can create tremendous amount of problems and usually it's
counterproductive and sooner or later there may be an explosion or the anger,
the resentment kind of sees out in unseen ways. So the alternative I'd like to
suggest for today between expressing anger and repressing it is managing the
anger. So knowing that we're angry and finding the tools, how to be with the
anger that we have so that it doesn't need to be expressed and it doesn't
need to be repressed. And what we can do is we can learn to interact with other
people having the anger somehow healthily managed. So one of the things, one
way to manage the anger is not to automatically give into it but have an
alternative place, a way of being with anger than giving into it. And one of
those ways is to be rooted, grounded, stable in ourselves. To have cultivated
habit, a strong skill set in being connected to the physical body, to be
able to be grounded in the physical body, to take a stable posture in the
physical body, to learn how to manage the agitation of the body, the restlessness
of the body, the emotional pressures that arise in the body, to be
able to hold them in the body. And this is phenomenally useful that we are
learning through mindfulness practice to expand our capacity to experience
difficult emotions. If the capacity is small then the difficult emotions spill
over or explode or become detrimental. But we're learning steadily in this
practice to expand our capacity to hold more and more difficult emotions
including anger. And one of the ways to hold it, to be with it, is to really drop
into the body, feel the body, feel the stability of the body and let the anger
be felt as part of the body, as opposed to we becoming the anger, identifying
with the anger, which is a very difficult state to be in. If anything we
identify with the body and the anger is a subset of it. And then as we manage
the anger, if we have a little bit of ability to investigate, to look inside,
to understand the characteristics of the anger, is it something that's really
unique to a current incident or is there a long history of resentment, of
complaining, of indignation, of stress connected to how we're feeling now? This
is just a continuation of a long pattern. In fact, there might even be a kind of a
continuous chronic feeling of irritation, that we annoyance, that's very
regardless if we're with others or not. And it's just that that annoyance, a
chronic annoyance, irritation, resentment, has it sometimes, now it's getting kind
of a big wave is being formed of it. The little wave is always moving across the
ocean and maybe it's going across a shoal and now it's being raised up and
really big. If it's chronic, we might relate to it very differently than if
it's just the incident in the moment. Because incidents in the moment is
where maybe there's real danger. And so if anger is a symptom of a danger, so
there's a problem going on, that then if you recognize what the problem is, then
maybe there's less need to be angry. Then we can maybe find ways to address the
problem. And this is where mindful speech is phenomenally useful, to learn how to
speak mindfully. And one of the ways to speak mindfully is again to be rooted in
the body, to have a stability of body as we speak, so that we can track what we're
saying. We might even be able to track what we're about to say. It's because
we're managing all this, not to repress anything, but so the best parts of
ourselves come out. It's really managing ourselves so we can stay free, not
managing ourselves so we bottle ourselves up. It might feel like we're
free or if we just vent our anger and just speak, spew out what we're feeling,
but that's not really freedom. That's really a loss of freedom, even though
there's a release and kind of ease in which things are spilling out of us. The
managing is to stay close to that place where there's a deeper wisdom that's
free, deeper connectivity, deeper choice as possible. And so to learn to speak,
connect it to the body, being aware of what's happening here. The other is, if
again, if there is an opportunity to pay a little bit of attention, and
this becomes second nature, the more we are mindful of speech in ourselves, is
to be careful why you're speaking. What's the motivation? What are you
accomplishing with a speech? Some speech, it's only our daggers were throwing at
other people to hurt them. Some speech is to try to solve the problem. Some
speech is to try to give a message to someone that what they're doing is not
acceptable, but it's very different between letting them know in strong terms.
You can't do this versus some kind of statement that says you're a
terrible person using some horrible language to say that, attacking them
and throwing swear words at them perhaps. So what's the purpose of the
language? Is it to hurt the person? Is it to problem-solve? Is it to be able to let
the person know what we're feeling? And then the content of what we say is
important. And one thing that's very helpful is, at times, is to learn the
art of eye statements. I was once, many years ago, I was a TA in college for the
chair of the department, and he was treating me in some kind of way that
was not appropriate, maybe as a servant in something, and asked me to do all
kinds of things and putting pressure on me and demands that were unreasonable. And
I got furious at him, but I had enough sense to know this is not a person to
yell at or be angry at, but I didn't want to repress it. I felt this
needs to be addressed. So I went to him and I stood there and I was kind of
shaking because I was so angry, and I made eye statements. I said things like
what I'm experiencing now, given what you said and what you're asking me to do,
is I feel really hurt. I feel really upset, and it was obvious that I was. I
wasn't saying anything about him and what he did. I was just saying the impact
it had on me, and that was all I needed to do. He backed down, he understood the
impact, he understood what he had done, and then the whole thing became a lot
better. And so to sometimes sharing the impact, sometimes it's powerful to tell
people, when you did X, I feel afraid now. Some people kind of, when they
realize what the impact they had like that, they switch and change as opposed to
yelling at them, and then they yell back, and then the whole thing escalates. And
the idea is to learn how to speak in ways where the speaking de-escalates
our own anger, where it diffuses it. And the wonderful, I like maybe slightly
pronounced differently, but the two meanings of diffuse is to kind of
settle out, spread out, so it's weaker, thinner, less concentrated, and to take
the fuse out of a bomb. So diffuse. We're diffusing our anger. We're tracking
ourselves so we know, we get a feedback that we're actually maybe speaking in a
way that's increasing the level of the anger, rather than decreasing it. I've
been angry at someone once, some years ago, and I asked to meet with a
person privately, so we did, and we talked for a while, and then after a
while, I could feel myself getting even more upset. And so I asked if we could
have a timeout. Can we just sit here quietly for a few minutes, and the
person was a practitioner, so that was fairly easy enough to agree to. And then
when, you know, after a few minutes of breathing and being present, then I was
ready to continue the conversation. I was not in a good place to have the
conversation until I had had the couple of minutes of silence. So to track
ourselves, to manage ourselves, to be able to manage the conversation and find
a balance, and find how to speak and what to speak, how not to attack people
when we speak, which is so easy to do when we're angry, but to speak in ways
that try to get the job done that needs to be done that's appropriate. To be
careful that we're not spilling over. Things have nothing to do with them.
Chronic resentments, chronic hurt that we're carrying with us can bring a lot
of pressure along that we we're not really taking care of the situation at
hand, as we're somehow giving expression to age-old resentment that we're
carrying that we're frustrated with and is coming out. So in these few minutes I
have, those are the ideas that I'm offering. So here the primary one I want
to leave you with is two ideas. One is manage your anger and manage it with
discovering some stability within. Always look for the stability you can. And
the other is start looking exploring and being wise about how you speak, because
sometimes we have to speak when we're angry. And maybe today, if you have an
occasion to be angry, you're irritated or annoyed, or you want to complain, don't
complain. Don't express annoyance. Don't send barbs to people. Rather, consider
what you can say. That's maybe an eye statement that maybe is supportive in
the situation that's appropriate for the situation. Take care of something that
takes care of you and the other person. If the person hasn't done the dishes one
more time, don't kind of yell at them. Just kind of say, wow. And here we are
again. The dishes aren't being done. What's happening? Or it's very discouraging. I
feel so discouraged to see the sink full of dishes again. And leave it at that.
See what happens. Something, the point being, find ways to speak when you're
angry. Develop the skill and the wisdom to be able to do that so that your
speech is healthy and wise in circumstances when you're angry. So
thank you. And we'll have one more talk on anger tomorrow. Thank you.
