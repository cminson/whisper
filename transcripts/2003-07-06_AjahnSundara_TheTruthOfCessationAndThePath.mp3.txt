 So can you hear me all right? Yes? So this is our last session What kind of feeling what kind of feelings arise Attachment relief Sanders joy Interesting And during this last few days you've really been able to witness the amount of Changes that has taken place in yourself How many How many feelings have a reason how many stories how many memories how many You know how many things have come up in the mind and disappeared Even if you wanted to conjure them up again you You might not even be able to how much you will you'll try That which a reason which arose two or three days ago. It's sometimes it's gone You know trying to remember it trying to remember feelings I mean the feelings are that which really Catches so Painfully sometimes feelings emotions And yet, maybe you had a very strong emotion two or three days ago, and you try to recall that feeling and it's gone So You have tasted in a way the the experience of cessation Yesterday I was talking to you about the first noble truth Dukkha the second noble truth Samudaya the cause of suffering and Then the cause of suffering the understanding of the cause of suffering takes us to the realization of near Oda cessation You may be aware that there is a the first Teaching that the Buddha gave was the could a job Dama check up our tennis utta the sutta of the turning of the wheel of Dhamma In which he expands the teaching of the vulnerable truth And it's very clearly Stated how we use those truths How we use the recognition of Dukkha Dukkha has to be understood Some with Ia has to be abandoned the cause of suffering has to be abandoned Neruda has to be realized that's the place of insight Such a catabang Should be such a means the truth Should made should be made true to oneself. So it's not a matter of believing anymore in cessation of Thinking about cessation is seeing directly cessation As my teacher used to say if you think that the end of the path The goal of the past is to realize that everything ceases is not self This is not you. This is just suffering Sounds rather dreary doesn't it as a prospect for the future our future life The idea of deceasing constantly with nothing left Doesn't kind of Stir up the stirs up the heart does it doesn't inspire the heart If I said to you the blossoming the growing the developing the increasing the progress look at that Louis size has already its eyebrows are really risen up two or three inches upward You know cessation you really start looking kind of oh god, what is she talking about? But really cessation is not so attractive as a Practice people want the truth. They want liberation Haven't realized that it only happens through the understanding direct insight into the truth of sensation That's the place of letting go When you've let go and seen what happens when you let go seen clearly what happens when you let go Then you can have you have a chance to realize cessation now most of us are fascinated by the arising of Conditions by the beginning of things by the the birth, you know, it is a little baby We can all rejoice when the baby was born. We kind of go gaga goo-goo of a little baby You know do that with an old person. That's not quite the feeling that arise naturally in the heart is it? And then we don't go gaga goo-goo of a no granny or you know Isn't it cute So birth even in nature you can see there's an immediate kind of response is I'm wanting to Rejoice wanting to celebrate But as many Dharma teachers said the celebration should be more at death, you know Roses and birth because birth is being reborn into the realm of suffering a realm of trial and tribulation and So neurodah the truth of the third noble truth is Probably the most important, you know the on the path of realization. That's why realization takes place It's the neurodah. It's a cessation of attachment the cessation of wrong view the cessation of suffering caused by our clinging to Anything it's a cessation of unskillful behavior So how we how do we realize this how do we see you know First of all, I think it's important to know the obstacle that prevents us from seeing the cessation Once you Begin to witness in your everyday life how much you want to be born all the time How much you want to be? To begin again, you know, it's like our society encourages us to do to go into that mode all the time, you know The whole culture is just run on being born into something new better richer You know some constant, you know It's a culture that is you know worshipping birth Doesn't care much about death when you die with this birth Calls you you're being called in if you're attached to diet to death and you become depressed you become You know you feel sad you feel undermined you feel victimized That's birth and death you have the birth Oh a new car Oh a new job Oh a new partner a new friend a new dog and you whatever is new a new train of thought a new insight even So we attach to that we get happy and elated and inspired and Then we haven't seen that this attachment will lead us to death and Death is this when the attachment to inspiration Goes what we are left is Desperation or disappointment we just get disappointed we get inspired and then disappointed Now when you to see the cessation in that particular context Let's say we feel inspired and then we feel dispirited Disappointed depressed and so on Cessation will be to notice those feelings when they arise To notice the suffering of being attached to inspiration for example Because if we attach to inspiration We want things always to go well because inspiration goes with the feeling of happiness the feeling of uplift But life is not an ongoing Uplift is it just Have to watch the news every day don't have to go very far how how much we can keep our life being uplifted forever, you know But certainly what we can do all the time when we Put our attention to it is that we can realize a dumber realization of dumber Let us let us be taught by life. Let us learn from life let us receive life as a teaching as a way of maturing and realizing more deeply the truth of cessation and When I want to reiterate the fact that when we say cessation is a cessation of the conditioned diluted mind And of course because that's all we know we think that if I leave I let that go there will be there won't be nothing Nothing left of me, you know Yet you've already seen how many drummers just in your life you let go you still bursting was life onto you How many attachment you had you let go over the years you haven't Disappeared have you you haven't vanished from this from the planet? Because you let go of whatever, you know, whatever was a problem for you maybe ten five years ago Something you thought you can never live without You felt you could die if you lived without and yet survived as my teacher would say Is there he's always came to the point in his practice where he will say I can't bear it this I can't I can't The attachment to wanting things to go away you know wanting to Whatever it was can't bear it, you know, whatever Whatever you would apply that thought, you know, I can't bear it and then he would say but I noticed I could always bear it If I was patient enough was that thought I can't bear it the next moment. I was still burying it And the next moment and the next moment So We often come to that point in life or just in a meditation session of meditation, you know where you feel I can't bear that anymore You might not manifest as a thought but it's intense feeling in the gut that is informing the brain get out It's just a movement in your guts and just say out I'm out Constantly and so Sensation for you know, if you really want to realize dumb not then you have to stay with that feeling that wants to You know push away. What is unpleasant? Clean to the ID of pleasant ID like when you sit and you feel I can't bear that anymore I just can't bear that pain. I can't bear that train of thought. I've seen a hundred time. I'm fat. I'm had enough Heard this 20 times. I've had enough You know just to be able to say, okay, I've heard you But I still can bear it. I can bear it and Then you find if you do that long enough then it ceases because attachments is dependent on conditions It's dependent of being averse to something or being attracted to something. That's how attachment thrives You Right. So if you're just observing witnessing then suddenly there is no fuel for attachment to be there And what is left is? peacefulness Who wants peace We want peace sure that's great So we need to get a taste for it This is an acquired taste in our culture. Not only our society is committed totally worshiping birth But it's also worshiping distractions. It's worshiping Confusion the more confused you are the more discontent you will be the more you will buy I Used to say when I when I was teaching once the five hindrances when I was living in England I said our society it was we theme was a hit the five hindrances and I Used to I told the people you know that actually, you know We are here to practice to understand the five hindrances and let them go and and you know and see the end of the five hindrances The arising and then understanding the nature of an each other canata but our society is totally Again the total commitment to developing and cultivating the five hindrances. Have you noticed that? You are taught daily to cultivate Love and hate if you want to know those who don't know the five hindrances love and hate Sloss into opera restlessness and worry and doubt Okay So all the billboards are about making you want something Comparing with some of something else so that you can dislike one brand and like another one a better one it makes you doubt all the time because You have so many choice that you you're paralyzed with choices We don't know which way to turn it makes you worry and restless because you keep being bombarded with You keep being we keep we keep being brainwashed with the idea that what we got now is not enough We don't have enough of this or that We don't know enough. We don't have enough PhDs We don't have enough Money, we don't have enough good health even though we are much better health and many people around the world still We're complaining about our health You know, this is not what you want even to hear but this is what we keep being brainwashed with this kind of notions of that brings that breeds discontent ongoing You know, so it's very important to know what is this brainwashing system that we are part of you know That doesn't want us to cease to to witness any cessation but want us to be born again and again and again through discontent And somebody at once asked me well, how do I work as my discontent I said well just be content with your discontent Just begin the way you are so to speak, you know, don't try to find another teacher to work with a discontent Don't try to find another New therapist to find you know, just be content with that experience of discontent. Just be at peace with that basically To start looking at it where you are While others and saying oh, there's something wrong with me I think my mother didn't give me enough love when I was young and my I had a bad school Experience and my boyfriend, you know, he was nasty when I was 18 and other You know and I wasn't capable of doing this and that my Goes on and on and on and on, you know Ah, it's exhausting just to think about it But you know that we do that all the time to ourselves You know, I had a very good insight was a Jungian retreat recently Something very simple which he was very very clever of him. He made us count very loudly within ourselves without speaking Just count he said using thoughts. He was saying when you think thoughts when you feel thought everybody thought I feel thought here You know, they say well Try this out and feel where thought arises So maybe we can do this experiment right now, okay close your eyes And just count very very loudly up to ten Finished okay. Where was the source of rising? Can you point on your body which part of the body was a sort of rising? There you go, oh Louis you're unusual what you've been doing with your chakras So we have to have a bit of work to do so this is happening here, isn't it? For whom beside Louis it wasn't happening here Well, it's the same thing on this. Yes that area What was it happening in your jaw right was a bit of work to do Okay, yes, well Oh, I see you heard it in your ears, okay, do you want to show we do it again one more time? Yeah, okay. Let's do it again loud Don't think to say it I Feel your whole body is saying it Okay, what was it? Yeah, so most of us yeah Most of us well, we have different parts of our body that resonate with thinking, you know and But what really Struck me was that really we feel it here a lot. This is where thoughts is experienced and When we experience thinking here you realize how much weight is held here how much burden we carry around the heart here You notice when you speak to yourself gently and softly like either in prayers or in Meditation is just repeating a gentle word peace or something without too much resistance Then it soothes the heart doesn't it? It's like the heart the thought that arises in the heart is soothing and calming and appeasing, you know So what the inside I had was really interesting for me is like how many times do we carry on a lot of negativity or You know a lot of heavy thoughts You know coming from the sort of sadness or sort of you know that comes from You know so that sorry not so that comes from the food that gives rise to sadness to Jealousy to anger to frustration to irritation to whatever, you know to Desire to overpower people the desire to know sorts of things these are to compete So all these thoughts are resonating in the heart here. Now you understand why we say she or he has a burden heart It's like this cave of resonance, you know echoing here And that's really the inside is that how much we have no excuse me and Unless you have a physical it's actually We'll talk about that later You know excuse to light down unless you have a physical real physical problems. Okay, so This the fact that he resonates in the heart You know just to realize how much we carry around and that incentive to really be kind to oneself You know it brought in me a deeper commitment to really be kind and gentle with this heart Because this is our body in a way that's what is holding us together alive And a lot of the time we may not be able to avoid You know the resultant karma that we have you know of anger. I mean all the negative mental states I mentioned just now we may not be able to you know, this is just what's happening to us. We can't avoid it We can't repress it. We can't move out of the kami predicament. We are a part of But at least we can begin to receive things gently And that takes a lot of work doesn't it? Receive things with a we say I mean you've heard this many time with a compassionate heart with compassion with loving kindness with gentleness And So to go back to cessation it's like when you have to bear with things which are difficult Most of the time we have a number of way of dealing with that we resist We want to Cut it out of our experience whatever is unpleasant and difficult to bear We want to distract ourself Ignore it Or we criticize ourself we bring up the judge Thou shall be whatever You notice how we deal we have numbers of ways which are so heavy to the heart That we can't see anything. That's why cessation is very rarely experienced Because to experience cessation you need a peaceful heart You need really to be able to see clearly what's happening without any reactions if there is any reaction it start being confusing Things become confused like let's say you are You're going through a period of depression or sadness If you are if you really want to see the cessation of that you have to give yourself a chance You know don't give up on yourself Give yourself a chance by allowing the heart to feel that experience Peacefully so it understands When you're connected and you feel and you look at it with a peaceful heart you understand more clearly see Our mode of understanding things is often complete out of sync with the truth out of sync with Dhamma So instead of we try to understand conceptually we try to You know understand through creating a self that's caused this cause our problems that has is a culprit of our misery So we go back into a deluded mode again and again create a self We try to solve our problem with a sense of self So there's a bad self that needs to be solved and then a good self that is good again That is going to come and rescue the bad self, you know, or we project it We can certainly we make somebody else the fault of the misery that we experience we project it out So there is another way the way of cessation is a way that leads to the ending of Division the ending of suffering and the ending of misapprehension and the realization of truth So This is what I was talking about this morning. Remember when I said you have to go through that little tunnel Well, you feel uncomfortable Not very at ease but This is a place where you need to have confidence in what we call in Buddhism the refuges Which is another topic and I could talk about it all day My favorite topics The refuges which is not just a devotional sort of mumbling, you know the Buddha Dhamma Sangha I take refuge Buddha Dhamma Sangha. It's not a kind of You know another thing to believe It's refuge in the awakened mind in the mind that is potential that is awake when you're mindful This is your refuge in the Buddha the Buddha nature When you are in touch with Dhamma that you refuge in the truth Seeing things as they are as Anicha you can begin simply Anicha Dukkhaanata seeing not believing and the refuge in the Sangha which is a refuge in the qualities of the enlightens and enlightened disciples of the Buddha the Buddha himself the fact that we can develop the same quality and realize in the same way and Purify the heart in the same way. That's it to have a confidence that there is a possibility of awakening the possibility of Realizing the truth and the police possibility of purifying the heart. This is your refuge now. You don't have anything else If you don't take refuge in the sense of self in the in a misapprehension That creates constant yourself, then you have to have another thing to rest in and your rest is refuges You know and they are very much part of yourself is not these words are pointers You know there is no now you don't take refuge in following desires through impulses of Motivated by greed and heated and delusion now you take refuge in observing the desire in Studying the desire in understanding desire So you can see the difference don't you? Between taking refuge in self and take a refuge in the stripper gems When that's the only way you can realize cessation As soon as long as you take refuge in a sense of self then there's agitation there is reaction There is pain there is suffering Simple you can't you can see that pain in suffering When you take refuge in the Buddha the awakened mind the Dharma the truth and the Sangha the purity of your own heart you understand so From cessation we go on to the fourth noble truth cessation that leads to peace that is to the ending of Clinging attachment and a realization of peace the fourth noble truth is a passive practice the noble eightfold pass And That is a path that begins with right view right understanding Right view right understanding in Pali Samadhi seeing things in accord with Dhamma not in accord with delusion, but in accord with Dhamma and and If I was reading this earlier on once you have right view then everything falls into place Once you have seen you know that Clinging to suffering breeds more suffering Letting go of suffering leads to in the ending of suffering you can just begin with that with that paradigm Don't need to go very far you don't need a very complicated teaching to realize the ending of Avijja delusion Right view there's a canonical you know explanation of right view but Right view really it's understanding the four noble truths You know it's understanding that there is suffering there's a cause there's an ending and there's a path that keeps you on-track to keep on realizing the ending of suffering So right view when you have an understanding of this and you go to right Thought right intention because this intention in the Buddhist teaching is divided into three aspects its intention to renounce to let go the intention to The intention to Be kind and compassionate You know it's stated in the tea in the teaching it's nikama renunciation non-ill will and non cruelty These are the three aspects of right intention So we take refuge in that in the in developing cultivating right intention Of course all our intention all the intention that we meet in our everyday life in our meditation in worldly Have very little to do with those three intentions But these remember this is this is a reference point So you begin to let go by reminding yourself that your intention is to let go Your intention is to simplify things your intention is to not act on thought of cruelty and to not act on thoughts of ill will And you're not supposed to get it right straight away You know This is a pass of humidity. It's a pass that shows you how many times you get it wrong in fact So you have no doubt Of who you are However enlightened you think you have been and how many insights you think you've had how many meditation retreats you think you've done And how many teachers you've met? How many you know connection with the divine powers you've done you've made Still if you still think with a thought that is cruel Unkind violent and greedy That's why you are For the time being you know you still got some work to do in other words So Right intention right intention We just naturally to write action right speech right livelihood The first two correspond to the pania aspect of the past the wisdom aspect of the past right intention so it write understanding or right view and leading to right intention and then right the the next three refers to the Ethical or the moral aspect of the path Right livelihood right action right speech and right livelihood So this is a moral aspect of the past the ethical aspect where you have to you know, which come which include the precepts The five precepts of refraining from killing stealing lying sexual misconduct and Taking drugs and intoxicant which leads to carelessness but really It's also The aspect of the practice which are related to our body actions and speech Okay So right action right speech right livelihood Without we don't have a lot of time to go into details. You can find this in many books But just to say that the whole Spirit of those three aspect is really Compassion harmlessness respectful life Respectful oneself and all beings Which manifests as speech as actions and In the way in the your own profession to what you do in everyday in your everyday life You know So just to know to pay attention to that The the you know, you can get very bogged down in you know by the details that you find in written in books But you know books sometimes makes us really lazy Because we just don't want to do the work ourselves We don't want to tap into the wisdom that we already have and do our own work so to speak You know in the forest tradition The the spirit of training was you just left to simmer in your own stuff for days and months Until you understand yourself. You don't go and see the teacher every five minutes The idea of being taught is that you just stay there in the soup for a while until wisdom arises understanding arises and You know, you don't need anybody to you know, you have no doubt anymore the end of doubt because you know yourself and That can never leave you. It's like it's part of you, you know So he I encourage you to really reflect yourself Rousen to always go back to all these Dharma books that are right that are around That feel your brains with lots of more thoughts More concept more ideas that then makes you feel inspired for a few minutes and then you're back into the trenches again Trenches Yes, you know of misery and self-pity and in adequacy and all the rest of it So people say how do I empower myself? just learn how to Come to that place of direct experience You know without direct experience, there's no empowerment You just still have the mercy of any old body that comes along and say, you know this center this this and that You you without experience and every teacher will make you more Mind-boggled, you know Confused doubtful, but when you have the experience then, you know And they can even When you hear somebody you can hear beyond the words, you know, so bogged down by words anymore You know, you can actually hear the wisdom of somebody beyond concepts So To This three aspects of Sheila or Sheila in Sanskrit Sheila virtue That once you you know The Buddha said the reason why we cultivate see lies so that so that our mind can be free from remorse and regrets So simple, isn't it? So obvious When we act as carefully by speech and by body then our mind is full of remorse and regret full of anxiety worry restlessness and so on So just let it sink down a bit, you know and daily you can your own reflection The Buddha asked us to do a bit of work, you know, not just to wait for people to speed to spoon spoon feed us So that we have nothing to do and just get the result without moving the little finger as we see Has work to do and That we once the body is more calm because it's less Anxiety and remorse and regret then that comes down our whole body all the stress that we get from Not acting skillfully in life is Decreases even the pain in the body goes Just through acting more ethically compassionately kindly wisely and so on and Once you know and as we become as we become more calm and at peace with ourselves The meditation aspect which are the three last links of the Noble Eightfold Path Right effort right media right concentration or right mindfulness Then you know that comes much more easily when there's a foundation of peace in our heart You know if you're restless confused miserable upset doubtful conflicted Consist still for a moment. Can you? You see people when they are in a state of agitation they Can't it's not one meditation will be an offense to them Sitting still will be offensive So The Noble Eightfold Paths sometimes described as see last summer deep Anya the last one the last three were the Samadhi aspect Which doesn't mean just concentration you mean all the aspect of? meditation you know effort concentration and mindfulness And Effort is something that is really important to consider very important because we fritter our life's energy often without knowing it We let it fritter away in the squander it As if we had endless Endless energy But most of us here are pretty middle-aged somehow I mean not everybody but got a few of us and we knew as we get older that we don't have the same Come tap into the same source of energy We had to be much more careful in fact. I realized that when I was just in my early 33 32 31 That's what actually brought me to the dumb. I is when I realized that I had a lot of energy and I was not using it properly You know skillfully and I wanted to Not that I didn't want to but I wanted to but I did not know how to do it So when I find the passive practice, and it became absolutely it's clear as crystal to me. That was the way to to transform energy or to use one's energy so that My life will be a better experience and life of others will too So Meditation deals with the mind itself so see lies more specifically addresses physical action and verbal actions and the meditation deals with the mind directly I'm seeing carefully what goes on in the mind This is what you've been doing you've been very Brave really most people are having lots of fun out there, and then you're just sitting on your you know sitting and sitting walking doing this slow walking meditation and having to listen to me all day and I Listen to your mind all day. That's quite takes courage doesn't it to have to bear with your own mind You know to bear with your you know with your own thinking that just goes on and on and on and on forever so This is what meditation you might not see the result now, but don't be attached to results because That's again going back into a self-mood Going back into a wrong view You know don't expect results You will know result give yourself five or ten years To really appreciate the result of your life I Was impressed with Mitra do you mind if I tell anybody your age? It's all right see the result of somebody would leave the good life Well you I don't maybe anyway Mitra looks much younger than he is You see this is a result of a good life 75 Nobody will know This is what happens when you leave skillfully your life You know doesn't mean that you always do that you know I Don't shower sick at the age of 65. I think of 61 even you know He lost he had a stroke And he was never able to speak again to community it again for 10 years His students took care of him day and night 24 hours a day for 10 years That's what I mean don't expect results But you know that when you leave a good and ethical good life with consciousness with mindfulness Your old age certainly will be You know improved Life will improve the quality of your life will improve So now we come to the end you've had the first novatrous second certain fourth and And It's up to you to apply those teachings in your everyday life So that instead of spending a whole day thinking about stupid things you might as well think about the teachings That will help you in this a while people might say well I mean why is it you have to think so much and reflect and do a lot of this and a lot of that but you know as one Thai teacher said in Thailand We spend a great part of our life Thinking in a way that are actually harmful to us most of the time without we don't even know it Ask somebody to do a mindfulness practice with the breath for one minute and the whole system goes out of goes crazy You see how much our addiction to delusion is strong It was wonderful This teaching, you know, she's a very enlightened women teacher and it's so true We spend a lot of our time doing all sorts of thing that actually harming our life But we don't we do it without qualms As soon as we are asked to do something just a little bit skillful, you know Like be more mindful a bit more giving a bit more generous a bit more thoughtful You know, how am I going to do that? You know, I haven't got time How can I sit I have no time to do that plenty of time to watch TV though or plenty of time to listen to your CDs But you know that just keep piling up brain and you know and stressful brainwaves into your brain channels but One moment of silence mindful is sitting. It's like I've got to do this. I've got to do something else more important You see this is why they would I is called a physician of the mind because really we have to deal with a serious illness called illusion But it's alright it's not what we are that's the news we're not deluded we just believe we are We then we just attach to this condition for so long that we believe that's what we are But the teaching is very hopeful it says you're not this miserable lump of delusion You are more than that You know there is brightness says in fact, I'm going to read you a little passage from a ginger To end you know there is more to this and that's just the Find it You So This is an experience for my juncture It's high time. We started to meditate Meditate to understand to abandon to relinquish and to be at peace It's difficult to put it into words, but it's as if somebody wanted to get to know me They have to come and leave here. It talks about his monastery eventually with daily contact We would get to know each other I Used to be a wandering monk I travel by foot to visit teachers and seek solitude I didn't go around giving them a talks I went to listen to the Dama talks and of the great Buddhist masters of the time I Didn't go to teach them. I listened to whatever advice they had to offer Even when young or junior monks try to tell me what the Dama was I listened patiently However, I rarely got into discussions about the Dama I couldn't see the point in getting involved in length lengthy discussions Whatever teaching teachings I accepted I took on board straight away Directly where they pointed to reno sorry Whatever teaching I accepted I took on board straight away Directly where they pointed to renunciation and letting go what I did I did for renunciation and letting go We don't have to become experts in the scriptures We are getting older with every day that passes and every day we pants is on a mirror mirrored missing the real thing Practicing the Dama is something quite different than studying it I don't criticize any of the wide varieties of meditation style and techniques as long as we understand their true purpose and meaning They are not wrong However Calling ourselves Buddhist meditators, but not strictly following the monastic code of discipline. You could say the five precepts for you Wait in my opinion never meet with success Why because we try to bypass a vital section of the past skipping over virtue Samadhi or wisdom some people may tell you not to get attached to the serenity of samatha meditation Don't bother with samatha advanced straight to the wisdom and insight practices of vipassana As I see it if we attempt to detour straight to vipassana will find it impossible to successfully complete the journey Don't forsake the style of practice and meditation techniques techniques of the eminent forest masters such as variable Ajahn man sao tungra upali The path they taught is utterly reliable and true If we do it the way they did it if we follow in their footsteps will gain true insight into ourselves Ajahn shah Care for his virtue Impackably it was fully enlightened being cared for his virtue impeccably He didn't say we should bypass it If this great masters of the forest tradition recommended practicing meditation and monastic etiquette in a particular way Then out of this respect for them We should follow what they thought if they said to do it then do it if they said to stop because it's wrong Then stop we do it out of faith the confidence. We do it with an unwavering sincerity and determination We do it until we see the Dhamma in our own hearts Until we are the Dhamma, this is what the forest masters thought their disciples Consequently developed profound respect Oh and affection for them because it was through their following their paths that they saw What their teachers saw? Give it a try do it Just like I say if you actually do it you'll see the Dhamma be the Dhamma if you actually undertake the search What would stop you the defilements of the mind will be one vanquished if you approach them with the right strategy? be someone who renounces let go renounces One with frugal with words with content with little and were abundance all views and opinions stemming from self-importance and conceit You will then be able to listen to anyone patiently Even with if what they are saying is wrong. You will also be able to listen patiently to people when they are right Examine yourself in this way. I assure you it's possible if you try Scholars however rarely rarely come and put the Dhamma into practice There are some but they are a few it's a shame The fact that you've made it this far and have come to visit is already a worse of praise It shows inner strength. So monastery also in car is probably talking to a group of scholarly monks Only encourages studying the monks study and study and on and on with no end in sight and never cut that which need to be cut They only study the word peace But if you can't stop still then you will discover something of real value. This is how you do research This research is truly valuable and completely immobile It goes straight to what you've been reading about If scholars don't practice meditation, however, their knowledge has little understanding Once they put the teaching into practice those things that they have studied about them become vivid and clear So stop practicing Develop this type of understanding Give living in the forest a try and come come stay in one of these tiny hearts Etc. Etc. I'm Telling you it's great fun to closely observe how the mind works I could happily talk about the subject of the whole day When you get to know the way of the mind you'll see how this process functions and how it kept going through being brainwashed by the mind's impurities and I see the mind as merely a single point Psychological states are guests who come to visit this spot Sometimes this person come to call sometimes that person pays a visit They they come to the visitor center train the mind to watch and know them all with the eyes of alert awareness This is how you care for your heart and mind whenever a visitor approaches your wave you wave them away If you forbid them to enter they are where are they going to sit down? There is only one seat and you're sitting in it Spend the whole day in this one spot spot of mindfulness This is a Buddha's firm and unshakable awareness. It watches over and protects the mind. You are sitting right here Since the moment you emerge from the womb every visitors that has that's ever come to call has arrived right here. No matter how often they come they always come to this spot Right here knowing them all the Buddha awareness sits alone firm and unshakable those visitors journey here Seeking to exert influence to condition and sway your mind in various ways Then they succeed in getting the mind entangled in their issues psychological states arise Whatever the issue is whatever it seems to be leading just forget it. It doesn't matter simply know who the guests are as they arrive Once they've dropped by they will find that they are only there is only one share and as long as you are occupying it they will have no place to sit down They come thinking to fill your ear with gossip But this time there's no room for them to sit next time they come there will be also be no chair free No matter how many times this chattering visitors show up They always meet the same fellow sitting in the same spot. You haven't budged from that chair How long do you think they will continue to pop up with this to put up with this situation? In just speaking to them you get to know them thoroughly Everyone and everything you ever known since you began to explain the world will come for a visit Simply observing and being aware right here is enough to see the Dharma entirely You discuss observe and contemplate by yourself This is how you discuss Dharma. I don't know how to talk about anything else I can continue on speaking in this fashion, but in the end, it's nothing but talking and listening I recommend you actually go and do the practice if you have to look for yourself You'll encounter certain experience. Well, if this is we can stop there Give you an idea We want spot But of course, you know doesn't mean we're going to find this experience straight away In fact, we like many visitors that's a problem we like to have parties We don't want to feel the alone then okay, so any questions What's the difference between consciousness and the clear mind Well touching on a tricky topic In Buddhism there are three words to express the mind there's the mind that's referred to the thinking mind There is the consciousness Mental consciousness the sense the mental sense that experience thoughts There's cheetah which is more refers more to the the totality of our experience and cheetah is also Translated as mind heart one will refer to mind stroke heart is we refer to cheetah which includes consciousness which includes awareness which includes The experience that we have through the senses, you know The cheetah is what you experience for moment to moment So There is awareness and there's awareness of the content of the mind There's awareness there's a seeing the mind seeing and there's a seeing of the object That enter the mind like the visitors that Ajahn Chah was talking about the visitor. We can see all the visitors Okay Don't get too bogged down because again that he say words can really lead us away from practice if we try to think You know, what is awareness? What is space? You know, can you define space? You know is a part of the mind that is like space and then there's object in space Like this room here imagine your mind being like the space I was confused because I think you said you read that we had to give up consciousness And yet it seems like consciousness Well, you don't have to give up consciousness. You have to give us a suffering that this consciousness produce in you You don't give up consciousness. Don't let go of You know The candor is the body, you know mind and body sense consciousness You know is there for lifetime we have to live with a sense consciousness But we don't have to hang on to the suffering that this consciousness that this sense consciousness produces Through a misapprehension of sense objects Yes, any other questions Yes, any other questions Okay So time for tea
