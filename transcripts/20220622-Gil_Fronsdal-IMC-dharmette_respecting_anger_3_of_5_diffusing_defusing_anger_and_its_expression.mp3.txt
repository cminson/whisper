The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So good morning, good day, good evening. And so we're continuing with this
discussion of anger. And I said now that anger is a sign, and one way of saying
a message, and one way of understanding that is that it's a sign that
something is wrong, somewhere or other something is wrong. And some wisdom is
needed to not assume automatically that what's wrong is out in the world, or to
assume automatically that what's wrong is within oneself. But it's a sign that
something is off, that something needs attention. And one of the first things to
do is to learn from it, to find out what it is, to stop and take a good look.
What's really going on here? And when we meditate especially, this is a great place
because we don't have to then, hopefully when meditating, say anything to anyone or
do anything in the world, you can just really be present and feel it. So we
want to learn from it. One of the things to learn is that how anger motivates us.
And that's part of the danger of anger, that sometimes anger comes with a very
strong motivation to do something, to say something, just very forcefully to
someone, or to act forcefully or something. And when the motivation
sometimes has the upper hand, and that's why, for example, expressions of anger,
speaking angrily, people lose touch with themselves as they say it. The motivation
is so strong and so powerful that they don't really know what's happening in
their body and their hearts, their minds. They've lost, sometimes in extreme
versions, they've kind of possessed by anger and they don't have not really
touched into what's happening here. And this losing touch with oneself when
we're angry is a great hindrance, a great shortcoming. The wisdom, the clarity, the
ability to be able to act wisely and speak wisely in the world happens a lot
from being grounded in one's body, to be present here. And that can happen even
when we're angry, and that's why we won't lose ourselves in the anger. And so
training ourselves to kind of be in the body, stay present. So it helps to think
of anger as being, part of what anger is, is there's a motivation in it. And to
ask yourself, what is the motivation here? What is the desire? What's the wish
that you see happen? And regardless of what the degree of anger might be, it
could be irritation, it could be even annoyance, something relatively mild.
What is that? This becomes particularly important when anger, annoyance,
irritation, is hostility, has become, is a low key and chronic. And so it has
nothing to do with any particularly incident that's happened, but rather it
has to do with it become a way of living, a way of kind of an attitude which we
have. And the whole assessment of chronic anger, hostility, is very different
than the analysis or the consideration of incident-specific anger, where there's
something happening right in front of us. And the chronic that goes on for a
long time, that is particularly debilitating. That tends to have a
powerful force to help people actually not be in touch with themselves, that
they might feel the opposite because the energy of anger is so strong that they
feel humming with it, but actually there's there's such a big cost, we lose
something. The Buddha gave this list of the downsides of anger, of being angry,
especially maybe chronic anger, that maybe he gave it to people to
motivate them to do something about their anger, not to live this way. And so
he said that the ill effects of anger include looking ugly, being in pain,
making mistakes, the loss of property, falls into disputes and disgrace, loss of
friends, and then rebirth in hell. So I don't know if that motivated some of
you, like, oh wow, all those things can be there with anger. I think of it as
chronic anger, this kind of persistent stream of it. So one of the ways to
respect anger is, I believe, is not to give into it as a motivational force to
say or do something, but rather take the time to feel it and to know it, and to
feel and know it in the body. And the body can process this. The body knows how
to unfold and relax and open up and reveal. And sometimes when we take the
time to sit down and feel anger in the body, it gets stronger. There can be
murderous rage that arises. But when you're sitting still, maybe that's the
whatever has happened is so powerful that something has been, is erupting
inside of us. And if we're not acting on it or expressing it, meditation is
about letting that eruption happen. Or meditation is about letting the whole
thing dissipate and dissolve. Because sometimes what keeps it going is telling
ourselves stories, repeating ourselves the injury that's been done, or it's
the repetition of certain trains of thought which keeps the anger, the
annoyance, the irritation going. And so to sit quietly and feel it in the body is
an alternative to all those stories. And then the body, then you can allow the
body to do what it wants to do. You know, the deeper process to do what it
wants to do. And it might be an eruption or it might be dissolving. And it's not
your job to choose which it is, but to really be attuned to see what needs to
happen here. And hopefully be quiet enough, still enough, go for a walk long
enough that you allow the whole process to maybe come to some completion. In
ordinary life, especially with incident specific anger, and we have to kind of
act on things, it's very useful to learn how to diffuse the anger, how to be with
the anger so that it doesn't automatically trigger motivational actions
we say or do things. And here again, training ourselves to a second nature
to be mindful of the body so we feel what's happening. The body can be a
sort of stability, come back to the body and just sit, be, or stand, feel your
feet on the ground. The body can also be the means by which we diffuse some of
the energy of anger, some of the tension and motivational force of anger that
interferes with our ability to really be attuned more deeply what's happening,
attuned to the deeper emotions that might really be the bigger issue that's
happening, more attuned to the situation we're in and to take a better look at
what's happening, more attuned to ourselves to, if the anger arises
because of a story we're telling ourselves, to question the story. Is that
the right perspective that we have? So to tune into the body and then to find
ways to diffuse some of that energy of anger by relaxing, breathing, breathing,
breathing, breathing deeply and relaxing, breathing and relaxing on the exhale,
breathing and feeling the expansion of the rib cage in the torso as a way of
kind of grounding yourself in the body and feeling something that's really
primary, the primary experience of breathing. Notice your posture when
you're angry. Maybe the posture is one that is not doesn't lend itself to
diffusion, to settling. If you're, you know, both hands are in a fist, it
maybe it's not that difficult to relax the fist, to relax the hand, to open it.
And doing that is part of the diffusion process, settling it, quieting down. And
diffusion is not the same thing as repression or denial or escaping from
it. Diffusion is to settle some of the some of the ways in which we're getting
disconnected from ourselves and to feel more deeply what's happening, to be more
present and to settle the motivational triggers that might come with
anger so that we're not speaking from the anger or acting from the anger and we
can kind of feel and sense what's going on. And so finding out where you are,
each of us probably has our own specialty of where in the body anger is most
expressed. It might be tension and tightness in the belly, it might be in the
chest, it might be in the face or the jaws, might be in the hands. Sometimes the
eyes, I've seen angry people in their eyes or feel so tense and fixed and locked
in. It might be somehow in the forehead and places where we get headaches
because of all the the tension associated with maybe irritation and
anger. So wherever your way is, your place, get to know it so that when you go
about your life and it's an incident of anger, you know to go to that place and
maybe relax and settle. The learned skills of diffusion, learned skills of
being grounded in the present so that anger doesn't get the upper hand, so
that you can learn from the anger rather than act on the anger. The expression of
anger is not something we want to do very often. I once asked one of my
Buddhist teachers if it was ever appropriate to express anger and the
teacher says, I said something, I forgot exactly the date, the time frame, but the
teacher said, yes, once in a blue moon, once at once in a great while, like once
every, you know, five years or something. So I don't know if that guideline is the
right one, but it was fascinating to me. They said, yeah, there might be a time,
but not that often. And so to have the ability to step back and the advantage
of that is that if anger involves something that needs to be addressed in
our life, it's often addressed much more usefully, motivated by other emotions
and feelings and ideas than the motivations that come from anger itself.
So again, it's not denying the incident was anger producing, it's not denying the
difficulty of the anger, but it's questioning the motivational value of
anger. And that's where it's very rare that anger is useful as a motivational
force. Some people are quick to defend anger because a lot of good gets done in
the world with anger, that people are motivated for justice and fight for it.
So maybe that's good, but it's not so healthy for the person who's angry. And I
feel a little sad when people justify anger for that reason. What I wish they
would do instead is find an equal or even stronger motivation from compassion.
Don't set up anger, don't justify anger if there are better motivations to get
the job done. So diffusing anger. So for this next day, you might, if you find
yourself irritated, annoyed, angry, rageful, simmering, resentful, whatever
about you might feel today, see what you can do by tuning into your body. And like
we did in the guided meditation, tune into what's going on in the body really
well and see what the body wants to do. See if the body wants to relax. See if
the body wants to be energized. If you do this during a walk, as I've said
before, I process strong anger with walks. Does the body want to walk
faster? Does it want to walk slower? What does the body want to do here? And
then also explore, where can you relax? What settles you into with the emotion?
And this is a personal skill that each person needs to learn for themselves. So
how do you diffuse anger? So, thank you.
