Dharmette: Shifting Perspectives   
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

One of the little sayings in the Vipassana world is that 
mindfulness is not about seeing something new , but 
rather seeing in a new way. People are sometimes 
looking for something , as opposed to giving importance 
to how we look. So, we emphasize seeing in a new way , 
because s ometimes the old ways of seeing  – the old 
perspectives we use – are not going to help.  
  
If we see the world as a battlefield, and we are looking 
for the solution by winning the battle , or fighting the 
battle better, t hen even if we win the war, we are still at 
war. We still see it through that perspective : we are ju st 
going to see more war.  If we see the world as a place 
that is frightening, and we are trying to figure out how to 
deal with a frightening world, and maybe temporarily we 
figure out some way to be safe, the eyes still see the 
world as a frightening place . You still have to hide in 
your safe place , and you still see it in a frightening  way. 
If you see the world as a place where the most 
successful, best person is the one who has the most 
pleasure, then you pursue pleasure and get all the 
pleasure you want,  but that perspective is still there 
afterwards.   
Another perspective is that of self. These  ideas about 
who we are , who we should be , and our identity  are 
very tricky . If we have a really fixed , strong idea  of who 
we have to be, who we’ re supposed to be, or who we 
are – the more fixed that idea is, the more fragile and 
brittle we are  – and the mo re easily we can feel 
threatened. If we think  what we are supposed to do is to 
have this sense, or this idea of self, and the more it’s 
threatened, the more we l ook for a solution that involves  
reinforcing the self.  
 
I don’t know if this is the best example, but imagine if I 
think I’m supposed to be the most macho guy at IMC – 
like that’s a really important part of my identit y. I mean, I 
grew up in America. I probably picke d up a few macho 
values, and this i s really important. Your status in the  
community goes up the more macho you are. I need to 
make sure that I’m seen that  way and respected that 
way. But I’ve noticed that a few of you don’t quite treat 
me that way, li ke I’m super macho. I feel hurt;  I feel 
disoriented. But it’s so important to be macho . So, I’ll 
come dressed properly with macho clothes , and have a 
swagger , and I’m going to do all the things that reinforce 
the idea that I’ m macho. But t hat makes me more brittle , 
because you guys are not going to accommodate me. 
So, then I feel more hurt , and try harder. As long as I  
think that’s what I have to do – to have t his kind of self , 
and the solution is through the perspecti ve in being that kind of person – then I’m swirling in saṃsāra. I’m 
swirling all around in a way that there is no escape.  
 
There is no escape. This is the mythology of Buddhism, 
that you have saṃsāra – this endless wandering in 
circles. There is no escape within the circle itself. There 
is no escape within certain mind sets. You have to find 
some way to step out of them , and see in a new way. 
So, part of the function of medit ation practice is to relax 
us, to calm us down enough so that our eyes don’t have 
a veil  or a filter through which we are always seeing 
things. We can calm down, slow down, refresh the 
mind, and see in a fresh way. Sometimes w e see that 
the problems we had weren’t problems after all.  Some 
problems we have don’t really exist. And then we  realize 
that if we relax , slow down , and take a break , we can  
see in a new way.  
 
I think that a fair number of people who practice 
meditation continue to try to think their way out of their 
problems, or their life situations. They sit in meditation  – 
and think , and think , and figure , and understand.  If you 
read a lot of books on Buddhism , or listen t o a lot of 
ideas about Buddhism – like on Audio  Dharma, or if you 
listen to o much to me  – It can seem to be just ideas. “If I 
move these ideas around in my head , and get the right 
idea, get the right understanding, then it should all work 
out.” Then we go back , and study the scriptures a nd 
Buddhist texts more to get the ideas. And move them around a little bit. It’ll all kind of click , and it will all be 
fine.  
 
The idea of thinking our way out of our problems doesn’t 
work very well. Especially if the framework of the 
thinking is still in  the old mode of the war , or the danger , 
or whatever it is that we are seeing. So how do we s tep 
out? How do we change ? The obvious thing we would 
say in our mindfulness tradition is we rely on direct 
seeing, on mindfulness. But I think some people who do 
mindfulness practice are relying too much on 
mindfulness, as if : “If I just look better. I just have to see 
better. I just have to look and recognize. And know this 
is what’s happening. Non -reactive awareness. Just this. 
Just this . Then everything would be  okay. “ 
 
How we see the world, how we see ourselves, how we 
see our problems has a lot to do with the state of mind 
we are in. So, if I’m in an angry state of mind, I am more 
likely to see the world as full of problems. If I am in a 
greedy state of mind, I  am going to see the world as a 
place where I am going to get what I want. If I am in an 
insecure state of mind , then I will see all of the 
challenges and threats to my machoism – or whatever it 
might be, right?  
 
Sometimes what’s really helpful is  to chang e the state 
we’re in. And i n a new state, we have a new perspective 
and can see in a new way. Part of the function of meditation practice is not just to see clearly, but to 
actually help us change our state. To get calmer, for 
example  – that’s a change of state. Or t o be more 
relaxed. To be more accepting. To be more loving, more 
compassionate. To have more compassion for the 
situation.  
 
Sometimes it’s useful in practice and in life to consider 
the state you’re in. And are there some legal, easy,  
approp riate ways to change your state?  Rather than 
relying only on thinking to solve your problems. Not only 
relying  only on so -called mindfulness just to see , and 
see, and see what’s there. W hat can you do to change 
your state?  Sometimes for people who a re overly busy, 
it might be just taking a break  – taking a vacation , or 
going for a walk in the park to get some fresh air. 
Sometimes it might mean taking a nap. Sometimes it 
might mean doing something that is really fun and 
playful. Being playful is great . If you take this Buddhism, 
this practice too seriously , you’re in trouble. Maybe 
some playfulness will change your state somehow.  
 
Do you have good, appropriate ways to change your 
state? Being careful  – without : getting attached to good 
states ; or thinking that your practice is only goo d or 
successful if you have good states ; or that you are 
somehow wrong if you have unhealthy states. Within 
reason – without being too attached, or too forceful, or 
expecting too much out of this – are there simple ways to change your state  so you can see  your situation in a 
better way?   
 
Take a yoga class. Yoga can be a great way to change 
your state. Some people get more traction from an hour 
yoga class than they do from an hour of meditation. 
Especially people living busy urban lives. Sometimes 
you need  to do something strong to get out  of the  swirl 
of papa ñca – the s wirl of mental perspectives we are 
caught in.  
 
So, be very careful with the perspectives you live in. 
And be very careful that you aren’t trying to solve your 
problems from a perspective for which there is no 
solution. The image in Buddhism is  that if you are stuck 
in quick sand , and you push down with one foot , that foot 
will sink deeper. Then you push down with the other foot 
to get you rself out, and you go even deeper. S ome 
perspectives keep you entrenched – keep you mired in 
the mud , going deeper and deeper.  
 
You want to shift and change perspective s. Shift and 
change even the state you are in, in some simple way. 
Then you might be in a much better place to see what’s 
really going on. What’s really happening with you. 
What’s important for you.  
 
For some of you, I want to say  that I hope that coming 
to IMC this Wednesday morning has that function for you. Stepping away from your normal life for a couple of 
hours, being quiet, meditating in this kind of stillness, 
letting things fall and settle away perhaps. That it is kind 
of a place to change your perspective , or to change 
your state a little bit , so that when you go back , you can 
see from a different perspective than you could if you 
had just kept going in the usual mode.  
 
Thank you.
