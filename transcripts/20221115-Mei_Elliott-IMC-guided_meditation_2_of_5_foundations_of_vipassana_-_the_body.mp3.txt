 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Let's see, where was I? I was introducing myself. My name is Mae Elliott, and good morning. Here we are in the midst of a week-long study on the foundations of Vipassana meditation. Yesterday we focused on the breath, and today we'll be talking about the body. These are the basic instructions, meditation instructions one receives at Insight Meditation Center and many of the Western Vipassana Centers in California and around the U.S. I'd like to begin our sitting with a quote. We'll have a little more silence in the sitting today than yesterday. My quote goes like this. This is from Kate Johnson. The language of the body is sensation, and feeling is the way we listen. The language of the body is sensation, and feeling is the way we listen. Let's begin our meditation with a stable upright posture. Finding an upright and energetic space to be in. An energetic spine, perhaps, maybe some lifting in the neck. And pairing that with some relaxation, some ease. You might start by connecting with your primary anchor. That might be the breath, a global sense of the body or a sense of sound, or the simplicity of the instructions. We'll just talk about the breath. So go ahead and connect with the breath where you feel it most predominantly. Maybe in the chest, the belly, or the nose. Allowing the mind to collect and stabilize. Allowing the mind to be in. In order to support us in learning the language of the body, we'll spend some time exploring one particular area in the body. And we'll do this with the hands. So go ahead and choose one of your hands and bring your attention to that hand and see what you notice. Because the body speaks in the language of sensations, you might feel tingling or temperature, buzzing or movement. Maybe there's a global sense of the hand, just the whole hand being, not a picture of the hand in the mind, but a felt sense of the hand from the inside. And as we feel the hand, we're not trying to make it any different than it is. We're not judging anything or telling stories about our hand. Just feeling. We might feel the skin between the fingers, where the skin meets the nail beds. Just exploring the territory. Feeling the flesh of the hand, the muscles. And feeling the bones. If the sensations are pleasant, that's okay. If they're unpleasant, that's okay. Just observing with a kind and gentle awareness. And when you're ready, you can move your attention to your other hand and explore in the same way, seeing what you notice. Feel theem So by being in that with the hands in this way, it gives us a sense of how we might feel into sensations elsewhere in the body. Just developing our vocabulary for feeling temperature, pressure, tingling, sharpness, softness, etc. So we can now let go of our focus on the hands. Go ahead and return to your primary anchor. Coming back to the breath. So from here, the way that you might incorporate more of the body into your meditation is by staying with the breath as the anchor. When something else feels more predominant, maybe a sensation in the knee, tightness in the shoulder, coldness of the toes, when something else becomes predominant, you can allow your attention to let go of the breath and to go to that sensation, that new sensation. The mind can feel that sensation. And when it begins to lose predominance, then we return to the breath. So the breath is still our home, but the awareness can venture out to other areas of the body when they call for our attention. And then coming back to the breath. You can go ahead and try that now through the meditation. And go ahead and return. And if it's helpful for you, you can add a soft mental note when breathing. You might make a quiet internal note saying, in. And as you breathe out, out, in, out. And then as another sensation calls the attention, we might say tingling or pressure. Or heat. And then back to in, out. It's just a light mental note with the majority of the attention on the sensations being felt. AZ Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Staying in contact with the full length of the inhale and the full length of the exhale. Inning and sustaining contact. And when another sensation arises, heaviness, lightness, length, whatever it is, allowing the mind to connect with that new sensation and feel it completely. Then returning to the breath. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. As we practice thoughts and emotions may still arise, but for now we allow them to fall to the background, letting them go. Dedicating our attention to the breath and the physical sensations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. By practicing mindfulness of the body, we can learn to be more present in the world. The body is always in the present. We can become more able to be with things as they are. To live with less greed, hatred, or delusion. When we're able to do that, we can be more available, more kind, more generous, and more compassionate with others. They may be goodness of this practice, benefit all beings everywhere. So they may be happy, healthy, safe, and free. Thank you.
