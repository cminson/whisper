 So, thoughts. Part of the function of the mind is to produce thoughts. It's very normal. It happens to us all. Thoughts appear. Another part of the function of the mind is to know, to experience the thoughts, to experience sensations, to experience emotions. So the mind has these two components. There's the content of the mind and there's the knowing aspect of the mind. So much as the eye receives sight and the ear receives sound, the mind also receives thoughts. That's another way to look at a way to experience the thoughts. That their experience is happening like not impersonal experience is happening. Like if somebody walks across my field of vision, it's kind of an impersonal experience. The eyes take it in. And in a similar way, the mind produces thoughts and it experiences them. So the mind receives the thoughts that are created. So thoughts happen. They will arise for many reasons. They'll arise based on what we've seen or done in the last day, week or year. They'll arise based on who we've met or an emotion that we feel. There's many, many reasons. Or they could arise because we're experiencing something similar to what we've experienced before. There's kind of an associative nature to thoughts. They may arise based on sense impressions. I don't remember. I don't think I told this story last week, but I'll tell it now anyway. At one point in my practice, I was really observing anger and had noticed a lot of how anger is experienced in the mind. And at one point, I was cutting an apple. And I wasn't angry at that point when I was cutting the apple, but I was cutting the apple. And I noticed a thought arise in the mind about the person that I was angry with. The thought, the memory, was an image in the mind, was that we were together in a fruit stand in Sacramento. So I could see the connection. There was an associative nature to the thought, that the apple in front of me had triggered the memory somehow. There's some connection in the mind. I think the mind kind of functions that way. So it had triggered that memory. And I saw in that memory, I saw the kind of inclination of the mind. To get on that thought and start thinking more thoughts about him to get angry. To kind of bring up more thoughts, associative thoughts about the person I was angry with, to get me angry. So there's kind of an inclination towards the anger. But at the same time, because I had seen the thought so clearly, I'd seen the thought arising because of the apple. And I saw that I wasn't angry at the moment. I saw I had a choice. I saw I had a choice that I didn't actually have to get on that chain of thoughts. I didn't have to jump on that train. And I didn't get angry. So it was a very powerful moment for me to recognize how powerful it is to see these thoughts. To be able to witness our thoughts, these random thoughts that appear in our mind. A sense impression of an apple triggered a thought of a person I was angry with. If I can notice that thought, it doesn't have to lead to anger necessarily. It may sometimes lead to anger. But we can begin to uncover the sources of our emotions and a fleeting thought. One that wouldn't have always been recognized. So through this attention, through this mindful attention to our experience, we can start to see how empty thoughts are. It really is just an empty thought. Thoughts only have the power that we give them, essentially, through not paying attention to them. That thought, if I hadn't really been thoroughly aware of it, there would have been the kind of jumping on that thought and the subsequent writing it into anger. So there's a tendency. We have a tendency to believe our thoughts. We think because a thought has arisen in our mind that it means something about us. That it has some validity. That it wouldn't have arisen if it didn't have some validity. But there's really, I mean, I have to say that after my experience of meditating for these years, thoughts are really kind of random empty. There's not much to them at all. And there's not much validity to them either. I mean, it's simply a random blip in the neurotransmitters creating some image in the mind. And it only has the power that we give it. So bringing the mindfulness to the thinking can really help us to actually see how ephemeral thoughts are and have a choice. The real point is not to get rid of thinking, but to be able to have a choice in how our thoughts, how we use our thoughts. Thoughts are very functional. They really help us. We need our thoughts to be able to plan our lives, to go to the store, to buy groceries, to plan our meals, to get to work. We need our thoughts to do all of these things. So we're not trying to get rid of thoughts. But what we're trying to do is to make them conscious so that it's not simply habitual thinking that we're living on, but that we are able to have some choice in, here's a thought, do I want to do something with it? Or is it not so functional for me? Is it not so functional for me to get on this thought and get angry? So I'd like to talk a little bit about the contents of thinking versus the process of thinking. We talked a little bit about this in our discussion of the exercise. But the contents of the thinking is the narrative, the story, if you will, that's going on in our mind. What he said, what she said, what we did, what we're going to do, who I'm going to do with all of the, the way we're used to paying attention to thoughts is to get involved with the narrative. And then there's the process of thinking, how it happens in the mind. Is it visual? Is it auditory? A combination of both? We've talked a little bit about this. The auditory might have a sense of, as if you're talking to yourself. You know, you have a sense that you're just speaking to yourself in your mind. It kind of sounds like your own voice. Sometimes it can sound like somebody else's voice. So sometimes it can be helpful to pay a little bit to, is it a male voice or a female voice? You know, is it my mother's voice? Is it my spouse's voice that's speaking to me? So notice a little bit about how the thoughts appear in the mind. Notice how they, actually how the mindfulness affects the thinking. When we bring our mindfulness to the thinking process, it will affect the thinking process. Because typically with the thinking, it kind of feeds itself and just kind of, you think a thought and then the next thought thinks itself and the next thought thinks itself and the next thought, and you just get in this chain of thinking thoughts. And if you bring mindfulness into that process, what tends to happen is that the thought that you're thinking tends to stop and then there may be a brief gap before the next one arises. So there's, it's not quite so much just one thought chaining off of another. So there's a chance for there to be a brief gap between thoughts. So it's helpful to notice if you're seeing a gap between the thoughts. You might also pay attention, if it's an auditory sense, to the tone of voice. Does the tone of voice have a mood or emotion if you're speaking to yourself? Are you yelling at yourself? Be rating yourself? Are you having kind and gentle voice to yourself? So a sense of the kind of mood or tone that's accompanying the thought process. So when we attend to thoughts, we do notice that they don't last for very long. And that's helpful to notice that. Just notice that. It can be kind of startling sometimes to break into suddenly your mind is aware of the thinking and you recognize, oh thinking, and then suddenly, poof, it's gone. It can be kind of startling. Just notice that. Notice that that's happened. So in our meditation, as I mentioned earlier, the thoughts can often come as a kind of drifting away from our experience. It's as if we've just kind of, we had been focused on the sensations of breathing and something just in our stream of experience grabbed us and we're kind of just, oh, floating off into this world of drifting thoughts. So when that happens, really it's most skillful to see if you can simply notice. First it's helpful to notice that that's the state you're in. You've woken up in that state. The mindfulness is there in that state. Recognize that. It's very, very helpful to recognize, oh, drifting. Drifting is what's happening. But then as much as you can, if there's any pull towards that drifting, because sometimes that drifting state can be really pleasant, so there can kind of be a pull towards that drifting. You might, if you find that, see if you can notice the pleasantness in the body. The mind has put you into a state that's a drifting and a sense of pleasantness. See if you can find that pleasantness in the body and use that as a way to come back into your physical experience, noticing the pleasantness in the body. And then if it's there, it may not be there. You may be experiencing pain, which is why you've drifted off. So you can have all kinds of different experiences. But if that is a particular pattern, if you kind of feel pulled into the drifting because it's pleasant, see if you can recognize where the pleasantness is in the body and let yourself experience it directly as opposed to through this indirect experience of the drifting. Then you can come back to your breathing. So as much as you can, if you're just drifting, see if you can let go of it and come back to the breathing. At other times, though, our thoughts are more compelling. It seems as though we notice the thought, we notice that we're planning or remembering or fantasizing, and we try to come back to the breathing. And then immediately we're off in that same theme over and over again. We keep trying to let it go, and the theme just keeps popping up. That's the time to really turn your attention directly to the thinking process, to look at first of all how it's happening, notice whether it's auditory or visual, and notice the tone of voice, all of those kinds of things that we've already talked about. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, talking to Sylvia, it's helpful to see if you can notice the category. Use that as your label, as you're noting your experience. Remembering, judging, angry, those angry thoughts. There may be lashing out thoughts or happy thoughts, whatever they are. Just see if you can notice the type of thought. This is a great exercise, and one Jack Cornfield likes to suggest that over time we notice the kind of themes of our thoughts that we find, will find that we tend to have a repeating set of themes to our thoughts. Maybe we tend to be judging, and it's not always the same judging that we're doing, but when we start to recognize it as judging as opposed to getting involved in the person that we're judging and what we're judging about, we can begin to see, oh, this is a pattern. I tend to be judging. It's really helpful to see if we can notice that kind of theme to the thinking. When thoughts are very strong and we're trying to observe them with mindfulness, one of the best ways to do that, as with emotions, is to bring some attention into the body. When thoughts are really strong like that, if we're kind of gripped into a pattern of thoughts that we just have trouble letting go of, there's very often some kind of a physical experience in the body that's correlated to the thinking. If we're gripped with a planning frenzy, for instance, there might be a sense of the mind kind of spinning, that this kind of tumbling sensation in the mind, a sense of physical sensation almost of falling forward or spinning. You can bring your attention just to what that feels like, or maybe there's a sensation of bees buzzing in your head that just like, it's just craziness in the head. Just see if you can notice that feeling of craziness. Whatever physical sensation, there's a lot of physical sensations that can manifest out of emotions. There might be tightness in the jaw or maybe something around the eyes, even things in the whole body. Another thing to look for or check for is whether there's an emotion associated with the thought, with the pattern of thoughts. For instance, planning thoughts, if we're caught into a frenzy of planning, there may be some anxiety underneath it. It's really helpful to acknowledge the anxiety. Gil likes to talk about emotions kind of being a factory for thoughts, that the emotion will just spin out all these thoughts. If the emotion itself is not recognized and acknowledged, it will keep spinning out all those thoughts. In a sense, the emotion is kind of asking for our attention through spinning out these thoughts. If we're caught in the thoughts and just paying attention to the thoughts themselves, we're not doing what the emotion really asks, which is to pay attention directly to the emotion. If you find yourself in a kind of a state where there's a pattern of thinking that seems to be based in the emotion, see if you can connect with the emotion itself. Fear can generate a lot of thoughts. Happiness can generate a lot of thoughts. I had an experience at one point where I was quite surprised because I felt like I was in a planning frenzy and I kept coming back. I was driving down the road, okay, come back to the driving, come back to the driving. I just kept spinning out into this planning frenzy. At one point I thought, wow, this is really strong. What is happening? What kind of emotion is happening underneath this? To my surprise, I found not anxiety, not fear, but happiness. I found happiness. I had completely missed the fact that I was happy because I had been caught in this planning frenzy. The planning was trying to figure out how I could keep this happiness going. How can I convince this person that this happiness is the right kind of happiness for me? It was quite a surprise. Don't necessarily think because you're experiencing a certain type of thoughts that you should look for a particular type of emotion underneath it. Let yourself prepare to be surprised. I found actually that habit or that pattern, I now call it talking myself out of happiness because I tend to not, it's harder for me to connect to the positive happy emotions. I kind of spin out away from them and get into this kind of thought factory off of the happiness and don't even really get to experience the fact that I'm happy. Eventually I'm now starting to be able to come back and just feel the fact that I'm happy in this experience in the car. It's like, wow, this is much better to be happy, it's much better to be caught in all of these thoughts. You might think that awareness of thoughts, to be able to bring our attention, our mindful attention to our thoughts is something that requires a very subtle degree of mindfulness and a lot of practice. But I found actually that it is a fairly natural thing once we start bringing our attention to our experience, to be able to recognize our thoughts. I had one experience pretty early in my practice, I'd say within the first five or six months of my practice where I was paying attention to loneliness. Every night when I went to bed I was lonely. This didn't particularly surprise me because I had just broken up with my boyfriend and I thought, well, this makes sense, I'm lonely, I'm going to bed by myself, poor me, I'm not in a relationship anymore, etc. But I was in the space where I was trying to just observe my emotions. So every night when I went to bed I just kind of observed the loneliness. And after some number of nights I saw that the loneliness started when I was setting my alarm clock. And I thought, that's odd, why would I get lonely when I set my alarm clock? So I just kept observing each night and noticed the loneliness arise when I set my alarm clock. Just paying attention, I wasn't particularly looking for anything in particular, I was just opening to whatever experiences were happening. And then one night, some nights into this process, while I was setting the alarm clock I noticed an image in the mind of myself with my ex-boyfriend in Disneyland looking up at a digital clock in Tomorrowland. So there was a connection, there was a digital alarm clock I was setting and there was a digital clock in the memory. And I saw that the loneliness was a reaction to the thought, that it didn't necessarily have to do with this overall pattern of poor me, I'm going to bed. The loneliness was arising in reaction to a particular thought. I thought that was amazing actually to see that experience. But what was even more amazing was the next night when I went to bed and set my alarm clock, of course the thought came up again, it had been made conscious. I was perfectly aware, I remembered that I had that thought the night before, so it was right there in my mind. And yet the loneliness did not come up. It was as if somehow witnessing, just simply witnessing the connection of the alarm clock, the thought leading to the loneliness, somehow just that witnessing of it the night before had broken its spell so that it no longer had the power to send me into the loneliness. So that, of course I got lonely in my life after that, I mean it's not that that ended loneliness, but that regular recurring every night going to bed and feeling lonely, that stopped. So it's very powerful to bring our attention to our experience, be open to whatever comes up whether it's thoughts, emotions, and just see what we can experience. It's really quite remarkable what we can experience. So those are some of my thoughts on how to work with thoughts. I've got some other ones, but I wanted to stop here and see if you have any comments or questions or anything you'd like to ask. I'm not sure why. I think it's partly because these thoughts are so subtle and so habitual that we just don't tend to notice them. So it really is just a matter of being in a space for a while that as we stay in a meditative space for a while, we begin to become more and more aware of subtler and subtler experiences. So the things that are not so obvious initially become more obvious later on. So I think it's simply because we're not used to seeing things that are that subtle and that fleeting. It was a pretty fleeting image. It was there and gone. And yet I could see the mind just want to jump right onto it and create more thoughts. So the actual question I would encourage you to ask is, what is this anxiousness rather than why? Because the why will tend to get us into our thoughts, thinking about why we're having it. So when we bring our attention to our thoughts and to our experience, we don't get into trying to figure out why we're having it. We just see if we can bring our attention into the what of the experience. What does it feel like to be anxious? What does it feel like to have this buzzing thought in my mind? Not why am I thinking it? What thought preceded this one that led me to this? We can do that kind of thing. And I did that as a child. I was very fond of playing that kind of a game as a child. We would drive through Texas, which has a lot of empty space. So there was not much to look at. So I would play this game. I had noticed that my thoughts kind of produced these kind of weird random thoughts. And I wondered where they came from. I was like, where do these thoughts come from? And so I thought I'd experiment. I'd explore. And what I discovered, I played this game where I would just let my thinking just go. And then suddenly I would decide, OK, what am I thinking right now? And I would notice what I was thinking right now. And then I would chain back. What was I thinking before that? What was I thinking before that? And what was I thinking before that? So it's possible to do this kind of thing. I mean, I did it as a 10-year-old. We can do this kind of thing. We can chain back. And what I discovered was that it always ended up, I could always chain it back to something I'd seen out the window. So it always had a root in a sense impression. And I thought for a long time that that was the only way thoughts appeared. And I've since discovered in meditation that thoughts do appear kind of out of the blue random, not based on the sense impression. But I think the vast majority of our thoughts are rooted in something we've experienced. So it's really helpful to know that because it kind of can help take the power out of the thoughts to some extent. Yeah. It goes on to the question I had, which is, is it important to notice if it's something in the past, like you tell it a memory, versus a future thought, like a planning? It's really helpful to notice those really broad categories, remembering versus planning, the past versus the future. You might find you have a predominance to one or the other, that some people tend to project more towards the future. Some people tend to try to figure out how they can live a better past by thinking over and over again. Yes. I have two questions. So after you've been practicing mindfulness for many, many years, when you meditate, do you have your thoughts, or you still have thoughts that you're much more able to diffuse them through awareness? It really varies. I would say there's a trend towards fewer thoughts, and there's definitely a trend towards being able to notice them. But it's definitely not linear, and there are times when I sit down and it's just complete chaos, and like I'm lucky if I notice anything. But that happens much more rarely now than it did initially. So it does tend to tend in that direction. But really the mindfulness is to allow us to be aware of whatever is happening, and if that's a chaotic mind, if we can just try to bring our attention to chaos. You know, the mindfulness, I mentioned this again earlier to somebody, our habits have this incredible amount of momentum behind them. So all the patterns of our emotions and all the ways that we tend to think, it's got this incredible amount of momentum behind it. So it's like we're going 60 miles an hour down the freeway. And bringing mindfulness into that stream doesn't stop the momentum immediately. What we get to see is that 60 miles an hour. That's what we get to witness, is that moving, that stream of thoughts, or that compelling emotion. But what the mindfulness tends to do, if we can do it in a kind of a nonjudgmental way, witnessing the experience, I like to think of it as putting the car in neutral. So you're going 60 miles an hour down the freeway and you put your car in neutral, and it doesn't come to a stop immediately. But because you're not continuing to give it the forward momentum, it comes to a stop of its own accord. And the mindfulness has that kind of effect. And over time, it does tend to allow us to come to a stop more easily, partly because the mindfulness is stronger. That we're, initially I think the mindfulness kind of gets bound up with judging and wanting to do it right, and how can I get this thing to go away? Sometimes we bring our mindfulness to something thinking, well, if I just pay attention to this in the right way, it will go away. And that kind of movement of mind itself brings a spin to the mind. So over time, as we get more and more adept at the actual practice of the nonjudgmental awareness of what's happening while it's happening, yeah, it does tend to settle. And we are able to see. One of the things that I've seen a lot more frequently in my practice is that I'm able to see when the mind leaves its object of meditation. So I'm paying attention to the breathing and I notice there's kind of this pull away. So I'm still there, but this kind of this pull. And I can notice that pull and I can do one of two things with that pull. I can either let go of where I'm being pulled and come back to the breathing, or I can witness the pull and just see what's that going to flower into. And often what seems to happen is with that, there's some kind of a settling. If I can really witness that movement, it's like, oh, well, the mind wants to leave the breath. It's kind of a sense of letting go of the breath. What is that experience of letting go? And often it can open into a very spacious place where then it's very natural to come back to the breath. So really letting yourself witness that pull. But it can take some time to get to that place where you start to see the mind leaving the experience. But that's one of the big shifts, I think, in my practice, is that I really see that beginning to leave the object of meditation. Does that answer your question? I have another question which was, it seems like the idea is that you're not just mindful in the 20 minutes of the day of the United States, that you're slowly mindful throughout the day. What is that process of, you mentioned walking through a doorway and every time you walk through the doorway, be mindful. But is that a process you follow and you pick actions or five times a day, you breathe and try to be mindful, and eventually you start to be always mindful? Well, I would say that the always mindful is a very distant goal. I think I'm a lot more mindful. I'm mindful through a lot of the day now. I remember to bring my attention back pretty regularly. But what you're describing, yes, is really what I've been trying to encourage you to do. And next week I'm really going to talk directly about the process to go into detail on it. So I'd like to save that a little bit for next week, but also to encourage you to find your own tricks, to find your own ways that it makes sense for you to bring mindfulness through the day. There's not actually a lot of instruction out there about bringing mindfulness into our day. I found some things that worked for me and I really like to talk about those things. Kamala Masters talks about them a lot because she used mindfulness of daily life as a real entryway into her practice. For me, I started the practice with mindfulness of daily life. I didn't start sitting down into meditation for several months into the practice. And I'd actually seen quite a bit of my mind and the momentum of the mind and the thoughts and the emotions without even really knowing much of what I was doing simply by having the intention to observe and then sitting down to meditate made things more clear. So we can actually come into the practice from a number of different ways. And if you can find ways that it resonates with you to bring your mindfulness into your daily life, come and tell the rest of us what they are. And I'll talk about the ones that I have worked with next week. So I would say, yes, the goal is really to bring your mindfulness as much as possible throughout your day, but not necessarily to try to set that up as your original goal. Because you'll end up frustrated and feeling like you failed if you say, okay, I'm going to be mindful all day long. So I recommend choosing some specific tasks initially and letting it kind of overflow from there. Yeah. In some village in France, they have a bell every 15 minutes that everyone stops what they're doing and they enter the bell again. Yes, yeah. I talk about that in my house. And I have some little things there somewhere. Yeah, and I think you talked about the mindfulness bell that you can put on your computer. So there's things you can do like that too. And Tic-Cun-On talks about the telephone as you wait for your phone to answer your phone because you used the three readings as they were in the previous bell. That's one of my favorites. I love that one. It's pretty simple. And it also has the benefit that when you pick up the phone, you're actually present for the person on the other end of the phone. I just want to say that because you told me how I really thought about what you said about the clock and how the last time you became so aware, I tried to open myself to a certain time like the evening to. And I was able to see something. It was not a good experience, but I was happy that I had it. I started this thing that I was going to talk about for something. It was so fast. And I had such an incredible emotion of sadness that I didn't go there. I stopped and I was terrified. And I said, where do I go from here? I want to know more about it. I was afraid to go in there. And so I thought, but at that time, I said, I'm absolutely not going in there right now. Could you feel the body at that moment? That's where I would rest at that moment. And over time, it's absolutely painful. It's really painful. I was happy that I was able to identify something, but I said, where do I go from here? You just keep opening. It really is a very organic process. It's not something we can control or choose. I'm going to take this step and this step and this step. We are just open to our experience. And things will reveal themselves like you're just that fleeting moment of a thought that you couldn't go to. At some point, you may be able to see it. You may not. And you may. Actually, I have seen that, but I never connected it. I was this kind of really had a panic attack if I keep on going on. But what I know I've heard before is that you stay with it until I mean, what things are we dealing with? Well, what you stay with is what the most predominant thing is. And what the most predominant thing was in that moment was the sensation in your body, not what the thought was or not where the thought was going, because your body and mind had already done something with the experience. And you're in a new place right now. You're in the place of the tension and contraction. And that's what you pay attention to. So you don't try to go back to the previous experience and figure out how it happened or where you could have gone from it. You start right where you are. And if that's in the contraction in your body, that's where it is. If you find it threatening to be with that contraction, you might try cultivating. And I think I talked about this last week when we talked about emotions, cultivating someplace neutral in the body that you can use as a refuge. So your hands, hands are a great one because they tend to have quite a bit of sensation. You can tend to feel your hands. You can just let your hands rest and bring your attention into your hands and see if you can. If you can't, if you find yourself being reactive to the to the sensations, see if you can let yourself come to something neutral to give yourself a break. So hands, feet are good. And I would not necessarily recommend trying to go to the breathing in that case because often with a strong emotion, the bodily sensations tend to be in this area. And if we're trying to pay attention to the breathing, we can just end up getting caught right back into the emotion. So if you can cultivate something neutral, it can be a great place to give yourself some rest from something that's difficult. We can be really reactive to our thoughts. You know, a thought can come up and we can have a sense of, I shouldn't be thinking that kind of thought, or I'm a bad person to be thinking that kind of thought, or I'm a good person to be thinking that kind of thought. We can be reactive to our thoughts. So again, just see if you can notice that reactivity and try not to let it keep multiplying. Anything else? Let me talk a little bit about the exercises I'd like you to try. So again, focus on your daily sitting. And as I suggested in the description of the practice, I would suggest for the first 10 or so minutes of your sitting, you really let yourself focus on the breathing. And then after that point, you can open up to letting yourself experience anything that's appearing in your experience. So give yourself some chance to settle and become somewhat concentrated initially. And then the next exercise I'd like to suggest is a pointer to next week. It's looking at a quality of the mind called intention. So there's an intention that precedes every movement of body, speech, or mind. We can know we're going to speak before we speak. We can know we're going to move before we move. And as Anne noticed, we can know we're going to think before we think. So we can notice an intention for everything. And a way to begin, it's helpful to start paying attention to this intention. It's a kind of a key place because that's where our actions are born from, is that intention. So one way to start paying attention to intention is in your sitting. And this exercise I'm going to suggest comes from Jack Cornfield's Path with Heart. He suggests for a period of time, maybe once or twice this week, you could try picking a sitting where you do not have a specified period of time, a length of time for the sitting. So instead what you do is you sit until the strong urge to get up from the meditation has moved you three times. So you let yourself sit through that urge to get up. And the way you do that is by paying attention to that urge, wanting, wanting, wanting to get up. So you sit, you keep, you sit, and then at some point there'll be some kind of something that says, time to get up, time to go clean the refrigerator, whatever, time to leave the meditation. Notice that and see if you can just sit through it. Now it may just come and go immediately, or there may be a kind of a pull, a sense of a wanting, a sense of a wanting to get up. So a pulling, a feeling of almost being pulled off of your chair or off of your cushion. Just notice what that feels like. It doesn't often last very long, this pulling. Jack claims it doesn't last for more than a minute. We'll see. What's your experience? Does it last for more than a minute? So you let it pass, and then notice what has happened to your meditation since you've let that experience pass through you. Then the second time it comes up, do the same thing. Watch, witness that desire to get up. This is really the same kind of exercise I was suggesting last week, witnessing a desire and watching it pass. So let yourself feel it the second time, and then the third time it happens, you can get up. So what you start to see in this is not only the urge, but you'll also start to see the motivation. Why? What is it that moves us? Why do we want to get up? Am I bored? Am I frustrated? Am I angry? Do I feel like I have to do things? Do I feel busy? What is the motivation? So we start to uncover the motivations of our mind in this process. And we'll talk a lot about intention next week, along with the practice in our daily life. This practice of looking at intention is a really helpful one in our daily lives to begin to see why we do what we do. So thank you all for your attention.
