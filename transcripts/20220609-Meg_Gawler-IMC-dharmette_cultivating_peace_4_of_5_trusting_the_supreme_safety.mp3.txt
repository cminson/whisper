Welcome dear Sangha. It's lovely to be here with you all. Some of us have been
part of this online community since it started over two years ago and I
treasure this international Sangha. So I thank you for your presence. Today is the
fourth day in our theme this week of Cultivating Peace and yesterday I
appreciated the kind and thoughtful comments about my loss when my little
sister died. She became ill 12 years ago and died seven years ago and to be
honest I no longer experience her departure as a loss. She's still very
much present in my heart. Yes I had been grieving intensely and constantly for
about five months before being able to in a retreat setting dive into and then
swim in that ocean of tears and that was transformative to abide in a lucid
awareness of my pain and finally to let go of wanting or needing a different
reality and this was profoundly healing. I said when distress and loss give way
to peaceful acceptance then we are in a much better position to radiate our
peaceful contented abiding so that we can better offer support to others who are
suffering and this ability to remain peacefully contented with whatever the
Dharma has on offer for us is the condition that makes possible the last
of the necessary conditions for abiding in Samadhi the state from which the
liberating insights of awakening can arise. So the expression of peace that
we're exploring today is letting go into unification. Samadhi is usually
translated into English as concentration but personally I have a
strong preference for translating it as unification because in Pali the word
Samadhi literally means gathering together. We are happily composed not
needing anything to be different in our present moment experience. For me the
English word concentration has connotations of maybe coming from the
control tower which may suggest effort and it's interesting that in the vast
Pali canon with so many teachings there are no instructions that the Buddha gave
on what to do to enter into Samadhi. Rather he taught that what we must do to
advance on the Dharma path to awakening is to put in place the conditions that
allow for Samadhi to arrive spontaneously, effortlessly. Those conditions of
course begin with living ethically and with generosity and then in order to
step out of the bonds of samsara the first thing we have to do is to
establish receptive awareness, sati. This is the foundation of our practice both
inside and outside of meditation. Yesterday we spoke about living in
awareness with Satipatana, evoking a metaphor for the mind of living in a
messy house but one that has a quiet living room. So when we begin the Dharma
path clearly seeing dukkha both in our own unskillful mind states and in the
world around us we see the mess and we know there's work to do to clean out
all the other rooms of the house and this work starts with our commitment to
practicing continuous mindfulness the best we can. And as our mindfulness
practice develops we begin to get a feeling sometimes for resting in present
moment awareness. What I'd like to offer today is an instruction of how to
encourage these beautiful mental states like sustained mindfulness. So when
awareness arises and is strong the instruction is to notice, appreciate,
and relax into the experience of strong mindfulness. And we do this with all of
the conditions that allow us to enter into samadhi. So we begin with the subtle
joy of resting in this clear awareness. Our gladness to be on the Dharma path
also naturally allows for joy to arise. So when joy is present we see that we
notice it, we appreciate it, and we relax into it. And then joy gives way to
tranquility and it's important to notice tranquility when it's there. And then
noticing it, can we appreciate the moments of calm? Can we relax into the
calmness? And we've seen that when the mind is calm, peaceful contentment
naturally arises. And so we repeat the practice of noticing, appreciating, and
relaxing into the beautiful feeling of being content with things just as they
are. This practice helps us to become more familiar with these wholesome
states. And with familiarity it becomes easier to enter into them. But we do
need clear awareness when dwelling in wholesome states because sometimes it
can be tempting to get caught in chasing after these beautiful states of
mind. But we know that they're conditioned, they come and go. So if we can stay soft
and relaxed in the well-being of contentment, the door is wide open for
Samadhi to arise. And now I would like to read to you from a beautiful teaching
by Gil that he taught when he was teaching a course at the Institute of
Studies in Berkeley on Samadhi. Gil says, to allow yourself to settle into a state
that's broad, expansive, it helps to be relaxed, to have faith, to have some
modicum of stability, and it helps to be mindful. Part of mindfulness is that we
start noticing how we're tense, stuck, how we have concerns. And we find a way
to live at peace, conflict-free, with whatever arises. And we heal the hurt
and the wars that exist inside us. Mindfulness sees all this. And perhaps
is able to meet it with kindness, friendliness. As our attention settle, we
settle into being here. And we start to feel like it's actually more interesting
to be here than to be elsewhere. So part of the movement of mindfulness and
Samadhi is a clarifying of our interest. If you try to settle on the breath, or
do you have all these thoughts, is that you're more interested in your thoughts.
It's not easy to convince the mind that it's more interesting to be here.
Distracted thoughts might arise and we let them fall away. And it becomes more
interesting to keep the focus on the safety of the harbor that we're going
to. It means that we gather together all the energies, and there is a phenomenal
sense of safety to be found in the state of Samadhi. We keep coming back,
leaving distractions go, and just settling in with the simplicity of being
here. And contentment arises. The mind is fully engaged, and we have the
encouragements of joy and happiness that help us to stay on track. It begins to
feel so good to be here, and this is very healing work. Samadhi can move
toward deeper and deeper states of equanimity. So we can develop Samadhi
into a very deep equanimity, where being here and settled is so strong and safe
that the mind does not really react to what is going on. It's not something to
be believed, this process. It will be revealed to you when you've entered the
temple under the tree on your riverbank, and it brings wisdom for how to be in
the world. Doing this deep work and truly being here, discovering this Samadhi of
just being here, transforms us into peacemakers in this world. It's not an
escape, but a sacred preparation of caring for each other in this world we live
in. So thank you to Gil for this. Samadhi is the condition for liberating insights
to arise, and we begin to trust the supreme safety of dwelling in a unified
mind where no part of us is left out. So for the next 24 hours it would be nice
to experiment with these wholesome mind states that allow Samadhi to arise, and
when you see one of them, whether it's joy or tranquility or contentment, take a
moment to notice, to appreciate, and to relax into that a little bit. And in this
way you'll become more and more familiar with these mind states and they
will arise more easily. So thank you very much for your attention, and thank you
for your practice.
