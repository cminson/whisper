 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. The Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California I want to offer this whole poem, which I read a few lines from. This is from the book, The First Three Women, Poems of the Early Buddhist Nuns. It's from one of the Pali Canon collections called the Terigata. These are the utterances from the nuns and the women who were awoken. So this is from Jenta. That's her name. For many years, this friend and I have traveled together, sometimes wandering in circles, sometimes taking the long way around. There were days when I thought I couldn't go on. There were days when I thought I was finally beaten. It's scary to give all of yourself to just one thing. What if you don't make it? Oh, my heart, you don't have to go it alone. Train yourself to train just a little more gently. So this poem has been ringing. There's a little echo here. So this poem has been... Do you hear the echo? Yeah, that's kind of sick. Okay, I'm going to try it again. That seems to have gone away, huh? Okay. Yeah, this poem has been ringing in my heart for the last week or so. It's one of the teachers, I think, reading those lines in guided meditations really touched me quite deeply. So I thought I'll share some reflections about some lines in the poem. And our first one is, we have a friend on the path. And so this poem spoke about the seven friends known as the seven factors of awakening, and that is the qualities of our mind and heart that can accompany us along this Dharma path. And a few things that came up for me in this poem, it's kind of the humanness, the humbleness of the practice. And this nun said that for many years, this friend and I have traveled together. And as I was reflecting for myself, it feels like this might be a lifetime, a lifetime traveling with this friend together. And then she said, sometimes wandering in circles and sometimes taking a long way around. How many of us would feel this? Sometimes we seem to just be wandering in circles or a long way around. And for me, it's the sense that sometimes the habitual patterns of stress had a deep conditioning in us. It could be lifetime conditioning when we were very young and gets conditioned. Through the practice we get to meet them. But it feels like a long way because they have it, our heart, our heart to kind of tame them or make peace with them. And they can come very strongly. And I remember this one vividly, that through the practice, mindfulness practice, I remember just noticing how often I have this calculated mind, particularly around prices. And I would drive on the highway and looking at the gas price, big bulletin board, and immediately my mind would start calculating. And I realized, wow, you know, and notice this was a deep conditioning because when I grew up in rural countryside in China, and we had very little, and ever since I was young, I was taught to be very thrifty. And I would go to the soy sauce shop to go fill the bottle. And we used to take the bottle to go fill the soy sauce. And I would give the bottle and make sure the person filled it up to the brim. I wouldn't give up if I don't do it. And that was that long, deep conditioning. And I noticed how often I would stand by the grocery line and just looking at the prices around me. I didn't need any of them. I already have everything in my shopping cart. But my mind would just start calculating. But with the practice, little by little, little by little, at some point I stood by the grocery line. I noticed, oh, I was no longer calculating. Wow. Wow, when did that stop? But I don't find it anymore. I was rather liberating for me. I was realizing how much space I had in my mind standing there and this kind of long running pattern finally kind of no longer there. And I bet that had taken years for that to come to an end. And for lots of us, this may well be the case. There are still other deep rooted patterns that are coming up again and again. You know, Sinan had this thought that there were days when I thought I couldn't go on. And there were days when I thought I was finally beaten. Some of those patterns coming up, you feel like you had enough of it, but they don't have enough of you. They still come. And yet, what choices do we have? What choices do we have? It can be scary to give all of ourselves to this just one thing, the Dharma path, ending stress. What if you don't make it? What if you don't make it? I confess, I had thoughts like that in my head before, right? What if you don't make it? But I would say, as we practice more and more, realize sooner or later there is no other way. Because this mind are really good at finding new ways to suffer. You may dodge this one and quickly find another one to replace it or find a different way. And by the way, just keep spinning. And the good news is we don't have to go alone. We don't have to go alone. We have friends on the path. And the last line really touched me deeply. Train yourself to train just a little more gently. Train yourself to train. We are going through a training. One of my teachers like to use this phrase very often. We practice, practice. We don't practice result. We practice, practice. And gradually we learn to practice more and more wisely. It doesn't mean that we won't go around in circles from time to time. But we learn from it. And then the most important thing is to train ourselves just a little more gently. Because again, do we have a different option? Do we want to train a little more harshly? It doesn't work that way. So learn to really be gentle with ourselves, with others, with the whole world. And the world will be so much better when we all train to train a little more gently. So thank you everyone for being here together.
