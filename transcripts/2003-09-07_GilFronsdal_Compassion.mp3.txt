 I would like today to talk about compassion, to explore the topic a little bit with you all. It's been on my mind a fair amount lately, partly because I'm getting ready to make a small presentation on compassion in a few weeks, but also just for various other reasons it's been in my mind. And I think most of you know that compassion is a very important quality of Buddhist practice, a very important quality that gets evoked through Buddhist practice. And sometimes it's said in Buddhism that the two wings of Buddhism are wisdom and compassion. I've been thinking a lot about compassion in relationship to service, offering ourselves and trying to help other people in some way or other, to be of service for others. And as my understanding, the call for service in Buddhism comes from the inner movement of compassion or empathy. And that there is no external authority in Buddhism that says, thou shalt be of service. You have to do this, that you have to kind of go to the Cambodia and work with the AIDS patients or whatever you might want to do. There's no one that's judging you saying this is what you should do or you should align your life this way. And there's no kind of God that's telling you you should do this. But rather, the call for service comes from the inner movement within us when it happens that is based on compassion, based on empathic response to the suffering around us. And that's interesting. Daniel Goldman in his book, Emotional Intelligence, makes a distinction between empathy and sympathy. He claims that the person who coined the word empathy in its modern psychological usage distinguished it from sympathy, where sympathy was a very general sense of, a very general kind of distant sense of concern or pity for the plight of others, concern for the plight of others. Whereas empathy was more, not just the abstract, kind of more distant concern, but rather a real sense of feeling or understanding in some way the suffering other people are going through. And different people will have empathy in different ways, I think. Some people it's more understanding kind of the vehicle and some people it's seemingly more the vehicles through the heart perhaps or more through kind of emotional resonance that they seem to feel. And then from empathy then comes, can come then, the motivation to try to want to alleviate that suffering in others. The motivation would be good. There's other people who didn't suffer so much and want to help or do something for them. And so compassion, Buddhism, Karuna, is not just empathy but is this movement of the heart, movement that wants to somehow alleviate the suffering of others and wants somehow to respond to it in some way that is of service, of aid, of help. So the call for service in Buddhism is one that comes from inner authority, inner sense and inner movement. And different people will feel it in different ways. Different people will feel it in different times of their lives. Different people feel it in different degrees. And there's no basis that I know of particularly to judge people as better or worse because of the degree of empathy and degree of compassion they have. And it's dangerous to judge because people's response to the world is very different, a wide range of differences. When I studied with Robert Aikenrashi in Hawaii, he's a Zen master, I studied with him for two years. And he was one of the preeminent engaged Buddhist teachers in America, especially at his time when he was at the peak of his teaching career. And he helped found the Buddhist Peace Fellowship and he would go off to places like Guatemala and be a witness for peace, follow along people who were threatened to be assassinated and just be kind of a presence there. And often just having an American present would often protect their lives. And he wrote about engaged Buddhism. And so there are people who came to Hawaii to study with him because they themselves had a very strong interest in engaged Buddhism, politically engaged, socially engaged Buddhism. And so they were kind of like a wing of the meditation center of these social activist Buddhists. And then there were another wing of people who mostly were people who kind of happened to be living in Hawaii and got interested in Zen practice. And he was a Zen teacher and they were very sincere and committed Zen students and I think really good hearted people. But they had no motivation for social activism. And then there was this little tension then in the community between these two people. And the tension came mostly from the people who were social activists who felt, if you're going to be a real good Buddhist, you have to be socially active. How can you be a Buddhist if you're not socially active? And these poor people, not only poor, but these people who felt that didn't feel motivated in the same social activist kind of way felt kind of like, well gee, I'm just doing this wonderful thing. I thought, it's really important for me and I'm living my life and why am I suddenly feeling so bad? To his credit, Robert Aiken, you never felt a ripple of his kind of judgment or concern from Robert Aiken. He seemed to embrace and hold everybody equally and wasn't any kind of feeling from him. You had to express your Buddhism in any particular way. But still, for those people who are called to do something called, loosely service, in Buddhism the call for it, the authority for the call, the motivation for it, comes from compassion, this inner movement from within us primarily. Sometimes it can come from the outside if service is taken on as a practice in the sense that I'm going to put myself in this kind of activity because I can learn from it. It'll stir things up for me. It'll help me in my mindfulness practice or whatever practice I'm doing. And so it's done pragmatically, not so much to be of service because that environment is helping your own practice. So it's not necessarily from the same kind of inner motivation of compassion. And where does that come from? Where does compassion come from? Where does that call the movement for being of service or this empathic response? I want to do something for the suffering of others. Where does that come from? If you look at the early Buddhist discourses, teachings of the Buddha, my impression is that compassionate response to the world is just assumed in the sense that there's never a rationale for it particularly. It doesn't explain why this is a good idea or why you should be this way. Just assume that some people are this way or this is the way things are, just an assumption about this. And if you look at the story of the Buddha's enlightenment, after he was enlightened, it said he spent some time just living in the bliss of his enlightenment. And then at some point, and he was disinclined to teach other people what he had discovered, disinclined to help other people become liberated. And then the god Brahma, the great god of Indian pantheon, kind of like the Zeus of India, he divined that the Buddha didn't want to teach, was reluctant to teach. So he went to the Buddha and said to the Buddha, in short 10, you should teach. What he said was, please open the doors of the deathless, open the doors to liberation for people. And the Buddha, it's unsaid, kind of surveyed the world and realized that there were people in the world who had but little dust across their eyes. So you could easily wipe it away and they could see. And because there were people who had little dust in their eyes, he said, oh yeah, maybe I can't teach. But then he made a very interesting statement. He said, the doors of the deathless are already open. So he was asked to open them and he said, no, it's already open. It's not up to him to open them. Maybe it's already here. It's already open right here in this room, you know, in your eyes right now. What would that mean? The doors of the deathless are already open for you right now. And then he started, and then he went off to teach and he spent the next 45 years or so teaching. And it said that his 45 years of ministry, of teaching, was an expression of great compassion, his motivation, was an expression, manifestation of his compassion he felt for the world. And it's quite common in traditional Buddhists in particular for Buddhists to be quite moved and inspired, sometimes to the point of tears, of thinking about the compassionate activity of the Buddhist, 45 years of stretching himself, extending himself for the benefit of all beings. So what I wanted to point to here in the story is the use of the God Brahma to inspire, to prompt the Buddha to go and teach. And now we can take this literally. We can do many ways of understanding this, but I'd like to suggest to take it a little bit more mythically or maybe metaphorically. In, there have been some scholars, I don't know how good the scholarship is for this kind of theory, but there's some scholarship that says that in the ancient world people did not understand very well where their thoughts came from. These thoughts would be there and they kind of, and sometimes they attributed it to some external voice. In the early Buddhist tradition you find a lot of expressions of the expression of voice in the sky. Some voice in the sky told me something. And I never heard any Buddhist start to explain what this is, but from this scholarly kind of theory the idea is that people don't necessarily, the old days didn't know about thoughts and inspirations and creative ideas where they came from. And so the idea of creativity was your own, was kind of foreign, it was like your muse that came and inspired you somehow. It was coming from external, they wouldn't take credit for it. So this voice in the sky. So Brahma also here could be seen, the Buddha had this wonderful dialogue, this wonderful inspiration, this request to teach, this movement to teach, to meet people in their suffering. But he didn't know where it came from. He didn't have a clear way to go, this is where it is, it's kind of assumed, it's just there. And so he had to attribute it somewhere, so he attributed it to something external to Brahma. So this probably doesn't hold much Buddhological water. At least I think most traditional Buddhist teachers will just kind of think everyone's talking about it as ridiculous. But whether it's true or not, whether it's just accurate interpretation or not of the story of Brahma and the Buddha. This idea of compassion being assumed, the compassion arising from who knows where, it's just there. For some people it's there in particular ways, other people it's there in different ways. For some people it's there for their family, for some people it's there for people in far away, and for some people it's there for animals or whatever, but it's just kind of there. And the efforts try to rationalize why you should be compassionate, you know, probably all kinds of wonderful exercises for that. But you know in Buddhism, in early Buddhism, as I understand, it's just kind of there, or it's not there, it's kind of assumed. And it expresses itself in such things and the teachings of the Buddha where he says a wise person should be concerned about what brings benefit to oneself and what brings benefit to others. So you know what brings benefit, what helps alleviate suffering and improves lives of oneself and others. What I love about that expression of the of the of the Pali Buddha is that there isn't a sharp divide between self and other here. A wise person is equally concerned with one's own benefit as with the benefit of someone else. Sometimes in Buddhism you have a sharp divide, especially in Western Buddhism is my impression, much more than an Asian Buddhism between self and other. You're almost like you have to sacrifice yourself in order to take care of other people. You know if you take care of yourself that's selfish, but taking care of others that's altruistic. And in order to be as a good human being you're supposed to be altruistic. I think there's a thread of teaching in the West about the importance of being altruistic and the importance of not being selfish that I think sometimes is then overlaid onto Indian Buddhism and the traditional Buddhist teachings. And so the assumption is that Buddhism is also teaching people to be altruistic. And it's overlaid like in the Jataka tales where the stories where the Buddha sacrifices his body for hungry tigress. Oh it's a great example of being altruistic. However the traditional rationale for why the Buddha fed himself to hungry tigress was not just because of compassion, it was because the Buddha was doing this for his own practice. He needed to acquire a lot of merit, a lot of character building in order to develop the kind of character that allows a person eventually in a future lifetime to become a Buddha. And so the Buddha was looking for opportunities to build his character. So the tigress was there great. So in the West we read the Jataka tales, oh that's altruism. It is a kind of altruism, but built into it also is this idea that he's doing it for this other purpose. And in India as I understand it, and as scholars have talked about it, it's divide between self and others that's so sharp sometimes in the West doesn't exist. That what brings benefit to oneself in a spiritual way would bring benefit to the world, and being benefit to the world is partly being bringing benefit to oneself. The two go close together. You don't sacrifice yourself in order to bring benefit to others. But you certainly motivate to bring benefit to others, but to sacrifice yourself or squash or do violence to yourself or ignore how to take care of yourself is kind of a foreign idea in my reading of Indian Buddhism. So wise person benefits oneself and benefits others. It's an expression I think of compassion. In the Mahayana tradition this idea of compassion being assumed or it just arises from who knows where just there and then you live that way. It's there in some ways. It's not there you continue your life. It's expressed I believe in the idea that compassion arises from emptiness. One of the key spiritual experiences of the Mahayana which exists in the early Buddhist tradition, the Theravada tradition, but they don't just talk, they don't use the same vocabulary to talk about it. But in the Mahayana we talk about emptiness. Experiencing the emptiness of all things, experiencing the emptiness. And somehow from the experience of emptiness, the emptiness of self, that emptiness and compassion are almost anonymous or in emptiness there's compassion. Compassion is the response of an empty mind, an empty heart. That somehow it just and then sometimes explained well when the boundaries of self and other fall away, when the hard boundaries, the hard separation of me, the here, you, there, then the natural response is one of compassion. You find a lot of expression in the natural response is compassion when you're from a place of emptiness. And there's kind of reasoning about that maybe or how that works, but I like to suggest it kind of doesn't really explain much at all. It just you know why should it be there? Why should compassion be there when through emptiness? It just kind of it just assumed it's part of the human makeup that this is what human beings can do sometimes. It arises from within. The story of the Buddha and Brahma has also some significance metaphorically here that by extension the Buddha sat in meditation and attained his liberation. And then as he got ready to leave his bliss of liberation, I started getting ready to go out into the world again. That's where this movement of compassion, the question of compassion, exploring of it, the doubting of it, the hesitation to live it came into play for the Buddha. It's a very dynamic place. This place where we're leaving meditation, we're leaving the depth of our intimacy with spiritual life in some way and then start entering into the world again or enter into relationship again, go back to work or do something. And this is actually a very important area of Buddhist practice is that movement back into the world so called, back into relationships, back into our social world. And then in that interface there's a lot of things that can happen and to pay attention to that interface, to pay attention to what happens in your heart, to pay attention to what happens in the feelings and responses you have to the people you encounter as you meet them, to pay attention to the motivations that might arise, to be in discussion with yourself about some of those motivations and explorations and doubts that might arise. And then in that place, that's the place where compassion will begin to arise. The idea of emptiness, compassion arising out of emptiness also has the idea that if you allow yourself to stay sensitive as you come out of meditation, what will your heart do? What will happen in that context with other people? If you get busy, inherit and run around and forget about your meditation and or shut down and get preoccupied in various kinds of ways, it's very hard to feel compassion. It's very hard to feel this empathy. And some people choose not to feel compassion or to feel empathy because it's too painful. They'd rather not or they're afraid of it or they feel it's a burden or they feel, oh, then all the shoulds of my life will come into play. I'm supposed to be a good person. I'm supposed to know all these, we've inherited these ideas of what it means to be a good person in life. And therefore, when I feel suffering or others, I have to kind of click into action and be a certain way. I don't know if this is a good story to tell. It's probably not. I mean, in relationship to this talk exactly, but it comes to mind as I'm talking here of, I apologize. But I taught a retreat many years ago in Kansas City. And we did it at a convent. We kind of rented a wing of a convent to do this retreat. And so we came there for opening evening and there were some of the nuns in the convent were there to kind of welcome us and give us a little bit introduction to how to use the place and be helpful for us a little bit the opening evening. And people were arriving for the retreat. And this woman arrived, you know, who, this woman arrived and to do the retreat. It seemed like a nice woman to me, you know. And she arrived and when she entered into the room, came close to me to introduce herself to me. These two sisters who were standing next to me kind of, you know, showing us what to do, they suddenly snapped into attention like they were in the military. Like almost like a heel, click together. You know, I looked. And what I learned a little bit later was that the woman who come into the retreat, she had recently, not that recently, but some years ago, left the convent and gone back into lay life and become a therapist and interested in Buddhism and practice and all that. But when she was in the convent, where she'd been in the convent 25, 30 years, she had been very superior to these two younger women. Very superior. And the old conditioning was there. The sergeant is there. And so this idea of being a good person, you know, snapping too. And, you know, so there's various reasons why people might want to avoid, you know, trying to feel the suffering, avoid feeling suffering in the world and distract ourselves. And we feel overwhelmed by it and burdened by it. But somehow to explore that interface and what happens to you as you encounter people, as you counter suffering in the world, and to see it as an extension of your practice to negotiate and engage in that part of life, I think is a very important part of practice. I would say that it's probably half of practice to do that. I think this is a very powerful story and maybe it isn't for everyone, but at least, you know, for me. It comes from the stories of the Buddha's life, the Vinaya. Now at that time, a certain monk was suffering from dysentery and lay where he had fallen down in his own excrement. As the Buddha was walking about, he came to the lodging of that monk. When he saw that monk lying where he had fallen in his own excrements, he went over to him and said, brother, what ails you? I have dysentery. But is there anyone taking care of your brother? No. Why is it, brother, that the monks do not take care of you? I am useless to the monks. Therefore, the monks do not take care of me. Then the Buddha said to the Venerable Ananda, his attendant, go Ananda and fetch water. We will wash the brother. When Ananda had fetched water, the Buddha poured it out and the Venerable Ananda washed that brother all over. Then the Buddha, taking him by the head and the Venerable Ananda, taking him by the feet, together they laid him on a bed. Then the Buddha, in this connection and on this occasion, gathered the order of monks together and questioned him, monks, is there in such a lodging a brother who is sick? He is calling the task. And they said, yes, there is. And what ails that brother? That brother has dysentery. But brother, is there anyone taking care of him? No. I am trying to imagine what they are feeling when the Buddha is asking these questions. It seems so matter of fact, oh no. I would imagine they would feel a little bit. Then the Buddha said, why not? Why do the monks not take care of him? They answer, that brother is useless to the order of monks. That is why the monks do not take care of him. Is this for real? So, anyway, seemingly some monks can be kind of seemingly cold hearted or indifferent or clueless. So the Buddha says to them, monks, you have no mother and no father to take care of you. If you will not take care of each other, who else will? Monks, those who would attend to me, let them attend to the sick. Those who attend to me, let them attend to the sick. Part of the context for this last saying is that in Indian religions, in general, some of them, certainly in Buddhism, one of the ways to express your devotion and to practice devotional aspects of Buddhism, which is traditionally a very important part of the person's practice, is to be of service to your guru, to your teacher, or to make offerings, things like that. So you're taking notes? So, sorry, we're not India. I'm in trouble now. So, it's a very powerful form of religious practice in order to do offerings, especially someone like who's a Buddha. And people down through the ages will still be offering flowers and all kinds of offerings to a statue of the Buddha in the name of the Buddha because it's such a powerful field of merit that helps in the creation of practice and develops a person's practice and all that. And so, in the hierarchy of Buddhist practice, the person of highest merit is the Buddha himself. So, people often do them, you know, that's where they want to do their merit making is in their relationship to a Buddha. And here the Buddha says, if you want to attend to me, attend to the sick. The Buddha is equating taking care of the sick to the power and significance of worshiping, taking care of the guru. Isn't that great? Now, there's a kind of a Jesus kind of thing that's similar, isn't there? What is it? What is it? What is the quote from the Gospels? It's like that. Is there another one that's also like that? Is that the one? Yeah. Say it a little louder. So, attending the sick. So, the idea of compassion, compassionate service again, that somehow taking care of the sick, taking care of those who are distressed, taking care of those who are suffering is a form of religious practice in this traditional style of practice where you take care of the guru and it's a kind of a devotional act in itself. If you want to practice devotion in Buddhism, one of the ways of practicing devotion is you take care of those people who need help. It's said that in Buddhism, one of the functions of compassion is, or empathy, is to see others as equal to yourself in their suffering. And this is a very important quality because it's very easy in wanting to help take care of other people to see yourself as better than, or you're up here as a helper and they're down there, poor person needs your help. And people can get very resentful if they feel like you're kind of like up here and kind of helping them. But if you can share, if they feel like you're really sharing, if you share their suffering in some way, they feel like you're meeting them as an equal, there's a whole different level of care and response that'll happen. And so it's said in Buddhism that part of the function of compassion is to help a person meet the others as equal in this field of suffering and not different from. I know some people don't like the word help, but prefer the word be of service because help implies you're up there on dry land, you help them up, you're helping them. But service is more like a servant, you're going to be a servant for people. My Zen teacher, Mel Weitzman, he was very clear over and over again that those people who became ordained as Zen priests, that they were becoming servants. And so rather than having a higher status in the community, they were actually supposed to be the kind of lowest status in the community. They were supposed to clean the toilets and just offer whatever kind of simplest help that needed to be done around it. There's supposed to be servants rather than leaders or whatever, to be of service rather than to be of help. Some people like make that distinction. I gave a talk some years ago on compassion and then someone in the audience came up to me and gave me this article that he'd written. In April last year, I witnessed a remarkable act of life saving. I was one of four men in a cancer ward recovering from surgery. My surgery was to remove melanoma cancer in my lymph system. My recovery was going well and I was able for long periods of the day to observe quite comfortably the comings and goings in the ward. Opposite me was a man in his early 70s who had his esophagus and stomach removed and he was trying to cope with the trauma of this outcome and to learn to feed via tubes that went into his body. His body was not reacting at all well to the diet or to the feeding process. In early one morning, he had failed to reach the washroom in time while trying desperately to do so. He was shaken, humiliated and dejected. The nurse was just going off duty. The nurse just going off duty helped him back to bed and settled him down but he looked awful. The new nurse came in, attended to each of us, but I could see her watching this patient at all times. She dispatched her time with each of the other three patients, me included, quickly and efficiently, then turned her attention almost undividedly through her shift to the older man. She brought in experts and did other things that I'm sure were technically and professionally correct, but it was the quality of the care, the way she spent time with him, the compassion she brought to this humiliated, depressed and defeated human being that really caught my interest. She held his hand often, spoke comfortingly to him, explaining what she was arranging and encouraging him to feel okay about how the day was unfolding. She was physically present with him frequently during the day. By the end of the shift, near the end of the day, he was looking cheerful, communicating with us and moving with some degree of confidence and comfort. Late in the afternoon, I moved over to his bed and told him he was looking good and that I thought he was very brave. He smiled and said he was feeling a lot better than he had in the morning and that at the beginning of the day, after his accident in the hallway, he felt his life slipping away. He felt useless, helpless and held out little hope of coping. He said, I felt my last day had come. I believe this might well have been true. What was important for understanding was what was going on, was that he believed this feeling. And he had consequences for how he started the day. The compassion in the nursing process may have had as much to do or more with his recovery as any technical practice that was provided to him. Perhaps the compassion gave him a chance. He was still in the ward when I left and I don't know how he did subsequently. Weeks later, I wrote a letter to the hospital administrators applauding the nurses work. Sometimes it said that that kind of compassionate care of someone else can save their lives because that can be that important to what we're doing when meeting someone else. I wonder how often people shortchange or inhibit their compassion because they feel that the way that they can respond to the world is not going to have an effect or they feel, what can I do? I can't really do anything. And one of the things I think we've learned over the years is that often it's not necessary to do anything, but often just sharing how you are in the presence of someone else. Just sharing your own sense of empathy, your own sense of suffering and just being present in an empathic way is just enough in and of itself or very powerful in and of itself. And that if you know nothing else to do, just doing that can be very helpful. So is compassion something we can just assume? Maybe that's the wrong way of saying it, but where does compassion come from? It just seems to arise in contact with suffering. Though it's said that people can develop their compassion and their empathy, and some people are motivated to do so. I know that in the world of therapy, that therapists who work with sex abusers, one strategy they have is for people who are severe, involved in severe sex abuse, perpetrators of it, who have no empathy for their victims, that sometimes they'll show videos to them of victims tearfully talking about their experience of being a victim. And only in seeing the tremendous distress and the tears of these victims will they begin understanding what's going on for the other person. Or sometimes they'll give an account, the therapist will give the person to abuse an account of someone and say, okay now write an essay or write out what you think the victim's experience was. And so they'd have to write in their first person account what the experience was like. And these things then can evoke a certain degree of empathy and compassion. So I believe that compassion and empathy, even though I think it can be developed. And then the question is, is it something that any of us would like to spend time developing? Is there value in that? Is there value exploring and developing our capacity for empathy and compassion? Or is it so difficult to hold domain of it? Or does it have a place in their lives? How valuable is it? How precious is it to cultivate compassion? When you realize that it might save someone's life, there's no monetary value you can put on how important it is to develop and cultivate compassion. And who knows when you'll be called on? Who knows when you'll have an encounter where you might save someone's life or the equivalent? So the two wings of Buddhism, wisdom and compassion. And the wisdom part is said to come, is very much involved in mindfulness practice, insight practice, learning how to be present in a very clear way, developing our capacity to see and be present. Compassion arises from that clarity of seeing. But also compassion can be something we cultivate and develop. So we come to a situation and it's the response, it's the natural response. And we've learned how to respond in a wise way. So that's the extent of my thinking this week on this topic of compassion. And I feel a little bit like I'm kind of ending nowhere. But I just kind of, this is the end of my words. Oh, it's also time to end. So may each of you discover or may each of you appreciate the tremendous preciousness of compassion as it makes its way through this world. Thank you all. I'll see you in a few weeks.
