Practice Note: Working with Tension

I wanted to say something this morning about practicing 
with tension. I think most people carry some tension in 
their bodies, in their minds. Some people a lot more 
than others.  It’s interesting, with your attention, to single 
out the tension you feel, whether it’s in the shoulders, 
the stomach, the jaw , the forehead, or anywhere  – the 
breathing, the rib cage. It’s certainly helpful to identify it 
and then to relax, to soften it, easy.  
 
One of the great ways to relax, sometimes, is to feel in 
touch with the place of tension and then as you breathe, 
imagine you’re breathing through it, o r breathing with 
that place. And then as you exhale, just letting go and 
relaxing with the exhale. J ust send a wave of relaxation, 
or intention, to soften that place. Sometimes it’s easy to 
do it, and sometimes it’s not so easy. But when it’s not 
easy, that’s when it’s most interesting  – to just stay 
there without a big agenda. Just stay and be in touch 
with, be present for the place of tension , and then just 
breathe gently. Just keep breathing, breathing with the 
tension, with the holding you have . And if, after a while, 
it doesn’t let go easily, then let go of any intention or 
desire to have it go away. Just stay with the tension in a very relaxed, open way. Just feel it and just breathe. 
Perhaps you  can imagine that the breath moves into 
that space and expands it as you breathe in , and then 
relaxes a s you breathe out. Just do that – it might be for 
a long time  – but just s tay with it.   
 
Sometimes as you do that , you can become aware of 
the connection between the tension and certain 
feelings, or tension and certain thoughts  that are going 
on. It’s interesting to watch and see if there are  certain 
patterns of thinking going on that might, in some subtle 
way, be reinforcing, or keeping, or creating, the tension 
itself. Or there mig ht be certain emotions tha t are in the 
background  fueling that tension. It might not be evident 
at first , but as you gently stay there, y ou just stay and 
hang out , and try to stay with the breath as best you can 
– but breathing through, brea thing with the place of 
tension – very ge nerously, spaciously, without any 
agenda.  
 
Do it for a long period of time – that’s what it takes. 
Stay, stay, stay there and then see what gets revealed 
as you do that. Just hang out. Discover. It’s a very 
interesting thing to do.  
 
It’s also possible to  do it in walking meditation, to some 
degree. It’s much easier, I t hink, to do it in sitting 
meditation, at least for me . In walking meditation, the 
idea is to set a steady, easy, relaxed pace as you walk, and then hold to it. In walking meditation, the te nsion 
you carry might play out to take you away from the 
easy, steady connection to your pace. As you feel that 
how it pulls you away from that pace, in a variety of 
ways, and then see if you can come back to the pace. 
Come back.  
 
I hope that’s helpful fo r you, those of you who might just 
happen to have some tension.
