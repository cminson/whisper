Well, it's wonderful to see everyone.
People are slowly, slowly arriving.
Hello.
So shall we begin by just meditating for a little while?
Yeah.
Good idea.
Okay.
Okay.
Maybe take a couple of deep breaths.
It's kind of helpful to relax that way.
Deep breaths engage the parasympathetic nervous system,
which is relaxation.
Keep your bath kind of straight.
Alert.
Open.
And relaxed.
And letting the thinking mind.
Drop, drop down.
Into the body.
Into the earth.
Into the feet.
Aware of the feet.
The calves.
Aware of the legs.
Aware of the hips.
The sensations in the hips.
And the base of the spine.
The base of the, under the navel, the hara.
And noticing the rising and falling of the breath.
Belly, chest.
Aware of the back, the strong, stable back.
Aware of the shoulders where we carry a lot of tension.
If you'd like, you could raise your shoulders and squeeze them a little bit and then relax them.
And aware of the arms and hands.
And the throat.
And the head.
Maybe picking out a place in your head.
And you can definitely feel sensations.
And noticing how they keep changing.
And we could extend that to everything.
The entire body.
From microsecond to microsecond.
It's changing.
Being aware of sounds.
There's no beginning or middle or end to a sound.
When we pay attention, we notice that nothing that we are aware of is really graspable.
We think we are a certain identity.
But where is that?
And on a certain level.
All day long our identities keep changing.
We're like pieces, identity pieces.
Husband, wife, mother, gardener, friend, neighbor.
If you're having whatever you're doing.
You're like a shop shopper.
Like a grocery store.
I said there are seven forms of consciousness.
Sense perceptions.
Eyes, ears, nose, taste, touch.
The thinking mind that's putting this together.
And the selfing mind, the me, me, me mind that's so touchy and sensitive and tends to explode or feel sad.
That's one of those.
And then there's another mind that isn't changing.
That knows all those minds.
That knows thoughts, knows the reactivities, knows the sound, knows the sensation.
Awareness.
Awareness.
In a famous verse from the Tibetan Book of the Dead,
the author wrote, this present mind that is unobstructed, alert, is the primordial Buddha,
which means awareness.
And yet it does not exist anywhere and is nowhere to be found.
This vividness, this aliveness, alert, vibrant,
not stagnant, not dead, not unconscious.
That potential energy is where you find awareness.
That is awareness.
Awareness.
Has no boundaries, like space.
It includes everything. It includes our reactivities.
But it's not reactive.
It's sublime.
It's peaceful.
It may be contracting in fear or sadness or anger or grasping, wanting, but awareness doesn't.
It just knows that.
That's why it's called the refuge.
This is worth devoting our life to.
Maybe for you.
It's what is true.
So let's just relax and be natural.
Be simple.
There's an analogy where a bird will fly far away from its nest, looking for food or whatever.
It always comes back to its nest.
It always comes home.
This could be our abiding intention to come home to who we truly are.
This accommodating, generous awareness.
This is our wonderful nature that is innately accommodating, kind.
Doesn't reject anything.
Isn't in conflict with anything.
Doesn't hold on to anything.
It's always here, waiting for us.
All we need to do is notice it.
Just turn our focus around.
90 degrees.
I may have told you this before but there's this analogy about our mind chasing after thoughts.
Like you throw a stick to a dog and they'll chase after that stick.
But if you throw a stick at a lion, he'll turn around and face you.
And then you don't throw any more sticks.
Just relax.
Into the lion's gentle gaze.
Open.
As we meditate, we become more attuned to this mind.
Not the other eight, this mind of awareness.
And we meditators have this unique problem.
We lose our mindfulness.
Nobody else complains that they lost their mindfulness than us meditators because we miss it.
And after a while, our awareness misses us.
It kind of follows us around like a dog, a puppy.
Easier and easier to pick up.
Let's return.
Okay, thank you.
So this chapter that we just read, it has two parts.
The first part is about intention.
And the whole book up to this point has been about developing our intention.
Which is the grace in aging, how aging through aging, we develop this intention to awaken.
She went through, you know, the chaos, the suffering and then the surrender.
To awareness, the surrender to awakening.
Simple awakening.
It's so easy. I mean, you're all awake, right? You're all conscious.
You're not dead right now. You're awake.
And the rest of the book, including this chapter, are about conditions that are conducive to awakening that help us, keep us, make it easier for us to abide in awakening.
So there are two minds. There's the absolute mind of awareness that's always here.
That's our inner nature. That's who you are.
You are Buddha.
All we have to do is notice that.
And then there's the relative mind, those other minds that I mentioned.
And these conditions are all about the relative mind.
Or maybe developing a wholesome sense of self, rather than an unwholesome sense of self that's grasping and clinging and averting from things and ignorant in the sleep of ignorance.
A wholesome mind that will incline us toward awareness.
So intention will incline us toward a wholesome mind, an ethical mind, and an ethical mind will incline us toward opening, toward kindness,
toward love, toward generosity, toward patience, toward diligence, toward joy.
And we want this more and more.
And it feeds on itself.
One ethical act feeds our freedom.
And the freedom feels good. And we don't want to say a bad thing about somebody.
Because it feels contradictory.
So we'll divide into some small groups now and maybe begin by checking in and then following that by if there are passages that you brought to the group,
maybe you could read the passages and we could discuss what you found inspiring.
And then after that, if you would like to discuss some of the prompts that I provided or that your group leader will will provide,
that should give us a lot of wonderful things to share and talk about.
I've been thinking about this, about why we're here, the refuge of Sangha, how this benefits us.
And it's just so wonderful to really share our journey with each other.
I mean, we're all on this path and we're not alone.
So to share our journey with others and be heard, be affirmed, and to listen to others' journey is a unique support of Sangha.
Okay, so we're going to divide into groups now.
Maybe groups of four or five, Joe, does that seem okay?
Well, with five facilitators, we're looking at five to six.
We had six facilitators, including you.
Well, if your group doesn't have a facilitator, please just go ahead and facilitate.
Just find some, you know, have somebody in your group.
So four to five?
Yeah.
And if you find yourself without a facilitator, just select one of you just to kind of keep things on track with questions and everything.
Well, that, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah. Well, that went way too fast.
I think our group could have spent the entire hour, you know, and
so, but we will return later and with the same groups.
And so, yeah, what was said in your group, maybe people who are leading could give a little, just a brief synopsis of some juicy pieces.
Jump in, there is never any way to summarize, as you all know, you know, it's a rich, intense short time, but I just jotted some of the themes that we touched on.
And folks were very appreciative of the insight meditation tradition because they practiced in other traditions, and they were finding the tools through Gil's guidance and the teachers of the sangha to be very helpful.
And some of the other themes were touching on the idea of the fictitious self from the chapter freedom from the fictitious self and the letting go that was talked about in the chapter and the power of gratitude.
As well as appreciating sangha to share all this with you.
In the group, there's never enough time to talk about intention, but we almost got around to everyone and some of the, some of the themes for intention really started with gratitude and a little bit going into ethics, doing the right thing.
Also, being in the moment, being present, being aware, and also connected to others, knowing that others are also out there, you know, searching for hope and happiness and joy.
And, you know, it didn't really make any difference whether in our group, whether we have been practicing a long time or just a relatively short time.
It was a very rich and sharing what intention means to each of us. Thank you.
Our group sort of jumped right into just how much everyone appreciated this particular chap.
It was so inspiring in so many ways. One person had talked about this sense of spaciousness as opposed, you know, the contraction around self and the spaciousness that can envelop our life and how we engage.
And looking at that positive side of all the, you know, the ethical part of the chapters, talking about the positive side, not just the prohibitory, but, you know, just the beauty in this life, you know, and honoring this and being present in each moment.
And it was just a beautiful sort of self affirmation and how in the balance, you know, having intention, but balancing it between, you know, this, when she was talking about being on retreat or being in life,
being inward and looking at life and holding it all and finding a balance and just the encouragement, you know, with this time that we have.
And being so appreciative of her voice and her encouragement and how rich this long list of looking at what one wants to look at in life at least times and going forward.
So anyway, it was wonderful sharing very deep, very wonderful. So thank you.
I forgot that I'd be doing this.
One, one number of our group is going through, it's going through end of life process, that's where I could put it.
And I hope I put that well.
And we got around to passages in the book.
And for her, the sentence that struck her was 88.
Perhaps the simplest guideline as simply elegant as Einstein's equals MC squared is Jesus's suggestion that we love one another.
And so that's her intention to stay just with that as things unfold.
For someone else, the passage was mindful awareness recognizes that there are options.
And this, this is in contradiction to above there on 78.
Without mindfulness, the direction of these.
Well, everything we see as a reflection of our own mind with its deep karmic imprints, everything.
And without mindfulness, this is just all a swirl that drives us to paraphrase the rest.
And so she liked counterpoint, which is mindful awareness recognizes that there are options.
Our options every nanoseconds experience can be guided with intention aligned with intention, taking the present trajectory of horizons and setting it on a new path.
That struck me.
That's what I have.
It reminds me of that Shakespeare passage without awareness is just a tailed Tobai idiots, full of sound and fury and signifying nothing.
So, yeah.
This makes it significant.
I talked about someone mentioned she.
She appreciated the sense of coming home.
In practice.
And then practice.
And she was quite moved, quite moved by that coming home so we discussed what coming home meant to different people.
Coming home in the body coming home with the energy.
Coming home to just knowing.
Simply knowing.
And
someone
was very moved about
how harmful
her untamed speech can be.
Gossiping malicious, hurtful, vengeful
and very grateful to be shining a light on that and the freedom that
restraining from that can bring.
All this coming immediately to mind.
We had a wonderful discussion and
can't wait to get back.
Yeah.
You could do this chapter again.
It's so potent.
Isn't it?
Yeah.
It's such a potent chapter.
So let's take a 10 minute break
and come back at 10 after. How's that?
Just settle in for a few minutes in our seat.
A little break and just arrive back in our
own room and our Sangha space here on Zoom.
Just let's take some
relaxing deep breaths
since the body just being in its seat.
Present.
Again, simply just being aware of
simple body sensations and
breath letting us know we're alive
and we're just here.
Present and aware.
I think I've shared this multiple times in the group.
This little quote on a gravestone.
The nature of being is awareness.
Simply remain still and be as you are.
That is all.
It seems very much
following on David's chest to relax
and relax into this
ever-present awareness.
No big deal just here.
Present.
So, Kathleen, she had these two
sections in this chapter
both looking at and cultivating
a wholesome intention and
the foundation was also
looking at cultivating and seeing
the benefits of ethical behavior
in our life and how that was a protection
for us, for our practice,
for moving into more freedom.
In an encouraging way,
in a really positive way.
Reminded me, I loved reading this
over again.
I wanted to share this.
I got this calligraphy
many, many years ago.
A local calligrapher in my area
she was a student of
Kopen Chinno Sensei.
He had actually been my first
introduction to Buddhism
back in the late 60s.
Then I came across this calligraphy
and Kopen had taken these,
the moral precepts
called the tenfold prohibitory precepts
and restated them
with clear-mind precepts.
I thought I would share those
just because I remember thinking,
oh, this is so encouraging.
So encouraging.
So I'll read the more traditional
Thou shalt not.
And then Kopen's
restating this in a positive way.
So the tenfold prohibitory precepts
and then the clear-mind precepts.
No killing lie.
Cultivating and encouraging life.
No stealing.
Honoring the gift not yet given.
No attachment to fulfillment.
Remaining faithful in relationships.
No illusory words.
Communicating truth.
No selling the wine of delusion.
Polishing clarity, dispelling delusion.
No dwelling on past mistakes.
Creating wisdom from ignorance.
No praising yourself or blaming others.
No containing modesty and extolling others.
No hoarding teachings or materials.
Sharing understanding, freely giving of self.
No being angry.
No feeling in equanimity.
No abusing the three treasures.
Respecting the Buddha.
Unfolding the Dharma.
Nourishing the Sangha.
It's a slightly different list.
It's in the Mahayana tradition.
It covers pretty much the whole range of our thoughts and activities
that can be skillful or unskillful.
I'm going to read just the clear-mind precepts one more time.
With this intention to cultivate clear-mind precepts.
Cultivating and encouraging life.
Honoring the gift not yet given.
Remaining faithful in relationships.
Communicating truth.
Polishing clarity, dispelling delusion.
Creating wisdom from ignorance.
Maintaining modesty, extolling others.
Sharing understanding, freely giving of self.
Dwelling in equanimity.
Respecting the Buddha.
Unfolding the Dharma.
Nourishing the Sangha.
I remember the first time I came across the little phrase,
the bliss of flamelessness.
I was seeing over the years in just the difference
in the actual feeling in the body and maybe we can,
in our groups, maybe reflect on how it feels
when we act with our highest intention
and how it feels when we don't.
The difference between for me
swatting a mosquito or not.
There is something in the body that actually happens,
and I can see the difference and actually feel
in the body the difference between in this very tiny way
taking life or not taking life
and how that is a support or can be a support.
And maybe looking at how we experience our actions
and how it lands in our hearts when we act
and how it supports our practice and eases the mind
when we can act from what Kathleen Dowling Singh
talks about as this moral compass.
This is actually a support for our awakening,
a support for our practice.
How does that actually manifest in our own experience?
How does it feel internally as opposed to a list
from the outside that we have to mark off and keep account of?
And I think the author really encourages this.
How was this really felt inside?
And I did mention in a small group of every three years
I think Gil teaches this class called
The Equivalence of Ethics and Enlightenment.
And sort of bringing it right up there,
how we act, how we think, how we speak,
all of this affects this awakening journey.
Anyway, I think we can go into groups
and just continue this discussion on how the chapter,
how the author's words have landed,
how it feels to have this list of, you know,
what encourages awakening in our ethical line.
And then at the very end of this chapter,
Kathleen also talks about these steps in moving
and transition for death.
But here we can enter into this now,
having this basis of our intention for awakening
and our intention to maybe act in a wholesome way,
which we'll be exploring as the book goes on.
But it's an inspiring but also a long list of,
you know, these stages of liberation, you know,
silence, forgiveness, love, long list.
Anyway, I think the groups were having a wonderful time
going into death.
So I think it's just time that we can go back
and share more of what we've gotten from these words
and our sharing together in these small little sangha groups.
So Joe, if we could go back and for maybe 25 minutes,
then we can come back at 10 to 1.
So welcome back.
And we certainly had a wonderful sharing
and David, do we have a little time to share?
Or yeah, if anyone feels inspired to just,
this was such a deep, in our group, a deep sharing of,
so if anyone can raise your hand
or just unmute and please share.
I, David asked, what does home feel like?
We were discussing at home and at one point,
and I just realized, as you were just speaking,
that I feel at home that this is what it feels like.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, if we're all very quiet and filled with Dharma,
I might just share this last few minutes.
I loved, really appreciate the chapter,
but this what really caught my eye at the very end.
She talks about, you know, taking this opportunity
of making our life a retreat,
these aging times as a retreat.
You don't mind me reading.
I just think here we are, you know.
We know in these last chapters of our life
of the time and the humility
and the life wisdom to appreciate the preciousness
of this fleeting experience,
stepping over the threshold of attachment to self,
stepping out of self and beyond self,
our awareness is filled with grace,
is graced with the true and the good and the beautiful,
all always already ever present.
The special conditions of transformation are skillful means
by which we can organize our life around our intention.
We act with both wisdom and self-compassion
when we choose to use these later years as a retreat
and dedicate them as such.
We don't need to go to a cave or a monastery.
We don't need an isolated hut in the woods.
We just need a commitment to awaken.
We need the wise gathering of the special conditions
that will facilitate awakening.
We need earnest and steadfast practice.
The retreat doesn't need a place.
It needs an intention.
It is a mental space.
Intention is our enclosure.
It is an enclosure that expands to include everything.
These retreat boundaries may tighten at times
and open at times,
visits with friends and family,
travel or the generous actions of social involvement
may at times be exactly where we need to be
and at other times more solitude may be appropriate.
The cycle of solitude and engagement is like breathing.
It always moves between in and out.
The retreat doesn't need a place.
It needs an intention.
Let's just sit quietly for a few moments.
Let's just sit quietly for a few moments.
Let's say the gift of our shared wisdom,
our shared open hearts and presence here.
Be a blessing in our lives going forward.
Be a blessing to all those we meet.
Be a blessing as we travel this journey in our aging.
So peace to you all.
Blessings and thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, David.
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you, everyone.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
