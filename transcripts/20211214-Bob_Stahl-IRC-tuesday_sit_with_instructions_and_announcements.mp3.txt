So I'd like to offer some instructions for this day of practice and generally
how the retreat works is every day at this time will be offering pretty
thorough instructions for the day. There may be yet other sits very brief
reminders more often silence so that it supports us to go deeper into the
practice. And so you know we could say this is a four foundations of mindfulness
retreat insight meditation retreat and it's interesting what the the Buddha had
to say about the foundations of mindfulness is saying that this is the
most direct way to experience realization. There's an aspect of the
practice of course has its theories, teachings, but then there's the application
of the practice itself and that supports the realization. So we speak of patti
that's the Pali for the teachings and the pari veda is is the practice itself
and then this plania this realization theory or the teachings and the practice
itself go together. And it was interesting when the Buddha first taught
about the four foundations of mindfulness towards the end he said that if you
practice this for seven years sincerely you will get enlightened and then he goes
on to say you could practice this for six years. Sincerely you'll get
enlightened five years four years three years two years one year you get
enlightened and then he goes on to say not only one year but 11 months 10
months nine eight seven six five four three two one month you'll get enlightened
and then goes on to say three weeks two weeks one week you get enlightened so
even in one week Buddha pointed to the possibilities of more awakening. And the
teachings that are found in the four foundations of mindfulness the first
foundation is of the body which we'll be working with today and tomorrow. Now the
foundations is the mindfulness of feeling tones the third foundation
mindfulness of mind states thoughts and emotions and the fourth foundation you
could just consider a collection of teachings they're not meditation objects
per se and actually a number of the teachings found in the fourth foundation
will be part of the themes of some of the Dharma talks later in the day how to
work with challenges with the hindrances how to what are allies that are
supportive for awakening factors of awakening and the teachings of suffering
and its causes in the path to great freedom therefore and nobly truths what
makes up identity these aggregates and sense space and so all of these teachings
found within the fourth foundation of mindfulness are often part of the themes
of some of the talks that are offered during the fourth foundation mindfulness
retreat and within the body there are six distinct practices we're primarily
going to be working with the first three gathering our posture one that is awake
and comfortable in the suit itself is cut and very much the Buddha was a
forest monk and coming to the foot of a tree and sitting upright and then
attending to the mindfulness of breathing in and breathing out then the third is
bringing our mindfulness into our day-to-day activities that I've already
been introducing the latter three are not going to be taught within this
retreat but are very important practices and there's times where we actually do
some retreats on these particular practices but I want to at least name
them because it's part of the first foundation of mindfulness of the body
so the fourth practice is an anatomical practice on the 32 parts of the body
meditation the fifth practice is a meditation on the four primary elements
that exist within all material phenomena of solids liquids motion and
temperature and the sixth practice is a practice of the mindfulness of death
nine different contemplations on different stages of decomposition beginning
with the first day of death until the body turns into dust the different
stages of the breakdown of the body and of course it was this understanding of
aging illness and death that Siddhartha Gautama was had these realizations of
these messengers again and the Dharma they're called heavenly because they
wake us up it was these types of realizations that brought him on the
path so this is a very powerful practice on the mindfulness of death and it's
interesting because I think there's an old Hindu proverb that says everyone
thinks everyone else is going to die but not me and so this particular type of
practice really takes root this preciousness and fragility of this
life and again what's said Siddhartha Gautama on this quest of of searching
for what is this life so in this establishment of these foundations of
mindfulness that help support us to steady our mind and open to insight so
this practice of some sense of settling collecting gathering developing our
concentration our steadiness and in time beginning to with that steadied mind
beginning to experience and understand how whatever arises passes away there's
a reframe in the four foundations of mindfulness on the bottom of each
teaching pointing to the impermanent nature of thing the origination of what's
arising in the dissolution the coming and the going and so in whatever bodily
position you're in when we speak about mindfulness of the posture there's
essentially four postures this walking and standing and sitting and lying down
and of course in yoga there's thousands of different postures and thank you
Yasmeena for bringing some mindfulness into the different ways we can attend to
the body but traditionally we speak of this the posture of walking that I'm
going to offer some instructions about a little bit later some of us might
prefer to stand and I know some people that actually standing is their primary
posture during a retreat and so if you're welcome to stand particularly as a
antidote to a lot of sleepiness and tiredness standing can help to keep us
more awake of course the sitting sitting in a chair on a cushion on a bench
finding our sitting posture and there's also the posture for some of us that
might have some physical thing going on in the body and that lying is the
preferred posture this is certainly fine as well and I would say there's two
common elements to the posture one and most important is to be awake and the
second is to be reasonably comfortable if we're so uncomfortable it's gonna
start you know you have too much pain if it's so lax so we get sluggish next
thing you know we're falling asleep so sensing into your body right now hiding
that perhaps for a few moments that sweet spot of comfort and awakeness and
of course there's never a permanent sweet spot what appears to be sweet might
turn sour some point and we're gonna learn how do we go with the flow of the
body sensations and and at times the skillfulness and the wisdom of shifting
your position mindfully but for now just sensing into your body awake
comfortable present
and it might take a few moments to do that if you need to adjust a little bit
so just yeah getting that place so you can be comfortable and awake
so collecting into our posture and then within the first teaching of the
foundation mindfulness it's often to become mindful of the breath in and
mindful of the breath out
and so beginning to bring awareness to your breathing breathing normally and
breathing naturally sensing into where you feel the breath most prominently
indistinct this might take a little bit of time to really sense in that point of
contact where perhaps you feel the breath as it comes in and out the some of
might be in the inner nostrils of the tip of the nose of the upper lip others
might feel the breath more prominently in the abdomen the belly expanding on an
inhalation contracting on an exhalation others may feel it in other places such
as in the chest or maybe more of a global sense of this whole body as it
breathes in breathes out since it's lifting like a balloon that's inflating
on an inhalation and deflating on an exhalation so sensing for a little bit
in where you feel the breath most prominently indistinct just again
breathing normally breathing naturally and as you're breathing in you're
knowing you're experiencing you're knowing you're breathing in as you're
breathing in and as you're breathing out you're knowing and experiencing the
breath as you're breathing out so it's unified this knowing experiencing
nothing needs to be figured out analyzed just the knowing and experiencing the
breath as you breathe in and as you breathe out being present
and I'd also like to just acknowledge that typically in these more current
times there's been a lot of awareness about sensitivity and to recognize it
even though we are all universally breathing there's no doubt about that
for some of us the breath may not be the most suitable of objects and so I'd
like to just offer a couple of options that you could make is the primary
object one is to bring awareness into the ears and just listening to the
different sounds this is a wonderful object as well that we can bring our
attention to inside the ears and just listening to sounds as they come and go
just invite us to practice with this for a little bit right now just listening
to the sounds within the immediacy of your own room place where you are of
course there may be some sounds outside of the room just hearing hearing
meditation listening to sounds as they come and go just as the breath comes in
and goes out the sounds at the beginning and endings hearing meditation
perhaps you can be aware of these sounds in a very core and basic way just
just sound waves yes of course some sounds you may find that you like some
that you don't like but underneath the like and the dislike is just sounds
audible formations hearing meditation so this could be a wonderful option that
you could make your primary object instead of the breath so you can
experiment hearing
then just shifting now into sensations within the body the contact points this
is a third option I just want to offer you some options that you can make is
your primary object to settle to collect to gather to build your
concentration to steady the mind in the body so there's the mindfulness of
sensations all of the different contact points that the body is making contact
with the chair cushion floor contact of the hands perhaps on the lap eyelids
closed or if they're partially open there's not a full recommendation to have
your eyes have to be fully closed or fully open but you see what works best for
you being mindful of the different sensations that they too just like the
sounds that are coming and going and the breath that's ebbing and flowing the
different sensations arising and passing the mindfulness of sensations is
another yet another option that you could choose as a primary object
essentially I want to just suggest to keep it simple it may be at first you
experience each of these practices but gradually anchoring into one be it the
sounds sensations the breath steadying the mind and it's fair to say that of
course that for many of us our minds will wander a lot to the future into the
past fantasy scrutinizing comparing liking disliking the flood of emotions so
when they arise as you're practicing it's important to acknowledge this is
what's here so there's not any denial about it if you will but then since we're
training particularly now the beginning part of the retreat to collect to gather
to steady the mind acknowledging wherever you went and coming back to that
primary object again and again and how we come back again and again is very
important and maybe train with kindness this training with kindness begins to
uproot deeper conditioning that may think otherwise of being critical and
judgmental with ourselves so the sense of sense of really bringing kind
attending is not some type of a Pollyanna idea it's actually interrupting
deeply embedded conditioning it was critical and judgmental and there's a
beautiful teaching story by Pema children that speaks about the wisdom of kind
attending she speaks about there's a puppy and it needs to be trained to
learn how to sit and stay learn some commands and you can train a puppy in a
very harsh and rigid and punitive way fear-based way and gradually in time
that puppy will learn those commands but often their dispositions they become
rather skittish nervous kind of neurotic kind of confused and she goes on to say
you can also train a puppy with a lot of kindness and that repetition and bringing
some love or some kindness into it and in gradually time that puppy will also
learn the commands but often brought up in an environment where there's some
kind attending that environment helps one to become much more confident and
flexible and so if we bring into our practice this harshness it may just
make us more neurotic and confused as one teacher says keeps on wrapping our
lives in a knot by contrast training with kindness may help support us growing
with greater confidence and flexibility and kindness doesn't necessarily mean
not giving effort there is wise effort wise effort of knowing when to put more
energy into what's needed because more energy is needed and recognizing at times
when there's too much energy and the time to back off so that wisdom of
knowing when to apply and knowing when to find the middle path so this kind
attending will serve us and if we did nothing for the whole of our hour but
bringing it back every time our mind went off or seems like almost every other
moment one teacher would say your hour is still very well employed particularly
for training in a kind way it's helping to settle the mind to prime the pump
we even know with weight training it involves that repetition it begins to
build the muscle the repetition of bringing our mind back when it wanders
off begins to develop the muscle of concentration so we'll go into a little
silence now and the invitation to experiment would eventually become your
go-to your anchor be it with the breath or listening to sounds or feeling
sensations kindly attending and being present

so thank you and this time each day as well we'll have a little time for some
some questions or clarifications about the instructions and from the talk or
the practice and and then what sometimes we'll offer some announcements as well
it's just a short little period of time book there's any thing that you want to
bring up you welcome to raise your hand or electronically raise it
if there's anything
and may not be anything pressing right now. I know we're just early in the
retreat. And just to let you know starting tomorrow at 11.15 and then 2.30
we'll begin to do small group practice discussions where we'll have an
opportunity for you to meet with one of the teachers in a small group of three
or four people and have some time to check in about how the practice is going
and challenges or questions or learnings and I trust you just get on the
the retreat website it will give you that guidance of where to go and what
link to press and so forth and I'll just pause for a moment see if there's
anything and if not I'm gonna proceed with some instructions around walking
meditation if there's anything. So alright so we'll do a little walking practice and
there's a couple of different ways of doing walking practice and what I want
to introduce you to today is sometimes I like almost like to call it like a
narrow gauge or a laser beam where we're really paying very close attention to
walking itself. I also want to say that if there's anyone in the room in our
space here that walking is just something that's something going on with
your body you're not able to do the walking practice then I will invite you
to do whatever movement and I'm grateful that Yasmin is offering some yoga and
or do whatever movement that would be supportive for you to be present but if
you are able to do the walking practice I'd like to invite you to stand up
mindfully now and we'll do a few steps together.
So coming into a standing position and as far as like the length of the walk
you know like for right now we maybe like two or three lengths of the yoga mat so
not not too long and just starting at one end we'll just take a few steps
together right now but then just proceeding on to shifting your weight
onto your left hip and lifting the right foot up moving it forward and placing
it down. You'll find as you place it down this is
shifting of the weight again lifting the left foot up moving it forward and
placing it down. So you can just begin just as you walk the shifting of the
weight being aware of the lifting as you lift the moving as you move the
placing as you place mindful of walking meditation step by step lifting moving
placing it's helpful at first to even kind of mentally note and say those
words that's helpful but if it's not so helpful just knowing that you're
lifting as you're lifting knowing you're moving as you're moving knowing
you're placing as you're placing. Just taking your lives one step at a time and
when you come to the end of your lane listen to your body your body will
inform you whether you turn to the right or to the left and then as you're
turning being mindful of turning as you turn it's a very intricate to turn this
body around and doing this mindfully and then beginning to walk back step by
step to where you first began so just walking back and forth lifting moving
and placing the foot shifting of the weight and again that lifting moving
and placing walking mindfully step by step and of course just like when we
were doing the sitting practice in our mind wandered off and we're trading
ourselves to kindly bringing it back the same way with the walking the lifting
and moving the placing and then all of a sudden thinking about something else and
working becoming aware that you're somewhere else kindly attending and
bringing our awareness back to the lifting moving and placing and it always
takes time to get into this practice of walking so much of our time our
orientation towards walking is going from point A to point B but here it's kind
of reversing that trajectory it's all point A not having to go anywhere except
being aware of the lifting the moving and the placing gradually in time we just
come into the body with the walking and being present
so we'll just continue walking and for those of you that are fine just exactly
where you are in the room walking back and forth you're welcome just to stay
for those that would prefer to go outside to find a spot not too far it's not
like a big hike type of thing but again maybe just two or three months of a
yoga matter so we're just not a very long walk and just walking and turning
and walking back to where you started we will come back to our sit at noon and
just carrying on being present walking meditation
