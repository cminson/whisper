Practice Note: Yield to the Present

If you drive into Spirit Rock, the Vipassana meditation 
center in Marin County , on the long driveway going in  
you come to a yellow diamond caution sign t hat says: 
“Yield to the Present. ” The idea of yielding to the 
present is a very good one.  
 
The famous 13th century Zen master in Japan, Dō gen, 
defined ‘delusion ’ as taking the self and movin g forward 
into the world – where as enlightenment is letting all 
things come to you. Sometimes when people practice 
mindfulness, they take their self as the one who’s  going 
to do it. They direct and make the effort. This is  not a 
wrong way of practicing , but making a lot of self -effort 
can often tr ip you up . Another way of practicing is that 
you are not trying to penetrate, understand, or get 
concentrated on something. But rather, you are trying to 
yield to it – to let the presen t moment experience come 
to you and  fill you , so you can really register it. You can 
let it come.  
 
If you are trying to listen to  a faint sound , you might  lean 
in the direction of the sound to hear it better.  But you 
can’t do much  to make yourself listen better , or listen harder. You have to yield better to the  sound – to 
receive it  more fully , to let go of the distract ions, 
thoughts, the agitation of the  mind, and to get some 
more space in the mind to receive and hear a subtle 
sound .  
 
So, the idea is yielding to the prese nt. Rather than trying 
to focus on the breath,  what happens if you yield to the 
breathing? Let it come to you. Let the breathing do 
itself. Rather than focusing on your steps in walking 
meditation, what happens if you yiel d yourself to the 
steps? Yield yourself to receive , take in , and be filled by 
the sensations of the feet and legs walking.  
 
So, receive , and register , and let it fill you. Let things 
come into your senses. Rather than using your senses 
to focus on somethin g, let things come to your senses . 
Then tune in , so you can hear, see, smell,  and feel it 
better , whatever it may be – yielding to the present.  
 
You might experiment with that this morning if you’d 
like. Sometimes it’s a nice practice to do. Very little is  
asked of us here . Sit quietly;  walk quietly. Nothing much 
is asked. So yield to the present and see what happens.  
 
Thank you.
