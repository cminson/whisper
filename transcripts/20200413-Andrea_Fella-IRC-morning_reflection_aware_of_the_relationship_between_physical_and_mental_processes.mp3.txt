As we explore experience, as mindfulness becomes a little more stable and there's more of
a continuity, we begin to recognize that our experience, all the different flavors of experience,
all the different fields of experience, sound, sight, smell, mind, taste, touch, sensebases,
all these fields of experience are processes unfolding.
Our minds have a tendency to make them nouns rather than verbs, to make them things rather
than events unfolding processes.
And yet as we practice and actually observe experience more, with more interest, we see
that there's nothing that stays around for long, it's just this mutating set of conditions,
changing experience, process unfolding.
And as we observe experience, there's different ways that the Buddha explored these different
processes at work, we can begin to be interested or curious about in particular two basic threads
of processes at work.
And these will be revealed as we just simply are aware moment to moment of what is obvious,
and as we're noticing what's obvious, we may begin to recognize that some of the process
that's unfolding that we're observing at the moment is connected with physicality, our
bodies, processes of sight, of sound, of smell, of taste, of touch.
And some of the processes that are at work are connected to our mind, thoughts, emotions,
moods, mind states.
These processes are interdependent, and so sometimes we can, our minds can get confused
and kind of conflate these different processes, and it may seem that it's obvious that body
and mind are separate, and yet our minds are not so clear about that sometimes.
And it is easy to confuse or conflate because the only way we experience our bodily processes
is through our consciousness, our feeling, our perception, or through our mental processes
we touch into the physical processes, and so it's very easy to mix them up.
But it is useful to begin to recognize the different processes and how they interrelate.
So for example, there are the physical processes of touch, just for right now, for these moments
as I speak these words, you may orient to the physical.
You might notice the contact, the pressure of your body against the cushion or chair.
You might notice the movement of the breath, the increasing pressure of an in-breath.
You might notice a tingling or a vibration in your body, a coolness or a heat.
There may be specific sensations of hardness or pressure or tension, moisture or stickiness,
dryness.
There's a way that the awareness can be more attuned to the actual experience, the direct
contact of the sensation.
And yet sometimes our mind will relate to that sensation, not through the direct sensation
of pressure or tension or vibration, but instead be kind of relating to it through a concept
of a body part, of that's the knee, feeling that breath through my nose, experiencing
hand, a vibration feeling in that area, there's an overlay perhaps of the concept of hand.
So the concept is a mental process, the vibration tingling, pulsing, the physical process at
work.
The knowing of the vibration is a mental process.
And so again, they're very close, these processes, we can't have one without the other.
And yet there are certain mental processes that easily obscure the actual experience.
So there's perhaps vibration, tingling, pulsing, and this is maybe a fairly neutral experience
or area of the body, the hand, maybe for many of us that may be true, but sometimes with
concepts, many times with concepts, not sometimes, concepts come with associations, with baggage
we could say, with the views and ideas, beliefs.
This is a good hand, it's a bad hand, it's a nice hand, and this is maybe a silly example,
but this is the way concepts work, and so that overlay of the concept brings the views,
the ideas, the beliefs, the relationship to that concept into the direct experience and
can affect how we experience our direct experience.
Now we're not trying to stop concept from happening.
That can happen in meditation sometimes, but we are interested in recognizing the difference.
So for example, again around the hand, recognizing the vibratory quality, and then also perhaps
recognizing the perception, the recognition of the hand, and then maybe the concept about
the hand and the baggage that gets applied to that.
So this is again, this is recognizing just what's naturally arising and recognizing these
differences between body and mind, and can begin to highlight different mental processes
through getting familiar with the more fundamental physical experience, the physical experience,
more the kind of language of the body, is at a very elemental level, vibration, tingling,
pulsing, coolness, heat, sensations like that in the physical, the touch sense, pitch and
tone in the sound in the area of hearing, color and form in the area of sight, the bare
seeing level, that the eye and the kind of the bare seeing is just form and color.
When we see wall, lamp, window, that's a mental process of concept.
And so we can begin to get familiar with, through our practice, the more bare aspects
of the physicality, and then that can begin to highlight for us the different mental processes
at work.
Meaning for example, there's a contact of pressure in the body, that physical pressure,
and then there's a mental sense of pleasant, unpleasant, neutral.
There's perhaps a response, liking or not liking, also mental.
There may be a perception of what the thing is, knee or hand, lamp or window, that's mental.
And then there are the many emotional responses, often based on liking or not liking, but also
often associated with the mental process of believing.
What we believe often affects what we like and we don't like.
So we can begin just in noticing our experience moment to moment, opening to.
This is what's obvious right now.
There can begin to be a recognition of the various threads of what is obvious.
Using the physical threads and the mental threads, and then also how they interrelate,
how they affect each other.
Seeing of how these processes affect each other, this conditioning nature of these processes,
is an important aspect of wise mindfulness, a curiosity to understand how this unfolding
of our minds is unfolding in a conditioned, a natural, lawful way.
That's the understanding, the development of wisdom about what causes and conditions
lead to struggle, to suffering, to stress, and what lead away from that.
Because conditionality can be seen in simple ways, just named, I just named some of them.
The sensation arises, it's felt as pleasant or unpleasant.
There can be a response to the pleasant or unpleasant of liking or not liking, which
leads perhaps on to a further mood or emotion that develops from there, a fear, a confusion,
a joy, a delight.
Again, none of this do we need to judge.
We are again observing what has come to be, and as it already has come to be, that allowing
or being honest opening to the truth of that.
This allows wisdom to develop, wisdom about what conditions and creates suffering, and
what conditions and allows release from suffering.
That wisdom, our system, our organism will naturally want to move in the direction of
release from suffering as it experiences the difference with wise mindfulness.
This process of our practice is giving our minds an education.
One that perhaps hasn't been available to us, our habitual way that our minds relate
to experience, obscures these relationships, obscures the nature of this unfolding conditionality.
So having dropped all of these ideas or thoughts or reflections into the meditation, there's
nothing in particular to do with this information other than let it kind of filter through your
system and sometimes think about this kind of information as like rain on a landscape.
The rain falls on the earth and it begins to soak in to the earth, saturate the earth
with, the earth just absorbing it.
That's kind of how this information might go in, just there's nothing particular to
do with it, continue, just continue with your practice, relax, recognize awareness and notice
what is obvious from time to time, checking the relationship.
What's the attitude?
The attitude is always a mental process.
In this simple practice, because the framing of this particular practice is exceedingly
simple, just aware and knowing what's here.
And yet the information that comes in as we expose ourselves to the wisdom of what the
Buddha taught.
That itself is a condition that affects how we notice.
So you can let this information kind of be in the background, just settle in and simply
continue with this very simple.
Are you aware?
That is obvious.
Thank you.
