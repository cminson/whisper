The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Discussion, breakout group discussions.
Given that we've just come off a beautiful meditation,
I'd like to invite you to kind of keep that meditative energy or field with you as you go into this breakout room.
And the questions that we'll be offering you will have a meditative flavor as well.
And so in the spirit of what David shared in the sutra, you bring mindfulness to all different activities.
And so consider that as you go into the small group.
And so we'll have about 12 minutes and we'll put you in a group about four people, each group.
And then you go around, one person say one thing and then move on to the next.
And so this circular around is as much of sharing, as much of listening as well.
So incorporate both of this.
And I'll invite the alphabetical order of the name based on the last name.
Maybe start with those whose last name is the highest in the alphabetical order and then go with that.
Now the first question is, there will be two questions and I'll share the second question in between so you can kind of focus on the first question.
The first question is, what is the felt sense in the body when equanimity arises in your experience?
What is the felt sense of the body or in the body when equanimity arises in your experience?
And I just give a little pointer to kind of as examples to begin this could be there is in a form of a softening in the body, some release of certain pressure or tension.
And however that you feel how this is and you can also, you know, as you get into the group and just to feel it in the body as you begin this exploration.
And then in about five minutes I'll type in the second question for you.
Okay, so are we ready?
Okay.
So that might be just about everyone. Great. Welcome back.
I see some smiles. That's always nice when people come back smiling.
So, first let me say that we're aware that of course this is a somewhat longer session this morning and so we are going to have a break in just a little while few minutes but before that if you can hang on for a few more minutes.
We thought it would be nice to open it up for any comments sharing the wisdom from the groups or any questions that have come up.
So, please feel free.
And again.
Laurie, or just ask.
I see Laurie's hand.
I'm, I'd like to ask what the second question was that it appeared and disappeared so fast we never saw it.
I was wondering about that because it did a flash properly very quickly.
So the second question was about what's the felt sense of mind and body when mind and heart when equanimity arises in your experience.
So the first question was that of the body.
And then the second question with that was that of a mind and heart.
I apologize that it looks like a lot of you may not have had a chance.
And there was no third question.
Those are the two.
Thank you.
I can say that for anybody over about, I don't know, 30 or 35. It's very hard to read that little text that comes up. It's very small.
Okay, Yan Kui, your hand is up.
Hello, friends.
I didn't get the second prompt. I spend the majority of my, at least the first half or three quarter of my time, I think I just slowly just close my eyes to get into the felt experience.
Just end up with that one of equanimity or just staying practicing equanimity.
I was so surprised by this exercise, how much I got from it because it, I didn't think so. It just floored me the fact that I can experience the version to the concepts words that were rising externally and, and then, you know, the greed for more silence and stillness was arising and then
there was just equanimity, because awareness was there to aware of this coming and going. So we have to have that container. And then eventually I the last third or so I start to open my eyes to the external and taking in the stimulation, both in front of the people in front of me and then all around my room and
staying with that container that equanimity that I just take this to the rest of my life now. This sort of felt sense of that kind of a mind state to now things will come in and out and I my own formations will come up to and I will want to grab but then there's still this.
There's an availability of that equanimity.
That's possible. Wow. Thank you.
Nice. Thank you.
Very nice.
Wrong.
Yeah, I mean, well, we didn't explicitly get to the second question but the answers to the first question, pretty much contain the answers to the second question as well.
It touched from the point of body and the mind. In my case, most distinct thing I noticed in equanimity is the diffusion of resistance, both in my thought and in my body.
There is no but or there is no resistor thing it's not just acceptance it's a realization. That's the way things are.
It's better to be free than to successfully resist.
We ever be successful resisting.
We think we think we can.
Thank you, Ron.
Vipassaco.
Yeah, I'm interested in what happens to feeling tone when there's equanimity arising related to something that's unpleasant.
I wasn't sure what my answer was for the first question because I was like, is there a consistent physical feeling with equanimity in my experience?
Or is it more like a heart, mind quality that can hold many different kinds of physical feelings?
Or is there some kind of thread that passes through all of them? That was like a curiosity for me.
And when there is something really uncomfortable and I can, like Ram was saying, I really like that, not having resistance to it.
Maybe in my experience that discomfort or pain shifts into a more like raw energy, like a raw flow of energy that's either like neutral or pleasant or painful.
But I don't know if there's like a consistent, for me, physical feeling.
Thank you. It's a very worthy explanation. Oh, go ahead. Investigation. Go ahead, David.
Oh, I was just going to say, I thought that was a really, the last two comments I think I've pointed to something kind of significant, which is that this distinction we make between body, mind, heart, and that was reflected in the questions is, is a distinction imposed on our experience by one aspect of mind.
And so the fact that it doesn't necessarily come up in those terms, I think that actually reflects some fairly deep, nice meditation practice, because those those distinctions, they start to be less important as the meditation deep.
That's what's body, what's mind, what's a bird, what's a door creaking, what's pleasant, what's unpleasant.
And the idea that when pleasant and unpleasant arise that there can be a way of holding them without in the words that Kim used from one of the suitors on Tuesday without them invading and remaining in the mind.
This is the way we enjoy the choicest hill rice and sweet curries, fully being with them and then, you know, that's a pleasant thing and maybe they're going as an unpleasant thing and then we're on to the next moment.
Yeah, David, I'm reminded how in the suit that you just quoted from and then 119 mindfulness of the body.
It's technically it says only mindfulness of the body and yet all these mental images all these mental qualities are evoked and at the very end it says that the person is capable of realizing anything that can be understood by insight.
So, there's a way and even the Buddha said also that mindfulness of breathing can lead to complete awakening.
So there's a way in which these things start to merge and going into the body will touch the mind, eventually, if we know to look for that.
Okay, well,
on that note, but perhaps with particular reference to the body we'd like to take a brief bio break time to just continue our mindful practice but maybe, you know, get a drink of water or stretch and the like so we'll be back in 10 minutes, and we'll start right back up
then because we have another kind of half of the classic. So take care.
