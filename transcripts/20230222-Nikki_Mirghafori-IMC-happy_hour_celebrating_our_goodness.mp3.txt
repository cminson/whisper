 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. Great. So hello and welcome everyone. Just happy having heard your voices and your hellos from different parts of the world. Just happy making, a sense of connection. But we have, knowing that there are other practitioners in the world joining us, we're all practicing together. So let's just start and I'll start the guided meditation and the theme will reveal itself to all of us during the meditation. So let's begin. Landing, arriving in our bodies in this moment. Landing with this out breath, letting go of whatever has come before. Nothing more do we know than this moment, the experience of this moment is all we truly know. Can we befriend this moment? Sensations in the body, the breath, the heart, the mind. Collecting and gathering ourselves peacefully with the breath, like lullaby, especially if we need calming and soothing, nourishing. As if we're being rocked back and forth. We have a very, very longmastersarde Relaxing the body, letting go of wanting things to be any other way than they actually are right now. Just for a moment, we can always go back later to wanting it to be different, but right now, what if we relax often? Big refuge in the breath. Relaxing the body, letting go of wanting things to be any other way than they actually are right now. And there are thoughts that will come, reflections, contemplations, memories. Some of them helpful, some of them not. What if we just turn away, big refuge in the simplicity of just being here, being brave, saying not now, thank you, even if there are helpful thoughts, reflections later. Just enjoying being, not doing, not planning, not becoming, not all of that, just being here. As if you were throwing out cold tea in your cup, emptying your cup of stale tea, letting the breath cleanse you, calm you, stabilize you. An act of love to let yourself be soothed, this heart to be held in the simplicity of not doing, wanting, being. It's an act of love, of care, to release. Loving and accepting this being who is you. Just as they show up in this moment, tired, cranky, sad, excited, relax, soften, let yourself be held lovingly by the breath. And we fall in love with the silence. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence bends within and we fall in love with it, enjoy it. Not seek something else, entertainment, planning, distraction, just be content with the amazing gift of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath.

Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Silence, the rhythm of the breath. Thanks everyone. Thank you for your practice. I think you've all been joyous to see your faces on the screen. You're light, shining all of you with your own beauty. So, so as I set up the small groups, if there are any quick reflections, you're welcome to share them. There'll be more time at the end. But now I'd like to invite you all to see, you know, this is an engagement of the rubber meeting the road as we engage in small groups together. And this sense of letting, letting your goodness, letting your good, not focusing on your challenges, your difficulties, what's going wrong, what's, but actually letting your light shine. And speaking about this person knows you as if you're presented to like, Oh yes, this person who's me, actually, they, they love to practice or they, they, they are dedicated to honesty or they're dedicated to their friends or, or they, they like to be generous or they're good cook. They love to cook for their friends. Just something about the goodness of you as if you're sitting on your own shoulder, you're being your own representative. Okay. Let me tell you about this person. They're great in this. So I'm just sharing that. And if you feel too shy, it's not you, it's your representative that's sharing something, but it's, it's nice to actually say something about that. Like, Oh yes, this, this person who's me like, likes to be generous. It's, it's true. And don't shy away. Like, Oh, I don't want to own it. What if you actually showed up with your goodness? We show up with all our problems and difficulties in the world, but what if you actually let your goodness shine again, not from a place of ego, but if I'm a place of goodness, it's very different and see if you can navigate and see that difference. If you're speaking from a place of ego, okay, I say pass. I'm going to just pass and sit with this. And maybe the next time we comes, maybe I'll say something, or you can just say pass. If it's like in a little uncomfortable, totally fine. Say pass. I'm just going to hold silence and I'm not quite ready to talk yet. Perfectly fine. Hold other people's beauties and goodness with, with, with, with detail, with vicarious joy, but it's lovely to celebrate that with each other. Unusual. We usually don't celebrate goodness. We get together and complain about what's not going well. Celebrate goodness. Just try, try something a little different. Why not? Let's experiment. So, so let's go in alphabetical order. And again, you can say pass. It's perfectly fine, but something, share one, one thing that you relish about this being in this person is a hard worker. They work really hard, et cetera. And, uh, just say one nugget, one thing, share one thing, the next person, the next person comes back to you. Maybe one other thing or not, just, uh, but make sure everybody gets the chance to, to share something and to be celebrated, celebrate each other. Yay. How fun. How fun. So I'm going to open the rooms, take care of yourselves, take care of each other. Oh, let me recreate the rooms. Hold on. Here we go. Okay. Creating rooms. All right. Um, take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Here we go. Okay. The rooms are back. The rooms are closed. Everybody's back. Welcome back everyone. And, uh, we have time for a few reflections. You're welcome to type them in chat, either to me privately or to everyone, and can also raise your zoom hand. If it's your physical hand, I may not see you. How was this practice seeing someone else's goodness and then seeing your celebrating your own goodness and, and also in the group, Kim, please. I just have to apologize because I was put into a room and then I was trying to press the enlarged and I was pretty pressing the X and so I was kicked out and then I was invited to another room. Same thing went for enlarged. It acts, but I was successful in the third, in the third room. So my apologies to those who came in and jumped out. Oh, that's, that's sweet. You visited lots of different rooms. Can you, you, you spread your, your light and any other, any other, anything else besides an apology or, or, or, you know, sharing what happened with the group and the observations you want to share, Kim, while you have the floor? You don't have to. I don't put you on the spot. It was a good meditation. It was, I enjoyed it. I was able to fall through with it and I went at one point, you know, I was visualizing my lovable being and that kind of came into me. And then you said, give yourself some space. I'll move them back out. And then I was able to, yeah, see myself from their point of view. And then also think of some memories of me of when I was showing some good qualities. Sweet. Thanks for sharing that Kim. Lovely. Beautiful. Yeah. Ellie, please. Hello. Yeah. It was very interesting because I'm just so close to the inner critic for so long. I mean, it was just hard stretch for me to do it. And then I says, why not? And then the first one that came on was a little hard, but then it kept rolling and it just like, I started enjoying it kind of like befriending myself for the first time because the other part I know so well, but this is very, very new. So thank you very much. Wow. Thank you, Ellie. Thank you so much. Wonderful. And I'm so happy to hear, delighted to hear that you stuck with it, even though it just seemed a little unfamiliar and difficult. Now, usually don't quite go here, but I'm just going to try it out. And then, oh, wow, it gets easier. Yes, of course it does. Beautiful. So appreciate you sharing that for benefit of everyone all who might also be in the same space as you shared. Thank you, Ellie. Lovely. Fred, please. Thanks Nikki. Kim, we were happy to see you come in for a second. Sorry to see you disappear another time. I would have found this impossible to do if I were speaking from the first person. And if I was doing it correctly, referring to myself in third person made it possible and still not easy, but feasible in a way that using the eye would have been out of the question. Nice. Thank you, Fred. So appreciate you sharing that actually having the third person perspective made it easier. It just created a little bit of space and beautiful. Thanks for sharing that insight. It just makes it a little easier. Beautiful. Yeah. Neil says we use the term damn weird. That's funny. And Ko, thank you for sharing that you've been recovering from a serious bike accident and wonderful that you're able to join us now. Wonderful. Hope you feel better soon. Yeah. In the other, maybe I'll just make a pause for one more, given that this is such a quote unquote, damn weird factors, but just, you know, there's possible it's possible to see the goodness of this person. Yeah. They are good in these ways. How wonderful to celebrate that. Yeah. Well, I'm glad that you were able to celebrate some of your own goodness and goodness of each other in this practice, this, in this moment. And, uh, yeah, thank you. Thank you for showing up for cultivating your own goodness, letting your light shine. You have so much goodness. Every single one of you, oh my heavens. So much. So thank you for sharing that. Take good care. May you all be well. May we all be free. Hey, take care everyone. I'll see you on Monday. We have a guest teacher on Friday. Bye.
