 Right, I know I'm falling over, I'm going to fall off this idea. So let's have a bit of, let's start off with a bit of Dama discussion and questions and comments or whatever you like. And then if it dries up, I can always talk a little bit, get good at talking afterwards, being a monk for so long. So is there anything that anyone would like to discuss from this morning or anything? Anything really, if you want to, if you have any questions or whatever. We can discuss that now if you have any disagreements is okay. Complaints, but that's basically the complaints that's right there, but apart from that. From this morning? Yeah, please. Okay, let's take the questions from online then. Yeah. So one leftover question was, what is the relationship between acceptance and right effort? Between acceptance and right effort. In a way, acceptance is right effort. So that is right effort is kind of strange because right effort doesn't necessarily mean that you are actually doing anything. It doesn't mean that you are applying yourself, anything like that. Right effort, letting go is right effort. Acceptance is right effort. Letting be is right effort. The ability to just to be mindful is right effort. Not doing anything is right effort. So it's kind of strange. Right effort is about really, ultimately it is about developing good qualities. So anything you do that develops a good quality in the mind, that is right effort. Yeah, so it can be like I said before, like nudging the mind a little bit in the right direction. It can just be allowing things to be without doing anything at all. So anything which gives rise, which kind of moves you forward on the part of meditation, is right effort. And acceptance is one of those things. So yeah, a lot of the things that we're trying to do on the Buddhist path, it takes quite a bit of contemplation and thinking about things there. Yeah, so if you're going to be able to, for example, if you're going to be able to forgive other people, how can we forgive people? Sometimes we say forgive, but how do you actually do it? It's easy to say, but it's not always easy to do. And the answer is you need a particular way of thinking about people to be able to forgive them. You need to kind of get in the right mind state. And what is that right mind state? Well, it's basically the idea that people don't really know what they're doing in this world. People have no idea. People don't, people are kind of walking in darkness in delusion, and they're kind of, you know, stubbing their toes all the place because there's no lights to see where you shouldn't be going. And once you start to understand the delusion that people are under in the world, how can you not forgive them when they do crazy things? Yeah, when people kind of say something bad to you, which probably happens almost every day, every day people say stupid things in this world. So what are you going to think? You know, you're going to say that actually they are just, you know, they had a bad day, things weren't going right for them. They don't know kind of what it really is, what it is to live a good life. And because of that, that's why they do bad things. And this is kind of where it comes from. And I think the, personally, I think the majority of people in the world, they actually want to be kind. They want to do the right thing. Because I think deep down, every one of us, we know that when you are kind towards others, when you treat other people well, we know that you feel good about yourself. Yeah, deep down, we know that. We know we actually, we really want to do these things. And still, even though we want to be kind, even though we want to live an ethical and moral life, very often we can't. Yeah, I'm sure you have all, everyone here probably wants to be, you know, kind all the time, if you could. There's anyone who doesn't want to be kind all the time. Everyone wants to be kind all the time, right? I'd like to be kind all the time. Sometimes I get these thoughts in my mind, yeah, that kind of leading me astray, that's terrible. That happens. I go to Ajahn Brahm and say, Ajahn, please, what's going on? No, I don't do that. And so, and that is kind of the despairing thing, right? When people actually, deep down, they want to be kind, they want to do the right thing. They want to be of service to the world, of service to themselves and everyone else, but they can't. And the reason why they can't is because their habits are so strong. Yeah, and I, you know, if everyone here knows, sometimes you get angry, even though you don't want to get angry. It's just habits coming out of you. So what you have been doing for lifetimes, probably. And at least many times in this life, if you don't believe in other lives. And so it comes out, whether you want to or not. And this is kind of why the spiritual practice is often hard, because the spiritual practice is actually about overcoming habits. And overcoming habits is very difficult. And when you know that, you become more forgiving other people, because you know how it is. And this is like a very important part of the idea of non-self. Yeah, amnata, the idea of non-self, the idea that we are basically not really in control of ourselves. So we are kind of the, we are under the thumb of habits and things from the past. And it's very difficult to kind of get out from those habits and those things. This is what non-self is about. So when someone does something nasty, it's not because of they want to be nasty. It's just that they're non-self nature, their habits coming out in a bad way. You happen to be there at the wrong time in the wrong place. And so you have to bear the brunt of those negative things coming out of that person. Does that make sense to anyone? Yeah, it makes sense to you. Okay, good. I'm not the only one that makes sense to you. Great, okay. So, yeah. Yes, please. There's one person over here who would like to do that. Would you like to? Yeah, yeah. Probably this is a too big a question for my shoes and pardon me. I am a very novice and an immature practitioner. But this is something I'm struggling with for quite a while in terms of practice. And he just brought it up. I mean, about self and no self and the question of context versus content. Usually when mind is very thin and you're not so caught up in the contents of what's going on, you have this, the way only to explain it is that the line between content and context kind of thins out. You are just this, that is the experience itself. You know, it usually happens either with effort, when the mind is thin, or occasionally very rarely, you know, just like that. My question is, is because, you know, when that happens, there are no attachments as such. I cannot even say what is you or who is freeing because it's just is, but either ways. Is there some way and probably the entire practice is to stabilize it. But my question is, is there something during the practice or a particular kind of meditation or something when you are still caught up and we're still trying to, you know, probably I don't know if I'm hooked on to an experience of sort or trying to get there. If there is anything which can be done during practice, where, you know, the trying, trying, trying, and then it just falls up, but it takes quite a bit of effort for long practice to get there. Of course, yeah, I don't know if I make sense. Yeah, no, so you're saying you want to get to the point where you don't try anymore and things are kind of natural and easy and mindful or whatever. And how do you get there? And how do you get there? Yeah, well, the way, you know, it's very interesting, the way that the Buddha explains meditation in the suttas, suttas are the kind of the discourse is the other word of the Buddha in a sense. And the way he explains it is that he essentially says you don't need to make an effort. You don't need to even have an intention. There's this kind of famous phrase in the suttas where he says and nācet nāya karāṇīya, which means that no intention needs to be done. Or needs actually shouldn't be done. That's what he says there. And he says that the process of meditation is according to nature. It's dhammata. Dhammata means according to nature. Dhammata is nature, right? The lawfulness of nature. So dhammata means according to nature. So if something is in accordance with nature, if you try to do it, you can't do nature. And nature has to happen by itself. You can't make nature happen. Is there the famous simile that I think as a Brahm sometimes uses is there, you know, you have the mother with a small child and she's going to teach the child how to grow a plant. Yeah, so she kind of puts a sunflower seed in the kind of soil and kind of walks a little bit and says to her, okay, now your job is to come and water this seed every day and you will see how the plant grows. Right? So after a while the kind of plant comes to the surface and it starts to kind of grow. And after a while this child gets very impatient because he's going so slowly. Yeah, it's only a few kind of millimeters every day. It's just too slow. A millimeter is okay, you know, fraction of an inch, whatever. I forget that I'm in the US now, so you have to kind of use the American terminology. But so and then of course the child gets impatient so it grabs hold of the plant and pulls it. That goes against nature. Nature has to take its own course. It has to go if you start pulling the plant, you destroy the plant basically. And it's the same thing with meditation practice. If something is to happen according to nature, you can't make it happen. You can't force it to happen. You can't use the chaitana. Chaitana is the intention or the will to make things happen. So what I say is that the whole process of meditation all the way to the very end of the path, which is like liberation from suffering or whatever, all the whole process is automatic. So what does that mean? Well, what it means is that you have to go backwards in that process to the very beginning point. And then you have to look at the beginning point. What is that? That is what you have to strengthen her because if everything else is automatic, well, then the beginning point is the critical point because everything will start from that. So what is the beginning point? What do you think? Yeah. It's a good guess. Yeah. Yeah. It's a good guess. But it's not actually quite, quite right because mindfulness itself actually comes from causes. Mindfulness is not something that is just there. Yeah. It has its own causes in a sense. So the Buddha says, Sila or morality or kindness is the root of everything. Yeah. If you are a truly kind person, if you truly have a good heart, if you have compassion for all beings, if you have a sense of metta and love for the world, that is where the whole process comes from. And it's quite simple in a way, because if, you know, the reason why it's so hard to be mindful is because the mind is as long as you have desires and ill will and this kind of things, the mind is going to be in the future. It's going to be in the past, because the nature of these things to be in the future and the pastor. But if you are kind, you're going to feel good about yourself. You can have a sense of self worth that. Yeah. But everyone is looking for self esteem. That's the path to self esteem. Let's be kind. That's the path. You're going to feel good about yourself. And when you feel good about yourself, you're going to have this inner feeling of happiness about how you live. Yeah. You're going to be, it's not kind of a ego thing at all. It's just a kind of quiet sense of being pleased with how you live. Yeah, me, I'm doing all right. In a good way, if you know what I mean there. And from that, because your mind is not going into the future and the past, it's kind of in the present. And you have the joy that comes with feeling good about yourself. Those are the two fundamental things that makes meditation possible. Yeah. Because if you are happy in the here and now, then mind will be present. And when the mind is present, you tend to be happy in the here and now. That is where the thing just goes by itself. So the critical thing is this idea of morality. But morality is very broad in Buddhism. It's not just don't kill and don't steal. It is, you know, it's about actually positive morality, how to be kind, how to be supportive, how to be compassionate, how to think in the right way. And it is very, very challenging to be moral in the way that Buddha taught. It's actually very hard. It's a very high bar to clear. Yeah. Because, you know, to be have compassion all the time, it's not easy to be kind all the time. It's not easy at all. So that is where the practice lies. And the more you're able to live like that, and you have to integrate it into your entire life. Your entire life has to be like that. Sometimes people think that this is my spiritual side. This is my worldly side. No, no, no, no. That's no good. Yeah. Everything is your spiritual life. Everything. Even when you dream at night to make your spiritual dreams. It's true. You think I'm joking. It's true. Spiritual dream. Have you heard of my spiritual dreams? There's a story of that I hear. This is a, I'm not sure if I should tell this story, but some stories are kind of half secret, right? I can't, I'm devolving secrets here. That's kind of, I'm not sure if that's a good idea. But I know people who they dream at night and they have dreams that are so powerful. This is one person who told me this. He said he was dreaming that he was bowing down to somebody. Now, if you have a lot of faith, if you really believe that the Buddha was awakened, he was the greatest spiritual master in human history, or you have faith in some other person who may be a great meditation master, heh. Bowing can be profoundly blissful because you are bowing to something very beautiful. Yeah, you're bowing to something wisdom, kindness, compassion, understanding. It's wonderful to bow down to these things. Usually we bow down to movie stars. That's a bad idea, right? That's our usual kind of people that we look up to in this world, or some people do anyway. And so, and he said that when he bowed down to this person in his dream, he becomes so blissful. He woke up straight away, yeah, because the bliss was so powerful. Went straight into a deep state of samadhi, meditation, straight from that. That's what I mean by spiritual dream, right? So, this is what your mind inclines so strongly to the spiritual path. And that, you know, you dream about these things. That's literally what is going on there. So, it is kind of really permeated in your life. So, that is what you have to do. And that is where the challenge really is. And, you know, if people really understood the power of morality and kindness, if they really, the more you understand that, and that comes from right view, right view, it actually tells you, informs you the power of these things. If that is there in your mind, lodged firmly in your mind, strongly, you never forget it. It's always there. The mindfulness tells you almost all the time, okay, must be careful, must think in the right way. And this is why someone who is a stream entry, have you heard about the expression stream entry? Yeah, the idea is that when you become a stream entry, you are perfect in morality. You never forget it. It is so lodged in your mind. It is always kind of there at the back of your mind. And it kind of guides you all the time. So, we should try to approximate the idea of stream entry and be like stream entries in our life. So, it becomes you. Yeah, right. Yeah, exactly. You are, morality becomes an expression of a character, right? Yeah, that's exactly it. So, the ego fades away. You're not really a person in the ordinary sense anymore. Well, I guess you are in some ways, but yeah, exactly. Have I even remotely answered your question? Oh, yeah, okay. Good. Yes, at the back there. Please. This is made at the back, first of all. Yeah, one second. Thank you. You brought up earlier that, if you look back at yourself 10 years ago, there's part of you that's the same part of you that has changed. If there's not self, what is it that gets reborn? This is something that I'm always confused about. I mean, the way it is explained in the suttas, it's like the stream of consciousness. Yeah? So, it is no different from what it is now in this life. Because in this life, you look at yourself, you see that there is change and there is a continuity. Two things coming together, change and continuity. And it's no different from one life to the next one. It's the same thing as you find in this life, change and continuity. So, the mind that you are now is in some way similar to the mind you had 10 years ago, and in some ways it's different. If you go into a future life, it would be the same thing. It would be something that are similar, some things that are different. And then that's why you can recall your past lives, right? And that's why you can say, oh, that was me in the past life, because you recognize yourself, just as you recognize yourself in this life. That's really what it is. It's a stream of consciousness, kind of carrying on. I think the reason why we have such hard time with these ideas in our modern world is because we tend to have this kind of physicalist and materialist outlook. That's kind of the modern outlook that we have. And I think it is fundamentally flawed outlook on the world, the world that isn't like that. One of the things I don't know much about philosophy, but I know enough to know that these ideas, like materialism, the kind of the opposite of materialism is idealism, where the mind is primary. The mind is the primary thing and kind of the rest of the world kind of is an expression of the mind in a certain way. And if you look at the history of philosophy, I'm talking about Western philosophy now, you can see how it kind of goes back and forth. It's like the fashions of the time, right? Okay, now it's fashionable to be a materialist. If you go 150 years ago, it was fashionable to be an idealist. Some of the famous German philosophers, they were idealist philosophers like Friedrich Hegel and Arthur Schopenhauer and some others as well. Who else? Kant, Immanuel Kant was partly a, it sounds like I'm name dropping, which I have, because I don't really know much about this philosophy. But I know enough to know that they were idealists. And then of course the tide turned, yeah? It turned in the 20th century and people became materialists. And now I think it is slowly turning back again. There's something happening in the world. And those people who are in the know, who are in that sphere, they say there's something major happening. Philosophers are starting to kind of look at the world in new ways. Scientists are taking things in a new way. Some of the kind of very famous neuroscientists, there's a fellow called, what's his name again? Christoph Koch or something like that. He's a very famous neuroscientist. He's a German by birth. I think he works here in California somewhere, not sure where. And he is basically now moving, you know, one of the world's foremost, I mean he's very, you know, up there. And he's kind of moving towards the mind being a fundamental aspect of nature and not being a secondary kind of outcome of material phenomena or anything like that. So these are just passions. We take these fashions quite seriously, yeah? We are trapped in fashions. We are trapped in a certain world view. And we kind of think that this is much more important than it actually is. And so once you see the world in that way, it opens up entirely new possibilities. And the idea that somehow you get born into this world and then you die and everything comes to an end. Although that actually is probably certain once you see the world in a different way. Yeah. Anyway, yeah, please David, yeah. Yeah. John, if there's interest in ordaining but an inability to do so, what are the most skillful conditions that can be put into place to allow enough suffering to be let go of for the first three fetters to be completely unshackled, let go of? Yeah. And how does knowledge that that has occurred arise for sure? Okay. I would recommend people not to be too worried about these kind of fetters and kind of get into a particular point because it tends to become an obstacle once you have these kind of goals and you become too goal oriented. I mean, this is kind of the way we are brought up in the Western culture, very goal oriented. You have a goal, you work hard towards that, but the spiritual path is different. It's almost like you let go of the goal and by letting go of the goal, it sort of happens by itself, but it kind of evolves. So I would focus on the simple things. How can I be more kind? Yeah, that's kind of the easy things. How can I just be more gentle in my life? How can I support other people? How can I give coffee to people? Yeah, that was beautiful. I mean, that's really nice. I mean, part of the nice thing about getting a cup of coffee is not so much to come, but it's the kindness of the people behind it. Yeah, it's a wonderful thing when that happens. And I was just walking down the street before and I, you know, from in my culture, you don't say hello to people on the street, but here you say hello to people on the street, right? And I said, hello, good morning. People respond, you know, initially look at you a bit funny, but then they can, okay, fine, we'll say good morning. That's kind of that's kind of really nice. And so this is really, again, this is where it is at. That is what we should focus on rather than focus on the stream entry or, you know, letting go of the three fetters or whatever, because that's where the practice really is. And often this idea of getting somewhere, it leads to frustration, it leads to problems, it leads to living in the future a little bit, because not looking at the here and now. So it, I mean, it is kind of a goal in a sense, but it's a goal that is way, way at the back of your mind. There's not something that you keep at the front of your mind to motivate you. Motivation should just be to be kind and then get the immediate results of that kindness. Okay, I feel good. When you have a kind thought about someone, you feel good straight away. Yeah, it's straight away. It has its own instant reward when you do that. That is what we should focus on. One of the kind of big mistakes that people often use, they, you know, the three so-called lower fetters that are the things that you let go when you become a stream mentor. Letting go of precepts and observances, you know, Sila Bhatta Padamasa in Pali. And so people often, Sila here really is the precepts. It's like morality, right? Letting go of morality. And then people think, oh yeah, we're letting go of morality. Okay, I better not hold on to my morality so much. Yeah, because if I hold on to it too much, I'm not letting go of this fetter. I'm not going to become a stream mentor. So I better kind of relax with my morality. That's the wrong way of thinking. Yeah. And the reason is because these fetters, they are not let go of by how we practice now. That's not how, I mean, we don't practice now and then somehow that leads to letting go of them in the future. What we practice now is the noble, letful path. And then this is the result of practice and the noble, letful path. So you don't actually let go of these things. You know, letting go of them is not part of the practice. That's what I meant to say. It's the result of the practice and the result of the practice is just an open, letful path. And I hear this all the time. Oh, I shouldn't hold on so much to my precepts. No, please hold on to your precepts. If you don't hold on to them, you're not going to keep them. Yeah. It's as simple as that. It's a little bit of holding on. It's necessary. And this is kind of this idea that attachment in the world is a, it's a gradual letting go of attachments. And we all, we need to have things to hold on to. And the reason we need that is because we have a sense of self, a sense of self is by definition, it is holding on. That's what a sense of self is. A sense of self means that you identify as something. And of course, that is going to be where you hold on. So if we're going to identify with anything, identify with being moral, identify with being kind, then you have a wholesome sense of self that is going to lead you in the right direction. And then you grab onto a higher rung of the attachment ladder, and you get more refined attachments. And then gradually you overcome the path in this way. But you don't kind of let go of the fundamental things too early. If you do, you're never going to get anywhere. So the next, the doubt is another one of the three kind of low effectors. Well, you know, that that's not something you can really do anyway. The way to overcome doubt is to, according to the suitors, is to investigate the teachings, yeah, and to practice. And then by investigating and practicing, yeah, you overcome doubt. And the last one is Sakaya Diti, the view that there is an existing personality. So that is kind of the thing which is the fundamental thing that you overcome when you become a stream mentor. And that's how you know, really, I suppose that you are a stream mentor, it's very easy to delude yourself. There are lots of so-called stream mentors in this world. And they are, and that's so lots of kind of, they're very, very easy to overestimate yourself. I don't know if you've been on the internet, you have all the internet arahants. Have you seen those famous internet arahants? It's like arahants so and so on the homepage, right? Arahants so and so. Okay, that's not an arahant. That's absolutely true. So there is a lot of overestimation in the world. So really, what you should do if you think that maybe you are a stream and you should go to some teacher who can point you in the right direction. Yeah, someone you have reasonable confidence in might know what they're talking about. But again, it's very hard. You don't really know who in this world knows what they're talking about. So it's difficult. Anyway, something like that will be my, yeah. Yeah, please. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Bonté, for being here today. Really appreciated your thoughts. You said something this morning about the Buddha didn't teach Anapanasati that way. I'm wondering if you're referring to like when I learned, when I first learned how to meditate, you know, it was about you have to figure out where you're feeling the breath in your body. And it's like, okay, is it in the tip of your nose? Is your chest or your belly expanding and contracting? And that was how I was taught to have attention now. Is there something that, you know, it seems like it takes a lot of effort. So do you have anything to say about what you were thinking? Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, absolutely. So what I was thinking is just that the way the Buddha teaches mindfulness of breathing in the Anapanasati sutta is that he starts off by laying the foundation for the practice, right? And so he says there that you sit down, yeah, and when you sit down, you straighten the body, ujju kayang panidaya or something like that. And I always like to quote a bit of Pali because that gives me more authority, you know, I'm very naughty. So you straighten the body. And then it says you establish mindfulness, right? That's what it says in the sutta. And this is all before you start watching the breath. So you have to, you should ideally, we should have mindfulness first. And this is what I mean by, you know, getting things in the right order and not watching, going to the meditation object too quickly. Because if you go straight to the meditation object, and your mindfulness is not established, the only way you're going to be able to watch the breath is through willpower. And the Buddha says willpower is not really the way to go. You know, I mean, a little bit of willpower is going to happen anyway, because you can't avoid it. But we want to minimize the idea of willpower. And so the only way to do that is to establish mindfulness first. So a lot of the practice, when we sit down, is about allowing the mindfulness to arise. Sitting back, waiting, guiding the mind, guiding it away from desires and ill will, yeah, finding that neutral balance somewhere in between, not having any pain or pleasures through the body. So the body becomes irrelevant. This is the kind of definition of the middle way in the sutta. And as you do that, when mindfulness arises, then you wait. And often the best way, the way I like to think about breath meditation is to wait for the breath to come to you. Yeah, if you go to the breath, that's kind of the definition of willpower. But if you wait for the breath to arise, well, then you are doing almost the breath meditation almost automatically. Oops, certainly the breath is there. Okay, I guess I'm doing meditation now. And then it lasts for a while and you disappear again. And then you wait for it to re arise. And so this is kind of the what I meant by, there's a tendency, you know, there are certain systems of meditation where you are told you come into the meditation center, you kind of get set down on a seat and you get told like you watched the breath. And you don't really get told that actually breath meditation happens in a certain context. It happens, you know, with a certain foundation. And that foundation is really the what I was getting at when I was said this morning. Does that answer your question, Ron? Yes, thank you very much. Yeah, great. So how does one come to terms with the severe emotional trauma from my combat PTSD? Okay. That is a very good question. That's usually how you say when you don't know what to say, you say that's a very good question. But no, it is, it is, of course, it is a good question. And the I think the answer is gradually, that's kind of the answer usually. And I think with many things, it is, I mean, it's good to do spiritual practice. But with many things like that, it's also good to get some professional counseling, right? Because actually, these things are really hard to deal with. And sometimes professional counselors or psychologists, they will have some kind of things up their sleeve that we don't necessarily have in Buddhism, right? Because the Buddha was not someone who the I mean, of course, it is about finding happiness and letting go of suffering. But it's not kind of meant for people who have had specifically difficult experiences in life. So, you know, live, live well, yeah, do the right thing. And if the trauma is with other people, which it often is in life with other people, then just gradually learn to see those people in a different way. Yeah. I mean, we all had difficult experiences with people in life, I've had my share of difficult experience with people. But as you practice this path, you learn that actually, these people didn't know what they were doing, right? They had no idea. And the more you see that, the more you see that they were actually acting against their own self interest. If someone treats you badly, actually, they are making bad come out, they're going to feel miserable in the future. They think what they're doing is going to bring them happiness, but actually, it brings them suffering here. And once you start to get that you start to feel sorry for them, right? They don't know what they're doing, for goodness sake, yeah. And then actually, gradually, gradually, slowly, slowly, you can actually start to have compassion for even the perpetrators of crimes in this world, because they are foolish, right? Eventually, you have compassion for everyone. I mean, the victims is kind of fairly obvious, but even the perpetrators, because in the long run, they may suffer actually more than the victims. It's kind of a weird thing, weird way of looking at things. That's kind of the Buddhist outlook for you. It's kind of sometimes a bit upside down there. Yeah. So go with it slowly, you know, take it stage by stage. And I think it may be difficult for you to see now that the trauma can come to an end. But if you do it stage by stage, avenues open up, but you never have knew even existed a way possible. So, Venerables, would you like to, I forgot that you were here completely now, and now I'm reminded, would you like to add something here? Can I have a microphone, please? Okay. Yep. We can see what you think of this, Ajahn. Okay. I think when you're working with, it could be the whole mess of not just the things that happen to us, but the things that we've done also, because we're also caught in a system and we're also caught in conditioning. And when it comes to PTSD and trauma, I'm not a psychologist, so there's a lot I don't know, but I've been for a long time working with the first three noble truths as a way to work with that. And it fits in very nicely with some therapies like somatic experiencing, where you're turning towards that feeling in your body and being able to, in a supported environment, stay present with what the feeling is until you can really see that change and dissolve. And it is really good, as Ajahn said, to get support from someone who's trained to guide someone through those processes. But it really has a deep effect when you're able to let that unravel through the body, because the body holds on to those things. And then, of course, everything Ajahn said about how we see ourselves and others and that compassion and kindness. Yeah, you're welcome. Hi, my question is a little bit related to the previous one. But in my situation, I've been targeted a lot. Growing up as a mixed race person, being LGBTQ, gender nonconforming, and having periods of homelessness in my life as an adult. And I now live in a vehicle, and people come at me sometimes. Someone came at me yesterday telling me that I couldn't park where I was on the side of the road. And in those moments, when someone is coming, being confrontational with me, I find it really difficult to hold on to my compassion. I have so much PTSD around being targeted. And then it came up today in the meditation. And it's like playing in my mind. And I'm saying, I want to let this go. And it's just there. It's like I can see this person's face. And I was thinking in your example about the people, the person who was finding happiness in those difficult circumstances of the war. And I'm assuming he wasn't one of the people that was taken off the concentration camps. Obviously, my situation is not equal to that. But what do you do if you're in a situation of being the targeted party? It's very hard to find happiness when someone's in my face and telling me I can't exist where I'm existing. So thank you. Yes, indeed. And this is why sometimes the practice is difficult. And in a sense, this is also why the practice is so rewarding. Because gradually, gradually, hopefully you will be able to deal even with these very difficult situations. And the person, of course, who benefits the most from that will be yourself. Because the idea of being able to let go and have compassion is very beneficial. The person who benefits the most is always ourselves in these kinds of situations. So I agree with you. It is very challenging. But it is also, in a sense, what the Buddha is asking us to do. One of the most famous similes of the Buddha is the famous simile of the sawha. And the simile of the sawha is the simile where bandits kind of get hold of you and they pin you to the ground and they take out the big sawha and they hack you to bits with the sawha. And the Buddha says that whoever gives rise to a mind of ill will or a mind of whatever negative mind state while they do that is not practicing my teaching. So the Buddha is, you know, he's basically set in the bar incredibly high. And what that means, it doesn't mean that we should despair if we can't clear that bar because it's very hard to clear. But what it means is that this practice can have some extraordinary results. If we do practice it in the right way, if we keep on going, even though we may not be able to understand how it can be done, if we keep going, those results will eventually happen. And that is kind of the promise of the Buddha and that is what is so extraordinary. So even though you, you know, and I can obviously not fully understand what you're talking about because I'm not in that situation myself, but I have some idea because we all had difficult experiences in our life. Even though you cannot see the solution right now to that kind of situation, keep on going and one day the solution will appear. Suddenly you have put all of these things behind you and you say, wow, I can do it now. Isn't that amazing? And you will actually see those people in a different way. You see yourself in a different way and you're able to let go of things that actually for most people are impossible to let go of. And then you know that you're really reaping the benefits of this practice. So just keep going. Yeah, just don't lose heart. Know that these results are possible because there are people in the world. I meet people in my life who are extraordinary. Yeah, people who are just never get angry at all. I have lived with people for 30 years who I have never seen angry and that's kind of, is that possible? It turns out it is possible. So when you see these things, you know that the path kind of is there. You know that things that seem impossible in the world actually can be done. So please just carry on slowly, slowly, slowly. Keep on understanding what the Buddha meant by these things. Try to deepen your appreciation of these teachings and gradually as you do this, things will happen for you. You want to come back on that one? You're very welcome to come back if you like. Gone. All right. Okay. Yeah, please. Please, please, please. This morning when you were telling the stories about the man from Norway and and the some of the people's experience during the war in Ukraine, I mean I'd heard you tell these stories before but this morning something came to mind that I hadn't thought of before and I wonder what you think because there's a component there in both cases of having to do without the things those people were used to in their life. So there's an element of renunciation there and I just thought, well maybe they're in addition to all the things you said about, you know, coming together with others and having a purpose and being kind to each other, more caring, that's all incredibly powerful. Totally agree. But it occurred to me that there's also that having to do without some of what you're used to and seeing that you can do it and there's a kind of courage that arises. Do you think that might also be a contributing factor to that happiness? Yes, that's interesting, isn't it? Yeah, the fact that you are in the sense renouncing and you're living and you kind of become strong through renouncing in a sense and yeah I think that there may very well be something to that. I think it does make you strong. Whenever you renounce something you give something up but there's something in your mind which actually makes you a stronger person. It enables you to renounce even more in the future and there you are faced with it and if you because you're faced with your kind of force to renounce or either you renounce or you suffer even more so if you choose the right track then yeah that's an interesting point. I think you may very well be right about that actually. I'll reflect on a bit more and then kind of see what comes out of that one. Ajahn, in the morning when you mentioned Maha Parinirvana Suta, I think we discussed this in the mid-week KBB meeting. There's a mention that the Buddha, he can only, don't quote me on this, but he said that he's in pain, he's dying, but he said he dwells in the sinless concentration of the mind to survive, to deal with the pain. And also when Maha Kasapa was practicing, I think he's also being told by the Buddha to focus on the sinless concentration of the mind. I just want to understand what sinless concentration of the mind is if you any insights. Well a sign in this the Pali word is nimitta. So a sign is what is kind of how you recognize things. You recognize things by the sign. You look at person, what is a person, a sign of person with two arms, two legs, something like that, there's a kind of a person and a head. And so things are recognized through the signs. And if something has no sign, it means that all you're seeing is impermanence, you're seeing change all the time. So the signlessness is really a kind of a deep contemplation or a deep focus on things being changing all the time, looking at change and it's allowing things to, you know, you all you see is change, you see nothing kind of inherent in anything. Everything's just moving all the time. That is kind of the idea of signs. We have this kind of three types of meditation. We have the Sunyata Samadhi, which is emptiness concentration, not seeing in itself. And then we have the Animitta Samadhi, which is kind of not seeing anything as permanent, seeing, changing all the time. And we have the Apanihita Samadhi, which is a non-direction that is usually connected with, I think, with suffering. So it's kind of the three characteristics that are focused on in certain way. So how does that work and why does it work? Well, I don't really know. I think any kind of deep Samadhi would probably do at that particular point. Not sure why he mentioned the Animitta Samadhi. I mean, a Jhana state would have a similar kind of effect. The body is gone. But maybe it is because he would use different kinds of meditations, depending on circumstances or context. Maybe he wants to talk about different meditations to leave those teachings to posterity so that we have access to them later on. Maybe something like that. I'm not sure exactly why he talked about that teaching in that context. But any kind of deep Samadhi will kind of take you out of the, you know, away from the pain in the body. So yeah. To clear my mind, sometimes when I'm going into meditation, I go to gratitude and love, and it kind of washes through me. And I feel like it's a cleansing. Would you advise I continue to do this? Or is there any, does it make me not neutral enough in my mind? Or is there any thing that is slowing me down by doing that? That's good. That's marvelous. That's wonderful. Yeah, excellent. Splendid. So that's great. I mean, the whole, one of the kind of things about meditation practice is to give rise to positive feelings, you know. And if you're able to do that, that's wonderful, because that is, you know, one of the roots of meditation practice. The Buddha always talks about the six Anu Satis. Anu Satis are the six recollections. And one of them is the recollection of your Seela, the Seela Nusati or Chagana Sat, the recollection of your generosity. And whatever way you're able to give rise to those positive feelings, they become the foundation of the meditation practice. So what you would want to do is you want to incorporate that into watching the breath. Yeah. So you want to bring that joy that you have to the breath. You can maybe have gratitude to the breath. Yeah. Thank you, Brett, for being there without you. I wouldn't have gone very far. Right. It's true. So you can have gratitude to your breath. It's like, and you can see your breath as your friend. Yeah. Friend. I mean, if we are practicing breath meditation, it's like we are going with this friend on this kind of really interesting journey or meditation practice. Yeah. So you kind of think of your breath as your Kali and Amit or whatever, and you have gratitude and they bring that joy together with the breath meditation. I would really recommend people to do breath meditation because breath meditation is the meditation that the Buddha really teaches in the suttas. Yeah. Very fascinating. Is that when we often talk about Satipatana practice, Satipatana being the, some must call the foundations of mindfulness, which is not a good translation. Maybe the establishing of mindfulness or the applications of mindfulness or just mindfulness meditation or whatever. And foundations of mindfulness is not a good translation because anyway, let's let's leave that aside for now. We can discuss translation some other time. But he's what he says, which is interesting is that Satipatana is fulfilled by mindfulness of breathing. That's how you fulfill it. Yeah. All the force of the batanas are fulfilled that way. So all we have to do from where we are now to all the way to the end of the path is watching the breath. Yeah. Very simple. So simple. How come we're not arahants already? That's what I want to we should be there. It's so easy. And of course it is easy. The instructions are very simple, but actually putting them into practice turns out to be not, not so easy. Yeah. The path can really be summarized into two things, kindness and mindfulness of breathing. Yeah. Those two things together, that's the whole path. And it was just about putting them into practice. And then you kind of in business. So bring that joy with the breath and then see if you can make your meditation really come alive by bringing these things together. See how deep you can go. Yeah. Yes. At the back there. Yeah. Please do we have a microphone again? So about the Satipatthana Suta and you said that can be done through mindfulness of breathing. But from what it seems to me that Satipatthana Suta, it's, it's like these drop down menu that you can, you click on one and there's like a bunch more showing up and you kick on them and like a bunch more show up like the 32 parts and then earth, water, wind. So can that really be done through mindfulness of breathing or do you have to do some sort of go through them systematically, like, like scanning through different, these drop down menu? Yeah. So that's a good question. Yeah. So the, the answer is that, you know, the, the Buddha says specifically that mindfulness of breathing completes and fulfills Satipatthana. Yeah. He says that specifically. So actually according to the Buddha, that's all you have to do. But of course the reality is that you may get stuck. So what happens when you get stuck? You're watching the breath and it doesn't get anywhere and then you get tired, you get fed up with the breath and you know, it doesn't really work. And so then the question is, well, something is blocking you from actually being able to do that meditation properly. And that is where some of these other things come in. What are the blockages for the breath meditation to develop naturally? Yeah. And one of the main blockages is our attachment to the sensory world. The world of the five senses. That is one of the main blockages. And this is where the idea of the, you know, the 31 parts of the body, not 32, but 31, you know that there, that's exactly the brain. Yeah. So now you use the brain to figure that one out. That's interesting. So, so I'm saying that because I'll get back to that later on why that is interesting, but 31 versus 32. Yeah. So why? So then we use those kinds of meditation, the 31 parts of the body to let go of the senses a little bit specifically to the body, because attachments to the body attachment to the senses are very closely related to each other. So that's where that particular practice comes in. It lessens the attachment and holding to the body that allows the breath meditation to go deeper later on. Yeah. And then you practice the breath meditation in that way here. But actually you, so, so part of this whole thing is, yes, you do the breath meditation, but you're also aware of the obstacles. You're aware of why of the, you know, you only go so far. Okay. You need to do something. So now I need to do something more, which is like a contemplation or an understanding of the nature of these things that let him then go, then come back to the breath again. So I would say that the breath is plenty enough. And there's actually very many interesting things that comes from this idea. Because if you read the Anapana Sati Sutta, the Buddha's explanation of the mindfulness of breathing, it has 16 steps. You know how this works. 16 steps. So according to, so, I took the Satipatthana of course from Bar Center of Buddhist study. And that will be the first one. And the next one will be Anapana Sati. So, so say again, what would be the first one? So the first, so this is taught by Bhikkhu Analayo. Yeah. And the first one is Satipatthana. And then after you complete that, and you explore it a little bit on your own, then you can start looking into Anapana Sati. And so that's how I've been thinking about this. Okay. Well, I'm not sure exactly what he has said. Actually, I'm going to visit him when I go there. I think I'll be into that. I'll ask him what he means by this. So I, the, but in the suit, as the Buddha is quite clear, you know, that Anapana Sati fulfills Satipatthana practice. So if you go to the mid length saying to the Buddha, Suta number 118, called the Anapana Sati Suta, the mindfulness of breathing Suta, and you read it for yourself, you can see, see it for yourself. And actually what it says in there. And there are some very interesting consequences from that, because, you know, the, the mindfulness of breathing Suta is divided into 16 steps. Four times four, so four tetrads. And each one of those tetrads relates to one of the four Satipatthanas. Yeah. So the first four steps relates to the Kaya and the Pasana, the contemplation of the body. The second four relate to the Vedana Pasana, contemplation of feeling. The third one, the last one, Dhamma and Pasana. So the, so if you take the second one, which is the contemplation of feelings, yeah, that is equivalent to the second tetrad, the second of the Anapana Sati Suta. Now if you read the Anapana Sati Suta, the second tetrad, it's all about pleasant feelings. If we go to the Satipatthana Suta on contemplation of feelings, it talks about knowing pain, physical pain, mental pain, all of these kinds of things. So how can it be here that watching the breath and all only experiencing pleasant feelings actually fulfills the contemplation of painful feelings? It's not a question. I must kind of give you pause because I'm going to see the expression on your face. No, I follow something. I'm being naughty. I'm taught by Ajahn Brahm to be naughty. That's kind of how we do things and I'm on the street. So the answer is, right, that when you have a pleasant feeling in the mind or whatever, Piti or Sukha or whatever, the painful feelings have already been overcome. The painful things are completely gone at that particular point. And the way to contemplate certain things, the most powerful way of contemplating something is not in their presence but by their absence. So if you see painful feelings in the body, usually you are told, okay, go to the personal retreat, contemplate the feelings of the body. Yes, we can maybe get a little bit of insight from that. But the most powerful insight into painful feelings are by contemplating them in their absence. Because when something is completely gone, that is the only time we can understand something. It's like the old simile of the tadpole becoming a frog. When as long as the tadpole is in the water, cannot really understand water because it's always in water. How can you understand something that you're always surrounded by? Once the tadpole becomes a frog, jumps out of the water, oh yeah, now I get it. That's what water was. In the same way, when something disappears completely, it's completely gone, that is the only point. You can really understand it properly. That's such a beautiful thing to my mind. You don't have to contemplate these blooming pains, right? Just let go of the pains. Let it go straight to the bliss. Isn't that great? And this is kind of my kind. This is what I, because I'm a disciple of Ajahn Brahm. Ajahn Brahm is kind of the bliss kind of person, right? So go to the bliss right away. Forget about the pain. And to me that is a far more satisfactory path. And so there isn't really much explanation in the suttas anywhere apart from this particular thing in Satipatthana suta that you have to contemplate pain. No, contemplate pain through its absence. It's far more powerful and also far more pleasant. Please come back on that one. Please tell me off. If you think I'm wrong. I'll check the sutta first. Yeah, check out the sutta and see what you think. Thank you so much. It's always good to hear from someone with depth of experience. Yeah. I'm gonna, if you write down what when Anandial said to you, I'm gonna, I will confront him when I see him. Can we do one or more, one or two more from online? Yeah, please. Yeah, let's just take some couple more online. Yeah. All right. So there's maybe two short ones from YouTube. Ajahn, can you talk about the role of meditation in Buddha's gradual training? And then another one, what should one do when a spiritual mentor is unavailable? Right. Well, the second one first, the spiritual mentor is always available because the spiritual mentor number one is the other suttas. Yeah. So the Buddha is always there, the Buddha is still talking to us through the suttas. So take the Buddha as your teacher. I think one of the kind of really the mistakes that we make in modern Buddhism is that we take everyone as our teacher except the Buddha. Yeah. And kind of this Ajahn, that Ayah, that this Bantu, this whatever, and the Buddha is kind of forgotten in all this, even though he is the original teacher of teachers. And he's the Ur teacher. Yeah, the Eber teacher. Still, we forget about we forget about the Buddha. So take the Buddha, he's always there, and then you're okay. And if you can find a kind of living teacher as well, that can be helpful. Yeah, because it's good to have someone who can ask questions sometimes, but it's not 100% required. And then there are, of course, there's the YouTube teachers, they can take some of these YouTube teachers as well and see how that goes there. And the meditation on the Buddhist path, the purpose of meditation on the Buddhist path really is to, if you look at the Noble Eightfold Path, what is the Noble Eightfold Path? And what it is, it is a path of purification. Yeah, you purify yourself, it start off with the right view, that's just to get you going. And from that right view comes the right intention. And after right intention is all about purification. That's why it's all about morality is about right effort, which is about purifying the mind. After right effort comes the right sati, the right mindfulness, which is breath meditation, satipatthana meditation. And the purpose of that is to remove the last little defilements of the mind. So it enables you to attain samadhi, the deep meditations, the very profound stages on the path. So that is the purpose of meditation is the kind of the final purification of the mind for the mind to access the deep samadhi, the deep stillnesses of the that are there, which are required to culminate all the way to the very end of the path. That's really what it is about. And there's more to meditation, there's more to mental development than that. There's also contemplation and reflecting on the teachings. This is also extremely important, developing your perceptions, seeing the world in the way the Buddha saw the world. All of these things are part of the cultivation, but meditation proper, which is just watching the breath, is really about that. All right, so let's have a break. It's already 132 and then we can do some more meditation or whatever afterwards.
