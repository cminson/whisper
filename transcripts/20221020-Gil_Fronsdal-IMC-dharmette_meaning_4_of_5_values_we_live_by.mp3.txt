So the topic for this week has to do with the meaning that meditation has for us. 
And I know some people like myself at one point were a little bit allergic to the idea of meaning. 
But as I've come to understand the word, that it's really a broad word that covers a lot of ways in which we assign purpose, assign roles, assign functions, assign value, assign all these things to the activities of our lives to the events of our lives. 
That how we understand it in or interpret it in the context of our life story, context of our society, context of our beliefs. 
And there's kind of no shortage of the many, many ways in which one way or the other assign some interpretation to the meditation we're doing. 
So this week we're trying to bring some of that out and have you be more reflective about it in a way that would help your meditation, both in that it would help you not get caught up in assigned meanings that are not useful for you, get in the way, but also to recognize the useful ones are there to support, to give buoyancy, to give momentum, to give strength to meditation as well, to help you stay focused in what you're doing. 
So today that topic is the values that we live by and the role, the connection that meditation might have with those values. 
And it's hard to imagine that there's people who have no values at all, no ethical values, no sense of prioritizing certain attitudes to how to be in the world. 
And some of them might be healthy and supportive of self and others, and some of them might be harmful for self and others. 
But how does meditation fit into it? It would be unfortunate for someone who's a thief who feels that it's fine to steal, that they have no problem with it, and in fact they feel proud of their ability to steal. 
And they assign the value importance of meditation has for them is it centers them, calms them down so that they can do their profession effectively. 
That would be quite sad because of the harm that that does. 
But someone who is a caregiver, for example, and the value is to give the best care to someone in a medical setting or any kind of setting, and for them meditation has the value of doing the same, of grounding them, centering them, preparing them for the best so that the best of them can be present with wisdom and clarity for caring for the people in their care. 
And so here where the values we have, how we want to live, are brought to bear on meditation and meditations used to serve that purpose. 
One of the one things that really inspires me is people who want to live honestly, to really live, you know, without any lies, any deceit, any just really want to have the truth be the forefront. 
And with that as a value, mindfulness can be really a support for that. 
Mindfulness is a truth-telling practice. 
It's a way of connecting to what's true, finding what's true. 
And so here the assigned function, the assigned meaning, the interpretation of what meditation is, is that it's truth-making. 
Someone else, the values could be harmlessness. 
And so the function, the meaning, the purpose of meditation is to live a more harmless life. 
Someone else, their value is enlightenment, full, complete, total enlightenment. 
And so for them, the value, the purpose, the functions assigned to meditation is that this is going to support them to find a way to that enlightenment. 
There can be multiple functions happening the same time. 
There can be, you know, meditation can be as, can be the same meditation can be done for different purposes. 
It can be both for many purposes. 
It can be for truth-telling, for de-stressing, for coming with more groundedness to work that we do, to being on a path to awakening. 
So there's these, it's not like you're choosing one over the other, but to have some clarity about what's important, maybe what's most important around the values we have. 
And maybe even picking and choosing between, I think, are important for us to give, so we can give emphasis to one thing to do really well. 
If we have too many values, too many purposes, everything gets watered down. 
Nothing really kind of takes root and flowers. 
And sometimes in order to really do well, we have to kind of choose this is what meditation is about. 
This is what I'm developing and doing here and have some clarity with it. 
And what the benefit of that is that no matter what the purpose is and the really sense of getting behind it and having some dedication to it, as meditation deepens, it kind of blossoms out into all these different dimensions of our life. 
So you might put aside certain things as the purpose, the value, and later you'll find that if it's a healthy purpose, it returns in a whole different way. 
It may be a little bit like someone who, you know, moves to a foreign country where they have a different language and really wants to be friends with everyone on the street and goes around trying to be friends but can't speak a language at all. 
And so they dedicate themselves to learning a language. 
And once it's learned, they find that walking down the street that it's really easy to make these connections now because of shared language. 
So regardless of what the purpose is for meditation, learning to meditate well opens up in such a wonderful way to so many different things. 
So what are the values? Some people live, center their life on the values that they have more than the goals that they have, the work that they have, what they're trying to do in their life. 
And some people, how they live is more important than what they do. 
And I think that in Buddhist practice, I think that we emphasize much more the how than the what. 
That whatever what meditation is for, the way to it is by caring really carefully for the how we are, that we're not living a harmful way, that we're doing what's beneficial, that we're learning to be at peace and relaxed, non-attached, learning to be kind and supportive, learning that we have care to what we do, learning to be honest in all ways, learning to let go. 
So so many different things that so that we can be at ease, have equanimity, be at peace here and now. 
Some people's lives is the value they have is to be of service, to live a life of generosity and support. 
And so then meditation serves that purpose for them. 
For some people, it's to live a life of really practicing dharma for its own sake. 
And with the result of that, they want to live a life of service. 
So all these things are shifting and changing. 
In fact, over a lifetime of practice, that it's fascinating to see how the, what the interface is between meditation and the way we live our lives, the purpose, the values we have, what we emphasize as being important, the assigning of meaning, assigning of importance of functions to meditation and to our life and back and forth. 
And it shifts and changes in a dynamic way. 
And to hold on to any one way, any one purpose, any one meaning for what meditation is. 
Sooner or later we'll get all bottled up, get kind of limited and come to a dead end. 
And but rather to keep opening up, keep kind of looking and feeling and sensing all the different ways and functions and meanings and purposes that evolve over the years of practicing more and more. 
And it's like, it's like a dynamic stuff that happens. 
It's like, I don't know, it's like having a good friend and over the years, the friendship shifts and changes as the friend, the, the two of you change and shift. 
And, but somehow you stay connected and involved and things flow back and forth and change and unfold and, and, but because of the commitment to stay present and stay connected that it's, it, you all change together. 
So the same thing with meditation. 
So to understand some of the values that you live by and that come into bear on meditation. 
And some of them, you know, are, you know, and then see how they shift and change. 
And one of the way they change is they move. 
Sometimes we discover through meditation that some of the values, some of the assigned purposes, some of the attitudes we have about meditation don't work, that they're actually harmful for us. 
Straining in meditation, being attached to states of mind that we're going to attain, holding on to calm, holding on to bliss that might be there. 
These are all, these, these kind of holding on and wanting and overvaluing particular states of mind are kind of a dead end. 
They're not really that helpful. 
And so if a value is, it's all about attaining a state. 
It's all about having, you know, some wonderful experience so that I can just add it to my repertoire of wonderful experiences. 
That doesn't, that's kind of a dead end to go, to attain, to experience the full potential of what meditation can be about. 
If there's a lot of conceit involved in meditation and the assigned meaning is that, is, has to do with, I'm going to be the, you know, the best meditator on my block and everyone will like me and accolades of how wonderful I am because I'm such a wonderful meditator. 
Or if I meditate well, then my meditation teacher will praise me and put me up on a pedestal and will be happy ever after. 
So those kinds of assigning of meaning, assigning a purpose, assigning a function are dead ends. 
And they'll just, you know, end up kind of knocking your head against that dead end until, you know, you go find a different way. 
So to look deeply, what is the meaning of meditation? What's a function? What's its purpose for me? So here's an exercise I'd recommend that you do for these next 24 hours until we meet again. 
And that is, you know, with a paper or with a computer, write the, the words, meditation means for, for me, meditation means, and then fill in the rest of it and do that 100 times. 
And every time write something different. 
And so I know, I would have some years ago, many years ago, I would have, maybe I would have written down meditation means nothing. 
You know, I was kind of, would have dismissed the whole exercise. 
But then because it's a hundred different times, you have to kind of keep going. 
And meditation means that I sit on my cushion. 
Meditation means that I sit early in the morning. 
You can say kind of physical things like that, but does that really get to your heart? Does it really get to some deeper thing? And just kind of keep writing, keep writing 100 times. 
For me, meditation means after a while you can drop it for me, but that's the idea behind it. 
And see what you discover and, and stretch yourself. 
It doesn't have to be all at once sitting to do all hundred in one time, but maybe over the 24 hours you can write down a hundred, fill in that sentence a hundred times. 
So thank you very much. 
And I hope that the exercise is enjoyable and useful for you. 
And then we'll finish the series tomorrow. 
Thank you.
