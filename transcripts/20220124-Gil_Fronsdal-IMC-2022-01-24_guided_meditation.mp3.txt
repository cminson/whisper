 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So good morning everyone, good day. It's my pleasure to welcome you today to the Insight Retreat Center in Santa Cruz. I broadcast from here a few weeks ago on a Monday. This week I'll do all the days here teaching a seven-day retreat. And I really wanted to be able to continue this series on Satipatthana. So I'm delighted to be here and to share this wonderful place with you. You don't see too much of it, but you certainly see the altar. And one of the things that I could say just to get a sense of what IRC is like. The altar was built by a practitioner here, a woodworker and beautiful altar that he spent many months building. His inspiration is generosity to the center and the Buddha was a gift from practitioners here at IMC and people who loved IRC. And so this little picture of how... And you see the paint on the wall, the color of the paint, maybe it's nothing particular special. But there were volunteers here and I was part of a team. The aesthetics team that was considering every color and what would work for a meditation hall and for a retreat center. So it's all... There's all this... It imbued this place with this wonderful Dharma dedication of many, many people to make this possible, volunteers. So you get a small taste. If I look around IRC, I see this replicated a thousand, ten thousand times of all this wonderful things that support that people have provided for the center. So when we started the breath exercise in Satipatthana, the instructions are when breathing in a long breath, no, you're breathing in a long breath. When breathing out a long breath, no, you're breathing out a long breath. And the same with a short breath. And I take that as being shorthand for when you breathe, know the characteristics, the qualities, know the experience of breathing. And the operating word here is to know. And the most common verb, most common activity that we're instructed to do in the Satipatthana is actually to know. And one of the ways of understanding this that I like is that the knowing is a kind of recognition. And it's a moment of recognition. And there's something very special can be discovered in just a simple act, moment of the recognition. And if you kind of spend some time experimenting with the act of knowing, this recognition knowing, you might be able to find that there's some quality of freedom, clarity, spaciousness perhaps, non-identification, non-reactivity in the simplest way in which we can recognize what's happening. And so it doesn't take too long to, you know, the idea that mindfulness takes a while you have to kind of do it for a while is certainly true that there are benefits that come as you continue to do it. But to have too much focus on the future and what you're going to, how it's going to develop, you miss the opportunity to discover how wonderful it is just in a moment of knowing, of presence. So if you would just maybe for a moment close your eyes and as you are and find some neutral but clear sensation that's happening that you're experiencing. It could be a sound, it could be sensation in your body, it could be breathing. And recognize it with a word like hearing, sensing or touch, warmth, coolness, movement, whatever it might be. And say that simple word in a very simple, easygoing, relaxed way but with some kind of like this is really what you're doing, you gather yourself around just a simple act of verbal recognition in your mind. And an easy pace, either continue with the same sensation or continue with whatever sensation comes to you very, very easily just like there it is and you recognize it. And experiment with having that act of recognition feel free, free, kind of not sticky, not reactive to the experience, not judging it. And just the clarity of, oh this is hearing, as you hear my voice, hearing. If the chest moves, moving, just really, really simple but see if you can gather yourself so that you're not, that's what you're doing. You're not kind of on the side, in the background of that, underneath it, mostly having commentary about it or commentary about this exercise and questioning it. Just like give yourself over for one, like a moment to recognize a sensation you're having. And see if you can find a way in your mind to do that recognition so that it's a spacious, receptive, allowing, open, maybe has some quality of the knowing is free of what is known. And this might feel like a little bit of work if you've never done this kind of focus like this. But this is the direction that mindfulness meditation can go, where it becomes simpler and simpler, more and more easeful, but it's a, we're taking refuge or resting ourselves in the mind's capacity to know, but not a knowing that's necessarily work. It's almost like a natural knowing that the mind does, a natural recognition. We're recognizing recognition so that that becomes clearer and stronger and we start discovering the freedom, the peace that's in that moment. So to start the meditation, to assume your meditation posture and gently take a few long, slow deep breaths on the exhale, settling into your core, settling into the center of your being. Feeling your breathing return to normal and continuing with the normal breath as you exhale to settle into your body, maybe as if you're relaxing and settling into your core. And then as you're breathing. Know your breathing. Know if your breathing is fast or slow. Know it to be long or short. Know it to be deep or shallow. And without working too hard at it, see if you can recognize the simplicity of recognition, simplicity of clearly knowing the simplest recognition that has no commentary, no judgments, a recognition that's light, useful. If the mind wanders off in thought, see if you can discover the simplest possible recognition that that's happening, a recognition that has some quality of being free of reactivity, free of preference. And then begin again with your breathing.ney. As you make the simplest acts of knowing, of recognition, do you have any sense that your mind is pulling away or leaning into searching? Maybe it's possible to have the mind neither search or pull away. The mind itself can rest, trusting the simplicity of knowing, just knowing. Bring in breath, out breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. Bring in breath. And then as we come to the end of the sitting, maybe giving us some contemplation about what it's like when you feel really known by someone else. Not necessarily they know everything about your history, but even a stranger takes five minutes to get to know you and you feel somehow they really knew you to the extent to which you were at those five minutes. What is it like to be really known? And what's it like for you to know someone else? If there's no words to be spoken and you're with someone and you really know them, recognize, allow for some clarity of recognition of the humanity of some other person. There can be an intimacy in knowing. The simplest and fullest knowing maybe has no barriers. Maybe it has no judgments. There can be something clean about only knowing, but knowing well, knowing clearly. And as we develop our capacity to know intimately clearly, may it be the channel by which we convey our care for the world, our love, our generosity, our respect. May what we learn through this meditation practice support us to be a conduit of care and love and kindness. And may our good will spread across the lands from person to person, a ripple of goodness out across the world, wishing, may all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere be free. And for this morning, I'm not sitting with the bell anywhere nearby. So I'll bow and you can join me. That can be the ending of our meditation. Thank you.
