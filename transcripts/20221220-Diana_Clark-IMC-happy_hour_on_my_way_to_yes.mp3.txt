The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So welcome, welcome. It's nice to see you all.
Here we are. It's quite something, right, that we are coming together all these times.
I think it's just an amazing, beautiful thing.
So I'd like to read a poem. I think I've shared this poem in this setting before.
And maybe we can look at it through the lens of the inner critic. Working with the inner critic is this theme I've been doing for quite a few months now.
And I had been looking at this poem not through that kind of framework, but I think it fits nicely here.
And the poem is called Healing Time, and the poet is Pescha Gertler. Pescha Gertler.
And the poem goes like this.
Finally, on my way to yes, I bump into all the places where I said no.
To my life, all the untended wounds that read in purple scars, those hieroglyphs of pain,
carved into my skin, my bones, those coded messages that send me down the wrong street again and again.
Where I find them, the old wounds, the old misdirections, and I lift them one by one, close to my heart.
And I say, holy, holy.
Maybe I'll read this, the little less drama. It's simple this time.
Finally, on my way to yes, I bump into all the places where I said no to my life.
All the untended wounds, the red and purple scars, those hieroglyphs of pain, carved into my skin, my bones,
those coded messages that send me down the wrong street again and again.
Where I find them, the old wounds, the old misdirections, and I lift them one by one, close to my heart.
And I say, holy, holy.
There's something really beautiful about this poem that she's noticing that I like the beginning.
Finally, on my way to yes, I bump into all the places where I said no.
I think this has been my experience as that kind of opening to once life, my life, my practice, my inner life, my outer life,
start to see like, oh yeah, here's the places where I was contracted and said no in some kind of way.
And often we're saying no because there's this inner critic that is saying, well, you shouldn't do that, you can't do that.
What if you fail? What if it's not okay to be vulnerable? That's risky.
There's all these things here that are kind of pointing us to say no.
To be sure, sometimes saying no is the exact right thing, but that's not what this poem is about.
This poem is saying, on my way to yes, I bump into all the places where I said no.
No to ourselves, maybe getting disconnected from ourselves and no longer present for not only ourselves, but for those around us.
And then that poet, she continues and she's talking about these scars.
We all have scars, right? This is what it means to be human is to have painful events happen and to have scars.
Some of those scars are in the forms of learnings.
But some of them are also in the form of limitations we set on ourselves for our life or in our life.
But I love this, she says, the poet, they send me down the wrong street again and again.
And then she says, the old wounds and the misdirections going down the wrong street.
Lift them one by one, close to my heart. And I say, holy, holy.
So this way of saying, okay, this is what my life is. I was getting expressed. This is how my life has unfolded.
And I'm not going to disown any part of myself.
Every part of my life experience, every part is here to be honored, to be respected, to be cared for.
It doesn't mean that we think that everything we've done is the most wisest thing that we've done.
It doesn't mean that we don't have regrets, but it does mean that we're stopping to trying to excise parts of ourselves,
that we're trying to get rid of parts of ourselves.
This is the inner critic that thinks that we have to somehow get rid of.
But this practice is all about integrating, bringing these things in, especially those parts of ourselves that we think are awful and terrible and we wish weren't there.
Because there's somehow, there's a way in which our thinking that it's terrible that keeps it separate and there's some energy around it while we're trying to hide it or squash it or something.
It's not only by allowing these parts of ourselves to be seen and heard and integrated as best we can, that they soften and the power behind them diminish and then our life can unfold differently.
So so much about this practice is creating the capacity to be able to do that.
And actually when we have these lifelong habits of trying to wish parts of ourselves away.
I lift them one by one close to my heart and I say holy, holy, beautiful.
So before we go into the guided meditation,
we just go off the phone with Nikki and we were just kind of like brainstorming a little bit about what we were thinking about happy hour.
Just we're just in the brainstorming stage.
We're just thinking, well, you know, is it time? Should some changes be made? And I made a little poll, but somehow I must not have saved it because now I can't offer it to you guys.
But we'd like to just like hear from you guys. So maybe we'll do this informally so many of you have your camera off so only a subset of you will be able to participate.
Maybe you could like raise your hand or maybe raise your hand like your zoom hand or something.
So here's a question.
Would you still be able to attend if happy hour were one hour earlier?
If you were at 5 p.m. here in California or 8 p.m. on the East Coast, would you still be able to? Is this something that would still work?
Like I said, we haven't made any decisions, but we thought, oh, you know, let's invite you guys into the conversation in this way and see, you know, how this would work for you guys.
So you want to vote right now so that we're not confused?
Yes. So if you could do it, you know, put your hand up, that would be great. And I'll count them this way or put your thumbs up either. Okay.
Here's a yes.
Okay, thank you. I'll add that to the list.
And there's some people that are saying no. Okay, right. You know, we know this that it won't work for everybody. We just wanted to get a sense of like, is this a, yeah, sense of reactions. Okay.
Okay.
You want the no vote?
Nope. I'm just going to do the math here. So with those of you who aren't saying yes, it would be a no.
If I were able to launch the survey, it would have been yes, no, I'm not sure, but I'll just count the yeses here. And Nikki tomorrow will do it, the survey again, and probably I'll do it on Thursday again too.
But this just gives me a sense.
And then, so maybe you could put your hands down now because here's a second question.
What about this idea of if happy hour were early, I'm sorry, shorter, only 45 minutes. Does that make it, would that make it a little bit easier? Like on those days when you're on the fence, like, oh, am I going to go?
Would that be nice to have 45 minutes or maybe like it really doesn't matter if it's 45 minutes or an hour. So would the question is put your hand up if you would still be able to go if it were 45 minutes rather than 60 minutes.
Would that be a way.
Whether very good.
Some people be like, yes, or, and some people like, I don't know what you're talking about. I always leave after 45 minutes anyway. So, right, that's what many.
Some people do. Yep. And so can I say that you wouldn't want to give up the 30 minutes meditation.
Yep.
Yep.
And some people are saying can do it, but I would hate to cut it. Yeah. Yeah.
I just want to get a flavor here.
I'm sorry that I must not have saved this survey or somehow zoom isn't cooperating with me.
Okay, okay, great. Thank you. I'm getting a sense of that.
As I said, no decisions have been made. We're just brainstorming and somebody said, like it would 15 minutes longer. Thank you for the vote of confidence.
That's very nice. That's very nice. Yeah, right. There's some ways in which if it were longer, we get to explore more things and that would be that way.
Okay, thank you. You can put your hands down.
If you're not, you can leave them up if you'd like, but so now I'm going to transition back to happy hour this meditation that we're going to be doing this idea of this poem.
Finally, on my way to yes, I bump into all the places where I said no.
And I would say that part of this practice is helping to heal those places where we said no or invite them in, or maybe that some of the scars allow us to learn from whatever it is they have to teach us something like that.
So let's let's do some meditation.
And our meditation posture, slowing ourselves to relax, settle in, arrive.
Dropping down into the body.
What is this body like at this moment.
Rest in the attention on the sensations of breathing.
Feeling the body move as it prays.
And if the mind wanders, we don't have to make it a problem.
Simply, gently, begin again.
Turning into being sensitive to the sensations of breathing.
And then we'll start our loving kindness practice will start where it's easy.
Somebody that does supported you in your life that you feel this warmth appreciation gratitude.
Family members that you have an uncomplicated relationship with.
It makes the heart smile. Some people use their furry family members.
Some people use the imaginary kittens puppies babies.
Another is to choose a loveable being that allows the heart to open or soften as best it can at this time.
So connecting with this loveable being in an image to mind or otherwise somehow connecting.
And then to support this cultivation of loving kindness.
You can repeat these phrases.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.

Sometimes it's helpful to speak directly to this so-called inner critic.
I know you're trying to help, but that's not helpful.
