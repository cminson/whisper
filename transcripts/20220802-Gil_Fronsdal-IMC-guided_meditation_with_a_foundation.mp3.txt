 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello, my friends. It's good to be here. One of the primary foundations of my life is the Dharma and Dharma practice. It's certainly nice to be able to share it, but it's also very nice for me that I have this time to sit here in my meditation posture and to kind of tap into the Dharma, express the Dharma, live the Dharma in a way that is meaningful and connects me to what I, for me, is this foundation. And to be able to live close to this foundation through one's day, through one's years, is one of the great vehicles for a meaningful life, a peaceful life, a life that brings a lot of gladness, a lot of happiness. So each of you who are here, whether it's the first time or you've been here since the beginning of the pandemic, are also here to, in a sense, tap into something within yourself that is valuable, something inside of yourself that can be a refuge or a support, a foundation, that maybe you have some sense that it can bring you gladness, happiness, sense of satisfaction. And exactly what it is in relationship to what we do here is probably a little bit individual for each of you. But especially for those of you who have been here for a while now, I'm confident that you have something that is valuable and important that you tap into. And perhaps as we go through today, especially this meditation, that it is not the words that come from me that are important, but rather what you recognize in yourself that's important. So underneath your challenges, underneath your sadness, underneath your maybe resentments and hurts and pains and frustrations, anxieties, there is a foundation that's deeper, a foundation that is enacted to be known, that is not something we search for, but something that we live, something that we enact, that we practice, we engage in. And for people who spend too much time looking for a foundation, looking for something valuable, they miss the key thing that it's almost as if the answer is in the looking. If the looking, if the mindfulness, if the awareness is one of being available, being open, and valuing this capacity we have to know and to enact the knowing, enact the presence, the attention, the hearness here. So maybe this hearness of your own can be a foundation. So to have a meditation posture, and one of the advantages of meditating for, ongoing, is that maybe the posture you find starts becoming part of this enactment of attention, of awareness, of presence. And so maybe giving some care to your posture so it can be an enactment, it can be part of this engagement, bringing forth your beings, your bodies, your heart's capacity for being present. And to lower your gaze, and even if you have your eyes closed already, it might be possible to lower your gaze as if you lower your gaze a little bit so the eyes can relax in their sockets. To recognize that the eyes do not have to work when we're meditating. And then gently closing the eyes. And then slowly and gently taking some fuller breaths, in breaths, maybe three quarters full in a slow, gentle way. And then exhaling with a longer exhale than usual. When you come to the end of the exhale, maybe there's a way of relaxing that allows the exhale to continue. And letting your breathing return to normal. And as you exhale, scan through your body to see if there's places you can relax. The face, the shoulders, the chest, the belly, maybe the hands and arms. But as you relax these parts of your body, see if that in that relaxation, in the softening, there might be a little bit more sensations, sensitivity, awareness, aliveness in those parts of your body. Ter awareness, into those feelings. And one analogy for meditation is that the awareness that we enact, the awareness that we abide in is a bit like the ocean, broad, deep. And all the emotions and feelings we have are like the dance of the waves on top of the ocean. Sadness and gladness, happiness and unhappiness. Fear or confidence, anger or love. They all have their place dancing on top of the surface. But rest in the depth, the fullness of your ocean. Rest in the depth in which things appear on the surface. Allow them to be there dancing on the surface without identifying or reacting to them or needing them to be different. But don't base yourself on the waves. Base yourself on the deeper embodied sense of the presence, attention, awareness, mindfulness. Vast like an ocean. The ocean does not need to identify or be concerned with the shape and the character of the different waves on the surface. They come and they go. So. If you're sitting here with some concerns, especially concerns that have an emotional aspect to them, for these minutes, think of them as the waves on the top of the ocean. They're there because of the winds, but that you are not the waves. Hear the vast, profound ocean, vast, profound ocean of awareness, of attention, of presence, of embodiment, aliveness. Rest in that ocean and allow the waves to do what they do without denying them and without believing in them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. Rest in that ocean and allow them to do what they do without denying them. The ability to be mindful of oneself gives us also the ability to be mindful of others. May it be that our capacity to feel and know and enact mindfulness allows us to have deeper, richer respect than care. May we live, offering our attentiveness, our care to others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may our life contribute to that possibility. Thank you.
