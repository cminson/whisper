Dharmette : Being a Lighthouse in the 
Storm   
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

In places like Greece , olive trees take about twenty 
years before they become big enough to bear fruit . So 
the people wh o are going to be olive farmers  have to 
plant twenty years in advance for the ir crop. The story is 
that when olive farmers get to be  seventy  or eighty 
years old, they are still planting olive trees that are not 
going to bear fruit in their lif etime . But they are planting 
them for the future .  
 
Last week, some of you may recall  that there was a five -
year-old girl  here practicing and meditating with us, and 
she sits at least as quietly as all of you – at least! It’s 
quite remarkable to see her sitting next to her d ad.  
[Practitioner]: She’s here today too.  
So you being here today is maybe planting a seed for 
someth ing to happen in twenty years. Who knows what 
you’ll  remember or what this does for you? What are 
you nurturing and supporting by just being here? The 
story about the golden Buddha , which I talked about in 
today’s practice note, was and effort to choose  
somethi ng to teach that might wor k for you as well – something  that might plant a seed that will bear fruit in 
twenty, thirty or forty years.  
 
The long -term perspective is to remember that great 
tides come and go in history , and how we participate 
matters . How not to get too caught up in the moment – 
even  in a tradition where we’re dedi cated to being in the 
moment – so that we can  take into account the big 
picture as well.  
 
When I was a graduate student in religious studies, 
there was a professor named  Michae l Saso . He was a 
fascinating man,  a Jesuit priest , who had  gone through 
his Jesuit training at a seminary in China or Japan. He 
was fluent in both Chinese and Japanese , and he’d also 
been ordained as a monk the Japanese Tendai 
tradition . He was deeply invo lved in Buddhist practice 
as well , and then became a professor of Buddhist 
Studies . When he eventually retired from teaching, he 
disap peared into s outhwestern China , where it’s quite 
poor, and spent his retirement travelling between 
villages building schoo ls. He’d use whatever retirement 
money he had to build a school , and then he’d go on  to 
the next town , like Johnny Appleseed.  
 
When I showed up in the graduate program, I  
introduced myself to him and said I was a Vipassanā  
practi tioner. And he really  brightened up and said, “ Oh, 
Vipassanā ! That’s when your attention is 360 degrees all around – your awareness includes everything!”  
 
We have to remember that our awareness and practice 
is meant to include everything , and one of the things it 
includes is o urselves . For some people , the challenge is 
how to include e verything in one self – the good, the bad 
and the ugly – the whole show of what’s here. To 
include our suffering, our joy, our disappointments,  our 
fears, our discouragements – to include how it is . 
 
The 360 degrees of Vipassanā doesn’t stop with the 
360 degrees of ourselves, but it also includes 360 
degrees of the world around us . To be able to be a 
witness to the world , and take it all in – the good, the 
bad and the ugly – and to see it clearly , to hold it in our 
attention , and to learn in that 360 degree awareness  to 
be like a lighthouse.  
 
Lighthouses are pretty stable . They’re solid ; they don’t 
move around;  they d on’t look discouraged in storms;  
they don’t look afraid. They just stand t all, and are able 
to shine their light in a balanced way , and do their job. 
Our ability to look 360 degrees in all directions, insid e 
and outside, comes with the cultivation of stability and 
confidence in the value of staying mind ful and seeing 
what’s here . 
 
This is  one of the gifts we can give to the world : the 
ability to stay present and be a witness in all directions, with balance  and stability, without collapsing  or getting 
swept up in the tides of fear and discouragement. Tides 
come and go . We can’t st op the tides , but we can keep 
the lighthouse on . We can keep the awareness on and 
take refuge in the lighthouse, take refuge in the ability to 
see what’s going on , and have confidence in that – and 
not lose the confidence because the storms are 
particularly big or strong.  
 
I think with what’s happening in America right now , we 
have a great need for this 360 degree awareness , 
where we attend mindfully, carefully and 
compassionately to what’s within us  – to make space for 
it and  to be with whatever  is going on . But it  may be 
even more important to learn to take our attention 360 
degrees around so we can be a witness to what’s going 
on in our society.  
 
Being a witness means that we are w illing to understand 
the suffering in our society . The huge uphe aval that is 
going on right now in America  with this new president  is 
bringing  some people a tremendou s amount of 
suffering . As they say in the news, a lot of people are 
feeling ignored , and t hey’re reacting to that . But if we 
set up a world of me versus  you, us versus them – 
whatever  side of the political spectrum we’re on – 
there’s going to be suffering . People are going to feel 
dismissed , ignored , or pushed away.  
 The pendulum will keep swinging . One the ways to be a 
lighthouse for the world – shining  on everything equally 
– is to take an interest in being a witness, in being 
present , and in seeing and unde rstanding not what’s 
happening  on the surface,  but what’s going on more 
deeply.  
 
The specialt y of Buddhism is to be able to look, 
recognize , and see the underlying suffering that is 
responsible for so much of the dysfunction  and 
problems in society.  To be able to have compassion for 
that, to be there for that, and in so doing, to start 
planting se eds that might not bear fruit in your lifetime.  
 
No amount of goodness is ever wasted. We all have 
infinite resources,  an infinite seed store of goodness 
within us . We can take those seeds and scatter them 
around the world – maybe we won’t go from  town to 
town build ing schools – but maybe we can go from 
neighbor  to neighbor  and bring our goodness into the 
world , plant ing seeds for something important to 
happen.  Maybe they’ll bear fruit in a we ek, or maybe will 
bear fruit when our five -year-old girl becomes twenty -
five, fifty -five or seventy -five. Who knows when and  how 
all this spreads and goes out  into our society and the 
world ?  
 
If there is o ne thing that Buddhism offers, it  is the idea 
of refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha – refuge  in the pr actice , and knowing that  it’s possible to remain 
confident in the midst of tremendous challenges and 
difficulties.  It’s possible to remain present, to be a 
witness , and not be overcome and overwhelmed  by 
what’s happening around us or within us . But to stay 
upright like a lighthouse for this world, so our light can 
shine on what needs to be seen : the good, the bad and 
the ugly. I always feel this expression is a little 
inadequate, but I guess it doesn’t make for good rhythm 
to say, “the good, the bad, the beautiful, and the ugly .” 
 
In 360 degree awareness , part of the wisdom of being a 
practi tioner is knowing where that light needs  to be 
shone at any given time. T oday, I suspect a lot of it 
needs to be shone  on ourselves , so we can real ly be 
present for h ow we feel, for  what is going on with our 
thoughts, fears, discouragements, or even the sense of 
betrayal that some  people feel, and to shin e on that.  To 
have confidence in the shining, confidence in the power 
and the value of mindfulness, in being present  and 
aware . That’s the home we can live in – the home of 
mindfulness.  
 
So with those thoughts, does anyone want to say 
anything or ask anything?  
 
Practitioner  1: What you’re saying and the events of 
the last two days , what they  bring  up in me  is more 
softness, and supremely valuing the honoring of goodwill. It’s increasing  the intention to find it  whenever 
possible.  
 
GF: Great, nice. Makes me think of how a pearl is made 
by the thing that irritates the oyster.  
 
Practitioner  1: Yes . 
 
GF: So maybe it could mean new pearls now . 
 
Practitioner  2: I just want to say that talking about the 
lighthouse is interesting because  I grew up on the East 
Coast and there are a lot of lighthouse there . The shape 
that they are built in is rounded , so that w hen the storms 
come, the water pushes and goes around it . It’s always 
been a really powerful image for me.  
 
GF: Nice. 
 
Practitioner  2: And it still stands and shines.  
 
GF: Nice.  A couple of months ago, I met someone 
whose  introduction to Buddhism and medit ation was 
when  she was backpacking and met this other 
backpacker who had spent time at the Tassajara Zen 
Monastery . Somehow it ca me up that he was going to 
teach her how to meditate there  in the wilderness . His 
instruction  for meditation was to imagine tha t you’re a 
boulder sitting in a river , and everything else is just water rushi ng by. That was the instruction  for meditation 
– so a little bit similar to that. Thank you.  
 
Practitioner  3: I spent last night, election night , with my 
daughter in San Francis co. My daughter was up all 
night and this morning crying , and I’m aware of the 
tremendous grief that’s around today . Although the 
lighthouse image is very beautiful and I feel it in my 
heart, I think there is also a time where one has to sit in 
the darkness, with the clouds , the rain, and the storm.  
 
GF: Right. T hat’s the 360 degrees . It has to include our 
grief and the people who are mourning. One person told 
me today that she feels like s omeone just died . So you 
have to sit with that too . If we don’t sit with and shine 
our light on that , then we’re short -changing ourselves, 
short -changing the world, short -changing the pearls  
being made . The heart of it is to allow the grief to be 
there , but to stay as the lighthouse, stay ing firm, strong, 
and mindful – as opposed to succumbing  to it and falling 
into it. 
 
Practitioner  4: I’ve been pondering what you said this 
morning , and I’m actually feeling kind of excited , which 
seems very strang e. In lots of ways , I’ve been ignoring 
the craziness that’s been going on , and trying to look at 
the big picture, the macro . Clearly  what you said is true 
– there are  a lot of people in a huge amount of pain right 
now. I think the pain is going to get bigg er. The saying is, “M ay you live in interesting times.”  I think it’s going to 
be very interesting to see what happens in the next four 
years . And I have to  hope that the pendulum is gone. 
Maybe it needs to go a little further before it changes 
and things become better . But I try to loo k with some 
sense of optimism at whatever is happening . Ultimately  
this is going to help people gain a better perspective of 
what it is that needs to happen , and I haven’t a clue 
what that is.  
 
GF: There’s a lot of wis dom in what you’re saying.  I 
appreciate it . I’m remi nded that the other date with 9 
and 11 in it, the original 9/11, and now it’s 11/09 . The 
events of 9/11 had a big impact on many of us . They  
had a big impact on me . The bigger the impact that 
something like this has on us, the more important it is to 
do more than just be mindful of it. It’s important to have 
a way of actually responding. Pla nt an olive tree;  do 
something . We do a dis service to ourselves if we don’t 
actually step forward and respond in some  way and do 
something. It doesn’t have to be running for president 
yourself .  
 
In 9/11 the big change that I did , which has had an 
impact on me for the last fifteen years, is that I started a  
training program for Buddhist c haplains , training people 
to be able to respond to the suffering of the world, to go 
out to places of tragedy and crisis : hospitals , prisons, 
and other places. I put a lot of time and effort into training people – some people here today have gone 
through that training program. I felt like I had to do 
something.  I couldn’t just go back to business as usual.  
 
It’s too easy to feel tremendous overwhelm,  grief, anger, 
sorrow – all kinds of things – when  something like this 
happens , and then after a few weeks or months, going  
back to norma l. I think if we do that, we do a dis service 
to ourselves. Hopefully we can allow these things to 
change us in some way , and how they change  us is 
very individual for each person.  
 
For some people, maybe it’s the job that you’re already 
doing , only now you feel you do it with more kindness 
and dedication , to support and help other people more. 
Maybe you’re more dedicated to be of service to  the 
neighbors  and other people around you . When they’re 
sick, you go shopping for them , or bring them food . 
Maybe it means you get involved in an organization or 
political party . If we’re not changed by this,  then that’s 
where the lighthouse analogy is limited . I suppose the 
lighthouse could deci de to do a better job, like making  
sure that the mirror or the glass alwa ys stays clean and 
is always on. But to think that you should only be 
mindful is not enough . It’s the beginning ; it’s the heart  of 
it all, where it all begins. The light  comes out of that.  
 
“How do you want to be changed by this ?” is a 
question I want to encourage you to carry with you over the next week or so. How do you want to be different? 
How do you want to change? How do you want to be 
affected by this , so that in some way the world becomes 
a better place because of you? Because if it’s only a 
matter of overwhelm, or anger , or grief, then the world 
will just continue the way it  always has.  
 
One of the things I really want to try pass on  is the 
tremendou s importance and value of having confidence  
– having  confidence in the practice, confidence in 
yourself, and confidence in the value of moving into  the 
world to make a difference – as opposed to looking to 
other people as if they’re supposed to do it , that  they’re 
supposed to make things better , or they’re  supposed to 
do it better . But it begins with us.  
 
I think that’s one of the teachings of Buddhism : that 
every world, every future always begins with you . That’s 
where it begins . So if you want a future wo rld to live in , 
and if it begi ns with you, if you’re the seed – how do you 
want t o go forward next? It could be in small ways or  big 
ways , so lo ng as it’s  something.  
 
It’s a curious time . I agree with Jeff that we don’t know 
what’s going to happen. It’s possible that major 
upheaval, major challenges are coming , and that when 
things get shaken, something will arise out of the ashes . 
Sometimes it’s good to shake things up to see what 
goes on. We don’t know wh at’s going to happen , and that’s also something to keep in mind . Pay attention. 
Watch what’s happening so that you’re prepared.
