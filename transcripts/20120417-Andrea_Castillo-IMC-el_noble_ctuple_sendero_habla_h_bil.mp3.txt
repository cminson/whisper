The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
This was the Able Intention.
One of the Able Intensions that we can propose,
which is of great benefit to us,
and all those who come in contact with us,
is the one to re-capacitate before speaking.
The topic of now is the Able Talk.
We can propose every day not to say anything that hurts others.
What some of you have already heard,
something I told you about when I was a child,
that my father told me,
Andrea, remember that words can hurt more than a hit.
I think we all have experienced that reality.
The Buddha considered the Able Talk in personal and spiritual development
so important that he assigned a specific area to it,
in the Noble Octopless Ender.
In the speeches called Majjhima Nikaya,
the Buddha describes five qualities of the Able Talk.
That is, our language must be opportune,
must be true,
affordable,
beneficial,
and emanating from a state of bondage love.
The goal is that before speaking in any relevant exchange,
we should ask ourselves the question,
what I am going to say is opportune,
is true,
is affordable,
is beneficial,
originate from a state of bondage love.
If you do not have one or more of these qualities, it is better to shut up.
Now, a Able Talk implies both speaking and listening actively.
It is equally important to know how to listen.
The quality of how we listen is of enormous significance.
If we listen with a clear mind and in peace,
the person who speaks will feel warmly welcomed.
Girls usually say that the person who listens is the person who loves at the moment.
So, in Able Talk, it is about expressing ourselves honestly and clearly,
while we put our attention to others
and offer them a respectful and compassionate attention.
With each word and gesture, we must communicate
our motivation to give and receive in a compassionate way.
Marshall Rosenberg, the author of the book The Non-Violent Communication,
writes that Able Talk implies a dual attention.
That is, we are attentive to what we perceive, feel and wish for this conversation,
and at the same time, what the other person is perceiving,
feeling and wishing for at that moment in the conversation.
So, it is not easy at all.
In reality, we do this at the end.
If any of you are interested in this topic,
this book that Marshall Rosenberg mentioned is wonderful.
It also exists in Spanish, originally it is in English.
Now, another essential part of Able Talk is, of course, Able Thoughts.
If we spend a long time involved with thoughts full of avarice,
evil, will, envy, it will have a negative impact on our humor, health,
and of course, talk too.
We think that our talk is the messenger of our thoughts,
so we must start by paying a lot of attention to the quality of what we think.
Converting our thoughts in the talk is so easy and happens so quickly,
which is why we must pay a lot of attention,
because when we are less aware, we already said something that was not Able.
This is what makes it extremely difficult,
which is so easy and so fast that we speak.
But it is also of great benefit, although we make mistakes time after time,
and this happens to all of us, to keep paying attention.
Now, the way I am going to organize this talk is focusing on each of the five areas
or qualities that Buddha mentions for Able Talk.
The first quality is, as I mentioned, the opportune talk.
Its opposite would be inopportune.
I think we all have seen ourselves in situations where we have spoken,
and then, with great shame, we realize that it was totally inopportune.
Depending on how much we have developed full attention,
we are going to be able to first recognize if the moment is an opportune moment.
Second, if we are able to resist the temptation of not speaking if it is not correct.
Surely, in this sense, it is the excuse of something that needs to come out.
Third, if we are able to recognize the appropriate moment
so that our contribution is taken advantage of.
The writer, Michael Nagler, reports in his book,
in search of a nonviolent future,
a story that considers an ideal example of what opportune talk is.
Michael Nagler and his wife were invited to a very formal dinner
at the house of a French Baron when they were visiting Paris.
The Baron's wife prepared a very elegant dinner,
and while they were eating, the Baron left the comment.
I am in favor of racial inequality.
The wife of Nagler validated, knowing that her husband was going to get angry with this comment.
Nagler, however, who had already had a year of experience meditating,
knew that the moment was not opportune to answer.
Why? Because he felt very upset about the comment, he felt angry.
A few minutes later, the Baron commented,
Do you know that nothing in the world is more important than love?
Which Nagler quietly replied,
Do you think that races have been gifted with an equal capacity to love?
The Baron immediately captured the connection that Nagler had made to his previous comment
about racial inequality, and he was stunned.
Nagler applied at the moment the full attention, and it was opportune.
He knew he could say something very constructive at the right time,
and this was much more beneficial and powerful because he was able to penetrate the heart of the Baron.
This would not have happened if Nagler had refuted and immediately judged the opinion.
Remember that when someone perceives a criticism, he takes the role of opponent,
and the possibility of receiving and transforming disappears immediately,
and the conversation gives a turn to a fight.
Now we see the second quality, which is, is it true language?
Of course, it would be false.
The truth is something very powerful, but it is like a very sharp knife,
that you have to know how and when to use.
We can hurt a lot with the truth sometimes.
In other words, it is of great benefit to investigate first what our intention is
when communicating the truth.
If our intention is to manipulate the other, is to cause harm,
or gain his gratitude or sympathy, then it is an inalienable act.
I think it is important to realize that there are many ways to lie.
For example, to say partial truths.
When I was a teenager, I became an expert in telling partial truths to my parents.
On weekends, when they were going to the field,
I wanted to stay in the city with my friends at a friend's house to attend parties.
They knew very well what to say and what not to say.
Similarly, to shut up in certain situations can also be a lie.
If we have been witnesses of an accident and we are asked if we saw anything
and we remain silent, we are lying.
Or in the same situation, if they ask directly to me
and instead of talking, I move my head saying no with my head,
I am also lying.
I am not using words, but with the language of my body, I am saying no.
When considering the veracity of content,
it is important to consider veracity of feelings.
Loveful and affectionate words must be sincere and motivated by a noble purpose.
Because if we talk with gentleness and kindness,
while we think or do the opposite, then it is hypocrisy.
Now we move on to the third quality, which is affable,
and we say that the opposite would be aspero.
In Buddhist teachings, it is said, and I quote,
each person who is born with an ache in his mouth,
an inable person who uses abusive language,
cuts himself and others with that ache.
In other words, the aspero language insults and hurts others
and lowers us.
We know that it takes years to grow a friendship
and with offensive words we can destroy a friendship in seconds.
Dante Kunaratan in his book writes that the words brusque and aspera
return to the same as a boomerang, and they hit us when we least expect it.
Within the affable language field, it is worth mentioning the old accomplishments.
These words seem affable, but they have something to do with respect.
This type of language is especially harmful,
because it seems to be affable and therefore penetrates more easily.
So the people who listen are under the impression that we are being affable,
but in reality, under the table, we are attacking them.
For example, I can tell someone,
I congratulate you that you are practicing meditation,
because how do you need it?
There it is, that was an ambiguous compliment.
We are using the word as an ache, although apparently we are giving a compliment.
We could think of several examples.
But we have to be careful, because it is common to do it, one by one.
One does not realize it.
If we practice the affability of our speech,
we will recognize that the conversation with someone is a constant,
receiving and giving.
So we need to be careful not to fall into the temptation of long monologues,
with the exception, as in this case, that they are giving a lesson.
Because in this way, if we enter these long monologues,
the other person does not really feel perceived,
but realizes that we are lost, fascinated with our own ideas.
I do not know if you have noticed,
the important thing is the tone of voice.
It can be terribly confusing.
For example, for a child, if they use a very sweet tone of voice and say something gross,
they have discovered that it is of enormous importance, much greater,
the tone of voice than the content of the words.
Think how our dogs understand us at home.
They are totally very sensitive to the tone of voice,
but not the content.
The words do not come.
But the tone of voice is immediately captured.
As you can see, there are endless issues that one can see in every quality,
but so that it does not stay too long, we continue.
The fourth quality is to be productive, constructive, and the opposite would be destructive.
A few days ago I listened to a podcast that was about the importance of how we tell our stories.
We must be aware.
We assign ourselves to the role of victim.
We complain bitterly about our luck.
We criticize our family, our friendships, our acquaintances.
They discovered in these investigations that the people who are described as victims
and their stories are full of criticism and judgment have a great propensity to depression.
Every time we tell our story with these destructive interpretations,
it is as if we make a circle in the deepest hole,
so that the wheel of the carriage, when passing through this path again, falls into this hole.
This is what we are doing in our mind.
It has also been discovered, through years of research,
that the stories we tell are very little exact.
Why?
Because these stories are molded according to what we want to build.
So, the full attention invites us to discover that every time we see ourselves in the situation,
to tell our story, we have an option.
The deepening of the circle of suffering that keeps us trapped in pain,
or elevating ourselves to circumstances,
gaining a visible and liberating ourselves from our suffering.
I think it is beautiful to realize that we have this option.
It is a golden opportunity every time we have the option
that we see ourselves in front of a friendship and ask ourselves,
how was your childhood? Let us not leave these opportunities.
Now, it is not that we are going to give a virus to what we call simplistic and superficial
and that we say that everything is fine and beautiful
and that we do not want to face what it is.
No, but with each story, instead of repeating it in the same way,
we see if we can bring a little more perspective,
a little more bondage and compassion for our weaknesses and the others.
Leaving these scary narratives of our lives is similar to removing a great weight from us,
like the luggage we talked about last week.
These luggage that when we started the Noble Octopless Endero,
if we carry five luggage and try to move forward, we do not move forward much.
Each story in our history helps us to get rid of a few kilos
of the load we carry on our backs.
Now, it is also interesting to realize that depending on the person who hears us
and how he hears us, this is going to have a great influence,
skill or inability in the process of purification of our speech.
This is why the Buddha does great in capi, in which we cultivate wise friendships.
Now, how can we discover if we are making progress in the liberation of our past
or the stories we created about our past?
First, we are going to note through the full attention that when we think about the respect,
our body no longer tense.
When it no longer tense, we already know that we have gained a little perspective.
We are also going to note that when this issue arises in our meditation,
we no longer have the strength and seduction that arouses our attention for a long time.
Instead, these stories become like small waves that we see in the sea
while we are standing on the shore, instead of these giant waves that revolve around us
and that we totally lose the notion of where we are.
A few years ago, I met a doctorate candidate in Stanford,
who was very quiet, very intelligent, but very, very quiet.
When I met him, little by little, I realized that he never spoke ill of anyone.
The gossip was simply not part of his way of communicating.
He rented a room of a woman who was famous for being difficult among the students.
However, he never said anything to criticize her.
Little by little, I realized that this way of speaking of this student was like a gift.
I realized that I could trust him because I said,
I can tell you what I want. He will not speak ill of me on my back.
How many times has it not happened to us that we are talking to someone?
This person is criticizing someone who is not present and comes to mind.
What will this person say when I am not present?
If we practice a skillful and discreet language,
we will have more chances that others will not speak ill of us.
After my first long retreat in which I spent 10 days without speaking,
I noticed for the first time how much of our talk is totally unnecessary
and how much energy do we have in speaking?
How many times do we not speak because we fear silence?
Once I began to practice full attention and I began to observe how I spoke
and how others spoke, I found it very sad to observe that people who tend to feel very lonely
in social situations speak incessantly, without stopping.
It does not matter the content, as long as they are constantly speaking.
The sad thing about this is that nothing else is said to have meaning
and makes you feel the connection between the two people,
but the person who feels lonely continues to feel lonely after a communication of that nature.
So, what we want to practice as part of this practice are pauses.
The pauses when speaking allow us to check with ourselves
where I am now, how I feel, how my body is,
how the conversation goes, goes through a skillful direction,
how is the person in front of me?
It has been proven that people who have practiced full attention for a long time
are able to read a infinite number of gestures in one person in one or two seconds,
the majority of the people.
That is, do we really see the person we have in front of us or not?
Or are we lost in our own thoughts, in what we are going to say, and we are not listening?
With our attention we can monitor if the conversation goes through a skillful direction
and it is allowing us to connect deeply.
It is very useful to apply full attention
in situations where the conscious language is practiced
and to observe how it makes us feel afterwards.
I have observed that I feel as if I had eaten Chattarra,
as well as a sadness for the time I have lost.
But on the contrary, it is also very true
that if we have spent a time practicing Avala, Avala,
Sabia y Bondadosa, we feel deeply nourished, with great satisfaction and peace.
So, we want to learn to choose conversations
and participate only when they are able.
In another way, do we remain silent or do we sit down?
A conversation to cry does not benefit anyone.
The last quality is the bondadoso love.
The state is the talk that originates from a bondadoso love state.
If you take into account the four previous qualities,
they imply something external.
It is true, it is opportune, it is profitable.
That talk is more about the quality of the talk.
But the state of bondadoso love, there, if the Buddha says,
now look inside.
What state is this talk coming from?
It is nice to see these five qualities because it is about all aspects.
Cultivating bondadoso love is a process that happens
only when we think about the word Avala and the action Avala at the same time.
Every time we open our mouths, we can strengthen this bondadoso love state.
But it is also important to mention the way we talk to ourselves.
This is a way to cultivate bondadoso love.
The full attention discipline helps us to be aware of our inner voice.
We need to start with ourselves to practice these five qualities.
If our inner voice is opportune, true, affable, beneficial and loving,
our outer voice will be the same.
To start this talk, we need to understand the essential part of our thoughts.
They are the seed of the talk, or action, or skill.
And now that we are at the end of the talk, we return to this same topic.
It is of great benefit to understand the interconnection of thought, Avala and action,
and to remember that the consequences depend on the quality of our thoughts.
That is, also on the intention that we saw last week.
To finish, I want to read you a quote from the Buddhist scriptures called Dhammapada,
which summarizes this idea and which also prepares us for the topic of the coming week,
which is the fourth step of the Noble Octoplayer and which is actionable.
I quote from the Dhammapada.
Everything we are is the result of what we have thought.
It is founded on our thoughts.
It is constituted by our thoughts.
If a person speaks or acts motivated by a wrong thought,
the suffering will follow them as the wheel that follows the foot of the bull that pulls the wound.
Everything we are is the result of what we have thought.
It is founded on our thoughts.
It is constituted by our thoughts.
If a person speaks or acts motivated by a wrong thought,
happiness will follow them as a shadow that never moves away.
And that is the end.
We have a few minutes left.
If you have a comment or a question...
No, I have to talk to you.
Let's see, pass the microphone.
I remind you to use the microphone as close to your mouth as possible,
because otherwise the volume is too low at the time of recording.
While you were talking about the authenticity of the talk,
I made a click, a click that sometimes I move back from the truth to have the reason,
more than to tell the truth.
And when you were mentioning it, I felt it in my body, I felt my body reacting.
And I had not seen it so far.
There is a phrase that says, don't say what you think, think what you say.
But sometimes you forget.
But right now it made me fall into that.
Sometimes I use the truth as a shield, perhaps to protect myself from something.
But perhaps to have the reason, the argument, everything that is being presented.
But now I realize that I have to look more below that to see why I act like that.
These discoveries are very, very valuable.
This talk, at least since we have someone very close to us,
who is able to say things very constructively,
is something that we have to discover little by little.
And I think we all have areas where we are totally blind,
and we do not see certain patterns that we have to talk about.
Marshall Rosenberg says something very interesting in relation to what you were saying, Pablo.
He says, when you criticize someone, or judge someone,
let's say that it is the truth, but you are inventing this truth in the form of judgment or criticism,
Rosenberg says, you are putting yourself in the role of God, superior.
I know.
And he gives some exercises that someday, if there is time, we could experiment.
Because he gives you very precise and clear and practical exercises
on how to act in these situations when something does not seem right,
how to turn it around and say what is very connected to Judaism.
Because you have to observe what happened,
to say how you feel about it, to say why you feel about it,
and then to ask for a petition.
It would be possible for X to be equal to Z.
But it is always extremely important,
instead of if Mr. X says something that bothered me a lot,
then I say, what you said makes me feel myself,
and then it is all about how it is affecting me.
I take responsibility 100% for the feelings that arise from what the other person did.
In other words, you have to differentiate the cause and the stimulus.
When someone says something or does something that bothers us,
it is not the cause, it is the stimulus.
If we make this difference, we are taking 100% the responsibility
of our feelings, of our reactions.
Although the other person has done something scary,
it is the stimulus, nothing else.
And then I speak from here and I observe it,
and I say, what you said made me feel X, Y, Z.
Is that clear?
I came up with a question about the bone language.
When you mention that, I immediately remembered
the meetings with my friends in Mexico,
when I was in adolescence, we had to use the bone language a lot.
But it was very relaxing, we had a lot of fun.
It was my doubt, because we laughed at each other.
We laughed for almost two or three hours.
I love that you mention adolescence,
because when I thought about the bone language,
I also remembered my adolescence.
It is that stage where you are discovering the world
and you have these long conversations with your friends
and you feel that you are being very deep
and that you are discovering something totally new.
Everything is getting to me.
In reality, it is not about listening,
it is about getting more and more,
but in reality, I remember that it was relaxing.
I felt very good.
At that moment, because analyzing them
was a biennous language, it did not take you anything,
but we were very happy at that moment.
It is the stage.
When you are young and you are in that stage
of discovering the world,
you have your purpose.
There you are inventing yourself as an adult,
in those conversations of adolescence.
You are creating, you are inventing,
building this little person that is going to become...
You have to give yourself an identity.
Go ahead.
Reclaim your space.
Sorry, Pablo?
Reclaim your space.
Because at that time...
The microphone can be yours?
The other one, yes.
Thank you.
Yes, because we are all fighting for being significant
or for being relevant.
So, in adolescence, it is very normal
that the way we are more relevant
is through the one who is more...
As they say, the one who has more saliva eats more pine nuts.
So, the more you talk, the more popular you are,
the more recognized you are, the more rejected you are.
But it is a way that we believe
that we are preserving our space
within our social group or within society.
No matter what we say,
whether it is important or not.
But what makes us feel good is that we express ourselves.
That does not matter what we say.
It is the expression of the sexual energy
that is starting to rupture,
that is expressed at that moment.
And then it is the discharge of that.
So, we already feel good,
but then reality comes.
We have to pay the bills and everything else,
we have to do the task and everything.
But at that moment, yes, it is a great relaxation.
And now, for example, as an adult,
how good it is to use this type of language,
for example, to laugh, to tell jokes.
Well, I think that also has its place.
We are social animals.
It is beautiful.
There is a saying that says,
the shortest distance between a human being and the other
is laughter.
I love it.
People gather and have a good laugh.
It does good to everyone.
That is part of the joy of having friendships
and there is nothing.
I mean, it does not mean that we are going to have
deep talks and a lot of very serious content.
No, it can also be happy talks, very light talks,
while they are constructive.
One knows, one feels,
when you start talking out of curiosity,
or because you are afraid of silence,
or because you are nervous, or what I know.
And in those moments, it is good to say,
they took a few deep breaths and said,
I want to continue this conversation or not.
Is it worth it or not?
It is better than staying quiet.
Sometimes, what is passive is to continue a conversation,
especially a little superficial,
because the person we are with is the only way
he knows how to talk.
So we do it because we want to offer something to ourselves.
I think it is very important,
here the key is to observe how you are feeling.
But that is a very good question.
Let's ask a question.
Another question.
We see action-able, which is the second of the group of morality.
Remember that the first group was two in wisdom.
It was vision-able and intention-able wisdom.
Now, the next three are talk-able, action-able,
which is the second group of morality.
It is very good.
