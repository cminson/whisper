 There are a number of things that are coming together in my head or my heart these days. So I'm not sure how they're all going to come together in terms of a talk. But let me start, I'd like to start this way by telling a story that I've told often enough about. When I was 14, I lived for a short period for a few months in a boarding school in Switzerland. I was very much involved in choosing the boarding school. I knew I had to go. We had all these brochures, so I looked around all the brochures. A lot of them were unisex, so I chose one of the few ones that was co-ed. Once I got there, you wouldn't have known, because we were kept apart with guard dogs. I chose the part because it was a spectacularly beautiful place. The photographs were placed on the mountain side of the Alps overlooking this beautiful valley and the snow-topped mountains on the other side, right below a ski resort. Very pastoral and just seemed really idyllic. And it was. I was there for about three months. I found out once I got there that this school was also the place that, if you had been in delinquent or rejected by other boarding schools in Switzerland, that's where you went. It was kind of an unusual place. I was 14, and I was walking down the road, on the country roads one day, a beautiful spring day with wildflowers and the blue sky and the mountains. With an older friend from school, who was 17. Just spontaneously, it was an awe of the location I was in, the magnitude of nature and the sky. I blurted out and said to my friend, in this awe, something like, why are we here? What's the meaning of life? What's the meaning of all this that we're here? His reply to me, which I remember very well, was, don't be silly. Since he was the older kid, I thought, oh, I was being silly. That was a stupid thing to have asked. So that part of me just closed right up. Forget that. I'm not going to not show that anymore, but I'm not even going to let it be there for myself. So then for a number of years, that part of me was enclosed up, because of that one little statement that a friend had said. I believe for many people, the motivation for spiritual practice, spiritual quest, is very tenuous. For many people, it can be very powerful for them, because it can arise out of a very deep place within us. But the depth of it sometimes doesn't correspond with the real strength of purpose behind it. There can be a lot of other purposes in life which are on cross purposes with it. There can be tremendous demands and needs of society and work. The popular messages of society often go against that, so that we're embarrassed to show that side of us, or it seems awkward or wrong to show it, or there's no time for it, or we feel like we don't deserve it. And so it easily gets squashed. I believe that for different people, the idea of a spiritual longing takes different words, a different description. The word longing doesn't work for some people. For some people, it's a quest. I like the word quest a lot, because my belief is that human beings are... ...homo questions. That it's built into being a human being, to be questing, in the sense that as soon as we know something, as soon as we have some understanding about life or reality or something, there's always going to be an interest, curiosity, or something propelling us to want to know what's on the other side of that understanding. Every generation that comes along goes beyond the boundaries of understanding that the previous generation has had to some degree. You finally figure it out for yourself, and then your children come along and say, well, what's on the other side of that? Let's go poke and take a look. But I think it's part of who we are, just questing beyond. What's beyond what we understand? Into, in a sense, into the unknown. What's the unknown? For some people, they have quest works. Unless you're afraid, afraid to go on, they take a step beyond what you understand. Some people, it's a longing. Some people, it's a sense of suffering. Some people, they only get onto a spiritual path when their suffering is strong enough. The sense of longing or desire or wish for a spiritual practice might be there for years and years. I've known people for whom it was there for 30 years. But they didn't really take it up until they suffered enough. When they suffered enough, they had no other choice. I've got to do this. Nothing else makes any sense anymore. Sometimes suffering is what propels a person to take the step into really pursuing some deeper quest, search for peace, for love, for answers to big questions of life, for the possibility of freedom from a heart which is maybe covered, motivated by fear or ambition, or many things that kind of get in the way of the depths of our luminosity, our clarity, our deep peace. I think the need for spiritual quest or the need for the individual person to be engaged very powerfully in their own process of liberation, their own process of freedom, their own process of taking responsibility for themselves is probably stronger in modern American society than it has been in most societies ever. In the old days, when most of your community belonged to one religion, you were very closely tied to a community of faith that you had, there was no questioning of any alternative. It was taken for granted that there was one God and one church and one hierarchy and one book and one thing that provided the answers for you and your particular understanding of life. You didn't have to do a lot of reflection or thinking or deep analysis or deep inner soul searching to find what the truth is because it was handed to you. It was obvious. This is what it was. Everyone around you believed this. It's very hard to step outside of how we've been conditioned and trained, if that's the whole view of the whole society or your particular subsection of society. What's happened in America is that we have a strong legacy of democracy and we have a strong legacy of diversity. We have all these different peoples who have come into this society here and with different religious backgrounds. It was a big deal, 150 years ago, to have Irish Catholics and Italian Catholics next to each other in the same neighborhood. Who are they? People didn't encounter each other, let alone Protestant Catholics. There's a lot of conflict and tension within Christians in America. Now we have a wider circle of people who are appearing here and bumping shoulders. You have so many different options for spirituality. There's such a tremendous amount of diversity. How do we negotiate that diversity? How do we decide what is true? We could fall back on the religion of our family or whatever reasons, on some particular faith, out of blind obedience. How do we responsibly go through a situation, a religious kind of environment that's democratic and diverse? We're up to ourselves to somehow vote, to decide. Then we have to decide among this huge collection of different, desperate teachings and possibilities for what life is about. What it does do, for those who see it this way, it really puts the responsibility to sorting through the stuff for the individual. The individual then becomes very important. How do I, the individual means you. How do you find your own way? If you're not going to listen blindly to a teacher or a book or tradition, how do you find your way? You have a spiritual longing or desire for some kind of something. How do you find your way? How do you take responsibility and take authority for this yourself? Ultimately, in a sense, in a world that's completely diverse, you're accountable to yourself in a sense more than you are almost anything else. This works very well, of course, with a whole legacy of American individualism, which has its dark side. It also has its beautiful side. There's this beautiful story from, I think it's beautiful, nice story, from the 1830s around that time, when it seems that the Congress was deciding, trying to decide on a motion, a law, to allow the post office to be closed on Sundays. Because it seems to be in the early years of this country, post office was open seven days a week. Most people worked, I guess, a lot. And so they wanted to give the post office a day off, Sunday, you know, Day of God's Rest. And so a Baptist minister, who was also the senator from Tennessee, got up on the Senate floor and gave an impassioned speech saying that this was wrong. The reason it was wrong was that what was most sacred was individual conscience, and that you had to allow respect for individual conscience for people to decide for themselves what faith to pursue. And if you took a Christian notion of what is a sacred day of rest and imposed it on other people of other faiths, on the Jews in America, then you're imposing your faith over their own conscience. And this was, you know, a violation of kind of the sacredness of their religious worldview of this Baptist. Does that make sense? The individual conscience was considered to be so sacred by some of the early religious people of America that they didn't want to violate that by imposing even, you know, he was a Baptist, you know, he has a religion on other people by having a holiday on Sunday. So I don't know, eventually he lost out, lost the vote, I guess. But, and you wouldn't expect this from a Southern Baptist today, that kind of point. The Southern Baptists have changed radically in their teachings over the 150 years or so. But there's been a legacy also in the West, from Quakers and Baptists, many people, of pointing to that there's kind of a divine spark inside of us, each of us. And so again, the finger points back at us, we have to find that in ourselves, we have to somehow address this in ourselves and not in a sense look outside. The Buddha taught, one of the last teachings of the Buddha was that, he said, was, be a lamp unto yourself. And he, you know, the Buddha did not want to, in his last days of his life, the Buddha did not want to impose or assign someone else to be the leader, the authority when he died. My disciple, Shri Putra, or Mughliana, or whatever, he's the one who's really going to have what it, he's really going to, knows what it's all about, you know, rely on him. He said, be your own light, have the Dharma, have the teachings in a sense as your guide, but you have to be a light to yourself. So again, this is pointing back to yourself, I think is a very important aspect of Buddhist practice, and it's also very important legacy of our American culture. But what do we do when we turn it back towards ourselves? At the time of the Buddha, there were also a tremendous diversity of spiritual teachings around. And people back then had to sort through them all. And what's interesting is how the Buddha related to the diversity. The Buddha refrained from getting involved in some of the key spiritual questions that people were trying to address and deal with in his era. And these are some of the key things that many of us maybe think are really important for spiritual life. So for example, is the world one? Is there unity? Is all the same? Is it all one? It was a question he didn't want to address. Is it all diverse? Is it all diversity? Are we all separate in some radical way? He didn't want to address that question. What happens to, is the soul and the body the same? Is the soul and the body different? What happens to an enlightened person when an enlightened person dies? Does the person continue? Does the person not continue? Is the world eternal? Is the world finite? There's a lot of kind of questions, these kind of questions which maybe many people will think, this is what I want to know. And the Buddha refused to answer them. And the reason he refused to answer them was he said, these are not conducive to the spiritual quest. These are not conducive to your welfare and well-being. These are side tracks that get you away from this very important way you need to focus back onto yourself. You need to focus here. So then in the Kalama Sutta, which is also a very famous discourse of the Buddha, he was asked by some people who were not Buddhists, how do we make sense? How do we find our way through all these different spiritual teachings of our times? And the Buddha said, do not rely on what you've heard, on what is traditional, on what's in the books. Do not rely on your own reasoning, your own logic. Do not rely because it's your own preference. You know, what's kind of left? Don't rely on many of the traditional forms you have for taking this as what's authoritative. Don't do it out of respect for the teacher. Rather the Buddha said, he said, and it kind of paraphrased him, he said, is that you have to become the arbitrator of what is true, or what is worthy of being followed. And the way you do it, you don't have to do that alone. You can use the wise people around you as help. You can listen to them, and if the wise kind of suggests something, listen more carefully. It's kind of like you go to Stanford University or go to university, and there's a lot of different textbooks you could buy on any one subject, and you have some trust that the professor has chosen the right one that's current and most appropriate. You listen to wise people that kind of give you some direction to where you might look, but you don't turn the authority over to that wise person. But then more importantly, the Buddha said, you study, you pay attention to what is skillful, what is beneficial, and is conducive to your happiness. And what is it that is harmful and not conducive, which is unskillful for your own benefits and happiness. So you become your own arbitrator by knowing the difference between what are the actions that you do, what are the beliefs that you hold that create further suffering in you, or help create further happiness. The assumption being that each of us can know the difference between suffering and not suffering. Each of us, it's very hard to know whether the soul is eternal, not eternal, the universe and the self are one or different or something. How do you decide these kinds of questions? Upon what evidence? But, are you suffering and are you not suffering? It's something that you can really feel. And for the Buddha, this capacity we have to see that difference is really a touchstone for finding our way. It's really a touchstone for finding our way towards liberation and freedom. How do we become freer of our suffering? We can feel our way into that, which requires mindfulness. That we become present, very present, for our own experience. So we know when we're suffering, we know when we're not suffering. And it has been so many times where, you know, myself or other people, where the evidence of suffering occurring, that it's such a powerful clue of what's really going on, a powerful clue that something needs to be stopped here and look and re-evaluate what you're doing, is overlooked, because somehow the suffering propels us to outside of ourselves, to assign blame, to attack, it propels us to run away and be defensive, to get distracted. Suffering is a very, very significant and powerful tool for Buddhist practice, to stop and look at it and let it be a mirror to look more deeply. Because suffering is optional. The sources of suffering, there's an origin, a beginning of suffering inside of us, that we can do something about. So there's a lot of spiritual questions that Buddha didn't want to answer at his time. But the one of the very powerful and important currents of debate in spiritual circles at the time of the Buddha, had to do with the nature of causality or will or choice. Does human agency or choice, is there human choice and does it make a difference? And there were a lot of different theories at the time of Buddha. Yes. Some people said, no, there is no choice. You're kind of stuck and everything's predetermined. And you can't really do anything about your life and your suffering, you just have to go along with it. Maybe it'll kind of exhaust itself and then you'll be happy. Or other people said that there wasn't much choice, but there was little bit if you appease the gods. It's really the gods who chose your own happiness for you, but you could kind of at least make offerings to them and help them out. The Buddha said there's no spiritual life without choice, without causality. And that kind of points the finger back to us, what are the choices we make? And part of the function of mindfulness is to reveal where the choices are that we make. The choices are very difficult to see and the people who don't see their choices don't have choices. And we tend to run an automatic pilot. To paraphrase Jung who said something like, something like, very vaguely, if you don't see where your choice lies, then you're doomed to live a life on fate. Fate takes over, something other, you start acting unconsciously. So we stop for the suffering, so eventually we try to be mindful of it, so we can see where the choice is behind it. And sometimes it's as simple as seeing the choice to run away from it, or avoid it, or strike out, or all the kind of dysfunctional ways that we relate to suffering. But to stop to it, really be mindful for it and hang out there, allows us to see where the choice is, so we can choose to go in the direction of being happier, or not suffering as much. We're the only ones who can do that. The assumption I believe around this is that who we are in our essence is freedom. In our essence is this lamp, a light, a luminosity, a clarity, a peace that's at our core. And that the suffering is the surface of that, that obscures the possibility of deep love or peace or freedom that is in a sense, could be said, maybe our birthright, it's a possibility for all of us. So the mindfulness practice is a practice of really learning to stop and pay attention to what we're doing. And in doing that, finding the place where we can take responsibility for our own life. And of course it's a lot easier to want to assign the responsibility elsewhere. And many people who are, in many respects, look like adults, you know, are doing that in some ways. And one of the ways that people do it in spiritual circles, in meditation circles, is they think the meditation is going to do it for them. As if somehow there's magic kind of thinking about meditation. If I just put my time in on the cushion, if I just get a little calm or something, then something will happen and I'll be transformed. I don't know what that is, but if I just kind of do this stuff, then something will happen. Amazing things happen in meditation. Amazing things happen seemingly kind of outside of your choice and your involvement. The Buddhist spirituality, the nexus of it, the locus of it, is the place of choice. Where is it we choose? Where do we take responsibility? For the simple thing is, you're sitting in meditation and the mind is agitated. Where is your responsibility there? Maybe the responsibility is that when it's agitated, you see that you make all kinds of conclusions based on the agitation. This means that I'm a lousy meditator. This means I can't do it. This means that, you know, that this is wrong, this shouldn't be this way. That was a choice to have that view, that assumption. It's an assumption. There's a freedom, a certain kind of suffering when we don't have all these reactive ideas about what it means to be agitated. Someone I talked to a week or two ago, it was a big moment of release for her when she, who has a very agitated mind or a very busy mind, realized that she didn't have any kind of feeling. She didn't have to fight that. She could just accept that. And the fact was, even though she was very thought-filled in her meditation, there was a kind of mindfulness of that. And she had assumed that there had to be a silent mind in order to be mindful. But when she realized she didn't have to do that, then the suffering that encased the agitated mind was freed from her. So the point of choice there was, am I going to stay kind of locked in these assumptions and reactions and hostility towards my own agitated mind, or do I release that and just kind of be mindful of that itself? Very simple, but very freeing. Sometimes agitation is a way of avoiding our responsibility. It's avoiding feeling our suffering. Sometimes agitation is a convenient way of not getting settled to go deeper into what's really going on. We have to somehow be responsible for ourselves. We are the arbitrator. We are the ones who are accountable to ourselves. In a kind of New Age spirituality, it lends itself to the kind of teaching which actually exists in some circles, which is a kind of a misquote of Joseph Campbell. Out of context, the teaching of Joseph Campbell that many people will refer to is that he taught, follow your bliss. And the Buddha said, kind of similar, you have to be able to discern the difference between what is conducive to happiness and what is conducive to suffering, and knowing that, go in the direction of freedom from suffering towards happiness. However, that's a quote by Joseph Campbell, is in a section of one of his books that's titled, Bliss and Sacrifice. And if you read on further, beyond the chapter after he says, follow your bliss, he puts it in the context of the necessity of sacrifice and renunciation, which the Buddha also did for his discussion of his path. And sacrifice and renunciation is a big topic in itself. It's a phenomenally unpopular topic. Follow your bliss is much more popular. And what's beautiful is Joseph Campbell put both of them together. They both were needed together. So sometimes sacrifice means we actually have to sacrifice some simplistic idea of well-being to be able to go down into the darkness of our psyche. Sometimes we need to suffer more in order to suffer less. Sometimes you have to be able to face, drop the surface agitation and really face the deepest fears and tears and depressions that's within us, the darkness, the demons. And that's kind of that sacrifice then is the sacrifice of a certain level of well-being to go into the deeper stuff, to see through it and go to the other side. To be very honest with what it is so that we can find again the place of choice, find again the path that's in that to really find what's really deep inside. There's a beautiful story. I don't know how much of this is true but maybe it doesn't matter. It's almost like a myth. But I think it's true. And some of it's true. Some of it I knew from the papers back in the 1970s, 1960s. During World War II, the Japanese were retreating from the Philippines. They left soldiers behind in some of the jungles on the islands. And apparently they were told to stay here and fight the war until they come and get you. And no one ever came and got them. And they were kind of in isolated situations, maybe without radios or anything. And the Japanese being very dutiful kind of people often, these soldiers stayed fighting the war for decades. And what I remember reading in the paper, as late as the early 70s, was they found this Japanese soldier still fighting the war in 1972 or whatever. And there was a series of these people found. Maybe that was the last one in the early 70s. And what seems to have happened was that when it was discovered there were still Japanese soldiers hiding in the jungle, the Japanese would take out of retirement the most senior military officer from World War II and send that person to Vietnam to the Philippines. And the person would go walking through the jungle with his best uniform and his samurai sword and calling out in Japanese, you know, come out, come out. And so the soldier would come out of hiding. And the first reaction of the general was to thank, you know, the way the Japanese can, they're experts at thank yous. And really deep bow and thank you and gratitude towards all the service a soldier had done to the mother country. And just expressing gratitude and thanks. And then they would take the soldier on a boat and to bring the soldier back to Japan and be treated as a hero with lots of gratitude. And just before coming back to Japan, the soldier would be told, and by the way, the war has been over. It's been over for a while. And we want to thank you so much. You know, you're such a great service to the country and you're such a wonderful thing you've done. What they didn't do was they didn't laugh at him for fighting a war that had been over 25 years. They just constantly showed us gratitude. And then he came back to Japan. He was treated kind of like a little hero. So I think it's a very powerful story, whether it's true or not, because many of us are fighting wars which are long over. Wars that we were fighting as children. Wars that sometimes we're not our making. Horrendous things that happen to us as children. And we try to cope the best we can in impossible, confusing situations. And some people have all kinds of coping mechanisms to get them through. Very, very difficult childhoods. And some of them have to do based on fear and running away and being silent. Some have to do with all kinds of ways in which children kind of may manage to survive in sometimes really impossible situations of abuse and all kinds. And then what happens often enough is that the wars of childhood, the wars of earlier in life, are internalized as being the operating mode which we carry with us long beyond the time of that particular fight, that particular survival times. And many of us are fighting wars which are long over. And those wars then, because we're still fighting it, it plays itself out in new situations that we find ourselves 25, 30, 40. 50 years later. And some of the conflict we sometimes have with people have nothing to do with the actual details of the conflict today. But rather, really the core power of the conflict for us, the anger or whatever, has to do with the continuation of the deep fears or deep anxieties or deep hostilities that sometimes are remnants of these long, long, long over wars that we're fighting. So mindfulness is to stop and sit with all that. The really important aspect of mindfulness is to stop. Is to stop and be still and not run away, not go away, not avoid, but do the opposite of avoiding, but really feel and be present for what's really going on. What's really going on here in a way that you've never been before. And it's difficult to do sometimes because often it is a process which is somewhat unknown. We don't know how to even go through that. If you don't know how to go through that, the tremendous pain that we have, then it doesn't seem like we should go forward into something which is unknown because we don't know how it's going to resolve itself. We can't know how things will resolve themselves, but we need to be able to put the step into that unknown. Sometimes the reluctance to go into our deeper suffering is because we don't know the path through it. There's no map. But we have to be willing to stop and stop and really stop and go in and feel it and be for it. Slowly, slowly we'll see the places of choice. A lot of the places we'll see are the places of resistance. We've embraced ourselves against life and just let go of that resistance, the fear, the clinging, the attachments, so that we can find that lamp, that luminosity, that freedom, which is the birthright of all of us, which is tender and doesn't seem to offer much because it doesn't offer us a bank account or a house. It in itself doesn't offer safety or security or relationships, so we tend to kind of deflect from it very quickly. I think there's a tremendous gravitational force within us towards freedom, towards this deep heart, towards peace, this luminosity, towards non-clinging. The momentum, the gravitational force of other things sometimes carries the day. But once the gravitational force of desires, ambition, fear begins to lessen, then we get involved in the gravitational force that brings us, wants to go, takes us towards increasing freedom. The power of that gravitational force plays itself out in all kinds of ways, unusual ways in our life, mysterious ways in our life. I used to live on the farm in Tennessee in the 70s, which was a very large spiritual commune, where the high priest, or priestesses, I guess, of the community were the midwives. And they were considered the most sacred people there, literally, kind of like the priests, the high priestesses. And so there were a lot of midwife stories, birthing stories, that kind of went around. And there were a number of stories that went around, a lot of stories, it was kind of popular to tell these stories, of these home births. And there was like, not home births, it was tent births, everybody lived in tents. The U.S. Army issued green tents in the woods of Tennessee. And the stories of these home births, and somehow the baby wasn't coming, baby wasn't coming. And then the midwives would somehow intuit, or see if there was some unresolved tension between the couple, the husband and wife. And they'd say, you know, you guys have to work this out. And so there, you know, labor pains going, whatever, you know, just, you know, they would work out this intense conflict, and, you know, anger and hostility or fear, whatever. You know, the issue was, it had to be worked out, had, you know, unresolved. And they would resolve it, somehow, you know, they would deal with it in that kind of very charged situation. And then the baby was born. So the story that was told was that sometimes this very powerful need for resolution of certain things is so strong that it put on hold something as powerful as giving birth. Because something had to be done, something, real work had to happen. So the last strand of things I wanted to say today, which I don't know, I'm not sure how it fits into all this, but, it seems anticlimactic now to talk about this, but the, one of the ways I relate to my son, my three and a half year old son, is, he loves right now playing with Legos. And he had these little Legos, which are very hard to kind of, for him to kind of do, and you build these things and they collapse all the time. It's a great thing for frustration, you know, teaching, you know, it's very, you know, and patience. I think it's a really good skill for him to learn, but he often asks, you know, for me to help, or gets frustrated, or today's morning we were doing it, then, and I was playing with him, you know, nicely, you know, back and forth for a while, and then I started building something, but he wanted the piece that I had. And, just somehow it didn't seem right to kind of give him my Lego piece. You have to draw limits somewhere, right? And, it just, you know, it seems, it didn't seem, I don't know if it was my sake, but somehow for his sake it didn't seem right to always be getting into him, you know, and I feel like there was a chance for a lesson here somehow, and so I said, there seems to be a problem here. You want this piece, I want this piece. What's the solution, is there a solution? And, this is the way I often ask him, there's a problem here, is there a solution? I want to kind of instill in this, in the idea that if there's a problem, there's a solution that we can figure out, and, you know, he can help. What is a solution, can you think of a solution? But, in the last week or so, I've changed the wording of it, rather than saying, you know, can you think of a solution or the solution? What I'm trying to say instead, is, to him, is, in the plural, what are some of the possible solutions? I don't want him to get the idea there's only one answer, but rather there's a range of possible solutions to any problem. And, I was talking about this with someone on Friday, who was interested in creativity, and she said, one of the most common characteristics of creative people is a comfort with ambiguity. And, then I remember reading a study where they had given two groups of kids tests, and one group of kids, they said, there's one answer, you've been tested on the, getting the one right answer, the multiple choice. And, the other group of kids said, there are several right answers to this question, you have to find the right answers. So, they gave these two kids, they took the kids a test, and then they had, took a kid somewhere else, and said, okay, now you have to choose from these photographs, which these kids would be really, would be, you'd like to have on your baseball team, or basketball team, or sports team, or whatever. And, the kids who had just taken a test, where there was one right answer, had a very narrow definition of who would be the right people to serve on their team. And, the people who had a number of different, you know, understood there could be a number of different right answers, said that there were, you know, we had a much wider range of kids they would choose for their sports team, including handicapped kids and all that. So, the idea is, there's a number of different solutions. I think it's very important. The fact that you can find a solution, be comfortable with ambiguity, comfortable with the unknown. So that, maybe we can be more brave in going into ourselves and being honest with ourselves, and sitting with that which is our, you know, which is us, really discovering ourselves. Sometimes we follow our bliss, and sometimes we follow our suffering. And, hopefully you know, you know, which one is the right one to follow in a given time. But, the purpose of it is to find, certainly to find, take responsibility for ourselves, but ultimately is to find the possibility of freedom. And, with freedom, our freedom is a really a gift that we give to everyone else. If we do our own work, the benefits to the people around us will continue for generations. So, those are my thoughts for today, and I'm sorry to have talked so long. And, I wish you all the wonderful next few weeks. And, if you're interested in seeing the church, you can come up here and look at the pictures. Yes? So, what solution did Taurant come up with? Oh, what did we come up with? I don't think he was particularly motivated to come up with a solution. I think he kind of, his solution was to kind of, after a while, ignore me. Ignore the problem. I think, oh, it was, the solution was for me. I came up with a wonderful solution. I said, I mean, after a while, I said, you know, we played for a while. He kind of ignored me. Then I said, okay, I can give this piece to you now. It required taking apart everything I'd built. It would take a while. You can take this apart and get your piece now, but while you do that, I need to go and talk to your mom for a while. So, that was a wonderful thing for me to kind of keep him occupied for a while so that I could get a few minutes with my wife. I don't know if that was so skillful, but anyway, great. Thank you.
