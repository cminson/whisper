So this morning we're going to continue adding to our practice instruction by including awareness
of thoughts. Yesterday we began to include working with emotions and exploring the emotional realm
and usually we save thoughts till later because thoughts move so quickly and when we begin our
practice it's hard to be aware of them we usually were lost in them and thoughts have amazing power
they're so ephemeral and yet they impact our lives so much so it's really valuable to be able to
bring awareness to them so that we have more choice as to which ones to follow
and we can pay attention to thoughts in in different ways we can simply note that we're thinking
just be aware and you've been doing that already just softly note that we're thinking
and then we can look a little more closely at the content of the thought what kinds of thoughts
are these there can be thoughts of planning or remembering past or the future or stories fantasies
a lot of our thoughts are the story of me many of us have an internal narrator that's commenting on
what we're doing all day a lot of our thoughts are self-referenced so we can begin to notice that
and then we can notice the nature of thought itself what is a thought where do thoughts come from
where do they go who's thinking these thoughts so more the mystery of the thought process
and so as we become more aware of these these thoughts then there's more possibility to act
wisely and to be more at peace to be less compelled by our minds sometimes we come to practice in
order to stop thinking but one of the Zen teachers once said if you have a thought think nothing of
it it's they're not a big deal they come and they go they're ephemeral it's it's the power
that we give them and we fuel them by believing in them and by resisting them so as we practice now
we'll be exploring noticing thinking and then being aware at times of the content of the thought
being aware of the reaction to thought some thoughts we don't like and we want to push away
some thoughts we like and we want to follow them hold on to them indulge them and then to notice
the impact of the thoughts sometimes certain emotions come as a result of a thought or as you
found yesterday certain emotions fuel a thought it can go both ways and then we can be aware of
what's happening in the body as a result sometimes when we're lost in a big train of thought it can
help to to ask ourselves if I could reduce this story to one word what would it be
and it might be anger or hurt or fear or desire or whatever but just to see what's underneath
and fueling the thoughts so as we begin our practice settle into the body
establishing this mindfulness that's centered in the body
inviting the body to relax to be at ease soften
so the body is still at ease relaxed and the mind and heart open spacious curious
you might become aware of the rhythm of the breath
connecting with the breath
and sustaining the attention with the breath
the felt sense of the in-breath and the out-breath
receiving the sensations of breathing
see if it's possible to just adjust the breath gently so it's pleasant
so you can enjoy the in-breath and the out-breath
as though you could fill the whole body with this awareness of breathing
sensing the whole body as you breathe in and breathe out
the body calm at ease pleasant
and then including awareness of sound
continuing to be grounded in the body and including sound as it comes and goes
some sounds pleasant some unpleasant
some neutral
where are the sensations in the body
from this calm centered place
allowing sensations to come and go
some may be pleasant some unpleasant
or neutral
kind attention to however the body is
and then to notice what mood is present
what's the emotional tone right now
might be peaceful or irritated
content or sad just to notice
and aware of what happens as you pay attention to it
and then beginning to include thoughts the thinking process
thoughts can come as words or images
just simply be aware when thinking is happening
not to push away the thoughts or to get involved
simply to know
to notice the difference between being lost in thought and knowing that thinking is happening
what are you thinking about
planning remembering
complaining
being aware of the beginning of thoughts when thoughts end
is there a pause before the next thought
sometimes it's helpful to have the breath and the body be anchors
and from this place to be aware of thoughts when they arise
to notice the reaction to thoughts whether you want to follow them or resist them
and then returning to the breath as the main anchor or the body
or sound
if you like you can also explore having the thoughts themselves be the anchor
so you keep the mindfulness continuous knowing thoughts as they come and go
at ease spacious the thoughts the object of the meditation
what are you aware of right now is the mind thinking
what's it thinking about
simply to know without judgment
and be aware of what happens
some thoughts dissolve as soon as we become aware of them
others are more charged and persist
when they persist it can be helpful to be aware of what emotion is present
might be there's a mood that's fueling the thought
to connect with the body
to release the content of the thought and ground in the body
so
Is the mind thinking?
What's it thinking about?
What happens as you pay attention?
Is the mind wanting to follow thoughts or resisting them or simply knowing them as they
arise and then disappear?
Sometimes as the mind is more still, we can catch the thoughts at their heads as they begin.
Sometimes we notice in the middle of a thought train.
Sometimes we don't notice until they're disappearing.
Is the attitude in the mind towards the thoughts friendly or judging?
So we could greet the thoughts with friendliness and yet not invite them in for tea.
We can fuel thoughts by believing them.
Is this thought true?
By identifying with them.
At times there are gaps between thoughts.

What kind of thoughts?
Going in a useful direction?
How is the mind, body and heart reacting to the thoughts?
Is the body tense or contracted, open or spacious?
Is the discouragement or openness?
Taking the impact of thoughts on the body and heart?
What happens as you become aware of the interplay between body, mind and heart?

For the remaining time, we are establishing full presence, full awareness in the body.
And then open to whatever arises in your experience, whether it is a sound or a sensation, a thought
or a mood, in this relaxed, open place, knowing experience as it unfolds.
Calm, awake, present, knowing.

At times, it can be difficult working with thoughts, and we can think, if it wasn't for
my thoughts, my meditation would be great.
And at times, if it feels like it's too busy paying attention to thoughts, that somehow
you're thinking about thinking about thinking.
It can really help to simplify it and just come to the breath and be a little more one
pointed with the breath, the body, until the mind has some stability.
And as there's more stability, we can then turn again to explore the thinking process.
And it's so helpful to begin to understand our own thinking process, how it is we put
together suffering, our habit patterns.
And the more closely we look, the more we can see that.
And then it actually starts to untangle and soften, and then we begin to be more free
and have more choice about not repeating those same patterns again.
And we can have, I was mentioning during the meditation, using thoughts as the anchor.
And sometimes that's called mindfulness of mind, where you're just paying attention
to one, to thoughts, just knowing thoughts as they come and go.
And not necessarily using the breath or the body for an anchor.
So every thought is a potential meditation object and can take your practice deeper.
And if you hold it in that way, then thinking is not a problem.
It's just more possibility for being mindful.
And there are some tools that we can use if we really get caught in thoughts, if they're
really compelling and we get stuck.
In fact, there's a beautiful sutta on working with distracting thoughts.
And I won't detail the whole sutta, but clearly the Buddha recognized that distracting thoughts
are a huge obstacle sometimes in our practice.
But some basic things are that obviously if you can be mindful and just pay attention
and they dissolve, and you've all noticed that already, there'll be times when a thought
is soft enough, you just note thinking and poof, it's gone.
And other times, say if it's a really negative thought pattern that you're caught in, then
you can bring in some loving-kindness practice.
May I have friendly feelings, so you're turning your attention to kindness.
Or if you're having a lot of grasping thoughts, you could bring in some generosity towards
yourself.
So it's like an antidote to the thought.
At other times, it's as though you're driving down the freeway and you see the exit that
says past relationships, for example.
And so if you catch it in time, okay, keep driving, speed up a little bit, go past it.
But sometimes you've already taken it and it's too late.
And it's possible then to find somewhere to turn around and come back if you're lucky.
But we can get lost in those for a long time.
So you get to know what your particular exits are.
And so you recognize them and when you recognize it, looming, there's more potential for not
taking it.
And so it's almost like you have a stop sign, this is not a useful direction.
I have been here before, or maybe it's some old story that you're retelling for the
17th time, you know, enough stop, so you have like a mental stop sign.
And I find that actually helpful.
Or some people not now here.
Another one is if I could reduce this story to one word, what would it be?
And sometimes what that will do is put you in touch with the emotion that's underneath
it.
And it can be really helpful to come out of the content and yield to the felt sense,
the emotion that's fueling it, and what's happening in the body.
And if you can stay, suppose the one word is anger or fury, then oh, fury is like this.
Anger is like this.
This big, and there's so much anger here, and you keep paying attention to the emotion,
and then that gradually starts to unfold and pass through and untangle.
And you also begin to see how you fuel certain stories.
This gets added, and that gets added, and it gets bigger and bigger.
And that's called pappancha.
It proliferates.
And so again, seeing if you can catch what's the bare experience underneath that can be
very helpful as we explore thoughts.
And then I think the last, oh, and another one is ignoring thoughts.
So that would be like if the stray cat keeps coming around, you stop putting food out for
it.
So you sort of, you ignore it, you sort of bypass it, or you put your attention on something
else.
It might be you go to sound, or you go to open your eyes or something like that, and sometimes
that can break a compelling thought pattern.
And the last resort is to sort of be really fierce and warrior-like with the thought.
And I like to sort of think of the sort of compassion in that way, is suppose you're
in a pattern of really harsh judging thoughts, it's like, not now, enough.
But not in an aversive way, just a really clear way, okay, enough.
This is not useful.
So you're just sort of stopping the thought.
So those are some different ways that can help when you're caught in thoughts.
But mostly it's to really explore and understand your particular thinking patterns, and not
to see thoughts as wrong or the enemy, but to be curious about how they work.
And today, just a reminder that it's an opportunity to practice with the awakening factor of joy.
So just to, from time to time today, to notice, is joy present or not?
And not to judge if it's not, but just to notice.
And when you notice it's not, see if there might be something that's blocking it.
Maybe you're holding on to something, an idea about yourself, or something that you're holding
on to, that if you could release, there would be room for joy.
But to be curious, to, and if there is joy, oh, what's that like?
Joy feels like this, allow it to be here, and you might notice if you're holding on
to it or wanting more, but to allow it to be there.
And if you feel like it, that's times during the day, what am I grateful for?
And just allow that to bring some joy in.
So to include the awakening factor of joy, to consciously incline the mind that way.
Especially if you're feeling miserable, it can be helpful.
Go in the bathroom and smile at yourself.
That's guaranteed to make you laugh.
Have a nice day, me, me, whatever you want to do.
Just have fun with it.
So we have a few announcements.
This evening, again, we will.
