 So welcome, really warm welcome to everybody. It's nice to practice together and to see some of us, you know, day after day or week after week, month after month practice together. It's a beautiful thing. I feel touched by it. So in the classical description of loving kindness practice, it starts with before even mentioning loving kindness, one of the things there's a few things that it mentions. And one is to review the advantages of patience. Patience. This idea of things don't happen quickly, maybe certainly most things don't happen on a timeline we would prefer. Either they're too fast or too slow or something like this. So patience. And then part of the, as this kind of gets fleshed out just a little bit, it says, and when a person, maybe I'll say this, when you first read this, you think like, oh, okay, there's a recognition that it takes time to develop loving kindness, especially for the difficult people in our lives. It's not something that we can just jump right into and have it taken care of. But we do some loving kindness and then our relationship, our thoughts towards them are shifted. It'd be fantastic if it were like that. But I think all of us have discovered it's not quite so easy. And so I certainly thought this when I first read those teachings, I thought, oh, okay, so it's pointing to that things don't happen quickly and that we need to have some persistence. But then a few sentences later in there, it says part of the, it says, so we should review the advantages. That's the word that gets translated. The advantages of patience so that one can appreciate the advantages of doing loving kindness practice. That is, patience is a consequence of doing loving kindness practice is something that gets developed as something that gets cultivated as we do this practice. So often we don't think about that when we're thinking about loving kindness. We're thinking about maybe it helps soften our hearts or make us have less hostility or it will or those types of things. So I just wanted to say a little bit about patience and connected to loving kindness and compassion, these kinds of these heart practices. And so one thing maybe that's important to set when we're talking about patience. I know certainly for me, I used to think about patience is just like this kind of grin and bear it type of thing like, okay, I just put my head down and plow forward some way, then things will get better or something like that. So it's not so much about repressing our feelings or pretending that things are okay when they're not or trying to construct some phantasmagorical reality and pretend that things are different. But instead, it's about having one, a soft compassion. That is this recognition. Yeah, this is difficult. But we only need patience for things that are a little bit difficult or very difficult to it. The only things that we're uncomfortable with. So many of you know that compassion is first is this recognition, recognition that things are hard. That there's suffering sometimes we use this word. So patience also has this recognition. Yeah, this is hard. And that alone sometimes can shift a little bit our relationship with it. But I think more specifically, there's a sense of a like a gentle forbearance like this ability to not blur it out that maybe unskillful thing that we were thinking or did not to do that gesture or action just because we're feeling impatient. So holding our tongue or having some stability. But instead, to tap into this inner reservoir of our intention to do no harm. Not harming others, not harming ourselves. And this, of course, is our loving kindness practice can help us. This really to be cultivating this wish to do no harm to nobody to to not anybody to without exceptions. So this kind of idea of tapping into or having readily available this idea that we want to do don't want to do harm. Maybe gives us just a little bit of space that we can restrain ourselves or maybe our first impulse to blurt out or do some action or gesture that might be harmful. And then with this loving kindness practice, there's also an ability to be more accepting like increase our capacity to be with what's difficult so that we can include into what's our I want to use this word well our bowl or whatever that we can have access to is more and more. Have access to more and more uncomfortable experiences. My brains a little scrambled. I've been on zoom for untold numbers of hours today. I think it's I can feel its effects. Maybe I'll end with this. This song, a few lyrics from a song by Katie Lang. That Wow, I don't know, 15 years ago, maybe something like this. She has this line. I often wonder, is it so? The lessons of patience are learned slow. That's how we learn patience. This finding ourselves in places where we feel impatient and not acting out. Not doing something that's unskill for that we might regret. I often wonder, is it so? The lessons of patience are learned slow. Maybe with that we'll do some loving kindness practice. So settling into our meditation posture. And feeling into this moment. How does it feel to be here at this moment? Noticing the sensations in the body. Noticing the quality of the mind state. Is it scattered or collected? Moving slow, moving fast, foggy, clear. Noticing the state of the heart. Is it feeling open and big? A little bit smaller and a little bit closed. Maybe there's a sense of warmth, happy to be here. Maybe there's some holding back, not quite sure. Maybe we're not even sure exactly how we are at this moment in our bodies, in our hearts, in our minds. That's okay. It's all welcome. It's all welcome. Whatever we are, whoever you are, just inviting it in. It's all welcome. We're not trying to turn ourselves into somebody else, something else. And allowing the attention to rest on the sensations of breathing. Noticing the inhale. How does that feel in the chest or in the belly? Feeling the movements. And the exhales. What do they feel? When the mind wanders, as it's apt to do, you just very simply, gently begin again. This is delicious. And just a reminder that at any time, loving kindness practice doesn't feel like the right thing to be doing. Or you get a little bit lost or overwhelmed or whatever, you can always come back to just this very simple resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing. And then to begin the loving kindness practice, we'll start where it's easy to bring into mind a lovable being. Either an imaginary kitten, puppies, babies, maybe a memory. Maybe it's somebody you know, you have an uncomplicated loving relationship. Maybe it's somebody that you know about, but who inspires you and touches your heart. Maybe a coach, a mentor, a teacher, leader, somebody you've read their writings maybe or heard their talks. Whoever, somebody for whom you without difficulty and without straining have some warm feelings, some warm heartedness, some goodwill, benevolence, care. And connecting with this person or being, visualizing them in the mind. And to support our practice of loving kindness of cultivating this sense of connection and care, you can say these phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. Maybe this lovable being has been patient with you. Maybe that's part of what you appreciate about them. May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. Can you have patience with your mind and heart settling during this practice? I often wonder, is it so, the lessons of patience are learned slow. And then to extend our loving kindness to ourselves in the same way that we were considering the lovable being, can we consider ourselves, view ourselves, feel about ourselves, perhaps bring into mind an image of yourself in which it causes you to smile. Maybe a picture from your childhood, picture from a celebration. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. What would it be like to do loving kindness for yourself that included patience? Acceptance perhaps of how things are without it demanding that they be different. Helping into our wish to not cause harm. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. Helping into our wish to not cause harm. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. Helping into our wish to not cause harm. If you don't feel anything in particular that's perfectly fine. And then to extend our loving kindness to a friend. Somebody we have a relationship with in our life. We care about bringing them to mind. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May your friend has been patient with you. Maybe you've been patient with your friend. Maybe you've been patient with your friend. Maybe you've been patient with your friend. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be patient with ease. Maybe you're needing to practice patience during this meditation. Changing things, we're moving at a different pace. Can you feel into that? Maybe bringing a little bit of compassion for yourself. This is difficult. Maybe it's just a little very slight. Sometimes it's helpful to practice with just these really slight annoyances. And this is difficult. And then can we expand our loving kindness to be for all beings everywhere? In all directions, without exceptions. May all beings be safe. May all beings be happy. May all beings be healthy. May all beings live with ease. May all beings be safe. May all beings be safe. May all beings be safe. And then to end this meditation, feel your feet on the ground and the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body. And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes. So this idea of patience, our loving kindness practice supporting patience and even needing patience with loving kindness. I know often we feel like it'd be nice to just practice a little bit and have our hearts already softened or opened. But for those of you who've been practicing a lot, know that it does. It can often sneak up on us, this loving kindness practice. Perhaps during the meditation we don't experience anything in particular. But we just notice later, a week later, a few weeks later, some thought in our mind. Whereas perhaps we would have been annoyed or critical of ourselves or somebody else we find ourselves being a little more accepting. And it's okay, I love you. These types of things just falling out of our mouth, popping up into our minds. So it can be really helpful to talk about these topics. And so I'd like to put you into some breakout rooms where we have an opportunity to talk about maybe this connection between patience and loving kindness. And one of the things that I didn't say, maybe you can even consider what are some additional things about kindness and loving kindness and patience that I didn't say. So let's see here. I'm sorry, you guys have to wait while I do this here. Okay, so here we are, these breakout rooms. So those of you who have been doing this before, you know, it's nice to not say everything you know at the very beginning, just to say one point and have it go around the circle. Next person says something, the next person, so you can learn from one another. So it's not so much saying everything you know, it's more just an opportunity to say one idea and to listen to other people. If it's helpful, you can go in numerical order by the number of characters of your screen name. Yeah, long screen name, we're gonna go last. Okay, so here we go. Welcome back, welcome back. Does anybody have a comment or a question they'd like to share? I noticed that when the meeting ended, zoom, not everybody came running back. So they didn't pull the rip cord. Get me out of here. Maybe it was helpful or nice to talk to some other people. Yes, Nancy. And then Marie Christine. We were talking about patients, having patients with our self and with others. For me, particularly having patients with myself over my medical issues I've had this year. And so that, I mean the loving kindness meditations have been so helpful to me in this year dealing with that and realizing what I have control of and what I don't. And having trust in the medical profession as I'm sitting here looking at a medical professional and our group and I thank you. But yeah, it's been extraordinarily helpful to me. Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you, Nancy. Yeah, sometimes we are hard on ourselves and it just isn't helpful and patients can be just what's needed. Thank you. Yes, Marie Christine. What came up for me whilst I was meditating was that the greater the patience, the less of the judgment of others or myself. Nice. Very nice. So do you have a sense like if you could soften the judgment, there'd be more patience or if you could be more patient, there'd be less judgment. Do you have a- Yes, the latter. If there was more patience, there would be less judgment of myself and others. Yes. But do you think that you, is there a way in which if we wanted to be patient that we could jiggle kind of like the judgment part of that equation? Well, I've got a really tight on that. Yeah, yeah. That's great. I love that, making this connection between those. Thank you, Marie Christine. Anybody else have a comment or a question? Okay. Okay. So maybe we'll call it an end of a session here. Just with a heartfelt gratitude for you all and for our practicing together. Why don't we go ahead and unmute ourselves and we can say goodbye. Say thank you, Diana, tonight. Bye, Mr. Diana. Thank you. Thank you. Bye, Diana. Bye, Diana. Bye, everybody. Thank you, Diana. Thank you, everyone. See you tomorrow. Thank you, Anthony. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Bye, Jesse. Thank you all. Bye. Thanks, Landese.
