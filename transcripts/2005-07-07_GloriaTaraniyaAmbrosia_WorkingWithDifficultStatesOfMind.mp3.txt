 of greed, if you just think of any mood or state of mind that sort of has this movement towards something in order to get it, as if it's kind of like longing, desire, a sense that if I only had something, you know, that wanting to be born into something, the wanting to get something, it's not just course consuming and having to buy and having to accumulate, but it's that longing in the mind that manifests in much more subtle forms than that, than these coarse states. So think of this as sort of an umbrella for a range of states of mind. And under hatred, when we talk about that, we're talking about that it's kind of like a survival mode energy, you know, that when something is difficult or painful or we don't like it, there is an automatic, you know, response to it, you know, that this stuff where you either contract around it with fear or anxiety, or actually lash out at it, you know, it's like you see these kind of automatic responses come up very, very easily in the mind where we're trying to get away from some difficult feeling by attacking, you know, it's like you go into attack mode, attacking the object. And then delusion, of course, is, it's the not seeing, the not knowing, the not understanding, the sort of absenting ourselves in a way, it's often equated with ignorance. So there's a, you know, just take that word apart, there's like an ignoring, you know, there's not wanting to see or just a plain not seeing of what's going on. So it's very tied up with the opposite being the opposite of wisdom and understanding, which is part of the goal of our practice, right? So these, these states are going to come up a lot. And they have all their different shades, like, you know, you can expand the list of these three to become the five hindrances, you know, and that would add restlessness and worry and sort of a sloth or doubt, both of these often get put in the delusion category. But the restlessness, you know, you can have this sort of agitated state because you're not getting something you want, or because you got something you don't want. So you get either way, you get this anxiety, you know, this is to me, this is one of the strongest states of mind, difficult states of mind that we deal with. Most of us, I think it's fair to say, are anxious a lot of the time over one thing or another. So you can expand that list further if you want and go to the 10 fetters, you know, which adds a few more to this list. There's no end to it. But just thinking in terms of greed, hatred and delusion is sufficient. So what we're looking at is recognizing that these states are part of our karma, if you will, they arise in all of us. And the Buddha was quite clear on the fact that there's nothing to be done about their arising in the short term. Anyway, the practice eventually leads to uprooting those. But in the moment when they arise, they can come up so fast and so strong. And he's saying that they are a fruit, they're an outcome, they're a product of past ways of being with things. So it's sort of like if you've been piggy before, you're going to be piggy again. If you've been hateful before, you're likely to be that way again. Because each time we give in to them, we're actually conditioning their return. So that's an important factor. I think we'll come back to that in a little bit. It's very, very helpful in terms of trying to establish some sense of impartiality about these. And this is important because in order to uproot them, one has to look at them with some semblance of detachment. And just more matter of factly, notice that you're in this state. And that's not the normal way that we do. As soon as you, especially lots of times when you learn these teachings and you start to begin to see how prevalent these states of mind are, and we're still filled with old strategies for dealing with things that we don't like, you've got a deadly combination in here for self-loathing, for beating up on ourselves. So this information that you can't help the arising of these states is very, very helpful. Can help just relax around that. It's sure you want to be free of it, but it's fine. Let's have a look at it and let's learn about it and let's figure out how to deal with it. Because hating it is only getting you right back in the soup. Then you get this, you hate hatred. And then you hate that you hate that you hated it. This is how we do, isn't it? This is the way our minds are. The point, I think, of even examining this is that, as I said, the Buddha called these the three unwholesome roots of suffering. So they're a statement or an experience in no uncertain terms of suffering. The experience of being caught in these states is not fun. And so that alone is enough to want to pay attention to it, but the not seeing of them and the not knowing what to do when they come up causes us to continue to act out of them. And so we're going to act in ways that are going to create more suffering. So all of this says to me that it behooves us to pay some attention to this topic. Usually what we do when these states come up, and this goes back to one of the teachings of the Buddha where he talked frequently about wise and unwise attention. And I love this teaching because it really sort of has this impartial attitude sort of inherent in it. It's not that there's something wrong with us or there's something bad. It's just that we don't understand the consequences of being caught in these states and not understanding. We attend to them. You have this longing for something you don't have, and there's an underlying sense that if I could only get it I would be happy. Then we pay attention to that thought and we think about it and mull it over. And the same with the hateful thoughts. They fester. It's like if I could just get rid of that, that guy just didn't work in my office. Everything would be good. Is there something wrong with a lot of the passports? Are there any form of blackness? They got my shirt left, so I can take it out. Thank you. Yeah, sure. Sorry. Yeah. So what he's kind of pointing us to is ways to help us to stop attending in this unwise way and to look at them with some wisdom and some understanding. And that breaks the pattern. If we just get caught in them and follow every impulse, then it's sort of like what you've always gotten is what you're going to continue to get. The way you've always been is the way you're going to continue to be. So there's a lot in this, and it's a lot to try to cover in one night, but I still think it's useful to walk through it and get some sense of what's being said in here. And so that you can take it home and reflect upon it and try to work with it in your life and in your practice. And then certainly you can talk to each other and to other teachers about how to work with these things. A lot of it's going to be familiar because I'm betting that a lot of you are already working with it quite skillfully. So he pointed to these five methods to direct our attention in wholesome ways when unskillful and unwholesome thoughts come up into the mind. Remember that it's called the removal of distracting thought, the removal of thought that is harmful or difficult. So with each of these, he gives a little simile that's a very powerful image to convey the feeling of shifting the energy. So like with the first one, and by the way, these are progression in the sutta. It's very clear. He says, try this one. Try number one. And then if that doesn't work, go to number two. And then if that doesn't work, go to number three. This is actually the language in the sutta. So you can see these as a progression where number five is sort of your last ditch effort. So the first one, replacing the unwholesome with the wholesome. Basically like in a way, what comes to my mind is like if you're a parent and a child is doing something harmful, then you take the harmful thing out of their hands and you put something that's benign. It's that neutral. It's just that it's based in wisdom. Get them out of the harmful and difficult state by giving them something that's actually the opposite. That's not harmful and not difficult. So the image that he uses here is a carpenter, just as a carpenter and his apprentice knocks out a course peg by means of a fine one. We replace the unwholesome with the wholesome. Very simple, I mean, but not so simple to do. So if you just look at these experiences of sensual desire and aversion and delusion, he says that basically we have these moods or these attitudes or these mind states towards people and towards objects, towards inanimate objects. And there's an antidote for each of those categories. So what happens, you know, and just look in our own lives with sensual desire or aversion towards people, what happens is that something they do, something they say, something we hear about them, you know, something comes in our being through one of the sense doors. And it could be a gesture, it could be the way that they are, it could be something that we find attractive, something that we find unattractive, right? We just get slammed with that in the second. And then the response to that is to exaggerate it, to proliferate about it, to just not let it go. Have you ever done that? You know, it's like, so that if it's something or somebody that we find attractive, then you just start fantasizing, I'm so in love state of mind, you know, and actually making them up in a way, you know, in our minds. You know, I know for myself when I first saw this, it was on a retreat one time and this guy had given me something. And it was just like walking around in the retreat in silence. And he was giving candy out, you know, and he didn't look, he didn't say anything, obviously, maintain the retreat. But this gesturing was actually outside of what's allowed, but he was doing it anyway. But in that process, in that receiving of it, my heart was so open, it just went right in, you know, the generosity. And I started to, you know, I looked up, I wanted to see who he was so I could know who I was going to fall in love with, you know. And then spend the rest of the retreat creating him in my mind, you know. And then at the end of the retreat meeting this person, and you know, the guy wasn't even close, you know. It wasn't even close. That feeling, I mean that realization for me was fabulous because it occurred to me at that moment that I wondered if I ever knew anybody, you know, or if it's all just some moment, some gesture, some word, some look, you know. And the mind filled with sensual desire just gloms onto it and starts to build a world. Starts to build a person. And it's horrible when you really see yourself do it because it's humiliating. I felt humiliated. And I felt that it was doing a great disservice to other people because I was not, I didn't continue to take in information. I didn't continue to be there and here and what have you and receive this actual being who was in front of me. I was too busy creating them, you know. And then often you wonder why relationships don't work, you know. Then often you take that kind of data and demand that that person be that way, you know. That's the stuff that we end up beating up on each other about. Why aren't you the way that I want you to be, you know. What? But that's what we're doing. That's what we're doing all of the time. And so, you know, this is painful and this is difficult. We want to break the habit of that. And the same kind of thing with the aversion towards people will do the same thing, you know, the one unkind word, one unkind gesture and it can go on and on and on and the mind will not let it go, you know. So what are you going to do? We've got to have some techniques, some tools to work with this kind of thing. So I mean in very coarse states, some of this may sound a little strange, but the Buddha in relation to sensual desire, he's actually pointing us in the direction of things that are going to balance out that extreme exaggerated view and get things back in perspective so that when it comes to longing for a person that you are actually fabricating in your mind, then he's actually recommending, and this can sound strange, but I don't want to water it down. He's actually recommending that you contemplate what the body really is. And so that, you know, you break through this, particularly if you've ever been lost in extreme lust or desire for somebody, then you've got to have something to break through that pattern. And it's like everything is totally out of proportion to what's actually happening, you know. So focus on, there's actually a meditation in the Satipatthana Sutra where he enumerates 32 parts of the body, where you kind of get in perspective that this body is, you know, it's hair and mucus and snot and, you know, blood and feces and urine, you know, and just contemplate that and it's just like, whoa, okay, okay, I'm back now, you know, that kind of, really, what am I going nuts over here, you know, let's get it in perspective and get you back in the more receptive alert mode, accepting attentive mode. So that for lay people, rather than 32 parts, he diminishes that test to the first five that contemplate hair of head, hair of body, skin, teeth and nails. And I think that's fascinating because when you consider, I mean, talk about the delusion of our culture. There are industries that around, you know, hair of head, hair of body, skin, teeth and nails, you know, people put great emphasis on these parts of the body to make them alluring and attractive and in a way, I think, cloud over the true nature of them, you know, really. I mean, when it comes to hair and nails, for example, the only part of the body that's already dead, you know, it's already gone to the complete decline, you know. So you got to do something to deny that, you know, so you get that, the hair spray and the curlers and the hair dye and all this stuff, you know. So get it back in perspective. This is what he's trying to get at, get it back in perspective. And when it comes to desire for an object, you know, this can be really interesting because what we'll do is you can't, something makes us feel good, you know, whether it's food, usually it's food, food's a good one, you know, you think about foods that you want and can't stop thinking about them so much so that we can override wisdom, you know, in relation to that. It might be things you know you shouldn't eat and you'll eat them anyway. It might be quantities that we shouldn't eat and we'll do it anyway, you know. Or let's say it's just with mental states and fantasies, you know, I hear a lot about not being able to control fantasies. Even though we know that being preoccupied with these states of mind actually is conditioning a terrible discontent with life, you know. You get lost in your BMW fantasy or whatever, your $27 million lottery fantasy and you can do that for hours, you know. But then you come out of it and you got this feeling like your life isn't okay, you know, it's not good enough. And there's tremendous harm being done by these states. But you know, we do it anyway. So he says here in the second one, since sensual desire as relates to an object to break the attachment by contemplating impermanence and non-self. You know, you get it that no matter what you get, no matter what object we acquire, it's going to break, it's going to fade, the colors are going to fade, you know, it's going to get scratches, it's going to get dense, whatever, you know. Just to really consider that they look at it down the road. Not to diminish the joy that objects bring. And this is where I think it often gets distorted. Because he's not saying that there isn't good feeling in these things. But when we're getting lost in them, then we're going to suffer. And so it's all about getting rid of the suffering, not making objects bad, you know. But just keeping in perspective the suffering that we can create by not seeing the true nature of the things that we get lost in sensual desire about. So then, for example, with aversion towards a person, this one's interesting. It says we should develop kindness towards the person, endeavor to wish them well, not wish them harm. Well, you try that when you're really hating somebody, you know, that's hard to do. You know, that's the first response that he offers, is to try to take the mind to that place. And what can be helpful is just to recognize that, or contemplate the fact that everybody wants to be happy. Everybody wants not to suffer. And so I don't care how difficult the person is, or how much they're hurting us, that's where they're just like us in that regard. And that can help. But it doesn't always do the trick, you know. And so I find, I know for myself, with some difficult people in my life, I just couldn't go there, you know. And one of the things that I came to quite naturally, and then I found out later, it was actually one of the methods he talks about, was to just recognize that you're suffering. You know, that there are difficult people in the world, and we bump up against them, and we have a hard time. And so if you can't turn your heart and kindness towards them, then turn it towards yourself, in the sense that you're suffering, and you need to be held, you need a bubble bath or something, you know, to soften the pain that you're feeling from difficult people. One of my teachers, one time, I found this very, very helpful when I was having a very difficult time, reminded me that there are difficult people. Oh, you know, there are people who just have ornery personalities and grumpy and stingy, jabby personalities, and we run into them. And sometimes we're that way. But you know, just to make peace with that can loosen up some of the hold that that state of hating them can have on the mind, or not wanting it to be that way. So aversion towards an object, this can be really interesting. You know, one might say, walk into a coffee table or want to kick it, you know, or get pissed that you've got a flat tire on the freeway, and you know, just want to go out and get a new car, you know, that kind of thing, and just really go into quite a state of mind about things that are just going to happen. Actually the commentaries even, in explaining this one, they talk about things like tree stumps and things in the forest, and you walk into the forest and you stub your toe on a tree stump, and you want to kick the tree stump, you know, and get pissed at it. So, or the weather, you know, it's so cold, you know, it's so hot, you know, that stuff we get into. You're pissed off because it's raining, you know. So to really, to contemplate the fact of the four elements, it's earth, it's air, it's fire, it's water. That's what physicality on this planet is all about. And that's the way it is, you know. So you're really going to hate somebody because it's raining, you know. I did that one time in England, I was so pissed, and then I was looking for, you know, I realized I was looking for somebody to complain to about this, you know, but to hate for it, it's nuts. So, this last one, and you see what we're doing with each of these, we're trying to replace the unwholesome with something that will be a lot more useful, to break the pattern, to break the habit, turn it towards a wholesome state. And actually, sometimes that's all you have to do, is just get in there and try something else for a few seconds, because the mind, at least my experience is that it's got really short-term memory, you know. It doesn't, it's just, it's like count to three, and the thing is gone, you know, the thing is over. And so, just getting in there with a different temperament, a different mood for a few seconds can be huge. And then this last one, delusion towards a person or object. There's a lot in this, it has a lot to do with faith and wisdom and understanding, but just the long and short of it is that what he's pointing to here is that there are people in our lives, like we're often drawn to the wrong kind of people. So that, like for example, when he talks about the five hindrances, one of the antidotes that he has for all of the hindrances is to associate with people who aren't that way. You know, but that's not what we do. It's like, you know, when you want to speak ill of people, you go looking for people who will gossip with you, you know. If you're agitated and restless, you gravitate towards people or objects that will be that way with you, you know. I watched one time when I was really agitated and it was like, I actually had this thought, oh, man, man, I need some coffee, you know. And it was like, what? The last thing you need when you're restless is caffeine. The mind is like gravitating towards things that are similar, you know. And just out of ignorance, just out of an association, the mind has a very strong associative qualities and so it doesn't think things through. You just get lost in the associating. It's like, oh, I know this feeling. This is just like the feeling I get when I drink a lot of caffeine, you know. And so then it goes that way. Or oh, I'm nervous. I know what I'll do. I'll have a cigarette, you know, whatever. That's what it does. So what we need to do instead is break that pattern and go towards the opposite. So the thing here that's recommended is to seek out the guidance of good people. So you're all quite skilled at doing this. That's why you come to centers like this. It's a lot of wisdom that brings you to the Buddhist teachings and to centers like this, to be with people who are going to help us to get free of difficult states of mind. And of course the opposite is true too, that we're not drawn to people that we should be drawn to, you know, drawn to people that we shouldn't be drawn to. And so it's just being aware of that as a mental habit, mental patterning and endeavoring to reverse that. Only through contemplation, the antidote here is contemplate the Dhamma. Contemplate what the Buddha is saying about these states and consider. That doesn't mean just sit here and think about it. That means like in the moment when one is being drawn to people who will gossip with you to see how that feels. You get it directly that, you know, ooh, you know, this is not fun. This is, I'm feeding this unskillful state of mind and I'm not helping them either, you know, to really feel them. Yeah, so some good stuff in here. I find this particular teaching very helpful. So if that doesn't work, number two, ponder the disadvantages of the unskillful thoughts. You know, he says just as a man or woman would be embarrassed if they had a carcass around their neck. So we should be embarrassed. You know, these are difficult states of mind. He's pointing to qualities that he actually talks about in the previous sutta, which are very important qualities to have in the heart. It's like if you want to get free, you want a lot of these qualities. And they're called the guardians of the universe, the guardians of the universe. They're called hiri and otapa in Pali. And they're translated as moral shame and moral dread, which is perhaps an unfortunate translation. But what you're getting at is basically conscience. The bit in me that would be ashamed if I saw myself in the mirror with a carcass around my head, you know, around my neck. It's that same feeling, you know, that black gunk coming out of your mouth when you're speaking unkindly, you know, what the experience of hatred is in the heart. In our culture, we don't like this word shame, but Buddha likes it. You know, you should be ashamed of that. But not in a self-denigrating, beating up on ourselves way. Like, lose that bit. But just noticing that this is not behavior that is befitting someone who wants to wake up. Who wants to be good. Who wants to exhibit, maximize, optimize one's goodness. And the moral dread is that it's just even the thought about going into that state. It's like, it's sort of like a Venus flytrap, you know, the whole system would recoil. When this is mature, that's what it's like in the mind. You can actually, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. You can actually see where you might have the impulse to go into an unskillful state and something goes, it's like there's a force field or you've got your shields up, you know. And the whole heart and mind just organically contract, retract and pull away from those states. When that gets going, it's great. That's why it's calling them the protectors of the universe. They're going to prevent harm. That's what it's all about. So contemplating in this way, these thoughts are unwholesome, they should be let go. Do you actually have those thoughts? Or it's sort of more subtle, this movement away from states. And I like this next part where he says, contemplate in this way, when sensual desire, aversion or delusion arises, it leads to my own affliction, to the affliction of others, to the affliction of both. It obstructs wisdom, it causes difficulty and it leads away from nirvana. So just to me, that says even more experientially, to feel what it feels like to contemplate the direct experience of the unpleasantness of being caught in something unskillful. Just feel it. That's what's going to do it. That's what writes the course. That's where mindfulness is so important. It's just in paying attention to what it feels like to be this way. It's not like I said, don't beat up on ourselves. It's not like you're bad and you shouldn't be that way. But you are. So be real about it. It's more like that. Just hold it neutrally. So then if that doesn't work, then try to forget those thoughts and don't give attention to them. Just as someone with good eyes who doesn't want to see forms would either shut his eyes or look away, so we try to focus on something else. This is very practical advice. The more you understand the harm, the easier this is to do. In the commentary, he's talking to one of the monks who's having difficulty with discursive thought that isn't particularly skillful. He tells him to go and sew your robes. Go fix your bowl. Go tidy up your kuti. Just go do something else. Take your mind off of this completely. It's like it's over here, turn it over here. You look in this way, close your eyes, turn the head and look over this way. It's that basic and that simple. As I said, the more we understand the harm, the easier that becomes. The more neutrally we hold it, if we don't beat up on ourselves for being in this state, then you have an impartial attitude. You just turn. Have you ever had that experience where it's like, I know where that goes. It's easier. You can just turn the mind towards something else. I was talking to somebody recently who's suffering with breast cancer and she just gets incredibly anxious. She came to this herself where what she would do is just get up and go skiing. She went skiing every day. She'd come home and start thinking again. She'd go back out again. Just keep preoccupying her mind with something that is either skillful or neutral. Go to something else completely. Another thing that one of my teachers said one could include in this is to contemplate space. This is very, very helpful. When you have a thought that the mind won't let go of, then it's like this image where you take that and then just start panning back as if the camera in a slow motion movie or something starts panning back and put that within a much bigger arena just to give it the perspective. I find this really, really helpful. For myself, my mind tends to get very contracted very easily. I've realized that environments where I have a big vista are incredibly helpful to me. If I can be on the water's edge, if I can be high on a mountain, if I can be in Kansas, that ability to see for hundreds of miles, it just lightens the mind. For somebody else, it might be the opposite. They need something to contain things because you're just so erratic. I find that particular thought helpful. If that doesn't work, then he says to try to slow things down. He says, it's as if someone would walk fast and then it occurs to him or her, but why do I walk fast? Now, let me walk slowly. As if then, he or she would walk slowly and it would occur to them thus, why do I walk slowly? Let me stand still. Just this image of, okay, it's all moving too fast. You can have this feeling like you get caught in a mind state, you can't control it, you can't see how you got in it, you can't get out of it, all of that. Then slow it all down. Freeze frame it. Part of it, some of the best learning one does about states of mind is when you find yourself in one, just freeze it and go back and see how it happened and learn that progression that got us there, which is our karma, our pattern. When people say this, when people talk at this tone of voice, I go nuts. When I see a strawberry cheesecake, I get crazy. Whatever it is. You just start to see how that happened and what your particular pattern is. That's very important. According to the teaching of dependent origination, that there's some kind of contact that we like it or don't like it, that we grab hold of it and before you know it, we're completely lost in it. What you're getting to then is through slowing things down, you can drop out of the content. It helps tremendously to drop out of the content of what's happening and just start to see these processes of the mind. When you start doing that, you've got a real leg up. You can get out of these states a lot easier because the mind is very interested in its own processes. When you start to look at mental processes, it's like, oh wow, how did that happen? Oh, I see. Where's the hatred? Where's the sensual desire? It's gone completely out the window. We're interested in what's happening as phenomena at this point. We've taken it to a whole other level and the states of mind are gone or we're looking at them in a new way such that we're not lost in them. This is incredibly powerful to slow it down and have a look. This brings in this enlightenment factor of investigation of downness. Look at it, investigate it. Now if that doesn't work, if all else fails, then the last one is restrain it, subdue it, beat it down. Just as if a person with great physical strength should have been caught hold of a weaker one by head or body, restrain, subdue, and beat down that weaker person and make him weary and exhausted, just so should the unskilled thoughts be checked. This is very important. It's the just say no bit. It's got to have this quality of tough love where if somebody was really doing something harmful, you would make a loud noise or shake them or do something to snap them out of it. It's got this quality where it's not hateful and it's not aversive. You're not doing this out of repression or wish to repress or to smack yourself around. It's the mind state that we're trying to get for you. It's like no, I am not going to think about this anymore. It's not because it's bad or because of anything other than that we're suffering when we're in it and we're going to potentially create more of the same. With all of these, the mood has got to be as neutral, detached, and partially interested as it can possibly be. That grows over time. Initially, a lot of these methods will be used with no small amount of self-view. They'll be accompanied by a certain beating up on ourselves. That's going to be a given. You're going to have to know that. As we mature in practice and begin to see through that tendency, then it's much more a state or a case of examining with interest and impartiality as the phenomenon of the mind and the consequences of being caught in various states. Can you feel that? That's actually a very good measure of the maturity of your practice. How impartial are you able to be about these states of mind? How detached and interested can you be in them as phenomenon? With this, the idea is to know that right now you just need to get out of the state. Later on, you can reflect. Later on, you can try to figure out how it happened. But when a state is very, very strong and harmful, then you need to get yourself out of it. Right now, you just want to push it down. This one I find particularly helpful in situations where you've got to maintain some sense of decorum and integrity about yourself, like in certain environments. There's times maybe at work or with family where you just really would rather kick in a wall or hurt somebody. Some things got to come into play to offset that impulse, that very strong impulse. We have the consequences in our culture right now of people who cannot do that, who are not doing that well. Particularly, there's thinking about aggressive driving and things like this where there's situations on the road that you don't like. Who hasn't had the impulse? You have to put your foot heavier on the gas and go after somebody, but you hold it back. You've got to relax and establish some sense of restraint around these harmful or hurtful impulses. We all have them. This particular teaching I think can be very, very helpful. Yeah? I hope so. I hope you find it useful. There's a lot to cover in one night, but I wanted to walk through it all and give you this information that you can take with you so you tack it up on your refrigerator or something. A reminder to help with difficult stays. You might have some comments or thoughts of your own. Yeah? Yeah. I have a question about the aversion towards the person. You cannot go on just like you aversion, but what I notice about what's difficult is if you know the difficult person of a friend or an athlete, I have to try to be that sort of thing. For example, if I see a friend or an athlete and they say, hey, we're talking in a room and I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, someone that I agree with, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, I'm talking to a person, Yes, that was a very good point. Well, I mean there's two things that come to mind. One is the one that I mentioned here that reflecting on the fact that this, no matter what one's behavior, no matter how abhorrent their behavior might be, everybody, and this is a matter of faith initially, but you come to see it through practice, everybody wants to be happy and everybody wants not to suffer, and everybody is in their nature, their true nature is good and kind. This is what the Buddha says. Now, you may not know this directly, especially given the data that you describe that you have coming at you, but it is the way that it is. So we accept that on faith initially, and endeavor to maybe use some of it, slow it down, try another approach that would allow you to receive this person, open your heart to this person so that one isn't taking this one bit of them, exaggerating it, and creating a total being out of that. That's the problem. It's the same thing with attractions, like the example I gave. This is not the person. This is a mind state. This is a mood. This is a temperament, perhaps. It can be more pervasive than just an arisen thing, but it is an impermanent condition, and it is being driven by ignorance and grasping. The more that you can understand that, then the more spacious one can be in the presence of it. The second bit that I think might be helpful is, I heard in the way that you asked the question that you want to fix it. You want it not to be that way. This is hard, but part of what one has to do in practice, and I'm not saying it's easy, is get it that it is this way. It's like, yeah, but they shouldn't. I know, but they do. Yeah, but I don't like it. Yeah, but it is that way. The subtlety of the Buddhist teaching is he's trying to get us to the place where there is complete and total insight into the truth of dukkha. Then if you're going to do something about it, it's going to be coming from a place of understanding and wisdom and acceptance. It's a paradox. You have to accept the prejudice in order to deal with it, in order to address it most skillfully. It's not that you can go ahead and address it while you're still hating it, but your actions are going to be different. That's all that Buddha is getting us to. He's trying to get us to a place where the quality of heart with which you act is as pure as it can possibly be. It's not accepting in the sense of it's okay. It's not okay. It's accepting it in the sense of it's a fact that it is happening. Can you feel that? I'm not saying this is fun. Insight into dukkha is not fun. You got to feel it and you got to have a good cry and you kick in a wall or do whatever it takes to let the heart open and expand itself to the reality of ignorance and foolishness. It's like then your actions are going to be coming from a much more skillful place if you can do that. I would say just take that and mull it over. Contemplate that a little bit. Someone over here had something? I was just going to say, of course accepting nature is really very tough but if you understand the conditions that cause the arising of the future then maybe you can have an understanding and patience. I find that what's been one of the biggest helps for me in that regard, no stretch of imagination arrived, but just seeing the hatred in my own heart and feeling what it feels like to be that way. In the moment when someone else is being that way then that gives rise to compassion because I know how awful it feels. It's so prejudice, hatred, I mean come on. It's so foolish. So ignorant and so painful. So they're suffering. Yeah. Yes, one more. I think that everything is certain. When you get into the negative state and the minus state, there's a certain energy that gives you something. There's a little bit of counter energy for the ones that get to the better. You kind of get on whenever you do. You understand what I'm saying? Yeah, we get off on it in a foolish kind of way though. It's not the, it's identification with states of mind and thinking it's who we are. That's part of what's happening in that moment. I think there's something to be said for there's a certain excitement and exhilaration, whether it's hatred or sensual desire, that maybe makes it somewhat attractive. But I think that that's an unexamined state. If we examine that more closely, it appears pleasant, but it's not. And that's part of the foolishness that the Buddha talks about a lot is that taking something, to be pleasant, that is not pleasant. And taking something to be unpleasant that is actually pleasant. So like the idea of renunciation or detachment, that sounds very unpleasant. And the experience of it is so light and happy, just to offer the opposite.
