 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. www.r www.r www.r www.r www.r www.r Mindfulness that we're exploring and discovering, it's always a discovery. This Dharma that we're discovering here and now is always a discovery. It's always a feeling that, not a feeling, but we never go, we never bother, never go to the effort of thinking that we've seen it before. We never have to have the mental neurons firing that's saying, this is not interesting or this is too much, this is, you know, not what I was hoping for. All those kinds of ideations are not needed in the simplicity of just here and now as something to be known, to be experienced, to be felt in its radical simplicity. And yesterday I offered this teaching about this, the ouch and the ah, without needing to analyze what the ouch is or what the ah is or think about its past and its future and what to do about it, keep it that simple. The other very radical simplicity of this practice is to be with the experience, the ouchas, the ah's, the knowing of it, whatever the experience is, even if it's not ouch or ah, but to be with it in the changing river of time, to be with it in the current of how things are always flowing past or through. It's kind of like, a little bit like we're standing in a river and maybe we're not, we're not, we're standing, but in the moment, right with us, the water's always flowing by. And to stay in the flow of the present moment as it comes from the past in a sense and goes to the future or comes from the future and flows back to the past, whatever your metaphor might be, just right here in the changing nature. And what's interesting is that this principle, this being grounded as best we can here and now in the changing, flowing nature of it, is that what we discover is the ways that we ah, freeze the moment, the way we resist the change, the way we step out of that flow by thinking, by wanting something different, by remembering the past or the future, reacting to something, wanting to analyze it, figure it out. These movements out of the river of time, out of the river of change and movement and flow of what's happening. And that flow of change that we tune into is both the change of experiences that say come and go and new experiences come that weren't expected maybe and they're there for a moment and something else comes. But they also involve the changing nature of the knowing itself. Knowing is a little bit fickle. Knowing jumps around and ah, and ah, and ah, so to kind of be there, so like if you're with your breathing and then you're with some kind of thoughts about the breath or about yesterday's breathing, then ah, the knowing, the awareness has shifted to something else and there's a sound outside and knowing shifts to the sound. And is it a knowing that shifts and moves? Is it a sound that moves, that comes to you, is moving? What is it that's, you know, the constant moving of the mind, of awareness, of experiences, not to be straining to look for it, that that's just more kind of freezing in the flow, but relaxing into the very simplicity of the experience here and now, to know it for oneself. So to assume a meditation posture, a posture of confidence that yes, maybe with a yes, yes, I will sit here. In a sense, standing in the ground, standing in the middle of the river of time. Yes, here's where I'll sit, be present with confidence. Taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. And on the exhales, closing the eyes and settling into this spot here now. And letting your breathing return to normal. And continue on the exhale, on the inhale to feel your body, feel where the holding is. Maybe holding tension is a little bit of an ouch. Feeling that on the inhale and the exhale, letting your body relax, soften. And then quietly, peacefully calming the mind, relaxing the thinking mind. And as you're experiencing your breathing, the breathing itself, the way it's experienced in the body, is a changing experience. To some degree, it's a change that repeats itself, but it's still a changing experience. And spend some time now, centering yourself on the changing nature of sensations connected to breathing. And as you do so, you're aware also of the changing nature of what you know, of the knowing itself. That you might know the breathing, the mind might move, the awareness might move to know something else, my voice. And then back to the breathing. Stay centered on the breathing, the changing nature of sensations. But be aware as well of where the knowing is, and how the knowing might come and go and where it goes. It too is changing. Don't worry about the change, if you can just know and see the change. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe with your breathing, maybe some other way, know how your experiences in the moment now here are changing. And be aware of how your knowing itself shifts and changes. These two changing things that are experience and are knowing. Relax back into that awareness, alertness, that can allow this to flow along in the present moment. The shifting, changing nature of experience and of knowing. Though they're in the flow of time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What we experience is changing, shifting. The knowing is changing and shifting. Both the known and the knowing come and go and change. Calmly being aware of change. Change of what we know and the knowing itself. And if you're aware of all this with a kind of background awareness or overviewing awareness, they can know what's happening with your knowing. Is maybe where freedom is found. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Being aware of change. The shifting, moving, in constant nature of our experience. Being aware of it and resting in that awareness. Kind of like you're not standing in the river but floating in the river of change. Carried along in the current. That's where freedom is found. That is where you can feel that you're resisting change or stuck and not moving along with change. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. As soon as you know clearly that you're stuck, clearly not in the river of change. At that moment in a way you're back in the river. If you trust it, if you allow for it. It's just another moment of knowing that has just arisen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And as we come to the end of this sitting, the end is just the continuation of change and comings and goings. It's just another moment in the river of time that we only connect to in the present. And to be at ease in this river, to not freeze it or be stuck in some way, not hang on to the branches on the sides of hanging over the sides of the river. To be available for the changing nature of this world, where the present moment is not static, but dynamic. To be available and open, receptive, and to see that, that it can be at that stance, that way of being, can be a gift for how we are in the world. Certainly many of the other ways of being is not a gift, but to be present and available, aware and attuned to how things shift and change. And to be present, to feel it, to sense it, is a way of connecting more deeply to other people and to our life. May it be that the freedom of our awareness, our ability to be aware freely with freedom, allows for a wonderful channel of our care and goodwill to flow into the world. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may our ability to be mindful, aware here in the present, contribute to this possibility. Thank you.
