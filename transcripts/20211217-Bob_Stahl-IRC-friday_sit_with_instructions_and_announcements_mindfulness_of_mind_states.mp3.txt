So I'd like to offer some instructions. Can you hear me all right thumbs up? Thank you. Good
And so we've been practicing with these four foundations of mindfulness and
first foundation of the body the second of feeling tones and today introducing the mind states
and again just to let you know that the fourth foundation are not meditation objects per se
but teachings teachings to help support the growth of wisdom some of the talks that we've been
offering each day are stemming from that fourth foundation for noble truth so within it the
hindrances and some other teachings that support the growth of wisdom
so it's very amazing these four foundations are complete
and again the Buddha said this is perhaps the most direct way in the path of realization and
so it's important of course to understand some of the theory this is called in Pali the Paryati
the supports the practice which is pati pati and then the theory and the practice support
realization which is pati veda so the Paryati pati pati pari veda the theory the practice the
realizations what are the realizations of the understanding of suffering and its causes and
the path to great freedom beginning to see through the stories the narratives the identifications the
conditioning this is a very noble noble endeavor
is that beautiful old folk song which sings that let there be peace on earth and let it
begin with me and so this is that endeavor that we are working within ourselves it actually has a
powerful impact on others individually collectively perhaps systemically if there's any hope for
this world i do sincerely believe it is a greater awareness and love and this is really the heart
of mindfulness actually in the mandarin translation of the word mindfulness the character has both
the heart and the mind in the word of the definition so we don't have that luxury in english to combine
in this particular way i mean maybe we could call it heartfulness or heart mindfulness or
kindfulness i love that built into the word itself at least in mandarin is this kind
heart kind awareness
and so today we are beginning to shine the flashlight on mind states which means thoughts
and emotions and of course there's so many thoughts and emotions and i already know that you know
that and you've been sitting with them all week long and again they're kind of like the new england
weather systems that are just coming and going and it's very powerful for us to begin to step back
and begin to know that these states of mind are coming and going because it supports perhaps two
beautiful qualities one is it's learning teaching us how to go with the flow of life and perhaps
secondly to not take it as personal license they do come and they do go though it feels like when
they're here that's all there is it's only going to rain just a few days ago it's only going to
rain now it's sunny sometimes when the weather condition is there we um it just becomes all
encompassing there's just no way out but if we sit back and wait and allow and acknowledge
it changes and again that reframe that i've been speaking about within each of the foundations of
the body the feeling tones the mind states the reframe at the end of these instructions is to
be aware of its origination its arising its dissolution its passing all in this state of change
so we're just giving space just like the sky for example gives space to whatever weather system is
there it offers no resistance because of that weather systems move yes they're there for a while
but then they shift and they change so sitting with awareness and just acknowledging the different
states of mind that are coming and going we could perhaps do a little bit of an experiment right now
and just uh just gently just let it happen no doubt thoughts will start coming and emotions
is such a wide spectrum of thinking and analyzing and scrutinizing comparing contrasting liking
disliking happiness sadness different emotions fear shame envy all coming and going i said just
sitting in awareness now and just experiencing the different states of mind as they come and go
so do this for just a little bit right now just beginning just easing into it just being aware
experiencing the different mind states being present
so all right the experiment is over one minute and two seconds has gone by since i last spoke
and perhaps even in that one minute and two seconds we could not even have counted
how many different places our mind went off to the future the past
just speculating fantasizing dreaming this is just to help an illustrator to illuminate
these states of mind are coming and going our practice here is to begin to penetrate into the
mind states to begin to know they are just as ephemeral ever changing it's the different
feeling tones that are coming and going the practices within the body of the breath or sounds
or sensations rising and passing so to these states of mind there may be times of course when you
might be really in a deeper weather system of strong emotions that might be evoked and if
that's there yes it's wise to understand that they too will come and go but also honoring if that
feeling is there letting yourself acknowledge what's present
and just giving it space and it too yes in time rises and passes like all things
so for some of us it we might be really keen on just making the primary object
completely with the mind states this can be your primary object just being aware of these
different states of mind that are coming and going for others it might be that your preference
more is to lean into the body into the anchor of the breath or sensations of sounds but also
including and expanding the awareness that when mind states are there just meeting them
experiencing them they come and they go and then returning perhaps collecting back into the body so
we want to support you with your practice but to include these states of mind there's so many
coming and going
so without grasping at them or resisting them just letting these states of mind like weather
systems let giving them the space they come they're here and they leave the next thing you know
you're thinking about something else this is for us to understand no matter where we bring
attention to into the body into the feeling tones into the states of mind they're coming and going
and today just shining the flashlight on these mind states this third foundation of mindfulness
it's kindly attending being present and if you're getting lost getting confused you know
about coming back to the anchor collecting gathering steadying and being present
so we'll just go into the silence now kindly attending
the mind states

there's a beautiful reading from the sati batanasuta on mind states this is thus the
meditator contemplates mind states internally and externally
how they arise with origination and contemplating its dissolution
the coming and going of things cultivating the knowledge necessary to cling to nothing in
this world of this one practices the mindfulness of mind states understanding this nature of change
