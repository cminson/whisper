The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So hello and we come to the fifth and final talk on the five groupings, the
five khandhas, aggregates. And so this is an exercise in the discourse on the
four foundations for awareness, for cultivating a kind of lucid, clear,
present moment awareness. And we come, the last one is conscious, is usually
translated into English as consciousness. And it's very likely that that is not
the best choice as an English translation, partly because I think very
few people either know what consciousness is or people who study
consciousness can agree on. I think there's so many different opinions and
ideas and efforts to try to pin down what consciousness is.
Interestingly enough, it was not a task of people, it's only for the last, probably
for only the last 200 years or so, the way the modern usage of the word
consciousness is relatively recent. And so, and then around that concept is
gathered, these different ideas, associations. The Pali word is vinyana, and it's
a word that existed in India before the Buddha, but it seems to have
meant things like, at least many translators of the ancient Hindu
Upanishadic texts will translate as understanding, even sometimes as intellect.
The Buddha very rarely defines it, and it's possible that the word
vinyana is used in different ways in different contexts, which makes it a
little bit more difficult to pin it down to what it is. In these five
khandhas, five aggregates, it seems to be a ability to differentiate, a knowing
that differentiates. So to know, you know, if you're looking down at a bowl full of
mixed beans, red beans, black beans, white beans, pinto beans, all kinds of things,
the ability to recognize the distinct kinds of beans from each other, to
separate out rather than one big blur of beans, separate out this, this, this,
this. So the Buddha, we talked about being able to differentiate between,
consciousness is what differentiates between salty and not salty, bitter and
sweet. This does not very satisfying for a modern English audience that has a
little bit more grand idea of what consciousness is, but it seems to be a
kind of heightened knowing, clear knowing of direct experience. And it's
related to the third grouping, the sannyau or recognition, the concept we
have, it's related to that, but maybe it's either can be more primitive prior to
the concepts we add on top of things, or in a kind of heightened clarity where we
know more with understanding what's happening. So the ancient analogy that
someone might, a child might be given a counterfeit coin and simply recognize it
as a coin, not realize it's counterfeit. A merchant who's expert on how people
counterfeit coins will immediately recognize that it's a counterfeit coin.
And so the recognition that it's a coin is there, but it's a heightened with
clarity of knowing to not, this is not real or this is not what we do. So the
Buddha talked about, there's these six kinds of consciousness. There's a
consciousness which is a knowing that happens when we see. So seeing,
knowing through seeing, knowing through hearing, knowing through smelling,
tasting, knowing through a tactile experience of the body and knowing what's
going in the mind. And rather than calling them all knowing, it's a
six distinct kind of knowing, the six consciousness or six vinyanas. And now
this is in contrast to what some meditators, some people, some, even some
spiritual traditions will emphasize what consciousness is as a kind of a
continuous, unitary field of knowing that they were always, consciousness is
always there. Everything is coming and going. Everything is permanent, but it's
all occurring on this kind of screen of, of it's always there or like, you know,
the consciousness is, it was like the ocean. Then everything else is just the
rain falling on the ocean temporarily there. It's the waves coming and going
on the ocean, but the ocean itself is always there and just under the surface
is vast and still and quiet. The, the Buddha seems not to have emphasized this
kind of consciousness whatsoever. And in fact, the more I think the, the, I
believe more of the kind of Buddhist kind of, or at least the Theravada
Buddhist, the early Buddhist understanding of what this would be that the mind
there is a, the mind is a constructing activity. And whatever this consciousness
is that is emphasized in the fifth aggregate is part of this constructed
activity. It's not innate. It's not inherent. It's not always there. It
doesn't go from one life to another. It is something also that comes and goes,
arises and passes. And, and in its arising, it's partly a construct of the
mental functioning. It's a condition of mental functioning as opposed to
something which is independent of the vagaries and changing nature of the
mind itself. And certainly in this fifth exercise of Satipatana of the
aggregates, what the meditator is meant to see is that this consciousness or
this kind of knowing appears and disappears, appears and passes away. And
so what we're looking at it is something that's changeable and impermanent and
constant. And so what kind of consciousness is that way? And what kind of
knowing? And how is that different from, you know, recognition? And so I've
suggested in the meditation that it's a very simple, very, very simple but very
clear so that there's a knowing. It's what knows all the other aggregates. It
knows there's a sensation. It knows there's a feeling tone. It knows that
there's a recognition happening at this moment. It knows that there's mental
constructs happening. And it knows that it knows. And you can do kind of, again,
get caught up in an infinite, infinite regress of knowing. Knowing that I know
that I know, but don't bother with that. Just kind of very simple, relaxed. And
then that kind of knowing, a sound arises. There's a knowing of a sound that
arises with the sound. When the sound goes, maybe the knowing goes. Or maybe
the knowing goes faster if we get distracted by something else. There is,
we see something, we hear, we taste something, we touch something, we think
something, we feel something. And with each of that, there's a knowing that
arises. A simple knowing that's, and the important aspect is not exactly what
consciousness is, but exactly all this is. But rather, whatever way in which we
know, there's a recognition that it comes and goes, that it's not constant, it's
not permanent. And as we start seeing its inconstant nature, then we will not cling
to it. That's the hope. That's the direction we're going. And so consciousness
also can be an object of clinging. And sometimes people can easily let go of
all things except consciousness. If they're strongly identified with consciousness
as being their true self, as this is who I am, and this is how I survive. This is
how I, you know, will always exist or something. And the deeper the
pastana practice goes, the less we can recognize or find this kind of
continuous, ever-present field of consciousness. Because everything is seen
in its momentary aspect, coming and going. And whether there is a consciousness
which persists over time, in a sense, that's not so very interesting for early
Buddhism to specify whether there is or not. What's important is in our direct
experience, as we practice deeper and deeper, we won't find it. That does not
mean we have to decide there is none. It just means we don't find it. And the
purpose for not finding it is so that we will let go of clinging to it. And we're
trying to let go of all clinging. And so the functional aspect of this practice
is all about the end of clinging, not to come to a philosophical conclusion
about what consciousness is or isn't. So that's just in terms of what consciousness
is or isn't. What I'm talking about today just barely scratches the surface
of a fascinating concept. But I hope that it gives you just enough information
and ideas of practicing to somehow begin appreciating the miracle of knowing
in the simple ways, knowing hearing, seeing, tasting, touching, smelling,
and then the mind, knowing the mind, knowing things, and then seeing how
in the objects or experiences arise in these six sense stores, they come and
they go, and the knowing of it comes and goes. Sometimes the knowing comes
and goes faster than the object. And that knowing can be very relaxed,
easeful, just being with what's obvious and free of all the self-referencing
where we get tripped up, where we slip, where we get caught, where we suffer.
And we're pointing here to a simplicity of being with all our senses,
all our experience, which is very, very simple and free.
So, thank you. And we'll continue. We have three more exercises to do
before we finish this Four Foundations of Mindfulness.
And so next week we'll do the six sense bases and the fetters,
the knots that get formed around them. So, thank you.
