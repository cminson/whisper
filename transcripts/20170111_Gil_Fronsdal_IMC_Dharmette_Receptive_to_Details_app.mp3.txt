Dharmette : Receptive to D etails

In Zen practice , there’s a little saying used to describe 
the practice: “ attention to detail.” A lot of Zen practice is 
about  paying attenti on to the details of the moment or  of 
the situation. What I have in mind in bringing this up is 
that people’s involvement in Buddhism, or maybe 
Buddhism itself, has all kinds of problems.  One problem 
is that Buddhism is one of the world’ s great religions , 
and it’s easy to have these big ideas about what it’s all 
about: e nlightenment, compassion for the world, saving 
the world  – all kinds of wonderful ideals  and big things. 
In the process of having these big ideas, you miss the 
details. You mi ss the moment that you’re in; you don’t 
see what’s here. You push  people aside as you’re eager 
to save the world . “There a re people in my way!”  
 
Sometimes people also come to Buddhism with 
significant challenges in their lives. But the challenges 
are so big that it also encourages  looking at the big 
picture , which is so huge, like a mountain that has to be 
moved. When you do this, you don’t look at  the details – 
this moment here.  It can  certainly be valuable to look at 
the big picture and big ideals, but often we miss 
something. We miss the moment . We miss the details of how we’re living here and now.  In many ways, it’s the 
small details that are th e building blocks for our ‘big’ life. 
The small details make a big difference over time.  So 
spend time caring about the details.  
 
When I was a Zen practitioner, I was deeply moved by 
some of the other practitioners I knew. Not by the fact 
that they were en lightened or anything big that had 
happened to them, but by the way they picked up a 
teacup. Wow – they were so present, so ‘there,’ with so 
little self -conscious ‘selfing ’ going on.  Just a teacup. Did 
I come to Zen to learn how to drink tea? I came for big, 
important reasons. Zen is a big, important religion. It 
has grand ideas and  ideals. If someone had said, “G o to 
Zen and learn how to drink tea,” I probably wouldn’t 
have gone.  But I was so inspired by seeing how 
someone picked up a teacup or walked across the 
temple courtyard. Just how they walked. I’d never seen 
anyone just walk without trying to get someplace , or 
without any other ulterior ideas or purposes. They just 
walked. Eve n in walking meditation you’re doing 
something, but this person was just walking. Not to go 
someplac e, but just there. I thought, “Wow, that’ s pretty 
impressive.”  
 
It’s not just Zen. A famous American Catholic monk by 
the name of Thomas Merton spent years living in a 
monas tery. Once someone asked him, “W hat have you 
learned in all your years in the monastery?” He was one of the great teachers in the 20th century  in America, a 
very important person. What did he learn? He wrote 
books – lots of books. What did he learn that was so 
important? He said, “I learned how to open and close 
doors.” S omeone might say, “W hat?! I’m involved in 
Christianity, or Buddhism, and there’re big things to  do. 
There’s communion with God; there’s enlightenmen t; 
there’re all these big things. I mean, ‘ Doors?’ That 
seems pretty ridiculous. ”  
 
How many people would go to a one-day retreat here at 
IMC on how to open and close doors? All day it’s going 
to be about that. I don’t know if people would come. I 
might be  alone teaching it. But if I held a workshop on 
the Buddhist idea of enlightenment, it would be packed. 
But none of those people would be learning how to 
open and close doors.   
 
Attention to detai l actually makes a difference – how 
you encounter t he door. Are you there for it? A re you 
present for it? Is the door just something that’s in the 
way of important things , and you just want to get by it? 
Doors don’t count for anything . They’re not valuable or 
don’t have any role in your life. There’s no sense of se lf 
to acquire from a door. The door’s not going to show 
you how great you are , or explain to you how it’s just a 
delusion to be caught up in ideas of greatness. The  
door’s not going to humble you – it’s just there. But can 
you learn from the door? Can you  really be there for the door – for this activity?  Attention to detail.  
 
And if we do that throughout the day, and really show 
up for our life, for what’s actually happening, we’re 
going to spend less time in fantasy. Less time in 
abstractions. We’re going  to be present to see the 
genesis  of our reactio ns, responses, and thoughts. 
Present for h ow we’re living our life.   
 
If you’re really there for that door  as you open it and 
when you step through it, you might be so present that 
you notice your response and reaction to what’s on the 
other side. Because you see the response and reaction, 
you have some choice of what to do  – whether to act on 
it or not. Someone might be on the other side of that 
door, and your first response is fear. You realize th at 
you’re often afraid of people, but you see the fear arise 
because you’re really there for the door and there for 
the fear. You say, “ Oh, that’s interesting. I don’t think I 
need to go down that path of fear. I’m afraid, but usually 
I get swep t away into  it and then I cower.  I sneak away 
before anybody sees me. But now I see the fear and I 
have a choice of how to be with it. ” That’s a ttention to 
detail.  
 
The other thing I think  we all do  – I’ve certainly done it  – 
is to look at the big picture for big solutions.  “I have a 
big problem , and I need to find a solution  to this big 
problem.” That’s reasonable. It’s reasonable to find solutions to our difficulties and challenges. But 
sometimes by looking for the big solutions, we mi ss the 
attention to detail of this moment here.  In this moment, 
you might actually notice that you’re stressed, that 
you’re  shoulders are tense. But paying attention to 
detail, you could say, “I still have a big problem, but I 
can relax my shoulders.” Or you might say, “N o, I can’t. 
My big problem is so important. It’s more important than 
my shoulders. Don’t tell me about my s houlders. What I 
have to do is so important.” Why can’t you look for the 
important solutions for your life with relaxed shoulders?  
By the end of the day , you might not  have a solution. 
Are you better off going through the day with relaxed 
shoulders or tens e shoulders? If you know that by the 
end of the day you’re not going to have the answer, 
maybe you’d be more willing to go through the day with 
relaxed shoulders. You’re still trying to solve the 
problem. Unless you think tense shoulders are going to 
make it more likely that you’ll figure it all out. Maybe 
there are s ome things you will never solve.  But would 
you rather never solve them with tense shoulders or 
relaxed shoulders? With a tense belly or a relaxed 
belly? Would you rather not solve them while be ing 
present for the door? For the tea? For your friend? For 
this life?  Or would you rather not solve your problems 
while not being present for all of these things?  
 
There’s something very powerful about attention to 
detail.  Attending to it, being careful with it. For the purposes of the practice we teach here, it’s good to pay  
attention to the details of how you tense up.  How you 
contract or tighten up.  Notice it. Pay attention to detail.  
Don’t be mesmerized by the ‘big’ Buddhism, the big 
problems, the big things, to the extent that  you’re 
overlooking the little details of tension , holding , and 
contraction.  
 
If you pay attention to your  distractions , they create the 
foundation – they’re t he building blocks to actually 
create better conditions for yourself , so that you’ re in a 
better , more useful p lace to address the big issues of 
your life  or the big issues of Buddhism. Whatever issue 
it may be, paying attention to detail creates the 
conditions for  solving  it. If you have big issues in your 
life, big challenges, or big dreams about what the 
Buddhist pract ice is going to do for you, ideally you want 
to make yourself into a person who is ch angeable.  You 
want to be willi ng to be changed. Spirituality  – Buddhism  
– is not about understanding everything so everyone 
else changes o r behaves properly around you. In the 
process of practice , we have to be willing to be changed  
by the solutions that c ome along . There has to be a 
shift. It’s not just a matter of understanding something 
and then everything will fall into place .  
 
How do you create the conditions so that you are able 
to be changed by the solutions that come? It turns out  
attention to detail is helpful. As you go through your life, you stay relaxed , open , present, and you’re really here 
– because who knows? You m ight have really big 
problems – huge challenges of life and death. You 
might have really big spiritual concerns, a dark night of 
the soul, where it’s really time for something to happen.  
And, lo and behold, it’s possible that the solutions could 
be given to yo u tomorrow : the perfect solution on a 
silver platter. It’s going to make everything else in your 
life fall into place. It’s there – maybe  tomorrow – waiting 
for you.  
 
But, you’re too busy  being tense, running around, too 
distracted to notice it. And you mi ss it because you 
haven’t learned how to be really present, in the moment, 
for this time, this detail, here and now. We never know 
what gift is waiting for us, but it really helps to have the 
kind of presence and attention where you’re there in the 
moment.  You’re receptive , ready , and you can receive 
it, take it in, and notice it. Who knows? If you pay 
attention to the door as you open and close it, it might 
be written there. Or it might be written on your heart as 
you open and close the door. Attention to detail.  
 
One of the ways we’ll do that here at IMC is by cleaning 
the place. Attention to detail. So , for those of you who 
can stay, it’s very much appreciated.
