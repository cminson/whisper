Present Moment

I think that all of you are probably well aware 
that if you sit down to try and be in the present 
moment , or sit down to be present for something 
as simple your breathing, a common experience 
is that the mind has other ideas for you. The 
mind will wander off in thoughts about other 
concerns. Some people get frustrated at this , 
because they are trying to be pr esent with the 
breath, but the mind keeps going off somewhere 
else. When you do mindfulness practice, it’s 
best – although it’s not always easy – if you can 
not get distresse d or disturbed by this . Realize 
instead that this is a common thing. It isn’t that  
you are accepting just letting the mind wander 
off, but you don’t have to be opposed to it.  
 
When you are doing mindfulness practice and 
your mind wanders off into something, it can be 
interesting  not to turn away from it or let go of it 
right away  – to not just come back to breathing , or to what you think your idea of the present 
moment is  – but ra ther, to take a few moments 
to realize that your thinking is happening in the 
present moment. Just see that this is happening 
in the present. I’m thinking a bout the future . 
Thinking about the future is what is happening in 
the present moment. In that way you are 
present, right? You are present for what is 
happening in the present, which is that you are 
thinking about the future.  
 
First, see it as a present mo ment phenomenon . 
Then, in the simplest, most obvious way 
accessible to you, simply recognize what it is 
that has caught your attention, and that pulls 
your mind in that direction. Just a very simple 
acknowledgement , “Oh, so this is what I’m 
interested in ; this is what the mind is interested 
in. It is different from what I want to do.”  
 
Recognize what is in the present moment, even 
though part of it may be the future or the past , or 
a fantasy. Then simply acknowledge what you’re 
concerned about . Then, o nly after you do those 
two things, come back to the present moment 
and to your breathing.  Make sense?  Or if you 
are doing walking meditation, then come back to 
the walking.  See what this is like.   
If this can work, then more careful monitoring 
and recognizing of what’s happening is included 
as part of your practice.
