Dharmette: Understanding the Purpose 
of Practice  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

One of the important topics in Buddhist practice is 
understanding the purpose for which  you’re practicing . 
A sense of purpose, intention, or goal is very helpful, but 
it can also be a hindrance. Anybody who practices has 
to understand the nature of having a purpose, or a goal, 
and how to work with it  – when to engage in it in an 
active way and use it as a reference, and when to drop 
it. 
 
In some schools of Buddhism, the goal is to be goalless . 
So you can be goalless, and set that as an ideal . Then 
the pract ice is to try to find out how to be that way . And 
in the process of doing that, you might discover how 
many agendas you have  – for fixing, making something 
happen, acquiring, becoming a better self – all kinds of 
things . Then you see all that against the r eference point 
of no goal . And then you can slowly let go, let go, let go, 
until you come to what feels like a very content state of 
just being. Even the goal of being goalless can be  a 
goal.  
 The advantage of having a goal is that then we know 
what we’re supposed to do . It can be better  or easier to 
know what to do  than i f you have a very amorphous 
idea that Buddhist practice or mindfulness is a good 
thing to do. You can be mindful of many things which 
are not particularly useful to be mindful of . You can be 
mindful of your little toe . You can go around all day 
being mindful of your little toe ; that’s nice , I suppose . 
But maybe it’s not as useful as being mindful of your 
breathing, or of your beliefs, or of your clinging, or of 
your resistance to thin gs. Certain things are more useful 
to pay attention to than other s.  
 
How do you know what is useful? You know a little bit 
by the purpose you’re interested in. If you’re interested 
in freedom from suffering, freedom from clinging, then 
it’s more useful to  pay attention to your clinging than it is 
to pay attention to your little toe, perhaps . And maybe it 
gives you a little guidance : “Pay attention to this .” Or 
maybe what you need to understand is  that it’s useful to 
pay attention to your belief systems, be cause your belief 
systems  – often  subconsciously in the background – are 
fueling your clinging and attachment. Since what you’re 
interested in is not clinging , then,  rather than being 
mindful of the trees, and the ocean, and nature  – which 
is a beautiful thing to do – but it’s not as productive as 
looking directly at the beliefs and the clinging you have. 
If it’s a vague idea of being mindful, it can be valuable, 
but it might not be as beneficial as having  a certain goal or purpose in mind.  
 
There  are a lot of purposes you can have, a lot of 
wonderful things to be engaged in . Some of them are 
intermediate purposes. For example, you might feel that 
you’re not kind enoug h as you are going about your 
daily life, and it would be useful to become a kinder 
person . So that  become s your goal : “Let me see if I can 
approach people with more kindness. It’s not in my 
nature to do that, but let me see . What would it take to 
do it wi th some integrity? ” Maybe it just means that I 
slow down a little bit , and take in the other person more 
fully, so that I really register who they are  and what’s 
going on with them . Maybe it  will be  easier to approach 
them kindly if I really get a sense of  who they are, rather 
than just coming from my ideas of what should be. It’s 
possible to work on your kindness, and develop it . You 
don’t have to be stuck with your native, or preexisting, 
level of kindness . You can cultivate and strengthen that 
capacity , and that can be a purpose or goal that you set 
for yourself.  
 
You can cultivate greater concentration. You might find 
that your mind keeps getting caught up very easily in its 
preoccupations, concerns, and worries . And  you have a 
sense that you want to do something . But your mind 
gets pulled away, this way and that way , and you can’t 
really stay focused on anything . So a good purpose 
would be to cultivate concentration. And since you know that’s your purpose, then you c an look at  what supports 
concentration . What can I do that develops that in some 
way? Maybe  this is not the time to focus on kindness; 
maybe this is the time to focus on being still. Or maybe 
it would be better  not to spend a lot of time on the 
computer , or television, or the radio , or email  – all these 
things that tend to spin out my mind. If I want to develop 
concentration, maybe I need to live in a more settled or 
focused way, and not be jumping around doing all the 
things that I could do.  
 
If you have a  sense of a purpose, that purpose casts 
light. It helps you make decisions about things you want 
to do: how to practice, what to focus on , and  to do 
things that support that sense of purpose. If you don’t 
have a sense of purpose, then you’re more adrift. I  think 
that the way mindfulness practice is taught here in the 
West is  sometimes  not taught with enough sense of 
purpose . It’s just taught as if mindfulness is all good, 
and all you have to do is be mindful , and everything else 
will follow.  
 
It is possibl e to take to heart in the wrong way what I 
said earlier about how profound it can be to pay 
attention to the nature of mindfulness itself: that there’s 
some freedom, a timeless presence, just in the qualities 
of attention itself . That kind of message can a lso turn a 
person away from a sense of purpose, because it’s 
about just resting in this luminous awareness, as oppose d to having some place you’re going and 
developing.   
 
It’s important to have some sense of understanding 
about what you’re doing and why you’re doing it . 
Sometimes when you see a teacher, one of the very 
interesting conversations is to make clear what I’m 
doing, and why I’m doing it . This is why I’m doing the 
practice ; this is my direction of where I’m going ; this is 
what I’m trying to develop ; this is what I’m working on 
right now . Then you can have a very interesting 
conversation about that , maybe  in some deeper way.  
 
Sometimes the purpose, the goal, is not very clear to 
people . Sometimes there’s an intuitive sense of why 
they’re doin g it, but they can’t articulate a particular 
purpose . I think that’s fine . I spent some years that way 
myself. Nothing was more important for me than to 
practice , but I didn’t have any clear sense of why . I just 
intuitively knew  that this is what I was doi ng. Other 
times , I had a very clear sense of purpose: this is what I 
was doing.  
 
I remember once, I went to sit a three month retreat at 
IMS. At the beginning of the retreat , Joseph Goldstein 
asked me, “Why are you here?” [laughs] And I said, “To 
overcome my suffering.” At the moment , that was a very 
sincere answer , but after I left that conversation, I 
thought, “Oh. Was that profound enough [laughs] – a simple thing like that ?” I’ve since learned that that’s a 
profound purpose . But, I thought, “Maybe I was 
supposed to have a more lofty goal. ” 
 
It’s important to know when to drop that sense of 
purpose . It’s possible to set a direction for the ship . 
Then o nce the direction is se t, you don’t think about the 
direction anymore. For example, when you sit down to 
meditate, you might have a sense of purpose: of why 
you’re sitting there, why you’re practicing . But then you 
don’t want to think about that purpose anymore once 
you’re there , because that just keeps you a bit too 
agitated, too involved, and maybe you want to let go . 
Any thought about the purpose just gets in the way of 
being really present . So you have to know how to drop it 
as well.  
 
One of the dangers with a sense of purpose is that 
people can spend too much time trying to fix everything, 
and tinker with everything. There can be a lot of 
expectation around the purpose . People  can want to 
measure themselves : I’m not living up to the go al; I’m 
not doing well enough ; I’m not going fast enough. There 
can be a lot of ego connected to it: me, myself and 
mine . It’s my goal . How are other people seeing me ? 
I’m not living up to it . It’s all about me, around the goal, 
and that can get in the way.  
 
There  are many problems with a sense of a goal. But having a goal, or a sense of purpose, or an intention 
can also be very enlivening and deepening . It can be a 
reference point, which  helps us understand what’s going 
on, and what’s useful.  
 
Some goals can be particular, short -term goals. Some 
can be lifetime goals that we establish for ourselves. 
There can be a goal for a particular week . This week let 
me be as mindful as I can when I’m drivi ng. Then you 
explore that , and see what that’s like, trying to organize 
your driving so you can really be mindful. Or it can be a 
week where you are mindful around food . This is a  
valuable place to bring mindfulness to . You can try to 
organize your week so  that you have some more care 
and attention given to what happens when you’re 
around food, and you’re eating . That’s where you 
cultivate and develop . It’s a small sense of purpose.  
 
Or there can be a lifetime purpose of trying to come 
from a place of compassion . Engaging with the world in 
a compassionate way is a high priority for you, and for 
how you want to organize and orient your life . So then 
you set that , and then you start looking with that 
purpose . What supports that? What manifests that? 
What allows me to live that? There  are many things I 
can do in this life, but if that’s really important for me , 
how do I organize myself around that?  
 
There are often subconscious intentions that we have, but we  don’t see . However, when you articulate an 
inten tion, a purpose, or a goal for yourself, that gives 
you a chance to find out that maybe that goal wasn’t 
worthwhile [laughs] . Maybe it wasn’t a good one after 
all; or maybe you were holding it in the wrong way.  
 
Sometimes the difficulties or the problems a round 
having a goal are the very place where we learn and 
grow. Some people are afraid of having a goal, because 
they’ve gotten burned before . But rather than avoiding 
it, maybe go into it again , and then try to understand , 
“How did I hold it wrong? What w as off before? Is there 
a different way of doing it this time? ” 
 
So spend some time considering goals . Is there a goal? 
Is there a sense of purpose that you might have? Is 
there a time and place for a goal? Is there a time and 
place for being goalless? Is there a time and place for 
reflecting and seeing ? Is there some subconscious 
sense of purpose and inte ntion, something you’re trying 
to accomplish and do that you haven’t articulated to 
yourself , and  that maybe is useful  or maybe not useful?  
 
It’s a very interesting area to explore , and I’d encourage 
you to spend some time considering your relationship to 
goals and purposes and intention and see where that 
leads you.  
 
That was my purpose for the se fifteen minutes. I hope that was helpful.
