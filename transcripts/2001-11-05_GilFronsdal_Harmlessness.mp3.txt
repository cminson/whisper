 There was an ancient Buddhist text called the Melinda Pana, the questions of Melinda. Melinda is the Pali pronunciation of Meninder. Meninder was a Greek king who ruled what is now Afghanistan, parts of Pakistan, northern India about the second century BCE. He questioned a senior Buddhist monk on the Dharma, on Buddhism. It is a wonderful contact of a Greek person, Greek thinker, Greek cultural person, and Buddhism in these questions and answer session. And he asked all kinds of, actually two big volumes translated into English, the records of this conversation they had. And in the course of this conversation, the monk tells King Meninder that the distinguishing characteristic of the Dharma, or of the Buddha Dharma, of Buddhism, the distinguishing characteristic is non-harming. That that which distinguishes it, or that which is the main characterizing aspect of the Dharma, Dharma doesn't have to be Buddhist Dharma, but of the Dharma, of the truth, of the way things are, the law, is non-harming. The idea of non-harming is one of the fundamental principles of Buddhism. It's a central approach to how to live a life, is to live a life of not harming, of being harmless. This focus on being harmless, then, it has priority over, for example, meditation practice. That it's understood that if you want to practice meditation, you want to begin by trying to arrange your life in such a way that you're beginning to live in a way that's harmless, that you're not causing harm. And there are many degrees of causing harm, and so maybe initially start at the biggest levels. For lay people, for the Buddhist laity, there are five precepts that they're instructed to follow. They're called training precepts. If your intention is to become liberated, if your intention is to clarify your heart, to develop your heart, to be free, that you need to cultivate and develop the five precepts. And these five precepts are often understood to be expressions of non-harming. And they are not to kill, not to take what is not given, not to be involved in sexual misconduct, not to lie, and not to either ... it's a little bit ambiguous how the poly is worded, either don't take any intoxicants or don't take any intoxicants to the point of intoxication. And exactly how it's supposed to be interpreted is a little bit, slightly ambiguous. The goal, traditionally, of Buddhist practice is to become a noble one, a person of nobility. It's the ancient Buddhist word for someone who has attained the stages of awakening or liberation, has become a noble person, noble one. And in defining a noble one, there are many definitions of what makes a person a noble one. But here, this is one very simple definition. One is not a noble one who harms living beings. By being harmless to all living beings is one called a noble one. So what I'm trying to stress here is that in the Buddhist tradition, there is a central role for the desire, the wish, the lifestyle where a person is living a harmless way, trying to be harmless. The Buddha said, what is right intention? And then he defined three intentions. The right intention is the second step in the eighth full path. Intention on renunciation, on freedom from ill will, and on harmlessness. Renunciation is one of the very important principles of ancient Indian Buddhism, whether you mean it more literally or not. This is a whole question we can explore. But of these three things, harmlessness is one of them. And this is again for householders, for laity. And how householders are there three kinds of bodily conduct, not in accordance with the Dharma? Here someone kills living beings, is murderous, bloody handed, given to blows and violence, fearless to living beings. Here someone takes what is not given, here someone engages in sexual misconduct. So these three things are considered very important for someone engaged in Buddhist practice, not to be involved in killing, stealing, or sexual misconduct. All forms of attempting to live a harmless life. Life doesn't cause harm. The emphasis on living a harmless life then becomes much more accentuated, or much more emphasized for the monastics, the monks and nuns in the Buddhist tradition. The Buddha in a sense saw the monastics as people who were organizing their whole life, specifically and totally, on the task of becoming liberated. And so he put much more emphasis on what you needed to do in order to attain that goal. And this is stated a little bit more in a relaxed discourse. And how is a monk perfected in morality? Abandoning the taking of life, he dwells refraining from taking life, without stick or sword, scrupulous, compassionate, trembling for the welfare of all living beings. And then similarly, almost the same wording is used for not stealing. And for monks, rather than sexual misconduct, the precept for monks is one of chastity, of celibacy. And I love this expression, trembling for the welfare of all living beings. That the intention to be harmless and not to kill goes together with a kind of, I don't know what, this is actually the best English translation of the Pali, but comes together with something passionate, something strong, some strong, quivering movement of the heart that is concerned for the welfare of all living beings. That desire to be harmless is not just simply for one's own benefit, but it arises out of being very keenly concerned about the benefit for the beings around you. So then in a more legalistic language, the Buddhist monastics have to follow a whole series of rules, of precepts. For the monks, it's 227 precepts. The first four are the most grave, most serious. If a person breaks any of these first four, they are then automatically no longer a monk. You don't have to go through any kind of formal procedures, like legalistic procedures. It's just kind of like the way nature works. If you do one of these things, you're just not a monk anymore. You can never be a monk again in this lifetime. So they're quite serious. I think it's the third, the third of these four primary precepts for the monks goes like this. Should any monk intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin, or praise the advantages of death, or incite someone to die, thus, good person, what use is this wretched, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life. Or with such an idea in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die. That monk is defeated and is no longer in communion. And then the sub-commentary of this defines the human life as beginning from the first time consciousness, from the time of consciousness first becomes manifest in the mother's womb. So this is usually taken by monastics, that they are not allowed to have any kind of involvement with abortions, or encouraging abortions, or somehow any kind of way. So this is very absolute, no involvement with killing, even indirectly. It goes beyond human beings. It's not as grave, it's Rule 61. And you don't get automatically expelled from the Order. If you break this one, you have to confess. And then there might be something you have to do, a atonement you have to do, or maybe not. But Rule 61 for monastics is, should any monk knowingly deprive an animal of life, it is to be confessed. So this means, in a sense, that monastics are not allowed to kill animals. Rule 62. Should any monk knowingly make use of water with living beings in it, it is to be confessed. So here, if you know there's an insect or anything living in the water you're drinking, you can't drink it. The emphasis on being harmless goes to that extent. You have to be very... You're trying to best not to knowingly be involved in the death, or causing the death of any living being at all, even something very, very small that exists in the water. And so some Buddhist monks in the old days used to have these filters, these cloths. They would pour the water through the cloth and just sift off the insects, and then they would drink the water. Probably in ancient India the water was not always so clean. And this is from the instructions to every new monk. There's certain things, catechism, I guess, right? A monk who has been accepted as a monk should not deprive a living being of life, even if it is only a black or white ant. Any monk who purposely deprives a human being of life, even to the extent of causing an abortion, is not a monk, is not a son of the Buddha. Just as a solid block of stone broken in two cannot be joined together again, in the same way a monk who has purposely deprived a human being of life is not a contemplative, not a son of the Buddha. You are not to do this for the rest of your life. So, very emphatic, at least for the... no killing, no killing, no killing. That central to practicing Dharma, central to engaging in this path of liberation, is to be harmless to the extent of not being involved in killing. For the monastics it's stated much more seriously, much more definitively than it is for the laity. So, then the question is... oh, so for the monastics it goes further than even little beings in the water. Monastics are also not allowed to kill plants. And so, they're not actually supposed to be involved in gardening or farming, because as you're tilling the soil, you might destroy some of the insects in the soil. Or you might have to pull the plant out of the ground, you're killing the plant. And if you're going to offer a tomato to a monastic, before you can properly offer the tomato to a monastic, you have to take a fork or a knife and poke it, so that it's already dead by the time you offer it. Because the tomato is kind of living, right? So, because a monk is not allowed to eat it if it's a living plant, because that kills it. So, they're pretty serious about this business of being harmless. So, then the question is... are there limits to how far we should go in being harmless? Are there times when we should maybe be involved in causing harm? Are there, for example, in our own self-defense, or in the defense of our home from termites? Is there a limit to this precept of being harmless? If you look at this issue, it's often contrasted with... the Buddhist notion of harmlessness is contrasted with the notion of the Jains. The Buddhists and the Jains, Jain religion of ancient India, were contemporary religions of each other. And both of them have been pointed to as being exemplars of this emphasis on Ahimsa, on being harmless, of being non-violent. And one of the reasons I wanted to give this talk tonight is that it's quite... if you're looking for resources or understanding from the religious world, for some understanding or some dedication or some model somewhere in the world, for people who organize their life about being harmless, Buddhism is one of those places. And it goes back for 2500 years. The Jains also were that way. But the Jains had a little bit different understanding than the Buddhists. For the Jains, any killing at all was not allowed. For the Buddhists, only killing where you intended the killing is not allowed. So the Jains would go out of their way with great kind of... almost a kind of ascetic practice level, try to avoid making absolutely sure nothing is killed by them. And they'd be... they'd go walking around with this broom in front of them to make sure there's no insects in the ground in front of them, sweeping them out of the way so they don't step on them. For the Buddhists, they didn't go to that extreme, even though they did filter the water. But if the basic idea in Buddhism is that you have... if you had no intention to kill, then you haven't violated your precept to be harmless. Even though you should try not to avoid accidental killing, the focus in Buddhism is on the intention, whereas in Jainism is much more absolute, any action at all that caused harm. But are there limits to how much... how far we should be harmless? I was a little bit surprised to realize only a few weeks ago that the five precepts for the laity, not to kill, not to steal, not to lie, not to be involved in sexual misconduct and no intoxication, says nothing about hitting someone. You can't kill them. But what about just punching the guy out? I kind of always assumed that hitting was as bad as anything else. You wouldn't want to hit anyone if you're serious about Buddhist Buddhism. You want to try to refrain from that. And harmlessness went to the point of avoiding hitting someone. But if you look at the precepts at laity you're supposed to follow, there's no rule preventing a lay Buddhist from hitting someone. So now you want to sit a little bit further away from everyone, make sure that you're in friendly terms. So what does that mean, if anything? So this is Rule 74 and 75 for Buddhist monastics. And it says, should any monk, angered and displeased, give a blow to another monk, it is to be confessed. So the operating... important terms here is angered and displeased. So if you hit someone and you're angered, angered and displeased, you've violated your precept as a Buddhist monk. What about if you're not angry? If there's no anger, no displeasure in your heart or mind, then you're not violating the precept. Because it says specifically, if you're angry or displeased. So now when you get close to a Buddhist monk, you want to make sure that... So then an explanation of this in the canon, this so-called sacred explanation, it states that it is a wrongdoing that needs to be confessed to also hit any unordained being, including animals, if the monk is angered or displeased. So the rule just says a monk can't hit another monk. The 227 rules say nothing about a monk hitting a lay person. But then the explanation says you have to also avoid hitting even animals, let alone lay people. In addition, it explicitly states that it is not an offense to hit someone in self-defense if one is not angry or displeased. Now is that possible? And the assumption is that there are times when that would happen. There are times when maybe someone's about to give you a blow and you just bring up your hand and knock it out of the way. You do something to protect yourself and you're not angry at the person, you're not intending harm to the person. You're simply trying to protect yourself from being harmed. And that is allowed. Now for monastics, they're explicitly not allowed to have weapons or to handle weapons. So the argument that there's justified forms of self-defense is not extended to them. You get to have the bomb. You get to have some kind of weapon to do some kind of major kind of... You can use your hand, your body, but you can't use anything more. Also, it certainly allows for kind of a reflex, you know, something striking out as a reflex if you're being attacked. And it's not an offense to do that. So are there times when we are not angered or displeased where we might want to hit or hitting becomes appropriate? There's some ambiguity then. So taking that example of the monks, then you go back to the five precepts for the laity. Maybe the reason why not hitting is not included in it is that it's ambiguous about... It's not an absolute precept. There are times perhaps from this early Buddhist tradition where it's not disallowed, it's not considered wrong to be hitting someone. However, it seems to say that you should not do it in anger or displeasure. There should be no intention of ill will as part of that action. Can that be done? Do we know how to do that? The focus here also again is the intention with which we're doing something. And this is something we find emphasized in Buddhism over and over again, that the intention, the motivation behind our actions is really defining what defines the morality of the action. So part of mindfulness practice is to encourage us to look back. Why are you doing this? What's the motivation here? If you want to do X, why do you want to do X? Do you want to do it because you're filled with greed? Do you want to do it because you're filled with hate and you want to strike out? Do you want to do it because you want to harm somebody? Do you want to do it because you want to help someone? You're concerned about their welfare? What is the intention behind it? And what we often can see is that sometimes what looks like a beneficial act can actually have unwholesome intentions behind it. You want to help your neighbor who's sick. And that seemingly on the surface is a very nice thing to do. But really while you're helping the neighbor is you think if you help the neighbor now, then the neighbor is going to give you some of their wonderful apple pie next time they make it. And really you want something in return or you want to show off to all the other neighbors what a great neighbor you are. And really it has to do with self-aggrandizement more than helping if you really pay attention to the intention behind it. I remember when I was visiting Ajahn Amaro in his monastery. I don't know if this is really a story. I went up there with a whole bunch of people and we all brought all these food as offerings. Because often you go to a monastery you bring food because monastics don't have their own food in a sense and you have to kind of feed them. And so everyone else in my group brought with them offerings for the lunch for that day. And it was very nice. It was a weekend. I knew the monks get a lot of food on the weekends. And when people visit them, during the week they don't get a lot of visitors. So what I did was I brought all these dry goods that wasn't cooked or ready to be eaten right then and there but could be eaten during the week. I thought I was going to take care of them later. So it was kind of a nice thought I thought. I went ahead and did that and it seemed fine. But what I didn't know was that the custom at Ajahn Amaro's monastery is when monks are going to eat their meal, as the food is being delivered to them, they announce who has offered the particular dishes. And so and so brought this, so and so brought this. And after a while it became obvious that Gil hadn't brought anything. And I could find, feel myself inside of myself feeling this great impulse. I got to raise my hand and say, excuse me, you know, I brought something too. And so it wasn't simply the intention, somehow I didn't just simply have the intention to make an offering. But in the context of that ritual of announcing who was to give me the offering, my ego got involved. And how I appeared in my reputation got all tied up in it. So the intention becomes important. And one of the reasons why harmlessness is a fundamental precepts in Buddhism is that the intention to cause harm is detrimental to you. Determined to the person has that intention. That the effects of our intentions are consequential. That if you intend to do something, that that kind of puts a kind of flavor, a kind of perfumes or puts a little twist or kind of puts a little spin, maybe that's the best, a little spin on your psyche, on your karma is what they usually say on your psyche. And it might seem very innocent or very minor, what you're doing, the intention. But with enough drops, the bathtub is filled. And if we repeat the same little kind of intention, you know, it's okay to exaggerate and to lie. And maybe, you know, to do it once doesn't really make much of a spin. But to do it a little bit, you know, every five minutes or ten minutes, it adds up over time, over a day, over a lifetime. That our intentions create a spin that can either be detrimental to ourselves, to our psyche, its well-being, or can be supportive of it and before our welfare. And to help us create conditions where our psyche becomes healthy is one of the functions of Buddhist practice. And to avoid creating a psyche which is unhealthy. And so looking at your intentions is fundamental to this. So one of the reasons, rationale for being harmless is not because it doesn't cause harm to other people, but the intention to cause harm creates an unhealthy psychic environment within yourself. And if you're interested in doing the work of liberation, you have to try to create as much health as you can within yourself, whatever way you can. Another reason for motivation, for rationale, for the harmlessness has to do with empathy. And the Buddha stressed that it's very important to put yourself in other people's shoes. That if you put yourself in other people's shoes, then naturally you wouldn't want to cause them harm. And the way that this is stated in the discourses of the Buddha is like this. This is a very famous quotation that gets quoted as being the reference for empathy being the source of desire to be harmless. It can cause others to kill. So the exercise, the use of your imagination, because empathy requires imagination, the use of our ability to put ourselves in other people's shoes is a very important one, a very important quality for Buddhist practitioners. And then to consider the other person. So even someone you think of as your enemy, or think of you have tremendous irritate you, or you're really annoyed by them or something, try to put yourself in their shoes. Imagine what it's like for them, their life and their difficulties and the causes and conditions that came together for who they are. So we don't just write them off, which is often a tendency people do when someone is your enemy or someone has caused you harm. Sometimes it's a tendency to write them off or to demonize them or project that they're absolutely wrong in some way. But you put yourself in their shoes. In the greater Buddhist tradition, this kind of teaching was presented as all beings, all living beings that you encounter, at some point in the endless cycle of rebirth, of being born and dying again, dying again, the people you encounter at some point or other, they were your mother or your father or your children or your wife or husband. At some point, everyone's been related. And so this intimate connection between everyone means of course you wouldn't harm someone who was your mother or your father. And if that's actually the case in some former lifetime, then treat them with great respect and love and care. So there are two motivations, two rationales in Buddhism for harmlessness. One is that, I'm just kind of repeating this, one is that to have intentions of causing harm, that intention harms you. And you don't want to cause harm for yourself. You want to avoid harming yourself. And the second is that if you have some empathy, if your mindfulness and awareness is open enough to sense some sensitive way, the humanity of the person you're encountering, then that empathy or that sensitivity of the person, you naturally would not want to hurt them. And part of what happens with mindfulness practice is that sensitivity gets developed over time. Often people are not so sensitive. They're kind of, we're often callous to each other or we're not paying attention to other people very well or we're living in our thoughts a lot. And we don't really encounter the person as they actually are. And as we practice the mindfulness, there's a greater sensitivity to what we encounter. And as a sensitivity turns into someone else and their well-being and their potential for suffering and harm, there gets born a kind of a natural wish not to wish them harm. So that's the kind of the rationale, as I understand it, two major rationales for harmlessness in the Buddhist tradition. The focus on intention is so powerful for the Buddha that, or taking care of your own welfare, taking care of your own inner psychic spin is so important, that the Buddha said, you should not sacrifice your own welfare for the welfare of someone else. So that goes against what a lot of people, the kind of sacrifice a lot of people will make. That they see that there, some people say there's a greater good out there and my good is nothing in comparison to this greater good. So I'll sacrifice my own benefit for the sake of this greater good. And to the extreme example of that, people have used that if you have a chance to kill someone who, by killing them you prevent the murder of a thousand people, you know that's going to cause bad karma for yourself, a bad spin on yourself. But you're willing to do that for the sake of the benefit. So that kind of argument, I'm not going to argue against it, but it's very powerful, I think, that the Buddha, in his emphasis on harmlessness and the path towards liberation, stressed, don't give up your own welfare for the welfare of someone else. That your own welfare is actually very important. That self-love, kind of a love of yourself, appreciation of yourself, is a very important quality in Buddha's practice. Instead, you can't really love someone else unless you love yourself first. You can't really want the welfare of someone else if you don't really understand and want your own welfare also. Part of the reason for this emphasis is that Buddha was very serious about the possibility of us becoming liberated from the deepest roots, the deepest roots of suffering within ourselves. And it's very hard to do that work. And he said, you can't really help someone else point the way towards that possibility unless you've attained some degree of this liberation yourself. And he said it's like someone who, if two people are stuck in a quicksand, in the mud, in quicksand, they can't pull themselves out. If you're in quicksand and then the aber's in quicksand, it's very hard to pull each other out. But if one of them is up on the dry land, then they can pull the other person out. And so if you avoid your own welfare, at least your spiritual welfare, you're not going to have the transformation and the understanding that's going to have the eyes to see what needs to be done for someone else who's sinking in the mud of samsara in their suffering. So this emphasis on being on then the intention and what goes on inside of us in our hearts is so extreme or so that we have the following. This is kind of like, to prepare you for it, this is only for adult audience. And it's kind of like, it reminds me of the Old Testament story of Job. He was tested, as we all are these days. I think it's earlier. This is okay, am I going on? I'm going to kind of just, sometimes I wonder, just talking on and on. Okay, ready? Monks. So he's talking to monks, so we're off the hook. Monks, even if hoodlums were to cut off your limbs, if you became hateful towards them, you would not be carrying out my teachings. Rather, you should practice, our hearts will remain unaffected, we will say nothing evil, we will maintain compassion for that person's well-being, we will maintain loving-kindness and a heart free of hate. We shall practice effusing the person with our heart filled with loving-kindness. After doing this to this person, we will practice effusing the entire world with our heart filled with immeasurable loving-kindness. This is how you should practice. So how do you feel about that? Someone's chopping off your arms. So, you know, we don't want to kind of think too much about this. But, you know, apparently the monks are allowed to kind of say no, you know, strike out. But it's in very, very powerful language. What the Buddha is pointing to is not the issue of whether you should not defend yourself or whatever, but he's saying, even in such dire circumstances, extreme circumstances, you are not to have a heart that's filled with hate. If you produce hate, if you develop hate, become hateful, then you're not carrying out the Buddha's teachings. Of course, many of us will have ill will and hate, and we're not supposed to kind of be down on ourselves because those things come up. But rather, the focus then in practice is to work with that, and not to take it for granted, not to take it as a given, and not to be overwhelmed by that and kind of act on it. But with great compassion and friendliness towards yourself for having it, to work with that and try to free yourselves from any compulsion that comes without those feelings of hate. So you're not acting on it. Try to free yourself of those in a healthy and realistic way. Not repression and denial, pushing it away as if it's not there, but in some very healthy way, addressing that and trying to purify your heart from that. So the focus, again, is on the intention within us, what the inner psychic life is like. So is there some ambiguity in the teachings of being harmless? I think that there's no ambiguity if it has to do with killing. Killing is absolutely prohibited. There might be some ambiguity about what we do in our self-defense. But even though there's ambiguity there, in the Buddha's teaching, there's absolutely no ambiguity about what intention is that disallows that kind of activity. If there is hate or ill will as part of the intention for self-defense, then that act of self-defense is prohibited. So the responsibility, then, always, for Buddhists at least, is to turn the attention of mindfulness back on ourselves and on our own intentions. So no matter what's happening in the world around us, we have to try to understand it and come to terms with the best we can, but never at the expense of turning away from at least one eye that goes in and notices what's going on inside of me. What are the reactions and feelings? What are the motivations that's prompting me to say what I'm saying? What's the motivations that's prompting me to come up with my particular opinion of what has to happen? Or what's the motivation of getting me to act in a certain way? Am I trying to harm someone? Getting back at someone is a revenge. All those are forms of ill will that then are disallowed. So the attempt, then, is to try in a healthy way to become someone who's peaceful, filled with love, generosity, calm, to be calm in the midst of crisis. And then from that basis of peace and calm and love and generosity, then to be concerned about what the right and the effective and appropriate responses are to the world that we find ourselves in, to what's happening. And not to sacrifice our own welfare by our blind compulsion to hate or to react out of fear or whatever it might be. So in a sense, the first principle for Buddhists is to come back to yourself and find out how can you become a peacemaker by having a peaceful heart yourself and then going forth into the world. And the world is an ambiguous place. So it's not always so clear how we should act in the world, but it's very clear for Buddhists what they should try to cultivate in their own hearts. Last thing I want to say is that the focus on being harmless is a kind of a negative. It's the absence of causing harm. And there's one discourse where someone comes to the Buddha and says, well, it seems to me that if I just refrain from speaking and acting and doing anything, that then I've accomplished the purification of heart that's required and I'm liberated. And the Buddha said, if that was the case, then a newborn baby would be fully enlightened. And the Buddha didn't want to allow for that because the latent tendencies towards greed, hate and delusion are buried in the heart of that baby. They haven't done the inner work. And that what's required is not just simply the absence of certain behavior in Buddhist practice, but also what's required is the presence of certain forms of inner cultivation where we develop things like generosity and patience, forbearance, discernment, wisdom, concentration. We develop inner qualities for ourselves. We try to cultivate ourselves, develop ourselves, make ourselves better in a sense. And what's also required is to be concerned about the welfare for others, to tremble at the welfare of others. So, let's see. I'll end with this. Monks, a wise person, one of great wisdom, does not intend harm to self. So that's a big one, right? I mean, it's one thing to say it'd be harmless to the world around you, but you have to also do it to yourself. And I think for a lot of people, a lot of the ill will and hate and weight in which we suffer is the harm is directed towards ourself. We harm ourselves to a great extent. Like all the inner conflicts and inner wars that we have. A wise person does not intend harm to self, intend harm to others, or intend harm to both self or others. Thinking in this way, such a one benefits, intends benefit for self, benefit for others, benefit for both, benefit for the whole world. Thus is one wise and of great wisdom. So, the encouragement of the Buddha is not just simply that we should be harmless and live a life that's harmless, but we should all live a life which is concerned for the welfare and well-being of everyone, ourselves and the world around us. And in fact, I believe that as practice develops, we have no choice for that, but to do that. Because, as I said earlier, the sensitivity that comes with mindfulness is the sensitivity that where it's not possible to exclude from our inner psychic life or consciousness the well-being of other people. And as we take that into the psyche, then the motivation for the well-being of others becomes as important for us as the well-being for ourselves. And we don't sacrifice our own being, our own well-being, in order to take care of others, but the two of them go in tandem. We want them both. So, that was my attempt to present you one of the world's preeminent examples of a tradition that stresses the importance of being harmless. May you sort through the ambiguity on your own. Thank you.
