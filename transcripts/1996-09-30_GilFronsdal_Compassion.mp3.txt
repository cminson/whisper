 Last Monday evening I talked about compassion and I talked, I think I talked the whole time and there was no chance for discussion or for your responses on the topic, which is a very important topic in Buddhism. So what I had in mind this evening was just continuing for hopefully a short while on the topic, if I can manage that, and then just see what comes out of us as a group on the subject of compassion. So continuing on the theme of compassion, I'm struck regularly, but I need more so because it's been in my mind, how much the world needs compassion, society, people, everywhere. Compassion is something everyone needs. We need it for ourselves, the world needs it from us, everybody's in need of it. And I was thinking about how so much of our society, our corporate society, our works, our situations, our politics, is based on, is not organized around the notion or the idea that people matter. That what's important is the individual's well-being and growth and individual's integrity. But rather, so much of our society is organized around maximization of material gain, of profit, of status, of power. And I think it's one of the great sources of great suffering for a lot of people. It's suffering for those people who are caught in the cogs of that kind of movement and that kind of motivation. And it's suffering for those who are perpetuating it and trying to get on top in the system. And what are the values that we run our work lives with? What are the values that we run our political, economic life? And the issue of compassion is often seemingly somewhat absent from the kind of values that primarily run our culture and our society. And I think the phenomenal success of the comic strip Dilbert is not just simply because people can relate to, a lot of people live in cubicles and they can relate to someone who taught cartoons about cubicles, but I think it's because Dilbert, the comic strip, is really touching a very sore and painful place in America. And people are resonating with that and resonating with the humor of that. And I was very struck by the articles I read in the newspaper this year, this last week. The impression you get is that the bills that Congress has passed in the last few weeks on welfare and on immigration, there's a lot to be said about them, but the impression I'm getting is that they were very ill-considered. They were not very carefully written, they were not very carefully studied and debated, and they were done very quickly. And it seems, you know, it's very easy to point the finger and say it seems like mostly it was done for political expediency. And I find it very painful that such monumentally significant important events get done quickly and casually or quickly and not carefully, not considerably, as if people don't matter. And people do matter. It's a lot of individuals, a lot of people get stuck in the confusion around the confused contradictory apparently, provisions in the different bills. People matter. I don't know why this occurred to me, but there's a story about Mahatma Gandhi being asked what he thought of Western civilization. And he said, I think it would be a good idea. So the world needs compassion, and we need compassion for ourselves, and maybe that's more one of the primary places we need to find it. And so many of us harp on our shortcomings, or our perceived shortcomings, our perceived sense of how we're not right or we're wrong in some kind of way, we're not good enough or we're bad or something's wrong with us. And it's a tremendous crisis, the epidemic in our culture, the amount of people who feel some variation of such things. And many of these things are imaginary, not necessarily real. And we focus on these things, imaginary or real, our shortcomings, rather than having some sense of our sacredness, the sacredness of life, of being a human being, of being aware, of being awake. In these few years that we have on this earth, to be alive and be awake, it's a tremendously sacred event, our life, our ability to breathe. And for some reason, just like the political people, focus on certain things and forget the person, the personal. So I think many of us, we focus on certain aspects of ourselves and forget the deeply personal, the areas of that sacred, that's whole, that's complete, that's perfect in the way, just the way it is. And so we need tremendous compassion for ourselves, for what we do to ourselves, but just for the second, there's a tremendous amount of suffering in our life and just to have compassion for the suffering. Many people have told me what a relief it was to come to Buddhism because it's seemingly that the Buddhists were willing to talk about suffering. It was like what they're known for. You know, at least they can admit it rather than hiding it. And there's this beautiful poem that someone gave me. I performed a Asha ceremony, bearing the ashes of her son. And at the setting of the ceremony, she gave me this poem. It's by William Stafford. It's called Tragedy. It happens. You knew it could. No one ever said it wouldn't, and now it has. The world just goes on. The air moves, the trees keep on standing there and maybe grieve a little, the sun stays steady. All of this can't stop for a person, no matter who. And the whole world has to rock now and then, but that's all. So people come by to talk and help if they can. They shake their heads helpfully. You'll get over it, they say. And maybe after years you do, or at least some of the time when it's quiet or during music, you almost do. So there is suffering. And the response to suffering is, the appropriate, the natural, healthy response to suffering is compassion. The sensitive heart, the open heart, trembles when it meets suffering. And one of the roots, the classic definition in Buddhism, if you read Buddhist classic commentaries, the definition of compassion is the quivering or the movement of the heart. Is it big? Is it small? Do you see it? It must be small. These ants that crawl around here, up here. But the heart, so the heart, it gets, when we say in English, you know, the heart moves, we're moved by something. So I guess they said quiver in India, or is shake or trembles. But the heart trembles or shakes in many different ways. And two primary ways it can shake, it can tremble, it can be a little bit different. But the heart, it can be a little bit different. In many different ways. And two primary ways it can shake, tremble, it can be moved with, maybe with resistance or without resistance. And the meeting of suffering, to have a trembling occur with resistance, is to have, to meet the suffering with all the complicated reactions that we can have, that complicated. There's reactions, there's fear, there's despair, there's sorrow, there's condemnation, there's judgment, there's timidity. There's all these ideas, and these ideas we have about suffering. It's inappropriate, it's wrong to feel suffering. Something must be wrong with my life because I'm not, you know, basking in the full sight in Hawaii, or, you know, or I'm not always happy and bubbly, or something is wrong. We feel we have these judgments and ideas that something is wrong, or it's unacceptable, it's frightening for us to experience someone else's pain or our own pain because it threatens the way in which we've created a self-identity, or the way in which we have some sense of safe bearing, safe orientation for ourselves in our life. So with the judgments, the ideas, the evaluations, the emotional reactions we have, there's a resistance to the suffering. And a lot of the suffering of suffering, of experiencing suffering in the world, comes from the way we relate to it, that's actually add on to it by resisting it in various ways. And some of this, the resistance takes off in the form of projection. And we project a tremendous amount of ideas, a tremendous amount of feeling onto the situations around us, on the suffering around us, based on how we're afraid of it, based on the judgments we have of it, based on our aversion to it. And if we fail to notice how we project our problems and our resistances onto the situation and onto other people, then often we're actually incapable of providing real compassionate help. We're incapable of really meeting the person as a real person, of situation as a real situation. And we tend to respond, if we respond in something that looks like compassion, it tends to be something like what's called in Buddhism, sympathetic pity, where there's really a sense of separation from the person, rather than a sense of connectedness in that event and that suffering. And what we're looking for in Buddhism, the trembling of the heart that has no resistance, is a trembling of the heart in which there's no sense of separation. When the sense of you and I, then it's very dangerous, the kind of compassionate result, response, because it can be condescending, it can be looking down at someone. Actually, what's called the near enemies of compassion. And the near enemies are those things which look like compassion but aren't, to be confused and for compassion. And one of them is called sentimental pity. And that's kind of feeling sorry for someone, often it's because you feel better than them, you feel higher than them, removed from them, quite separate from them. And so you look down and say, oh, I feel so sorry for you and I'll give you a little bit of whatever to help you out because I feel sorry for you. And it's somewhat at a distance and to receive that kind of pity is actually kind of painful because you're not really seen as an authentic person. The other near enemy is a horrified anxiety or despondency. You think you're being compassionate but mostly it's like, oh my god. And here, the focus is not on the suffering that there, but rather the focus is on how we react to it, our fears. And so again, the separation of self and other and the focus rather than is on the other person's kind of below you or separate from you, the focus now is towards yourself, towards oneself and how it is for oneself. So there's experiencing suffering with resistance, trembling of the heart without resistance. And it's interesting to me that in Buddhism there's two forms of non-resisting trembling in the face of suffering. And one of them is compassion and I talked about that last week. But the other one is something which is called in Pali Samvega. And it's not exactly an easy word to translate into English. Samvega, as I understand it, is the quivering or the movement of the heart, the impact of suffering on the heart that inspires us, that ignites us to practice deeper awareness, that ignites us, that excites us, that inspires us, that fuels us, motivates with tremendous passion. The arising of passion is the meeting of suffering, recognizing suffering and with that being moved and inspired to deal with the root causes of suffering, to practice religiously, to confront the clinging to a sense of self, self-identity that some of our suffering might be born from, the suffering outside of us. The other people is often born to some degree from their clinging to a sense of self, their self-identity, their self-image. So Samvega is the religious inspiration, the passion to clarify what our attachments are, what our clingings are, what our fears are. It's to be inspired to aspire for a fearless state, to discover fearlessness instead of to see fear in the world and then know the possibility to be fearless and to be inspired towards to move out in that direction. That's called Samvega. So it's not compassionate response, but it's an inspired response, passionate response. The other then is Karuna, is compassionate, compassionate response, and that's when the heart quivers and it's not just simply feeling empathy but feeling that you want to help alleviate, you want to do something, you wish that person to be better. And there's two ways I can see of being compassionate. There's idealistic compassion and there's more kind of realistic compassion or actual. In idealistic compassion, with mindfulness practice, the idea is we learn to be with suffering without denial, without defensiveness, without distance, without fear, without aversion, without depression, tall order. But that's, you know, idealistically that's what we're supposed to do, that mindfulness is supposed to come to that. But you know, idealistic is always dangerous. I think the actual way practice works, in the, you know, as we negotiate our practice and the real messiness of our life in life, what we're learning is to be compassionate towards our tendencies of denial, defensiveness, distance, fear, depression. So rather than kind of beating ourselves up for not being able to do it, we see, you know, how it is for us to suffer and how it is to be afraid and feel compassionate for that movement, feel compassionate for us for not being able to, you know, be a superman, to do it perfectly. You know, who can? You know, all these things, even our denial and defensiveness, all those are movements of this sacred thing we call life. And we're all trying to cope and do the best we can, and so we can have a little bit softer around it, a little tender around that, forgiving, accepting how difficult it is. And it's okay not to do it right. And we keep compassionate towards our shortcomings. That was a beautiful quote by Pirwala Yatkahn. Overcome any bitterness that may have come because you are not up to the magnitude of pain that was entrusted to you. Like the mother of the world who carries the pain of the world in her heart, each of us is part of her heart and therefore endowed with a certain measure of cosmic pain. You are sharing the totality of that pain. You are called upon to meet it in joy instead of self-pity. Overcome any bitterness that may have come because you were not up to the magnitude of pain that was entrusted to you. That's compassion. It's okay. Compassion doesn't make us feel as if we're a victim in a situation. But rather, we can prepare our attention to learn to breathe softly in the situation of suffering, to be able to be with it, learn to breathe softly and feel the sacred breath. It's as if our breath, our conscious breath itself is a fresh breeze across the tender burning landscape of our inadequacies, our unworthiness, our self-criticism. Just to breathe gently through it and with it. Compassion, it's said, comes naturally when fear, greed, envy, despair, hope are understood carefully. Not necessarily gotten rid of, but when they're understood. So in mindfulness practice, we actually don't try to avoid these things, but we actually try to study them. We turn towards them we turn towards the very things that keep us from being compassionate. And in that study, eventually compassion is born. So you don't have to kind of make yourself compassionate, but it arises in the willingness to explore all that. Compassion is also the response to suffering. And to respond to suffering, which is a huge subject, because it is necessary to learn to listen very carefully to what's going on in the situation. As the quote says, we live in a world torn between wanting to listen to the sound of a flower growing and wanting to ignore the sound of the sky falling. By sometimes being sensitive enough to the first process, we acquire the energy necessary to prevent the second, to learn to listen. To listen deeply, there's a Buddhist center that I know that's going through a kind of somewhat major ethical crisis in someone's ethical behavior. Nothing original. And it was interesting to watch people's responses in the community. And there were some people who immediately got on the bandwagon. We have to do something and do this and that and let's get, this is terrible. And we have to kind of just immediately kind of got upset and angry and everybody was wrong. Let's tear down the walls and let's criticize everyone and let's get this guy out of the system and assigning blame and every possible direction. But overall, the people kept cool heads. And as they kept cool, it didn't rush to conclusions, but actually started listening carefully and understanding the situation better. Then they're starting to be born kind of wisdom and understanding and a sense of compassion for a lot of the people involved and for the whole community. That it's important to take the time to listen, not to jump to conclusions, to wait, to really listen carefully. So rather I announce with a couple of other quotes that address the question of how to respond to suffering besides just feeling compassion, but actually what to do is a huge, huge, huge question because it's so complicated. But these two stories are just two examples perhaps or two points to be made in this large question. Ruth Sanford wrote this on visiting South Africa in 1987. So it's very careful to listen carefully to what's really required. Maha Gusananda, who's one of the few Buddhist monks who survived the Holocaust in Cambodia, a tremendously wise man. I met him once, and it's just a tremendously inspiring, wise and peaceful. He wrote, wisdom must always be balanced by compassion, and compassion must always be balanced by wisdom. We cannot have peace without this balance. I would like to share a story to illustrate this. One day a violent dragon met the bodhisattva on the path. The bodhisattva said, my son, do not kill. If you keep the five precepts and care for all life, you will be happy. Hearing just these few words, the dragon became totally non-violent. The children who tended animals at the foot of the Himalayan mountains had been very afraid of the dragon. But when the dragon became gentle, they lost their fear and soon began to jump on him, pull his tail, and stuff stones and dirt into his mouth. After a while, the dragon could not eat, and he became very sick. The next time the dragon king met the bodhisattva, he shouted, you told me that if I kept the precepts and was compassionate, I would be happy. But now I suffer, and I'm not happy at all. The bodhisattva replied, my son, if you have compassion, morality, and virtue, you must also have wisdom and intelligence. This is the way to protect yourself. Next time the children make you suffer, show them your fire. After that, after that, they will trouble you no more. Yes. Yes. Q. Would you speak a little bit about why the compassion in terms of the something to death, the Richard Allen Davis system, and his major in court? A. Why is compassion? For me, the first thing I think that is essential is listening carefully to the suffering that's there. And I suspect that there's a tremendous amount of suffering in a situation. Certainly, we've exhibited, we've felt it, what he did in many different levels. But I suspect that there's a tremendous amount of suffering in him also. And I suspect very strongly that his acting out is acting out of a place of tremendous pain. And I think it's necessary to listen to that. If we want to have wise compassion in that situation, that's one of the ingredients. And if we can listen to that ingredient also, then I don't know how people respond then. But I think that listening has to be there. Q. I also saw the movie and watched the movie received a dead man walking, a non-essential worker sent to the last days of his prisoner's life, a corner execution, and just felt such admiration for his daily music. What she went through, the condemnation that she got from her, and she was willing to give it to his man. A. I've told several times here the story of, I won't tell it now, but the Anguly Mala. Buddhism has a story, it's somewhat mythic, is the way it's told. But it's a very important part of Buddhist lore, the story of this mass murderer who was converted and became enlightened actually. And that's kind of in the background, I think, for Buddhists, this idea that it's possible for people, even people who do horrendously evil things, to change. And so that's one of the other things to listen to. Is it possible to change? Is there that possibility? If there's possibility for radical transformative change, if that ingredient is added to the discussion, how do we respond then? So the question is, how do we respond when we have more information? Yes? Q. Getting back to the movie, I think, fit men walking. It was more complicated than just her being with a person with a murderer. She was also interacting with the victim's parents in those one moving scene where she goes up to one of the parents, as well, if you need anything, you know, I'm there for a year, and the guy was a Catholic himself. I said, that's really, really arrogant of you to do that. And she was struggling to come to terms with how to interact with the victim. And the victim was struggling and how to deal with their feelings and everything. It was really inspiring. A. Forget. Q. The thing I have found striking about David is that he did apologize to Paul's mother. A. And what's the difference? Q. How different she's been throughout this whole thing, and I promise honestly. She's not been learning it like you've been her, so saying that you should go down, that kind of thing. She's been very quiet, so from a little I know, more compassion. A. Yes, she did. Very early on, Ram Dass went and spent time with her. And they did a tremendous, I don't know exactly what they did, but Ram Dass, who's a great spiritual teacher, spent a lot of time working, being with her and I don't know, helping her come to terms with what had happened. And I suppose that had a lot to do with her responses. And I have no idea whether the father did similar work. The father went in the political direction, and the mother seems to have become very quiet and gone into more the spiritual side of it. And both are appropriate, but it depends how it's done. Yes. Q. Do you think that compassion is more available to women, especially mothers? A. That's a stereotype. Q. I don't mean it to be that way. A. No, I know you don't. Q. Okay. Let's say giving birth, the birth of the children, raising children, does that open the door of compassion? Anybody? A. Well, you were talking about the experience of birth. And Bruno Bezelheim, who was a psychoanalyst, said that mothers are extremely critical of their newborn soon after it's born. So I don't know why that happens. Q. Is that suffering? A. I don't know. We are seeking perfection. So even in the newborn? Q. I find that a large scale compassion comes easier, but in daily life, just interacting with the people that I deal with every single day. A lot of times I find myself at the end of the day really beating myself up over, you know, God, why did I behave this way towards this person? Let's say at work, you know, I struggle with, you know, or I got frustrated with this person, respond, or they can do something this way, or they couldn't do it as quickly as I needed, or, you know, whatever the case may be. But I feel like, you know, I struggle with how do I practice this just every day? Q. I think so. I think generalized compassion is not as significant for a maturation, for a mature person as the dealing with the details, the particulars. That's really the test. You know, how do you meet actual things? Because compassion involves a response. And, you know, voting for a different politician, well, that's an important response. But how do you meet the person at work who, you know, just got a phone call that their spouse just died in an automobile accident? How do you meet that? Or how do you meet someone at work who's always obnoxious, or this or that, or, you know, it's, you know, so there's willingness. Really, I think a lot of willingness to be present for the particulars is where I think the spiritual practice really has its home. And so to point it towards work where we spend a good part of our life is a good place to point it. Yes? Q. I guess I'll state about this a little bit. If environmentalism is a form of compassion, it might be worth reconsidering the wood fires, which are not only a large atmospheric pollutant, but which also are an immense source of radioactive pollution, because a lot of trees were grown during the 50s when the atmospheric tests were going on, and even as the grass became the source of strontium 90, the trees stored a lot of radioactivity, which was released on its ground. A. I never heard that. So that's true all over or certain places where there were more? Q. Wherever there was fallout, yes. A. Interesting. It's interesting in question how to respond, because there's often, in my opinion, there's often not a clear answer because there's so many factors going on. And so it's a matter of some sense weighing the different factors, different issues, and deciding for oneself what seems the most useful and most important response in a situation. So I'm certainly not going to answer. I mean, respond, I mean, decide. But what we have here is we have the suffering of air pollution, the suffering of perhaps radiation, and what that does to us. But we also have the suffering of the people who are homeless and their needs for warmth, and their needs for not just warmth, but also a homey environment. Because it's rather, some of these places they don't necessarily feel like a home to them. If you have fire, it makes a nice homey feeling, which is more important for some people than having a roof. There's a dry place. So what are the issues involved? And how do we balance and figure out? And that's always a difficult question. Many of us have made the decisions, you know, driving a car is a very polluting, very damaging thing all around. And many of us have done some kind of calculation and decided that somehow it makes sense, even though knowing how much damage we do. Some people made the calculation and said, it's not worth it. And I'm strong enough, I can bike and it works for me and I'm close enough. And so the interesting point for me is that it's not just one thing. There's many factors we have to listen to and take into account. I wanted to add to that. I think when we sit out to help people, the wisdom of the other side of compassion is it's like stepping into a spider's whip. There are many sticky lines to many other situations. So that when you step out towards a person or towards the situation to realize that the reverberations from your step everywhere. So as it's a good, the caution is to step quietly, or as gently as you can and work your way into a situation, working with another person or a situation and let it come to you rather than imposing yourself on it. So listening deeply. So is it balance between wisdom and compassion? You need to have both. And the wisdom side is it's either listens or looks or studies situation. It doesn't react, but rather remains open to explore it, to understand it. Yes. I was thinking about that and thinking about once you were talking about one has sort of separation in quality, you don't think so and the other not so. So one of the things that we're thinking about is in relationships where it's set up that there is an inequality. People come to you as a teacher and they have some expectation, perhaps they have some expertise and they come to you and say something. How do you, if you do, how do you then shift back from where you are so that you're there is a way of compassion, you can be of service and not helping you fix the issue? I don't have a simple answer. I just do my best. I don't really, you know, I just try my best. I try to be very careful, be aware of what my reactions and responses are and what I'm thinking, you know, with someone or what I'm feeling. And paying attention to that often gives me a lot of information. And then I know how I'm responding, know what my body is doing and things like that. And then from that I can make a decision, you know, knowing that, oh, now this is not an appropriate way of being. This response is really making me separate. So I'll let go of that or I'll turn towards the person again or I'll listen again from my body or listen to my gut or something, which is where, you know, if I listen to my body, for me, when I'm talking, when I'm, you ask about me personally, when I'm meeting with people in interviews, there's, for me, there's an intuitive quality to what I do. And so it kind of comes out of my body. It's kind of sometimes a surprise to me what comes out of my mouth. And if I could kind of stay at that point, if I can stay in that intuitive place, then I think there isn't much sense of separation. But when I started getting caught up in ideas or if I start feeling ill at ease in the situation, that's when I want to try to fix it. So if I could notice difference between being ill at ease and being at ease in the situation, maybe I can catch the difference. I mean, I don't know. I don't have a good answer. Yes. And sometimes it's because sometimes people are ill at ease themselves to be in proximity to the suffering and the pain. And so they either they brush it off in some way like that, or they give excuses for it. You know, they excuse the person for what they've done, or they excuse the situation, or they find excuses for it to make it better, or kind of look at it to a different point of view. And that's very painful to do that, because you're not really seeing the person and people and really who they are. Sometimes people do it because they're ill at ease, but it's not so much to ill at ease to be suffering. But people are sticky. And it's not always so easy. If you open up and start to go to help or go to be compassionate someone, you don't necessarily mess with another person who's also going to say, well, that's very nice. Rather you mess with a person who's kind of like, I want more. And so you people hold back because they're afraid of, they could be either afraid or they could be wise about what they're getting themselves involved in. Or they'll mess with someone who says, I don't want any. Or some people who don't want any. Isn't it also clear that it's contagious? People don't want to hear something. That it's contagious. How is it contagious? How is it transmitted? Oh, this might happen to me too. Uh-oh. I don't think it is, but I think that some people don't want to hear it. Because it's, oh, this might happen to me. Do other people feel that? Is that common? I have a little story for that. If I went down to Florida with my mother when she was very, very elderly, and mostly among people who were over 80, and they gave a little party for her when she was going to leave, and somebody at the party went down with a heart attack. And I went to help in another grandson, I think, if somebody was a doctor and we were working with the people. And I looked up at one moment, and there was a circle of people around us who would not move into the situation. And I looked and I saw in their eyes, only, they thought it isn't me. Not, you know, not connecting with this person, but very definitely separating themselves from it. It's fear, it's not contagious because it really can happen. Could be. So we should have lots of compassion for our fear. Lots of compassion for our aversion. Lots of compassion. Oh, just, you can never have too much compassion. But remember the wisdom. Remember to listen to. Okay, last one, and then we should go home. A truthless compassion, he says. And ruthless is a good word because ruthless, if you look up the dictionary with ruthless means, it means without mercy. The word that he uses that I like is compassion and emptiness. Because when you talk about listening, you talk about why is compassion, you're really talking about somebody going into a situation without bringing in their own ideas or problems. You can't help other people if you bring in their own problems. So that's in some ways the ideal, and the actual is, it's complicated for us. And so even more so, we need compassion for even our shortcomings, rather than say, oh, I can't do it because I can't do it right. But yeah, it's emptiness and compassion. Ruthless compassion. So, thank you all. Good night.
