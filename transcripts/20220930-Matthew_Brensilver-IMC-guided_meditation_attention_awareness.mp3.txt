 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome, welcome folks. Yeah, nice to be with you. I see the names over there. Let's meditate. And just immediately when you hear that cue, let's meditate. And just notice what you do to move from the mode of chatting with friends to beginning formal practice. Maybe you do need to do some of the things you do, but maybe not others. And so we begin by being very natural at this moment. Not forcing us into some slot that we think is meditation. Just very natural, certain kind of trust that the ingredients or wisdom, love, are already here. And so we begin by being very natural at this moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We relax whatever can be relaxed. Let go whatever can we let go. Our clinging necessitates a lot of agitation in our attention. As we begin to make peace with the imperfection of the moment, to not be constantly seduced by the thought that something could get better. So we make this kind of peace, the attention system settles, the spotlight of attention that illuminates phenomena, the breath, the body, sound, whatever starts to glide more smoothly. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sometimes we relinquish control even further, not even trying to direct the spotlight of attention anywhere. Come to rest back in awareness. So if I told you to stop being aware, you couldn't do it. Whatever you cannot stop, rest there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The attentional spotlight can be used for developing samadhi stillness, focusing the attention, or the attentional spotlight also necessary for clinging.
