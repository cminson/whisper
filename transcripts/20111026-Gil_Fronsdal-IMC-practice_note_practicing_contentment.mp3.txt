Practice Note : Practicing  Contentment

In terms of practice, one of the important supports for 
mindfulness  – which  sets a context for it and makes it 
easier to be in the present mome nt – is to be content. 
There is both wise and unwise contentment . But there 
has to be some kind of contentment that helps support 
us. We’re  content to be here  and to practice 
mindfulness . We’re not caught up with the idea that the 
grass is greener somewhere else . We’re not caught with 
ideas that things are so bad for us that we can’t 
practice , that  this is hopeless, or we’re so restless 
because we’re caught up in desires and discontent.  
 
As you sit here and practice this morning,  you might 
look at whether there is some healthy, appropriate way 
to use the experience, feeling  and attitude of 
contentment : to be content to be here today , content to 
be practicing with the challenges you have if you have 
challenges, or content to be practicing with the joys if 
there are joys as your practice , and content  with the 
level of concentration  and mindfulness you have  – as 
opposed to being discontented with how poor your 
concentration and mindfulness are. You can be content  
with knowing that you’re practicing or in training to develop and grow it, rather than being discontented with 
how you feel about yourself . You can be content  that 
you’re on a path to clarify and settle that, and  to come to 
peace.  
 
There are  many ways to find contentment . But,  if there 
is some sense of being here and being content with this 
situation here and now, then it’s a lot eas ier for the mind 
to settle, to be willing to be here , to practice  and be 
mindful. So , if that’s interest ing for you, I encourage you 
to explore contentment as you walk and sit to the 
degree it helps you to be quieter, stiller , and more 
engaged here and now  – but not  so much that you’re 
involved in more and more thoughts.  
 
If this exercise to explore content ment reveals that 
you’re totally discontented, that’s good too , so that you 
discover and see it . Then,  what you might do is to bring 
mindfulness to your discontent and see what’s go ing on 
there in some deeper way. Hopefully you will be very 
contented  to ex plore your discontent.  
 
Thank you.
