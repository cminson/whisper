So, for this evening's reflection, I'd like to say a couple words first and offer a poem or two.
As we collect ourselves, as we come together, both in community and in our bodies, as we collect ourselves and practice.
Towards the end of the day of inclining our hearts, inclining our minds, towards kindness, towards goodwill,
in challenging areas, whether it might be towards ourselves, others, perhaps forgiveness or the need for it arises.
Where metta, where metta love, care, kindness meets, meets what is, meets perhaps dukkha meets challenges,
to appreciate that we are here, that we are still here.
Yay! Another day of practice. Yay!
You're here, we're here, as much as you needed to step in or out, to take care of yourself, to care of your body,
to care of your heart, to care of others, it's okay, it's okay.
Giving yourself permission, it's okay, it's okay.
Continuing to widen, widen the circles, widen the circles of care, of care.
So, this poem I'd like to share with you is one that is by Rilke, and it's from Rilke's book of ours, Love Poems to God.
And it's called, I live my life, I live my life, and it goes like this, let it drop into your body, see what resonates.
I live my life in widening circles, I live my life in widening circles,
that reach out across the world, I live my life in widening circles,
that reach out across the world, I may never, I may not ever complete the last one,
but I give myself to it.
I live my life in widening circles, that reach out across the world,
I may not ever complete the last one, but I give myself to it.
It describes this practice of loving kindness as we expand living our life in widening circles.
We may or may not reach the last circles, but we give our hearts, we give ourselves to it wholeheartedly.
It's our way of cultivating our being as the way of being in the world, showing up being of service.
I'll read it one last time before going into silence.
I live my life in widening circles, that reach out across the world.
I may not ever complete the last one, but I give myself to it.
Let's sit together in silence.
