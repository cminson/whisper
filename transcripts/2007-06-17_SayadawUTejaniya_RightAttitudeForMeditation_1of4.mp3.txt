Because there are a lot of new people today, he's just going to do a brief introduction
again to the way he teaches meditation.
He says, before we even start meditation, it's good if we know some right information
about the important things that affect our meditation.
The first thing is to note that meditation is really the work of the mind and it is a
work of learning how to improve the quality of our mind.
So because we use this mind to work at itself, he says he's going to talk a lot about the
mind.
In meditation, he says there are the objects that we observe and the mind with which we
observe the objects and he says between these two, the mind itself is actually more important.
You can try the simple exercise, put our hands together.
Do you know that your hands are touching?
Yes?
And why do you know your hands are touching?
What is the mind doing?
So he says the object might be there, but if your mind is not here, you're lost in thought.
You won't know what's happening here, but if you pay attention, you'll know what's happening.
So this is just a demonstration to show that there can be an object, but between the object
and the mind, the presence of the mind is more important.
Is this so?
Do all of us know that we have a mind?
Yes?
Yes?
But although we know we have a mind, we're actually not very clear about what the mind
is.
If he asks you what mind do you know, how would you answer him?
So the demonstration he gave just now is because he wanted to show you how the mind
works when it's here or not here.
He says so some of us can actually, maybe all of us here, can actually know that the
mind is paying attention.
You can now touch something and see whether you can notice that the mind is paying attention.
If you can see that the mind is doing this work of paying attention, you can even start
meditating by being aware of that, that mind that's paying attention.
But sometimes some people are not able to notice that mind that is paying attention.
Then we just start by paying attention to the object itself that the mind is paying attention
to.
He says there are many different kinds of people and some people just find it much easier
to notice the mind.
And for these people he said they can start meditating by looking at the mind, watching
the mind.
Some people find it more difficult.
He says then these people can start meditation by paying attention to objects in the beginning.
He says but this information is very important because he says when we've been meditating
for some time, even if we start with the object, he says when we've been practicing for some
time and we have this information, at some point you need to know that you will get to
this point where you can notice the mind too.
He said at some point you have to shift towards the mind.
If you just stay at watching the objects only and never seeing what's happening in the mind,
he says progress in meditation actually can't go very far.
So now he's saying you can notice the mind paying attention.
But does paying attention alone mean that you're meditating?
He says not yet, just paying attention alone not yet.
He says in the back of that mind that's paying attention he says the mind has to have the
right ideas, the right point of view, the right attitude, the right thoughts and information
about meditation.
So he says what becomes more important is not just to meditate but to know how the mind
is doing its meditation.
With what attitude is the mind meditating?
If the attitude is wrong then everything becomes wrong.
He says remember it's not you that is meditating, it's those ideas and attitudes and beliefs
that are doing the meditation and so if those ideas, attitudes and beliefs are wrong then
wrong meditation is going to happen.
So we need to recognize what wrong meditation is to get to right meditation.
So you have lots of expectation of the practice, is that right practice?
You get a headache.
Very dissatisfied with what you're experiencing, is that right practice?
You don't know what to do.
So very basically if there's greed, aversion, delusion then you can say the practice is
wrong practice.
He says when we practice meditation does it give us peace and happiness or do we suffer?
He says so if we practice in the wrong way it brings suffering and we become miserable
because we're doing the wrong practice.
When we do right practice he says it not only brings a feeling of well-being to the mind
and the body, he also developed more wisdom.
So the main thrust of what he's always trying to present to people is that when we practice
meditation we need to have the right attitude towards meditation by having the right understanding
and the right information about what meditation is.
He says very often yogis have difficulty in meditation, they become miserable while meditating
and so on because they don't recognize the expectation that is operating.
They don't recognize the dissatisfaction from which they're operating.
They don't recognize that they don't know what to do but they're just kind of thrashing
about trying to do something.
So we need this information so that when we're trying to meditate we can check and see what
is happening and know what to do.
So he'll try and tell you now as much as he can what he remembers in this moment about
what he feels is important for meditation, that's what he said.
So he'll tell you about the five faculties.
These are five qualities of mind that the mind actually uses to meditate with.
We need to know the definition, the meaning of these five words that we hear in order
to know how to meditate.
These five words are awareness, they're qualities in the mind actually, awareness, effort, samadhi
which is often translated as concentration but he'll redefine it for you, faith or confidence
and wisdom.
So meditation is the using of these five qualities of mind and using them and that is meditation.
These are good qualities of mind and cultivating these qualities of mind by using them is what
meditation is.
So he says, you know, it's really not about the objects that we observe.
You can use any objects as a stepping stone to using these qualities.
So the definition of that word awareness is quality of the mind called awareness is actually
it's the quality of not forgetting.
So awareness or mindfulness is not talking about focusing on something, it's the quality
of not forgetting, it's not forgetting the right object and the right object is everything
that's happening in this mind and this body.
So if you want a simple way to remember it, it means don't forget to watch yourself.
He says, do we need to use a lot of energy to not forget?
So he'll really try to explain to you why it's not necessary to use a lot of energy
to meditate and because we don't need to use a lot of energy in order to meditate effectively
that's why he's saying don't use so much energy.
Because do you know why we use a lot of energy usually?
When we want something we use a lot of energy, when we don't like something we use a lot
of energy, when we don't know what to do we use a lot of energy.
He says, so that's why he says you don't need a lot of energy if you are even thinking
about yourself at those times there is awareness, awareness is present and in fact he says
everybody already has awareness, it's not that we don't have awareness to begin with,
what we're doing is cultivating this quality that already exists in the mind to make it
better and better.
You have it, it's not that we don't have it.
So if you think about yourself or ask yourself a question like what am I feeling, what's
happening now in the mind?
Awareness is already present, what am I doing?
He said the moment you think that question, awareness is already present.
He uses this body language to explain to teenagers the concept of awareness and he does this.
He says usually our minds are like this and when you do awareness you do this.
So there's not need to use a lot of energy.
If you're thinking about yourself all the time, awareness is here so no need to use energy.
Number one, second quality is called samadhi and if we want to use the word concentration
as a translation he says he has this question for you.
When you try to concentrate on something does it mean that you always develop concentration
just because you're concentrating on something?
Lots of people just get headaches.
So the meaning of samadhi is the quality of mind that is relaxed, peaceful, steady, stable.
That's having samadhi.
If you have that quality in the mind, that sort of quality in the mind, that's enough
samadhi.
He says you don't have to be focusing or concentrating to have samadhi.
You might have heard of two different kinds of meditations, samatha and vipassana.
One is concentration meditation and insight meditation and for those concentration meditations
maybe there is a requirement to focus and pay attention to one thing but he says for
vipassana meditation that sort of samadhi is not necessary.
A momentary attention is all that's needed.
He says in the kind of concentration that we develop from concentration meditations
we focus or concentrate on one thing and develop concentration.
That's one kind of concentration he says.
But the word samadhi in insight meditation only means the kind of stability the mind
has because the mind understands something, either it has the right understanding about
something because of right information and right knowledge so it can think in a rational
and logical way or because the mind has understood something for itself and therefore is okay
with this.
Then the mind is not reacting to what is happening.
There is no greed orversion developing towards the situation and therefore the mind is stable
and from that sort of stability of mind he says more wisdom can arise, insight can arise
and he says real samadhi, samadhi really comes only because of right attitude.
Right attitude is right thinking which is based in wisdom.
He says just because we focus and force ourselves hard to look at something doesn't mean samadhi
is going to come.
Only right understanding and right attitude brings samadhi stability.
The other reason for samadhi to develop is continuity of awareness that develops samadhi
too.
The third quality is right effort and right effort is not about efforting like using energy
of the body.
He says it's really a quality of mind and it's the sense of patience and perseverance
and that's right effort.
Vipassana is a long term practice, it's not a short term practice and since you're going
to do this consistently on a daily basis and trying to keep it consistently going all day
long and for a very long time he says you can't use too much energy, you need to use
only as much as you can but keep putting it in forever and understanding that this work
is actually beneficial for you you do it relentlessly.
If you use a lot of energy you can't keep it up for too long.
The fourth quality is faith or confidence and he's really talking about faith or confidence
in yourself and the work that you're doing.
What is the benefit of doing this work?
If you recognize the benefits of the work for yourself he says then your confidence in
the work will grow.
He says so progress in meditation is measured by whether these qualities are growing in
the mind.
If these qualities are getting stronger in the mind the meditation is working well for
you.
The last quality is wisdom or understanding and in talking about wisdom he is not talking
about the insights that are associated with Vipassana practice, higher insights.
He's talking about the very common wisdoms of understanding how to practice in an effective
way and a wise way.
Do we know what is right practice, how to do right practice and are we skillful at it?
These are wisdoms.
If we don't have the wisdom of how to do something in the right effective wise ways he says then
the results of that right practice which is insight is not going to come.
He says what practice is meditation, the body or the mind?
So we use this mind to meditate but we don't know, we don't recognize how much energy the
mind is using to try to meditate.
We don't recognize the beliefs from which the mind is meditating.
We don't recognize the attitudes that are present while we're trying to meditate.
We don't recognize what the mind is thinking which is affecting the attitudes and beliefs
that we're practicing.
He says how can we become skillful at the practice if we don't recognize these things?
We just have good meditation, bad meditation and we just finish with that.
He says if we understand the practice, we are skillful at the practice, we know what right
practice is then he says practice is always good.
Last three important points, number one is continuity of awareness is very important.
He says because we're not required to use a lot of energy but what we want to do as
much as possible, only a sufficient amount of energy to keep it going for a long time,
forever, all the time consistently and build up a natural momentum from doing it consistently.
So what you want to grow is the quality of dhamma which means the quality of nature.
Nature grows its quality, the nature of the mind that is aware becomes stronger.
It's naturally aware more and more.
Not the kind of awareness that we are doing personally, that's my meditation but an energy
that is natural.
He says for most yogis they try to use a lot of energy in a short period of time and get
the most results from it.
But he says the main key to the success of vipassana meditation is to do it all the time.
Because vipassana is a learning process, the more you work at it, the more you research
and examine and investigate, the more your wisdom grows.
He says it's only when you're very familiar with close to and in contact with a subject
all the time that you understand it more and more deeply.
So if he asks you when is time for meditation, what would you say all the time, and when
is now?
Now is whole.
Now and after now is still now and now and it's only when the awareness actually becomes
more continuous.
He says that we begin to be able to see whole processes unfold and when we see whole processes
unfold, more understanding arises.
So the posture is really not important for meditation.
It's not the main thing that makes the meditation.
It's really these qualities of mind that need to be working to make it meditation.
So the mind needs to be awake, aware, alert.
You can practice in any posture you like, he's a chooser posture that works for you.
There was a yogi who came to the center and she was always complaining of so much pain
in her sitting meditation.
She's always pained, so much pain.
And so finally he asked her, he said, what work do you do?
And she was a nurse.
She did a lot of standing in the hospital, having to sit for such a long time was not
suitable for her body, she just wasn't used to it.
So he told her to do standing meditation, she was great after that.
So the posture is not important.
What's important is for awareness to be there, for samadhi to be established, for wisdom
to be there.
He said, is it important to sit or to have awareness and wisdom?
He says, so whether you sit or walk or eat or go or come, he says, it's important to
have awareness and wisdom in every moment.
That's called practicing satipatana.
That's called mindfulness meditation.
He says, so the second important point is that you don't need to use a lot of energy
when you meditate, you don't need to focus very much.
He does not like to use these English words to refer to meditation practice.
Their focus, penetrate and concentrate.
The words he prefers to use are words like observe, recognize, notice, watch, be with
it, things like that.
Because the energy is just so different.
He says, you need to be watching all day long.
He says, you can't be concentrating all day long.
That's why he defined it as don't forget to watch yourself.
He says, if we just don't forget, that's good enough.
He says, and please persevere over a long term.
He said, that mind becomes really strong.
When you don't put in any energy, but an energy and momentum develops and without your
putting in effort, there's a strong energy.
That's what you call really strong energy.
He refers to it as a snowball reaction.
He means like a snowball running down the hill.
He says, would you all just become conscious of yourself right now?
Isn't there so many things that you can notice in the body?
Touching sensations, temperature, sound, many, many sense objects.
And how much energy do we need to notice these?
Is it difficult, tiring?
Can you be like this all day long?
Because don't forget, that's good enough.
There is one thing he likes to tell Yogis though.
He says, you know, don't practice in any way that's going to make you tired or miserable.
Relax, practice in comfort and at ease, but he says, don't ever stop.
And the last thing is right view, and this is really very important.
When you practice Vipassana meditation, he says this right view is very, very important.
He says, how should we regard these objects that we are observing?
When we observe ourselves, there's mainly just body sensations, feelings and mental
activities.
But are you the only person who experiences these things, these phenomena?
Everybody can experience these phenomena.
So he says, regard all these phenomena as qualities of nature, their universal qualities
that everybody experiences, and don't identify them with me.
Remember, they're just forces of nature at work.
When you're angry and you think, I'm so angry, does that make the anger go, become less or
does it make the anger increase?
This is why anger increases, is because we have the wrong view of it.
Anger is a natural force, is a quality, a universal quality, but we identified them with me.
He says, so when you're angry, he said, if you want to meditate with it, first you have
to remind yourself and really see that the mind understands and can regard this as a
force of nature or a universal quality.
And when the mind can take that view towards it, then bring awareness to it, then you can
meditate with it.
He said, if you don't have the right view first and you just try to be aware of it,
he says, your mind will get sucked into it, it will participate in it, and it will suffer
more.
For example, he says, when it's hot, instead of seeing that heat, instead of regarding
heat as a natural quality, he says, what people do is my hand is hot or my body is hot.
He says, but when the heat disappears, does the hand go with it?
Does the body disappear?
So would it be right to say the hand is hot?
So hotness is heat is a quality of nature, a universal quality.
So that's what he means by right view.
If it's wrong view, we're completely identified with the experience.
So when there's wrong view, he says, the mind will get involved in it, it will participate,
it will believe in it, and it will suffer from it.
That's why it's only when there's right view present and awareness with it that you can
call it right awareness.
He says, the whole definition, the very definition of the word vpasana is special view, extraordinary
view.
He says, and our ordinary view, our whole lives, we just have this ordinary view.
He says, now when practicing vpasana, you're going to try and remember to see it from a
different view, and the different view is to see it as nature.
Our ordinary view is to see it as me.
So these are basically his basic instructions, and it's regardless of whether you sit, walk,
talk, or whatever.
