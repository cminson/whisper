Thank you, Diana. 
Thank you. 
It's great. 
And you'll see today we'll keep adding and interrupting and interjecting. 
Diana will try to weave this together. 
So it'll be one teacher with two voices. 
I don't know. 
We'll see how that goes, anyway. 
So I'll just start by asking you to check in to see how your heart is today in this moment. 
Your heart might be heavy, might be light, might be peaceful, might be joyous, or many, many varieties. 
I named those because those are some of the spaces my heart has been. 
And heavy yesterday this morning was calm. 
And in a moment I'm going to unmute everyone and popcorn style. 
If you would say a word or a very phrase, how are you this morning? I don't know is a fine thing to share also, or confused, or whatever it might come. 
Just unmuted everyone. 
So please, how is your heart this morning? Grateful.

Thank you. 
Thank you all. 
Thank you for sharing how your heart is this morning. 
Range of sad, heavy, confused, broken-hearted. 
Thank you to everyone again. 
To grateful and peaceful, calm, again we have multiple grateful and warming up. 
So there is a range, of course, and everything is welcome. 
Everything is welcome. 
Exactly as it is, as it needs to be. 
Your heart doesn't have to be any other way. 
Come as you are to metta practice. 
Come exactly as you are. 
Heavy, broken-hearted, sad, joyous, uplifted, warm, sense of community, grateful, whatever it is. 
Friendliness, metta, friendliness, goodwill, for exactly how your heart is right now, in this moment. 
So, in the practice of metta, and especially today, the practice of the Brahma-Viharas in general, the Four Heavenly Abodes, first of all, we start where we are, and we start by embodying ourselves, by planting ourselves in the body, by settling ourselves in the embodiment, in the stability of being here and being here right now. 
Connecting, connecting, stabilizing, someone mentioned the breath, grateful for the breath, grateful for the breath, grateful for the body, the sense of stability, and then opening up to whatever is arising, with friendliness, with kindness. 
And for the first section of today, this morning, the guided meditation I will do, and much of the teaching I will do will be actually part of the guided meditation, but just to say what I'll be touching into this morning, to start, to warm up, to warm up our heart, is to start with metta, care, kindness, for people that we care about, for dear beings, for people who are dear to us, as a way to prime the heart. 
It turns out for many, for many of us, starting there is easiest. 
And given how the conditions of the world are right now, as we do the practice of friendliness, warm-heartedness, care, it is quite normal for also acknowledgement of suffering to come through our hearts today, because our loved ones, our people whom we care about, we probably have a sense of concern and care for them. 
Maybe they are suffering too, maybe they're challenges they're having. 
So after doing a guided meditation, doing a guided meditation on metta will also bring in compassion, meditation. 
So let me just take a couple of minutes to tell you how they are distinguished. 
So metta, as you well know, is an expression of care, kindness, warmth, friendliness. 
And for example, when you pass someone by in the street and you smile, that smile is an expression of your metta, is an expression of your friendliness for the other person. 
Smile, maybe you greet them, maybe you say hello, or when you say hello to a cashier somewhere you're shopping. 
So very simple, just friendliness, care. 
And if you think of that just simple kindness, friendliness, goodwill, that can be expressed in the traditional phrases, wishing someone safety, may you be safe, may you be happy, may you be healthy, may your life have ease. 
So a sense of friendliness that meets someone who's in a neutral state. 
Now if that sense of friendliness, goodwill, meets a being in a challenging time where this being is having a difficult time, is suffering, then that friendliness, that kindness expresses itself as compassion. 
So care plus pain, so metta, love, whatever you want to call it, metta plus pain, suffering. 
When metta holds suffering, it expresses itself as compassion, the practice of compassion. 
And there is a sense in the heart that the heart, the warmth, the care, the love is soothing, is touching, is embracing the challenge, the pain that's coming up. 
So the phrases might be something like, may you have ease in the midst of your pain, may you have ease in your suffering, may you be free from your suffering, I wish you peace, I wish you ease, I care about you, I care about your suffering, which is variations. 
We'll both offer different variations and you can pick and choose. 
Or maybe no words come up for you, which is fine too, but a sense of acknowledging the pain without falling into it, without what's called empathetic distress, without bobbing into the waves with the person who's suffering and over identifying with the pain itself. 
And just to say if that should happen, again, these are really, really unusual times, to say if that should happen, if you find yourself hurting while you're holding another person's suffering or pain with care, at that time, please turn your metta and care, your compassion to yourself because you are the one who is suffering at that moment to hold yourself with care, holding yourself with ease and gentleness and love. 
And when there is stability in your heart, then maybe turning back, if it feels appropriate to your beloved person, your easy person. 
So I say that because it's important for you to know that you're going to be, even though you will try to perhaps follow the guided meditation, but if something different comes up for you, if your own pain comes up for you, be your own inner Dharma coach and turn your goodwill towards yourself. 
Okay, I just want to make sure that's very clear. 
So today, whatever the guidance is, whatever the instructions are, at any point if you find yourself hurting and in distress, yourself becomes the object of your metta, of your compassion, of your care. 
I just want to make sure that is clear. 
So any questions about that, anything not clear, you're welcome to unmute yourself or raise your hand and ask a question. 
Going once, folks, going twice. 
Okay, alright. 
So I'm assuming that it's very clear that at any point please metta for self, care for self, compassion for self. 
This is a challenging time, no matter what the guided meditation instructions might be. 
Okay, so if you agree, please raise your right hand. 
Yes, I hear you. 
Got this. 
Got the permission. 
You have the permission. 
Oh, turn to yourself. 
Beautiful. 
Great. 
Lovely. 
So with that, I would like to start with the guided meditation at this point. 
I think that's enough blah blah talking from my end. 
The more instructions will come through the guidance. 
So I'd like to ask you to make yourself comfortable right now as we're going to start the formal guided meditation, the first one. 
And if you need to move right now to make yourself comfortable, please, please do that. 
Take care of your body. 
And wherever you're sitting, actually first let's just move your body a little bit. 
See your body needs right now before settling. 
Maybe moving your arms, maybe moving your neck a little bit. 
Some of you might even be called to stand up. 
And I feel called to stand up for a moment there. 
You can do that anytime. 
Taking care of your body. 
I like to model taking care of body today. 
We're going to do this throughout the day. 
Just and as you move, as you listen to your body, let this movement, let this expression of care, let this be an expression of care for your body, this movement. 
It's part of our meditation. 
It's part of our expression of care. 
Maybe even give yourself a little hug, both stretching your upper arm if it feels right for you. 
And also just touching this body and embracing yourself. 
Hi, dear one. 
Good morning. 
Good afternoon. 
Whatever your time zone is. 
Thank you for showing up. 
Thank you for practicing. 
And whenever you're ready, settling. 
Settling in your chair or your cushion. 
Or if you choose to do standing meditation. 
That's fine too. 
Settling. 
And allowing your back to be straight. 
Having a sense of integrity. 
Your body having a sense of integrity. 
Ah. 
Imagining that there is an invisible string connected to the top of your head, pulling you out vertebrae by vertebrae. 
Ah, so your spine is straightening without you even trying. 
And then the rest of your body, all your muscles can relax. 
Can put down their weight. 
You don't have to work hard at all. 
Your spine is holding you up and letting. 
Ah. 
With each out breath, letting your whole body, all your muscles to relax, to let go. 
And with each out breath, settling and letting go some more. 
Relaxing, softening, checking in with different parts of the body. 
Ah, the parts of the body that you know you tend to hold tension. 
Maybe your jaw. 
Maybe your shoulders, your neck, your chest, or your abdomen. 
Sit bones, your hands, your feet, face, wherever it might be. 
Ah, your eyes, forehead. 
Challenging yourself, asking yourself, can I let go of a little more tension? Hey, I think my body is perfectly relaxed. 
No tension. 
Hey, can I let go of a little more tension? Relax into myself a little more at the end of the next out breath. 
Drop that in as a little challenge and see if it's possible. 
And let yourself be surprised as you continue to land, land more deeply. 
Let go of more and more tension as if the cells of your body are opening up, freeing up, giving up, offering up. 
Ah, I need tightness holding. 
With hands and landing, landing. 
Ah. 
And groundedness and stability and spaciousness and peace. 
Ah. 
Continuing to let go of tension, landing. 
And when you feel you've landed the sense of openness, maybe even still one more time, with the out breath, letting go some more, some more, letting go of the tension some more, letting your body from the inside become probably relaxed, open and soft. 
No need for any tension, letting go of tension, letting go of thoughts in this moment, letting go of plans, memories. 
This moment just taking refuge, taking refuge in the simplicity of this moment, just sitting and breathing. 
Just sitting and breathing in order to have more stability, groundedness, spaciousness, to be available for yourself and for the world, taking this moment away from the world, this moment of refuge in the body, in the breath. 
Just receiving the breath, the in breath and the out breath. 
Could be noises outside, listening to the stillness inside. 
There is stillness inside, groundedness. 
And receiving, receiving each in breath and out breath as a friend, as a soothing lullaby, receiving the sensations of the breath, in the body, the framework of the body, maybe in the abdomen today, just so that it helps you settle in ground, more deeply into your sit bones, or maybe feeling, receiving the movement, the joyous movement of the breath throughout the body, through all the way through your feet, your hands, and your face. 
And if that feels too unsettling or expansive, bring it back to feeling the breath in the abdomen, very close to lower abdomen in your sit bones, grounding, settling. 
No. 
And from this space of stability, from this place of groundedness, as much groundedness as there is this place of refuge, having established this first, as much as possible, as much as available this morning, turning our minds, our hearts, to care, to friendliness and goodwill, and to support, to prime the heart, invite you to bring to mind someone to whom you care, someone to whom you have goodwill, friendliness, care, meta, love, kindness. 
Maybe when you think of this being, a smile shows up on your face. 
It could be a child, a pet, any being in your life who's easy, not complicated, the flow of friendliness, and good wishes, bringing them to your mind's eye. 
If you're visual, especially what they look like as if they're in front of you, the way they smile and move around or act. 
Or maybe using other senses, their felt sense, what it feels like to be with them, the sense of this person, maybe their smell, to conjure up. 
In other words, conjure up, the felt sense of this person, this being, this being. 
So having established that as number one, now noticing as you conjure them up what comes up for you in your heart, in your body. 
Again, maybe a smile shows up, maybe just a sense of warmth in your heart, a sense of recognition or safety, maybe there's a sense of ease, gladness, however mild it might be. 
Please recognize that as Mehta, however subtle it might be for you. 
Maybe it's just a sense of connection that you have with this being, a sense of recognition. 
Let that come from their felt sense, their image. 
So number one, felt sense or image, number two, it's noticing what's coming up for you in your body and heart. 
And number three, if you wish, allow the phrases of Mehta to flow out of the feeling, however subtle it might be. 
And I'll offer the traditional phrases if you have your own, you can use them. 
May you be safe from inner and outer harm, dear one. 
Keeping their image in mind, the felt sense in your heart. 
May you be happy and have joy in your heart, dear one, you can add their name if you wish to make it more personal, dear so and so. 
May you be healthy and strong, dear so and so. 
And may your life flow with ease, dear so and so. 
May you be safe from inner and outer harm. 
May you be healthy and strong. 
And may your life flow with ease. 
I'll offer the shorter version. 
Also, may you be safe. 
May you be happy. 
May you be healthy. 
May you have ease. 
May you be reciting phrases as a thread of continuity in this practice while you keep up the image, the felt sense of the being and notice the sensations that might come up for you. 
The three legs of the metastual, the image, felt sense, feelings and phrases that can support the practice, continuity. 
May you be safe. 
May you be happy. 
May you be healthy and have ease. 
I like putting my palm, my hand in the middle of my chest, my heart center to connect with my intention. 
I invite you to do that, experiment with that, just really connect with yourself as you're doing this practice with your goodwill, your intention flowing. 
And you're welcome to stay with this practice of metagoodwill for this dear being. 
Or if you notice, if this being right now, there is some suffering or some impact. 
But you're aware of some challenge or difficulty for them arising, perhaps, either physically, emotionally, economically. 
But anyway, allowing the sense of friendliness to acknowledge, to acknowledge the challenge, to hold the challenge. 
That's the way the practice of meta-becoming, practice of karuna, compassion. 
But you can still continue, if you wish, with the metafraises and yet acknowledging the challenge, the difficulty, or you can use different phrases. 
May you be free from your challenge. 
I wish you ease, I wish you peace with your difficulty, with your challenge in the midst of this. 
I care for you. 
I acknowledge that this might be a hard time, this is a hard time. 
I care for you. 
I wish you ease. 
And well-being in the midst of this all. 
I wish you peace. 
May you have peace, may you have ease. 
Feel free to use any of the variations I offered, starting with May or I, or anything that works for you. 
Making sure that you're rooted in the good will, embodied in the good will and the warmth. 
So the heart doesn't fall into empathic distress by focusing on the pain and suffering too much. 
Just as balanced, this acknowledgement of suffering balanced with your care, good will, warmth. 
I wish you well, may you have peace. 
And for the last moments of this practice period, seeing what your heart needs, maybe going back to Metta, or maybe Metta or Compassion for yourself, holding yourself with kindness and good will. 
Thank you. 
Diana, would you like to do the groups? Yes. 
Thank you, Nikki. 
Thank you. 
So in that guided meditation, Nikki spent a little time for us to kind of like settle and get collected and get connected in a really nice way. 
Kind of get grounded and let go some of our attention. 
And then to bring to mind a loveable being, somebody for whom it's easy to feel warmth and care and good will. 
And then just a recognition that this person, this being, or perhaps some other beings, maybe having some challenges, some difficulties. 
So to fold that in to our practice, to hold it into our, this warm heartedness. 
And using phrases like I wish you well or I wish you peace. 
I care for you, these types of things. 
So now we'd like to open it up that you can have a conversation amongst just a small group of you, maybe three or four. 
Just to share what was that like, what was your experience? So were you able to get settled? Was it, how was it to bring to mind a loveable being? And was this, and the bringing in of the compassion, the acknowledging that there might be difficulties, but yet doing that while rooted in a sense of warm heartedness, a sense of goodwill. 
So you'll, each of you will have just a short amount of time to describe your experience and to share what that was like. 
With this recognition that sometimes we don't really know or what our experience was until we try to articulate it. 
Or it's, we can integrate it in a different kind of way when we're sharing it. 
So there's no need to go into a long story about your experience. 
But if you could spend maybe one or two minutes sharing, and then go to the next person who can share and then go to the third person who can share, there might be four people in your group. 
I'm not sure we'll see how zoom does this. 
And then if there's time to go back around again, maybe something that somebody said reminded you of something or helped you to touch into experience that you had, and you might have something else that you'd like to say. 
So, and then just a reminder, I think everybody knows this, but this is not a time to give advice to each other, but just a time for which that we could just kind of connect and connect with ourselves as well as to connect with others. 
So Nikki, I think has been setting us up and I can't help, but I always get a thrill out of this, that we're going to magically find ourselves in groups, small groups, probably three or four. 
And then you'll get a note about 60 seconds before it's time to come back. 
So have fun. 
Okay, so just checking because people have been coming and going and the rooms keep changing in number. 
So I keep having to change them. 
Okay, I think we are. 
. 
. 
Oh, I need to change one room again. 
It's changing as we speak. 
Okay, hold on. 
Moment of practice. 
Peace, ease, here we go. 
Move to five. 
Yeah, so I see there's a. 
. 
. 
the bell maybe could have been just a little bit louder. 
A few people are making a note of that. 
Yeah, so like we said, Nikki and I were kind of experimenting, so we'll work with this. 
So we can turn the volume just a bit on your end. 
Okay, is this for me or for Diana, for both of us? Nikki, you and I can figure that out while you set up the rooms. 
Okay, let's figure that out. 
Okay, let me make sure the rooms are good. 
Okay, I think the rooms are good. 
All right, I'm going to start the rooms. 
Here we go. 
I had to put you into a room. 
Okay, that's fine. 
Good, good. 
Okay, yeah, I don't know if there's a way. 
There is a way not to put someone in a room, but I still have to discover that. 
Hi, I'm going to pause the recording. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, welcome back. 
People are still coming back. 
Yeah, I think I inadvertently sent a chat to everybody. 
That was meant for Nikki. 
She and I were chatting about how we were going to adjust the schedule and she said, why don't you go to this room? And then so we're, you know, we're all in this together. 
I didn't get the chat to run out. 
Everybody saw it, but I didn't see it. 
That's okay. 
That's okay. 
We'll figure this out. 
Great. 
So welcome back. 
And we'd love to, to hear. 
Yeah, how, how was it for you this, this practice? I came up for you just now and practice. 
Yeah, please. 
So that was really special. 
I met two women from Calgary who happened to be in the same sangha and by chance they were in the same group. 
So, I mean, it was really touching. 
They showed me the snow and I didn't show them the spring, but I told them about it, but just to know, you know, the sharing some of the same kind of matter that I had had experienced, which was a profound matter in that group, in the small individual. 
So, you know, we just shared how personal it had been. 
I appreciate that. 
So, thank you very much. 
Thank you, Ann. 
Yeah, thank you Ann for sharing that. 
Any other reports, reflections, please either raise your hand or just unmute yourself. 
Hi, Mara here. 
So it is, it is my first time actually live or, you know, live stream because I live in Switzerland, so it's usually I follow the recordings that you guys have. 
But so today I had this fantastic experience of being able to be, you know, I'm able to be with you guys and connect with other people. 
So for me it was, it was very, it is very, very touching. 
And yeah, it's, it's the positive we were saying in our group that one positive thing that is coming out of these challenging situations actually to be able now to have all these live streams and participate. 
And so sometimes I do participate during the week as well because I'm home, working from home so I can decide what to do. 
And so thank you very much for, for this. 
Yes. 
Thank you, Mara. 
Yeah, Mara, it's so heartwarming to, to hear that and to see everyone's faces, you from Switzerland, folks from Calgary, from Berlin, all over the world here we're practicing together and it's the beauty of a global pandemic. 
We really are all of us in this together, all of us. 
I'll share my heart. 
It just loved being able to, to relax and kind of quiver and feel with others without having to do or perform or protect, which it's been doing a lot of, but I didn't realize that it's tired. 
So thank you for this space. 
Thank you, Alish. 
And also for sharing this, the beauty of vulnerability at this time of not needing to be a particular woman. 
Yeah, thank you. 
I think Joana had her hand up first, right? Yeah, sorry. 
Because I have a view of you, Charlie. 
We'll get to you in a second. 
Oh, I think you can hear me right? Maybe. 
So Charlie, somebody had their name up, their hand up before you. 
So we'll get to you. 
You're next. 
Hi, Jasna. 
Hi. 
My name is actually Yasna. 
Oh, Yasna. 
It's like why, right? Yes. 
I just wanted to express my appreciation for the two of you leading this retreat. 
It's like really beneficial and it's so nice. 
I know in person it's better, but it allows people from all over the world to attend. 
And I've seen there's somebody from Berlin. 
I've just heard some of their people from Calderi. 
And thank you so much for organizing this and leading this retreat. 
It's really helpful in this time. 
Thank you, Yasna. 
Thank you. 
Charlie. 
Hello, everybody. 
You know, I was chatting with, I think it was Sherry or Dairy anyway. 
And I entered this room like a half hour after you guys were already sitting. 
I had thought there was one scheduled with Chris at 10 o'clock and it turns out it's next week. 
So I went on the side and found this group. 
And as I was listening to Nicky guide, I really, I didn't know it was a meta theme. 
But that certainly was happening while I was sitting. 
But one of the things I've really noticed from being able to sit even in the zoom is being close to everyone, you know, versus what's going on now. 
That distancing thing almost feels like I'm being ostracized. 
You know, that's what goes on in my head. 
And so I found it very, very sweet to be able to just sit with a bunch of people and listen and participate. 
And it just really, really filled my heart, you know, really gave me that, oh, wow, I'm home, you know. 
So thank you all. 
Thank you, Charlie. 
I love hearing the feeling of being home. 
Even, you know, coming late and yet feeling that you're at home with others and you're not afar. 
But the sense of connection, really interconnection and feeling of being at home in your heart. 
And that was part of the intentions that Diane and I have had for this room, for this day long today. 
So thank you for saying that. 
Any other reflections, thoughts, questions about the practice that might have come up? Any complaints? Cheryl, please. 
I just wanted to say that I experienced more sadness than I expected and realized that my heart's been more guarded than I thought in the last number of weeks, just kind of dealing with how to do this correctly and, you know, the best thing for this and the best thing for that. 
So that it kind of caught me off guard that I felt the sadness I felt about not being able to hug my grandchildren, for instance. 
And so that's what I wanted to say. 
My heart is certainly more open, but it's got a little more pain in it now than what I was aware of. 
I wanted to ask a question. 
Yeah, something that I think that came up in my practice was I think that, like, as I'm an empath, I think a lot of people who practice are and I've been struggling with feeling everything too deeply. 
So I've noticed sometimes in my practice when I'm trying to, like, do the compassion, it's, like, overwhelming, in a sense, because, like, I already feel so much compassion that when I, like, turn attention to it, it's, like, oh, God, this is a lot. 
So I was just curious to have thoughts about how to, like, how to practice this compassion when you are already feeling it to an extreme extent, if that makes sense. 
Yeah, that's a really, really good question. 
So I'll say something in the end if you'd like to add. 
So I am so glad you brought this up and I was hoping someone would actually bring it up in this time. 
So the practice of compassion is really different from empathic distress. 
And I want to say a little more. 
So it's part of what you're describing, actually, is empathic distress, which is someone who really feels the pain of others so much that it's painful to go there. 
And so how not to, so then I wouldn't call that compassion, but perhaps if I may, I will reformulate your question and, oh, how do I do the practice of compassion by letting the soothing and comforting and not fall into empathic distress? Because my mind, my heart has a tendency, can do that because I feel the pain of others so much. 
So with that perspective, slight reorientation, still the same practical, but the slight reorientation then allows us to actually approach it in the following way. 
So the practice of compassion really has two components. 
One is feeling the pain of others. 
And the other one is the soothing, the meta. 
And I'll share an anecdote with you, actually, which I've shared when this question comes up. 
So there are also, you know, brain scan studies, and this anecdote is from Tanya Singer, the neuroscientist. 
And there's a talk, I was attending a few years ago at the Mind and Life Institute, and she was saying that, okay, doing this, the compassion, research and compassion, she had this renowned mark, a renowned monk, Matthew Ricard, in the fMRI machine and told him, okay, don't do compassion meditation, just contemplate suffering of the world. 
And she did, she did the scan. 
So in the part of the brain that lit up is the part that if you hurt or if you watch somebody else be in pain, that part of the mirror neurons that have to do with pain will light up. 
Emotional pain, physical pain, similar areas. 
So if you're contemplating somebody else's pain, ooh, ouch, it feels like you are in pain yourself, okay? So had him do this practice, brought Matthew Ricard out of the fMRI machine, and he says, oh, I feel so terrible, please put me back in. 
Let me do the full compassion meditation, not just contemplate the pain of others. 
She puts him back and now he does the full meditation, compassion meditation, which is holding the, contemplating the pain of others and wishing well, soothing wishes, calming wishes, love, care, which actually the different area of the brain lights up, which has to do with warmth, love, care, filial emotions, which actually feels good. 
When you love someone, it feels good, right? Okay, so he does that for 30 minutes, bring him up, bring him out of the oven of fMRI machine. 
And he says, ah, thank you, Tanya, I feel better now, I feel balanced. 
So this long story, sorry I have going on, but I think this really demonstrates that this empathic distress is when we just contemplate the suffering and it's not as well balanced by the love soothing care. 
So notice how if you're falling into this more, then balance it with more love, care, soothing, or maybe turning it towards yourself, which is what I was suggesting at the very beginning. 
Turn towards love, care, soothing for yourself and hitters more stability that both can be balanced instead of this one being the only one you're putting attention on the suffering of the world. 
So I hope that clarifies it as clearly as I'm able to explain. 
Yes? Yes, thumbs up, okay. 
So I think that's time. 
Oh yes, Diana. 
I would just like to add a little bit, if you find yourself in a little bit of overwhelm and like, oh, like it's just not accessible to have this warm feeling because you're feeling overwhelmed and it just feels like just too much. 
Then you can just bring your attention to your body to whatever is kind of like the obvious experiences in your body. 
It might be the pressure of the chair or the wherever you're sitting against your body, it might be the feeling of your feet on the ground and to help bring us back in and get grounded again and get here in the present moment. 
So, or it may even just be the feeling of movement, maybe you're walking and having a conversation with somebody, but something tangible and physical and that's present here. 
If you find yourself in overwhelm, you can always get grounded back in the body. 
That's often a little bit easier to have access to that if it feels like too much. 
I just offer that in addition to what Nikki is saying. 
Great suggestion, Diana. 
Thank you. 
I wonder if this might be a good time to move on to the walking meditation. 
I think there was one question in the chat. 
Oh, it was there. 
I was very asked is met a feeling or a mind state. 
I'll start with that. 
And I'll add. 
Yeah, so there's a few things I can say here, and I'll just keep it short. 
And there's maybe one answer could be however you experience it or define it is perfectly fine. 
So whether you experience it more as a felt sense like a bodily experience warm heartedness a certain amount of ease spaciousness, or if it feels more like a mental thing that it's having nice thoughts or good will that thinking pleasant things are about somebody, or maybe it's a combination of both is perfectly fine. 
And then, and then maybe I'll just say briefly, like in the classic Buddhist teachings, they don't, they didn't divide up the human experience and the exactly the same way that we do in this. 
We call it post Freudian era, and when we have a psychoanalysis and all that kind of stuff. 
So the way that they understood the human experience was a little bit different. 
And so some of the categories that we use today don't fit quite as neat and tidy as then. 
So then Nikki maybe you'd like to add to that and I liked what you said. 
Maybe I would ask Barry, where's the question is coming from? Why, why is this distinction feels important to you? I would love to hear from you, Barry. 
Okay. 
Yeah, hi. 
And I'll take myself off. 
Take my video. 
Um, so I was at a Q&A this morning with Bunty, Bunty G. 
I'm just learning about meta. 
So, uh, uh, I asked, um, is, is, is a field is something supposed to arise after you said the phrases and you um, settled down. 
And he said, you know, first you say the phrases, then you conceptualize meta and then yes, some sort of something else arises. 
So I'm just trying to dig into that because I didn't know that anything, any type of feeling was supposed to arise or could arise as a result of practicing meta. 
Okay. 
Thank you so much for sharing why that's coming up for you. 
So hearing that, um, what I would say is meta can be a lot of different things actually. 
It can, the feeling can arise a feeling of love and care, but not necessarily actually for everyone. 
So if no feeling arises for you, don't feel like, oh, I'm failing. 
I got no met meta. 
It might actually arise as a perspective for you or as a shift in action or in the way you are in the world or the way you see the world. 
And there may not be a feeling because we're all, as human packages, we all experience life in a different way. 
So some people might actually experience it as action. 
They might do really loving kindness actions for other than they may not have this loving feeling. 
And some people might have this loving feeling, want to go hug everyone. 
So it can show up in different ways, really. 
And as a change of perspective for some people. 
So it's not one size fits all, really, how meta might show up for you, I would say. 
Okay. 
Other quickly, can you evoke a person who's deceased as either, as one of the people that comes to mind when you're saying that phrase? Very quickly, yes, you can, but we don't recommend it until you are a lot more stable in the practice. 
And the quick reason for that is it can bring up some grief and complicated emotions. 
So it's best to be really stable in the practice when you really got your sea legs and real legs down and then you can practice with deceased individuals. 
You're welcome. 
Diana. 
Thank you, Arch. 
Are you next on the schedule here? I don't have anything to add. 
Okay. 
Yeah. 
I've lost track of our schedule. 
Okay. 
So I will, yes, here I am. 
Look at that. 
Walking meditation. 
Yes. 
Okay. 
So we are going to do walking meditation in a way of really making this into a practice today, into a day long, walking and sitting. 
So the practice that we've done together, we want to invite you to either walk in your apartment back and forth. 
You don't need a lot of space, as you guys know, for walking meditation. 
Maybe five, even 10 steps. 
And the practice that you do is basically you walk and you do the same thing. 
You don't focus on your legs or sensations of your feet or your breath, but essentially what we did, maybe starting with actually starting with settling in your body, maybe starting actually by feeling your feet and breath just to settle, just to arrive again for a few minutes and then conjuring up the image, feeling, noticing the feeling that comes up for you and saying the phrase is while you're walking. 
So the practice of sitting and walking are the same for metta or lying down if you're taking care of your body. 
I see an acknowledged solely taking care of her body today and doing lying meditation, which is perfectly fine. 
Yeah. 
And so movement meditation, if you wish, any form or not, in the next, let's see, let's look at the program. 
Let's do it for, I'm going to make it sure. 
Diana, let's discuss in real time so that we don't fall too behind. 
Should we make this 20 minutes? What do you think? Come back at 11. 
25 or make it 15. 
What's your feeling? Oh, you're muted, my dear. 
I'm going to. 
. 
. 
Oh, there we go. 
I'm used to being the host. 
I think 20 minutes is great. 
Let's do 20 minutes. 
It feels good to me. 
So it's 11. 
04 now. 
So let's come back at 11. 
25. 
Not 11. 
24? It's 11. 
05 now. 
See what happens by the time I finish a sentence. 
Time moves. 
Okay. 
All right. 
So see you at 11. 
25 in 30 seconds. 
You want to stop the recording? Oh, yes, thank you. 
It's all working out. 
Nikki and I spoke briefly on the phone just to connect and, you know, see how the morning's going to adjust the schedule. 
The things that, you know, we often do when we're co-teaching. 
And we inadvertently made a little joke that I don't know why I just am taking delight in. 
As we were signing off the phone, we said, see you Zoom. 
So corny, but I think it's funny. 
So here we are back on Zoom. 
So I just wanted to say a little bit more about this idea of meta and compassion. 
And that the importance of allowing our positive emotions like meta, like loving kindness and compassion to flourish. 
The importance of cultivating them, letting them grow, letting them blossom, letting them develop and creating the conditions in which they can grow and develop and blossom. 
Of course, we all know this, but this idea of there's two people that are sinking in the mud and quicksand or something like this. 
And if one of them can get out of the mud, it's so much easier to get the second person out of the mud. 
So part of this, I just heard this, that the voice is low. 
So here we go. 
I'm making the microphone. 
I'm speaking louder and I move the microphone a little bit closer. 
So hopefully this volume works a little bit better this way. 
So part of this practice is so that we can start. 
And also, Diana, just to say regarding the volume, if any of you are having trouble with the volume, using a headset will drastically improve, even though it might limit your movement for a while. 
You're listening to the teaching, but it will drastically improve the volume. 
So please, if you have a pair, please use it. 
Thanks, Diana. 
Yeah, yeah. 
And maybe I should, we'll see. 
Okay, I'll continue here and then maybe I'll explore. 
Maybe I should be using one too, just to make it a little bit louder. 
So cultivating loving kindness and cultivating compassion is can really help us help others. 
And of course, it's can be integral to our own well being and and our path of practice as we are able to find a little more ease and a little more spaciousness, a little more freedom. 
I think all of us have this experience that when we are lost in difficulties or struggling with difficulties and whatever form those difficulties may be. 
We're not as easy or straightforward or we're just not as available to support others. 
But when we do have a little more ease when we've slept well, we've been eating well, and we have some sense of ease or goodwill or happiness or whatever it might be, positive quote unquote emotion. 
It allows us to view our situation from a bigger perspective, a vaster perspective, and it allows us to be more receptive to others. 
And this way of being more receptive and with a bigger perspective can help us have to be flexible and creative in the ways in which we meet what's happening. 
And that allows us to be malleable and address what's the right thing to do next. 
And to just manage in some kind of way whatever adversity it is that we're experiencing at that time, or whatever adversity difficulty challenging others are experiencing at that time. 
And maybe importantly, cultivating some warmth ease spaciousness and care helps diminish some of our self preoccupation and softening letting go some of our self preoccupation helps free up energy helps increase our capacity, in which we can love others, in which we can serve others. 
I think many of the all of us know this to that somehow when there's a little bit less preoccupation, and we're able to show up for someone and just allow them to be just who they are. 
Without our projecting on to them what we want them to be or expect them to be, or wish how they were, but instead to just show up and see them exactly as they are. 
This is a type of love. 
This is a type of care that becomes available when we have softened our self preoccupation, which becomes available when we are practicing loving kindness, compassion for ourselves. 
When we stop demanding that the world and that other people be in a very precise way, it's a way in which it's really powerful to be able to show up to others to show up for ourselves in this way too. 
So in this next session, we'll be doing loving kindness and compassion for ourselves. 
We're going to be building on what we did earlier, that is loving kindness and compassion for a dear being. 
For some people it's easier to start with a dear one. 
Somebody for whom it's really easy to have loving kindness or compassion. 
And to expand that, to use that foundation, to fold ourselves into that as well, to have warmth, care, goodwill for ourselves, to have compassion for ourselves when we are experiencing difficulties. 
So in the classic Buddhist teachings, self-compassion, compassion for oneself is not different than compassion for anybody else. 
However, some of you might be familiar with Kristin Neff, her teaching, and that she has specific teachings on self-compassion. 
I'm not going to be teaching those today, but if you're interested in that, that's something you can find freely available that's specifically for compassion for oneself. 
But it can be really important to highlight that self-compassion can be an antidote to this idea of a critic, the self-critic, the inner critic that sometimes arises, this feeling of I can't do it or I don't deserve to feel okay when so many other people are having difficulties. 
But self-compassion, taking care of ourselves, loving ourselves, as best we can. 
I want to insert this expression as best we can as a way to highlight that we don't need to do this perfectly. 
It doesn't need to look any particular way. 
But instead, can we orient ourselves towards our difficulties, towards our challenges? Acknowledge that's the truth of the moment. 
Acknowledge that we're a human being. 
These are extraordinary times. 
Of course, of course, there's difficulties. 
And can we turn towards them, align with them in some kind of way, with a warm heart, with a sense of care, with a sense of goodwill towards ourselves? Even if what we're experiencing is some anxiety, some fear, can we take care, can we hold this anxiety, this fear, whatever our experience might be? Can we hold it with a sense of it's okay? It's okay. 
So some of us might have this idea of having compassion or care for ourselves is wimpy or somehow meek or weak. 
But it turns out, just as Nikki was talking about some of the studies that were done putting individuals into MRI machines, they have also done studies with individuals who don't practice self-compassion and those that do. 
And they looked at a number of different outcomes, including how they were in their personal lives, how they were in their professional lives, and their general sense of well-being. 
And they discovered that those that practice compassion for themselves tend to have greater well-being, which isn't surprising, but also tend to have more professional success and relationship happiness. 
And the reason is this, because when we are willing to have compassion for ourselves, it allows a little bit more flexibility, as I said earlier, a little bit more malleability and creativity to arise in which to solve problems, in which to see the bigger picture of what's happening and not be stuck and constricted in the sense of like, oh, I did it wrong. 
So flexibility, but also a little bit more ability to take a chance to try something new. 
And often that's how we discover greater capacity. 
That's how we discover maybe some creative ideas and new ways of doing things. 
So having this foundation, building this capacity for love, for compassion for ourselves, can really make a giant difference in our lives. 
Not only today, these days when we're in the midst of the coronavirus, but just in general is a way to enhance the quality of our lives and those around us. 
So as opposed to self-criticism, this is a habit that many of us have. 
Why not just give it a shot or try it out for this little bit here? When you notice the self-critic, the inner critic arising, can you maybe like bow to it, literally or figuratively, and say, I see you. 
But right now I'm going to be practicing this. 
Right now I'm going to be practicing some warmth and loving kindness as best I can, as best I can. 
So with that as an introduction, we'd like to bring yourself, I'll start a guided meditation, bring yourself to an alert upright posture that also expresses care, that also expresses self-care. 
So for some of you, that might mean lying down. 
For some of you, it might mean getting an extra cushion. 
For me, I'm going to put this little cushion under my knee here. 
I'm going to begin in much the same way that we did the earlier guided meditation that Nikki led us through. 
We can use the sensations in the body, the felt experience of being here as a way to get connected, not only to ourselves, but to the present moment. 
Can you sit and know you're sitting? Nothing in particular needs to be happening. 
We're just arriving here in this moment and getting embodied as you sense into the body. 
Can you notice there's some areas of tension, some areas of tightness? It might be that simply bringing your awareness to those areas can help support some softening, some easing. 
If there isn't some softening or easing, maybe you can be easy with the lack of ease. 
Bring some kindheartedness to the tightness, the tension. 
I'll highlight a few places where we often hold tension around the eyes, around the mouth, and the shoulders. 
I can hear this bird that's right out my window here. 
Hello bird. 
We'll start with a lovable being. 
It's always helpful to start where it's easy. 
Bring to mind somebody for whom it's easy, or maybe some being, for whom it's easy to feel warmheartedness, to feel kindness, openness, respect, care, benevolence, goodwill. 
Choose any of those words that resonate for you. 
You might check in with the body and see if there's a sense of ease or some type of inner smile. 
If there is a sense of warmth and openness, and it's perfectly fine if there isn't, but if there is, you can allow that to support you, nourish you, nurture you, even if it's just a tiny part of your experience. 
Then having this lovable being in mind can say the phrases. 
I tend to do them in a way that has a little bit of a rhythm to them, but you can find your own way. 
May you be safe, may you be happy, may you be healthy, may you live with ease, may you be safe, may you be happy, may you be healthy, may you live with ease, may you be safe, may you be happy, may you be healthy, may you live with ease, we don't have to manufacture, we don't have to create engineer, warmheartedness, we're creating the conditions in which it might arise. 
This practice is powerful, even if during the actual meditation practice, you don't have a strong or clear experience of loving kindness. 
It turns out that so much of the power is bringing our mind back to our intention to cultivate loving kindness and compassion. 
Don't worry, whatever your experience might be, just hang in here and practice with us. 
Again, bring into mind the level of being and sending some good will, some warmheartedness. 
May you be safe, may you be happy, may you be healthy, may you live with ease. 
Now we'll build on this foundation of loving kindness for a level being and expand it to include ourselves, of course we're going to include ourselves, for a level being too, of course we are. 
People like to bring to mind an image of themselves. 
Maybe an image of how you are today or maybe an earlier version of yourself, maybe a younger version, some people even like to do when they were toddlers or whatever feels accessible and supportive. 
Some people like to use a felt sense of what it's like to feel themselves here, maybe a little bit less visual and more physical, maybe a little bit more aesthetic or aesthetic. 
May I be safe, may I be happy, may I be healthy, may I live with ease, may I be safe, may I be happy, may I be healthy, may I live with ease. 
You're welcome to change the phrases. 
Maybe there's other words that resonate, maybe words in another language, the language of your heart. 
It's helpful to keep the phrases simple, not too complicated. 
And that express some warm heartedness towards yourself, some care. 
Thank you. 
So it might be, it's been some difficulties, either this moment or recently. 
And we'll work with these, but it's best not to start with the most difficult. 
Start with just something that's just a little bit, just a little bit. 
This is a practice and you'll get tremendous benefit of even just starting where it's easiest. 
Don't underestimate how powerful just to start where it's easiest. 
Maybe we had a little bit of a conflict with someone, maybe we've been feeling anxiety. 
Notice how you feel. 
How does your heart feel? In some way, can you continue to have some warmth, some openness, some tenderness while acknowledging the difficulty? In whatever way makes sense for you. 
So for compassion, is when we bring this warm heartedness, this openness, this care, and acknowledge the difficulties. 
And this warmth, this openness, then naturally flows into a wish for those difficulties to be eased. 
It flows into a sincere desire for there to be some well-being. 
It comes from a place of warm heartedness, from love. 
To support this, we can use different phrases for compassion. 
May my difficulties be eased. 
May I have well-being. 
May my difficulties be eased. 
May I experience well-being. 
May my difficulties be eased. 
May I experience well-being. 
And allow any warm heartedness or settledness. 
Maybe even a warm feeling in the chest, in the heart center. 
Allow any of those sensations to support you. 
And allow them to get as big as they would like. 
And not making them get bigger, we're just allowing them to get bigger. 
So now in this remaining time for this meditation, maybe just check in and what feels would be the most supportive for you right now. 
Do some compassion practice for yourself, maybe just loving kindness for yourself. 
Maybe it feels easier to do loving kindness for a lovable being, including kittens and babies, puppies. 
Maybe it's just feeling into the felt sense of the body, getting grounded, present. 
What would be helpful? What would be supportive? There's no way to take care of yourself. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
So before we transition to what we'll be doing next, I just want to say a few words about compassion practice. 
There's, of course, it's enormously helpful and supportive to be doing meditation practice. 
Just how we did sometimes to start with loving kindness and then to expand that out to compassion practice. 
But there are some other things that we can do too. 
And some include to value compassion when it does arise. 
We might see it when it arises when we see somebody who needs some help or when we touch into when we're on the phone talking to family members or friends. 
It may just naturally arise. 
And can we appreciate it like, oh, yes, here is compassion, as opposed to being dismissive. 
But just to kind of help get the mind accustomed to get the heart accustomed to, oh, yeah, this is this feeling. 
And that more often that we're kind of tuned into that feeling, whether it arises during meditation or just spontaneously in the course of our day. 
Makes a little bit easier, the more familiar it is and makes it a little bit more likely that we can bring it to mind again or experience it again. 
For that when we might really need it. 
Something else that might be supportive is to recognize that we're not obligated to feel compassion. 
This is a practice, but it's not something that you have to do. 
It shouldn't feel burdensome. 
It shouldn't feel like this is what a good person would do. 
Instead to recognize that if we're able to have some openness of heart, some spaciousness. 
I don't know, I keep on using this word warm for me, it feels kind of like a warmth and open feeling. 
And then if we can bring this warm and open feeling to all areas of our lives. 
Then that's then compassion will just naturally arise naturally grow and develop, but there's no obligation so don't feel like this is something you have to do. 
Compassionate is a wonderful asset to ourselves and to others, but maybe it can be helpful to do a little bit of a reflection on how it might enrich us rather than deplete us. 
So feeling like it's depleting and it's, can you maybe reorient or rethink in a way in which it feels like it's supportive and nourishing. 
With that as a little background, we'd like to now we'd like to hear from you all how it's going, just kind of check in and all that Nikki decide whether it'd be best to unmute us all or to have us unmute one by one whatever you want to do. 
Yeah, I think maybe I'm muting one by one would be going and that was lovely Diana. 
Thank you. 
That was lovely. 
Yeah. 
And so so reiterate the invitation of Diana to to share what what's happening for you right now. 
How is how is the guided meditation for you reflections questions comments, especially given what's happening right now in our collective lives with COVID-19. 
This is a very unusual and special time to be alive and to open our hearts for care and compassion to ourselves and others. 
How are you what's coming up, please raise your hand or either yes Nancy you have your hand up and unmute you. 
I, I thought that was just lovely Diana was I have been since the our first meditation and our first group very emotional today. 
The loving kindness and compassion for the dear ones made me very tearful. 
And one of the people in my group was saying how she had to turn it around and then practice loving kindness for herself because she was feeling her or sad. 
And I guess it's just been the building up of everything that's gone on in the last week and adjusting and readjusting and changing your expectations. 
And it feels a little bit like an emotional letter, not a little bit of a release I guess is the right word to say. 
And so it feels good to me to be able to practice loving kindness, especially to myself right now. 
Because it's been, it's been quite a, quite a shake up. 
Thank you Nancy. 
I like that expression quite a shake up. 
Yeah, quite a shake up. 
And the recognition that there's some poignancy, you didn't use that word, but with this recognizing that we're vulnerable. 
But that's the truth of them, you know, human beings are vulnerable. 
And there can also be some strength when we align with the kind of the reality, when we are, yeah, if I'll just stop there when we align with the reality of the moment. 
I see that. 
Yeah, I had has been up for a while. 
Nevin, please unmute you. 
Thank you, Nikki. 
I have two questions. 
One is, I think I felt this stronger when we were doing it as a self compassion, self loving kindness, a sense of self pity, like, this is terrible, like, I'm just never going to make it. 
So that seems to be maybe similar to this empathic distress that you have used. 
So maybe at the personal level, it kind of turns into some kind of a self pity. 
And then overall, these, these maybe especially for the love kindness practices, are they the same as or kind of similar to prayer? That's how they feel like. 
And if so, in a way, the question comes into mind like prayer to whom? I don't know, just kind of broad questions in general. 
Thank you. 
Great practices so far. 
Thank you very much. 
Thank you. 
Nikki, would you like to answer that? Sure, I'll start. 
Thanks. 
Excellent questions, Nevin. 
And my saying your name right, Nevin or Nikki? Yes. 
Yeah. 
So for the first part, yeah, it's both the pity is a near enemy, as it is said in the teachings of compassion, it kind of feels like compassion, but it's not exactly compassion. 
And both either for other people, it can feel like, Oh, poor you, I'll never be one for ourselves. 
As you express, it's a feeling of kind of collapsing. 
So the way to actually work with that, I would say is what Diana said earlier, which is a sense of actually embodiment and feeling your own stability, physical stability and strength. 
Because notice the energy of self pity, it's kind of collapsed inwards, it's like, Oh, it's weak, it's like sapping, it's like energy is going away. 
Whereas a sense of, Oh, sweetie, you're really having a hard time right now. 
There's a sense of strength in it. 
There's a sense of like sitting tall, like, I'm having a hard time right now and I love myself and I care myself and God, this is hard. 
Do you feel energetically that that's a great point. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, like feeling it that way would be helpful. 
Yeah, really just to sit up straight, deeper breath really feel the strength. 
Exactly. 
I see how you're sitting differently right now, right? I think I wasn't paying attention to that. 
I was just like, Oh, I felt my head is kind of dropping. 
Yeah, I feel it. 
I see it on zoom in your body language right now. 
So cool. 
And the other thing quickly to say something about so, so there are some similarities and differences between prayer. 
That is, it's an expression of good will, good wishes and yet prayer has the intention of getting something you want the other person to be well. 
So please God, make them well, make them healthy, make them happy. 
Whereas here, the purpose is actually is to cultivate and strengthen our own heart in love and care and compassion is without attachment to any outcome. 
The person we're wishing well for might be sick and might actually be dying, but we still wish that may you be healthy, maybe you'll be as healthy as possible. 
It is for you and may you have peace as much. 
So it's it's kind of turns the practice on its head and and releases all it. 
You don't have to call him back like, Are you healthy now? Are you happy now? I've been doing Meta for you all day. 
Like, come on, is it working? It's like you free yourself from all expectations. 
You're just giving the, where you can just think of, yeah, strengthening your heart as an interest as an intention or just releasing these good will into the universe. 
Thank you. 
I don't have anything to add. 
That was nice, Nikki. 
Thank you. 
Prajit, your hand is up, please. 
Hi, thank you. 
So when Diana was talking about kind of these specific words, which is, you know, may my difficulties be eased. 
I feel a sense of well being. 
For the first part of that, I was wondering, how does that maybe, how do I treat it as something that's different from like a version to my difficulties? You know, I had these difficulties and they don't feel great. 
And how do I kind of phrase it in my head or like treat it such that it's not me pushing away the difficulty, but me kind of holding. 
Yeah, this is a good question. 
Like, how is this not a version? And, you know, part of the answer is similar to the answer to the preceding question. 
That is, what's the felt sense of it? Is it of like, go away? I don't want this. 
And there's a turning away. 
There's a, and maybe kind of getting a bit smaller with our attention, as opposed to a warm heartedness, which is a little bit leaning forward and an openness, like, may there be, it's just like this wish for things to be better. 
But it has an openness, a leaning more, not leaning away, and maybe not necessarily leaning forward, but not collapsing around it or something like this. 
So may I, it's more a active generosity of like, what's, what's, um, may the conditions be created such that the difficulties and as opposed to how can I make this, how can I make this go away, something like this. 
Nikki, would you like to add something to that? Thanks, Diana. 
I'm going to refer to what we're talking about you and I actually, the yesterday, a couple of days ago as we're planning this in terms of choosing phrases. 
And we did discuss this because sometimes the choice of phrases can bring up what exactly what you're expressing. 
And sometimes it might actually be lexically choosing something different. 
Now I have ease in the midst of this challenge. 
May I have peace? May I be resourced in the midst of this difficulty? So yeah, it's here. 
It's not going to go away for a while. 
The pandemic is here. 
May I be resourced? May I care for myself? May I love myself? May I support myself? May I have ease in the middle? And you can have ease in the middle of challenge. 
You know you can, right? So maybe choosing different, making different lexical choices can support that too. 
However, your hand has been up for a while. 
Please. 
Yeah, thank you. 
I just, you know, I always end up a little unsure on exactly what to say. 
But I just wanted to thank you guys for that. 
It's just very funny after having lost a very, very, very close relationship. 
You get caught up in school and work and the busyness of life and you forget to practice these things, you know. 
You forget to stay close to yourself so that you can stay close to people that are in your life and that you care about. 
And so silly of things we get caught up with. 
And what happens when you lose this heart and you start neglecting other people that give you so much. 
And like you mentioned about having to meet reality. 
Once there's a change and it's in kind of death of a relationship or death in general where you really face to meet a reality that you didn't see before. 
And so much comes up from that. 
So I've just constantly been meeting this and kind of breaking apart and having to do Tong Lan and trying to meet this with compassion. 
At the same time, just, yeah, just having to bear through it, bear through a lot of that grief and guilt and resentment. 
So thank you very much. 
So, Trevor, may you meet this grief and pain and you said the word resentment. 
Is there a way in which you can meet it with some warmheartedness, kind of like, okay, yes, this to this to kind of like bringing that in and allowing it because that is the reality of the moment when those things arise. 
And can you with as much warmheartedness as is available at the time, can you meet it meet all these difficulties. 
And if you find that you're sliding into, there's so many different things that we could slide into, then maybe something that can be a loving kindness for a level being, or if that doesn't feel accessible, maybe, as we've stated, maybe some groundedness in the body or something like this. 
Yeah, recognizing that there's all kinds of difficulties. 
Thanks for sharing that, Trevor, and sharing how in the midst of what's going on, there's also the grief that you're holding and working through. 
And in some ways, actually, what we're globally experiencing could also be expressed as grief, global grief, but losing someone that you cared about is very, very intense and very particular. 
And really self-care, self-compassion, self-lops, especially going through the different stages of grief, just giving yourself space and time. 
It's like this. 
Trying to wish the other person just as much happiness to find this is very helpful to get down on the sober level. 
But I'll leave it there for other people who have something to say. 
Thank you, Trevor. 
Raj, your hand has been up, please. 
I'm muting you. 
I just wanted to say I'm just really grateful to be here and again, and I thank you for organizing this. 
I wanted to share my reflection on the self-compassion practice. 
So when we started off by focusing on someone we have a lot of love for, I focused on one of my nephews. 
And that was very nice. 
I could really appreciate a very warm feeling. 
And when we moved to focusing on ourself, I felt like that feeling kind of really fizzled. 
Thinking about myself or picturing myself as when I was a child that really helped. 
But yeah, it was interesting to see how that fizzled, and I noticed that I started to kind of criticize myself. 
I got into this bad cycle of criticizing myself for not being aware of my own suffering. 
So it was very important for me to hear that with the compassion, we're not obligated to feel it. 
I trust that because self-compassion practice is fairly new to me, I trust it will come in time. 
But to not criticize myself if I don't feel it, so that was important for me to hear. 
I just wanted to share that, and thank you. 
Thank you, Raj. 
Thanks for putting that in the Zoom room, that both the fizzling, which I saw, heads nodding along with you, that yes, yes, and so that you don't feel alone. 
Yes, of course, this is something that happens, which is why Diana emphasized there's no shooting in this, right? Just meeting whatever comes up arises or doesn't arise. 
All right, thank you. 
Peggy, your hand has been up, please. 
So I sent loving kindness to an old friend who's just very easy to be around and very dear. 
And then when it came for myself, what it sort of pointed out was how hard it is sometimes to be in my home situation. 
I live with somebody who were very different and just our natural ways of being sometimes clash, and I feel, and our ways of responding to this, the COVID also, the COVID-19. 
So I feel like an amount of pressure sometimes. 
So just the difference between that and how easy it is to be with the other person was really evident. 
And I hadn't been aware really of this kind of just this tiny level of pressure that I have quite often. 
But it was easy to have compassion for myself in that. 
Yeah, it's not always easy to maintain when I need to deal with this person sometimes if there's a clash and find a skillful, compassionate way for both of us to interact. 
Thank you. 
Thank you, Peggy. 
Christine, please, I'll unmute you. 
Hi, thanks. 
This has been a really great day, particularly after the weeks that we had recently. 
And I just wanted to say on the loving kindness for yourself meditation, I never had this experience before, but I kind of felt like at first I was doing loving kindness for the better parts of myself, and then the parts of myself that I'm not so pleased with started to come up, and it felt like a super energetic shift in terms of how I could relate to that and how I could offer loving kindness to the super anxious part of me or those parts that aren't as kind of easy to be with. 
So I just wanted to share that. 
Yeah, thanks for mentioning that. 
I think it's so important. 
There's this expression that I've borrowed from Zen a lot, no part left out, no part left out. 
The parts that we love and the parts that we don't really, we want to exercise and leave it away. 
So thanks for mentioning that. 
And as it arises, again, no shooting, but when they arise. 
Yeah. 
And there can be a lot of healing, by the way, and self-acceptance when we do allow in the parts that we don't necessarily like. 
But of course, they're there for a reason because of our history, how we've been raised, and we haven't had control over those parts so much. 
They've kind of programmed in by society, by family. 
So like, oh, it's okay. 
I can love you too. 
It's all right. 
I don't like you, but I can love you. 
Okay, let's see. 
We have Elaine. 
Let's take a couple more. 
Is that okay? And let's take, because we're going over it. 
I think we're still okay. 
We're just shifting our schedule by 10 minutes. 
So yeah, Elaine, please. 
Hi. 
I just wanted to say this is wonderful. 
It helps me feel socially connected, and I love it. 
And one of the things that I've done is reframed. 
The statement for self-compassion and self-care is I'm calling it centering in peace. 
Nice. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, I think that it's, as Nikki mentioned, the words that we use can make a difference. 
And with this practice, we're all welcome to find words that work for us. 
There's nothing particularly magical about the words that Nikki and I are offering. 
Centering in peace. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thumbs up, Elaine. 
Thank you. 
Shai. 
Bye. 
Shai, I will unmute you. 
Your hands up. 
There we go. 
Yeah, I've been learning so much, and I feel like deepening my practice so much. 
So I'm so grateful to have everyone here. 
I've noticed something that has been, I think, getting in the way of my metapractice has been, I guess, fear. 
And I think that comes from attachment to my relationships and loss. 
And actually, I expected, when I first felt it, it was because of the coronavirus and being scared that someone's going to get sick. 
But actually, where I noticed it most was with my dog when I was sending a meta, I was like, oh my gosh, my dog is really old. 
She's not going to be around for a long time. 
So I'm trying to just be present with that. 
I'm curious if you have any tips for navigating the attachment, like fear of loss that comes up. 
Nikki, do you want to say something? Sure. 
You know, loss is a part of life, right? There is no way around it. 
And there are small losses, big losses. 
And in fact, what's happening in the world with COVID-19 is the lesson in loss and the lesson in impermanence. 
Things are not going to always be, we think they're going to be the same. 
But they change, things go. 
And when we hang on, we experience the pain and the suffering of loss. 
And I think what you're talking about specifically is the fear of loss is projecting forwards. 
And we can live in the fear of so many losses. 
What if this happens? What if that happens? What if that happens? There are so many different things that we can project. 
And of course, a lot of times, things that we hold dearest. 
So what I would recommend in this specific case is bring your mind to the present moment right here, right now. 
Sort of being overwhelmed, projecting, oh, there will be a time in the future when my sweet darling doc, who might dearly love, won't be here in the world. 
Well, take care of this moment. 
He, she is alive right now. 
Love him, her as best as you can right now. 
Love yourself as best as you can. 
If you can be present and fully meet this moment, you can build the trust that whatever the future moment is, when that future moment becomes the present moment, you will manage to meet it with grace and present. 
So just be right here right now and meet this moment with presence. 
Diana. 
No, that's beautiful. 
That's beautiful, Nikita. 
And so maybe Tobias will be the last one. 
Last one, I agree, yeah. 
So Tobias, please, I'll unmute you. 
I can't unmute you there. 
Yeah, thank you very much. 
Also, I'm very grateful for this kind of mini retreat. 
I feel that, yeah, it's a good chance to come back to myself because I think I've been also distracting myself with so many other things that were maybe not so necessary. 
But now, yeah, to have the time, yeah, to also feel myself and I feel that it's also quite a bit of grief and anxiety in there that I maybe didn't notice before so much. 
But it's good to notice it and work through it. 
And I think my question is, I think you also mentioned the Brahma Viharas before and I also heard in another meeting and talk. 
Yeah, the Brahma Viharas as a whole can be really a strong foundation for all of our life, all situations. 
I wanted to ask if you can maybe say a few words also about cultivating joy because I feel that it's also a bit missing in my life maybe at the moment and how it can maybe link with other Brahma Viharas. 
So I think maybe it's kind of a big question, but if you can just say a few things about cultivating joy. 
Ayana, would you like to say something? Yeah, yeah. 
So, for those of you who don't know that Brahma Viharas are for practices and maybe the base, the foundational one is loving kindness and I'm using this expression like warm heartedness, openness. 
And when it's just perfectly natural that this warm heartedness as we start to get developed and cultivated starts to spread out so we can, that can happen naturally or we can do it intentionally. 
And when it spreads out, of course it's going to meet individuals who are having difficulties and that turns then it transforms into compassion and that's what Nikki and I have been talking about. 
But there are also people who are having some joys, maybe it's their birthday and somebody surprised them with a gift or maybe it's doing something funny on Zoom together with other people. 
There's, I've been learning about all kinds of creative things that karaoke and you're like all these kind of silly fakes and a friend of mine sent me a funny little video. 
So just the, there's also, so when this warm heartedness meets delight, joy, gladness other people are having, then there's this wish like, oh, may your delight, may your joy continue. 
May it not diminish, may it support you and be a part of your life or integrated into your life in a nice way. 
So there we can cultivate that specifically during with a meditation practice, Nikki and I aren't going to talk about that as much today. 
But it also can be cultivated just in our everyday life in a similar way like we can with compassion. 
That is, one, to just notice when it naturally arises. 
When a couple discover they're having a baby and there's this joy like, oh, fantastic, you're having a baby. 
Like there's, there's often just a big uplift and to just notice, oh, how that feels when there's, there's a well being or there's a somebody's expressing something that's delightful. 
So just tune into when these experiences naturally arise, feel them in the body, tune into how they feel in the mind and that just makes it more likely that they will arise again. 
They might have gained familiarity with them. 
It might be that they've been arising for some time already and we've been a little bit dismissive of them, especially we tend to do this, especially in the midst of a global pandemic. 
We might feel like we shouldn't ever feel some joy or some gladness. 
But the truth of the matter is, it's very likely that all of us are having a big range of emotions. 
It might be like a bias to only go towards the difficulties. 
The invitation here is to open it up and to notice what are those experiences that are neutral. 
And what are those in which there's a little bit of gladness in the heart, whether it's with a formal meditation practice or just an everyday life. 
And then Nikki, would you like to add something? Yeah, thank you, Diane. 
I feel this is so important and maybe we should do it in half day in the next few weeks, just about cultivating joy in the midst of a challenge. 
Yeah, as Diana said, turning the mind, turning the heart and actually cultivating, really making time for cultivating joy in the midst of all this. 
I was actually talking with a student of mine a couple of days ago and long story short, she realized that she had had an intention in her life to cultivate joy and during this time with all the news and everything that's going on, she had lost that and her heart was so heavy understandably. 
But why lose touch with the intention to still cultivate joy? Because actually, I'm going to share a poem. 
This is so important. 
I'm just going to share this poem. 
Well, I'll read it to you and then I can send it to you in chat. 
So this is by Jack Gilbert. 
Sorrow everywhere, slaughter everywhere. 
If babies are not starving, I'm going to put it in chat and read it too so you can follow along. 
And there we go. 
Here we are. 
Okay. 
It's not letting me copy. 
I think it's too long. 
Well, I can copy. 
But this page has so many ads. 
So you're going to be bombarded by ads, but I will put the link here anyway here. 
It's called a brief for the defense by the well-known poet Jack Gilbert. 
Sorry about all the ads on this page. 
You can find a better one anyway. 
Sorrow everywhere, slaughter everywhere. 
If babies are not starving someplace, they're starving somewhere else. 
With flies in their nostrils. 
But we enjoy our lives because that's what God wants. 
It's a particular perspective. 
Otherwise, this morning, the mornings before summer dawn would not be made so fine. 
The Bengal tiger would not be fashioned so miraculously well. 
The poor women at the fountain are laughing together between their suffering, between the suffering they have known and the awfulness of their future, smiling and laughing with everybody in the village very sick. 
And it goes on and on. 
And at the end, I love the end. 
We stand at the prowl again of a small ship anchored late at night in the tiny port, looking over to the sleeping island. 
The waterfront is three shattered cafes and one naked light burning. 
To hear the faint sound of oars in the silence as a rowboat comes slowly out and then goes back is truly worth all the years of sorrow to come. 
I skipped a lot of it, but part of the poem that I'll let you enjoy on your own later is to only honor challenge, to only honor darkness and difficulty is almost as if you're forgetting beauty and grace and love and joy. 
And let's serve that in our wholeness, honor beauty and love and grace and joy, because that is just as important as the challenge. 
Let it infuse the honoring of the beauty and joy. 
Let's celebrate that and not just celebrate the deaths. 
And in fact, perhaps that way, the deaths, the loss, they can be infused with this beauty and grace and meaning, instead of just something dark and awful that's happening to the earth, to us, all humanity. 
Anyway, this is very brief time to try to make a very complicated point, but I'm just going to leave it at that and trust that you might have learned some benefit. 
Shall we take our lunch break now? Yes. 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
So we are going to take an hour or an hour and five. 
Let's come back at 1. 
45. 
Let's do that. 
I think that feels good. 
Yeah. 
This has been really rich, so I'm glad we didn't shorten this. 
So we're going to come back at 1. 
45 and understanding that people in Europe may or may not be able to join us because it'll be pretty late your time. 
Oh, come on. 
Just in the middle of the night. 
Do it all night, sir. 
Just acknowledge and give a huge face if you need to take care of yourself. 
And if you come back with love to see, of course, it's all good. 
And so I just want to really appreciate the time of practice we've all had together. 
And yeah, yes, there is a way to save the chat. 
I think you can click on the bottom and say save chat or something. 
There's a way to do that. 
Otherwise, just do a Google search for a brief for the defense, Jack Gilbert, and you'll find it. 
In fact, here. 
So, okay. 
And we'll see you at 1. 
45. 
Take good care of yourself. 
Yeah. 
Take care. 
See you. 
Bye. 
And I'm going to turn off the recording. 
Let's see if I can do it. 
Yes. 
Yes. 
Yes. 
.
