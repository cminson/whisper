 Well maybe my topic for tonight is a good one given that some people leave early. I thought of talking about frustration. And as an introduction to that topic, it just occurred to me to repeat a quote or statement that Zen Master Dogen has said. He says that ordinary people are deluded about enlightenment. And enlightened people are enlightened about delusion. And I think that's a very profound statement. Often we look towards the world of enlightenment to provide the answers. And rather we should look to the world of delusion to understand it really well. When we really understand our delusion, then we'll find our enlightenment, but not separate from delusion. So frustration is a very important one to understand. To understand our frustration is a common part of most of our lives. It takes many forms, simple frustrations and very big ones. And there are frustrations in all kinds of aspects of life. There are frustrations at work, frustrations in relationships, frustrations on the freeway, frustrations in our practice with ourselves, frustrated with ourselves. And it's common enough. Things don't go the way we want. And we get frustrated. We want things to be different. We get frustrated. We can't accomplish things. We get frustrated. So frustration I think is common to all of us. What's interesting and what's particularly important I think from the point of view of practice is how we respond to our frustration. What our reaction is. And what happens to many of us is that at various periods of our life perhaps, or maybe in the kind of the person we are, there are certain characteristic ways in which we tend to respond to frustration. And what's interesting is to start the interest in frustration and interest in the way in which we respond to frustration, to get some sense of what the common patterns are, the likely ways in which we are going to respond and react. And if we can get some sense of that, then the chances are we're not going to be so caught up when it happens. You see the frustration arises and we can notice the patterns of reaction we have to that and then perhaps be a little bit freer to it. And I came across from the Buddhist suttas, the scriptures, a quite remarkable description the Buddha gives of eight ways. It can be taken as eight ways in which people respond to frustration. And it takes the form in this particular account of eight ways that a Buddhist monk or nun can respond to being criticized, which is often frustrating to be criticized, right? So the monks reprove a fellow monk for some offense, and he, when reproved by them, pleads forgetfulness, saying, I do not remember, I do not remember. So that's perhaps the strategy of what? Denial, denial, repression maybe. Oh, by the way, sorry? Forgetfulness as a strategy. It's a great strategy. Yes, these are all considered to be strategies. And of course, he could have had a poor memory and actually forgotten it happens to all of us. But these are taken as strategies. So I don't remember. I don't remember. The monks reprove a fellow monk for some offense, and he, when reproved by them, blurts out at his reprover. What right have you to talk, you stupid fool? Do you really think you must speak? The best defense is a good option. So we respond to frustration with criticism, with aggression. That's a good one, right? Calvin is walking in the snow with Hobbes. Some people complain all the time. They complain about the least little thing. If something bugs them, they never let go of it. They just go on and on. Long after anyone else is interested. They just complain, complain, complain. People who gripe all the time really drive me nuts. You think they change the subject after a while, but they never do. They just keep griping until you start to wonder, what's wrong with idiots? But they go on complaining and repeating what they've already said. Hobbes says, maybe they're not very self-aware. And Calvin puts his hands on his hips and angrily says, boy, that's another thing that gets on my nerves. So something gets on our nerves, and we find reasons to blame other things for it, to criticize the other thing, to attack. I came across an interesting study recently. The study was titled, Post-divorce Adaptation and the Attribution of Responsibility. And what this psychologist found out in this study was that people who assign all the blame for divorce on the other partner suffer a lot longer than people who see that actually there was a combination of factors that contributed to the difficulty in the divorce. So when there's frustration to assign all the blame to attack and be aggressive, often prolongs the difficulties. So then the Buddha continues. The monks reprove a fellow monk for some offense, and he, when reproved by them, retorts to his reprover. It is you who has committed such and such an offense. So you must first make amends. It's a little bit different than aggression. And perhaps in the modern psychology we would call it projection. You don't see what we've done, but rather we project it to others and blame them for it, for the very same thing. It's quite remarkable the Buddha had all these great insights, I think. And four, monks reprove a fellow monk for some offense, and he, when reproved by them, evades the question through another, turns the issue aside and shows anger, hatred, and sulkingness. So that's going to be a little bit different. Anger and hatred is maybe like aggression, like the other one. But sulkingness I thought was an interesting one. And sometimes when we get frustrated, there's a tendency of what in modern psychology is called regression. When we start acting like children and we become depressed and we drag our feet and we whine and kind of the energy drops and we start complaining left and right to everything. Does that sound familiar to anyone? Or sulkingness? No. So now there's another strategy. Monks reprove a fellow monk for some offense, and he, when reproved by them, speaks in the assembly of monks with much gesticulation. In other words, I've never said before. I've just read them many times. And so I see us sometimes when we get frustrated or get criticized. There's a lot of kind of compensatory activity that has nothing to do with what's actually the theme or the subject being talked about. It's a kind of gesticulation. It kind of just starts talking fast or rapidly or moving hands about and repeating itself and not saying anything particular of importance or changing the subject. As a way of maybe a kind of form of defense or maybe a form of what? Agitation? Escape? What? Histrionics. Well, maybe that's a good translation. But what kind of strategy is histrionics? Distracts. Distracts? Covers up? So that happens. Monks reprove a fellow monk for some offense, and he, disregarding the order of monks and the reprover, goes on as offender just as he likes. That's another strategy. Arrogance. That's interesting. It's a strategy. I think arrogance is a strategy that must have deeper roots than something else. But what else was it, people say? Oblivion. Oblivion is a strategy. What's kind of... Hostility. Kind of maybe hostility? Narcissism. Narcissism? How much is that fear? Fear. Fear. Passive aggressive. Yes. Okay. The monks reprove a fellow monk for some offense, and when reproved by them he says, I am neither guilty nor concerned, and he annoys the order by his silence. So it's kind of similar, some of these. But maybe again it's kind of like denial and maybe repression. Arrogance. Maybe arrogance again. I think the assumption here, in this particular story, is that the monk actually did it. I think that's the assumption. But it's interesting because frustration or criticism sometimes is unfounded, and then it's also interesting how do we respond to unfounded criticism of ourselves. And sometimes perhaps silence is maybe a good strategy, but I think there's, as a general rule, probably better strategies than silence. When there's conflict, not to ignore the conflict, but actually be willing to enter into discussion. You know, what's going on here? You know, I disagree with you, but let's talk about it, rather than just shutting down and being unwilling to talk about it. And then eight. The monks reprove a fellow monk for some offense, and when reproved by them he says, Reverend Sirs, why should you worry so much about me, since I shall give up the training now and return to a lay life? And when he has given up the training and returned to the lay life, he says, now Reverend Sirs, be satisfied. So, good one. So just you drop out of the game entirely. Kind of leave the situation, abandon the situation, which is also the strategy. We get frustrated and say, well, I give up, I'm not going to be part of this anymore, rather than dealing with it directly. We have this famous list in Vipassana called the Five Hindrances. And the Five Hindrances, as most of you know about, are greed or desire, real strong desire, aversion or aggression, restlessness, sloth or lethargy, and then the fifth is doubt. And one way of understanding these is that these can also be seen as strategies in the face of frustration. When we get frustrated, one response is to get filled with desire and want to get compensation by desire. And wanting something better or something really pleasant. Another way is to, again, the aggressive ways, to get angry and get hostile. And other ways to get restless and just get really restless and agitated. It can be a strategy. You feel full of worry rather than dealing with it. And the fourth way can be lethargy, you know, how the energy level just drops, the sulkingness. What does sulkingness mean exactly? You can define it. Childish pouting. Childish pouting, yeah. Okay, it's been defined. And in doubt. Doubt is a strategy, not necessarily because there's real healthy doubt, but rather be filled with doubtful concerns, kind of questioning everything because of the frustration, of the uncertainty, of being uncomfortable with uncertainty. And I think this is really the key in my mind, is how to really work with frustration or work with criticism when things don't go the way we want. The key is to be willing to experience our frustration. Be willing to experience the discomfort that might exist. And a lot of the training that comes with Vipassana comes with increased willingness to allow ourselves to feel uncomfortable. Just that. Rather than automatically letting the old habits, the old conditioning, the old patterns we have, many of us, we all have, I think, of responding some particular way as a strategy, unhealthily, to our frustration. And of course, there's healthy ways to act and fix things that frustrate us, but there's also unhealthy ways of responding. And this is really to understand how we respond to frustration is important. But to be comfortable with discomfort, to be willing to experience discomfort, and take some time, when we get uncomfortable, they take some time just to be with it, rather than to be in a hurry to escape from it, or hurry to attack it, or hurry to do whatever we do with it. They say, oh, I'm uncomfortable. Let's just kind of study the situation, let's be aware of it for a while, and see what creative responses might arise out of the situation if we allow ourselves the chance to be with it, the discomfort from it a while. There's a tremendous amount of creative potential that arises in the crucible of discomfort. And when we turn too quickly away from discomfort, we lose that opportunity to see the creative solutions that might arise. Yes? Is the Buddha or anyone with healthy ways to deal with frustration? Attention? The Buddha does give different lists of things. Now, specifically through frustration and through criticism, to match these lists, I don't know. The Buddha did institute, or tried to institute, a set of procedures for reconciling conflict when it arose, and it involved such things as giving, in terms of interpersonal conflict, such things as meeting in a formal situation, perhaps with other monks and nuns present, and calmly giving each other a chance to speak about the history of the event, and how it feels about it, and the other person responding, you know, kind of things that are common in mediation nowadays. But I think all of Buddhism, all of the Buddha's teachings, is the Buddha's response to how to deal with frustration. Frustration is just another one of the possible translations of the word dukkha, which lays at the heart of Buddhism. So not just simply mindfulness, it's everything you've ever read about Buddhism. It's really supposed to be a help to frustration. But I believe that generally one of the most important starting places for whatever we're going to do is this willingness to be uncomfortable. And if we don't have that willingness to hang out a little bit with discomfort, then we're not going to have any chance to really see what else we might be able to do with the situation. What else would you like to say in response? Anyone want to give any examples? Yes? In the line recently from a book called A Year to Live, in which he took as a task living his life as if he were going to die and be here. And one of the points that he makes beautifully is the willingness to expand rather than attract into something that is uncomfortable. It's probably the shortest way to really expand fully into life. The point is that fear of death is much more a fear of being fully alive. Fear is prevention from doing so. There's almost always bouncing back away from some frustration rather than going through it. Yes, I think so. And to be fully awake or fully present or fully willing to experience our full humanity, our full life, it sounds like it's a nice thing. But to be a human being is to be limited. Human beings are finite. We're all mortal. We all get sick. We don't have infinite capacities and capabilities and intelligence and capacities for compassion. We all have our limitations. And it's inherent in being a human being, which means that frustration to some degree is inherent also to being a human being. So that part of becoming fully accepting or fully present of our full humanity is also to find some way to include and hold within that frustration. Or another way of saying it, a better way of saying it is limitation. And limitation can stimulate frustration. But it stimulates frustration most often when we're not willing to accept it. We feel, oh, it shouldn't be here. It shouldn't happen. When we always have this notion, it should be and it can be fixed. There's a kind of a delusion, I think, among many people, that every discomfort and every problem should and can be fixed. And always looking to fix it. And actually inherent in human life is limitation. Inherent in human life is something which is wrong. Right? It isn't like it's all beautiful bliss and become fully enlightened and awake. And not going to have any more limitations. You can have just as many limitations then as you have now. But the way in which we embrace it becomes very important. And so this is why perhaps the Zen Master Dogen said, an ordinary person is deluded about enlightenment. An enlightened person is enlightened about delusion. Because it's really understanding our limitations, understanding where we get deluded or where we get caught, a problem. Understanding that maybe it isn't a matter of getting rid of them so much as understanding them from a new perspective, holding ourselves and being accepting of ourselves for our imperfections also. So there's kind of a radical shift that can happen in Buddhist practice. And the radical shift is one, maybe a simple way of saying it, of it being caught up in the midst of the drama of our life, to getting some little bit more wider perspective where we kind of see it or observe it. We observe it with the, I'm not, my wife tells me I'm not allowed to use the word spacious anymore. My wife, better listen. I've been limited. She usually has a very good sense. You say some words too much and they lose any meaning. But one of the things that happens is shift the perspective. It helps a lot with understanding limitations and uncomfortable situations and maybe frustration. When we no longer take it so personal, and when we think that our difficulties and the criticism towards us is really personal, and this is, it's me and it's something about me, then we tend to get caught much more and the power of the frustration is a lot greater. But the shift, when we still have the same limitations and still have the same things wrong with our life and along with society and everything, but the shift of perspective is we don't take it as quite as personal anymore. There can be a lot more ease in the situation. So there's a way in which Buddhist practice is not necessarily about changing the delusion, the greed and the hate. So much as it is getting a different perspective on it, that we're more accepting of it, we're more holding it within the complete, we're holding it within a view of this is what it is to be a complete human being. And what many people nowadays call accepting the spirituality of imperfection. And I say this because often Buddhism, the kind of way Buddhism is taught and described, it often lends itself to kind of spirituality of perfection. It's all about becoming perfect spiritually, becoming perfectly enlightened and living happily ever after, becoming perfectly compassionate, becoming perfectly serene, perfectly concentrated. And there's some truth to this, that Buddhist practice involves certain kind of development and strengthening of certain capacities within us. But I think that in the end, that there's a spirituality of imperfection and accepting ourselves for that we're not perfect and it's not going to happen. We are perfect and we're not going to become perfect. Get used to it. So, Alison says this very nicely, the perfection of imperfection. We can't get away from it. So what else would we like to say in common to all this? Yes, Phyllis? I'm not sure what you're looking for. When I got there, the good stuff is there was, there were too many volunteers, so we kind of threw in this maybe, we would use a cleaning. And so, I don't know why, but for some reason, I was the one who got good to do a lot of the cleaning. And so I found myself getting really frustrated, my bad, and so when you're talking, I thought, oh, you know, this is great, maybe talking about this. But it was really helpful to kind of just, you know, it was a different experience for me. I just maybe came there, like, kind of just tried to discuss it. You know, it made me take all the slices off the top shelf and clean up all this stuff. But it kind of got into it, and by the end, it really wasn't as bad. Thank you. Yes? Well, it's a month or two, and you're going to decide to leave the phone for us. Thank you. Nobody's quite yet. I'm finding that out to me. I'll try to be more aware of something that's bad. How would you classify a response like that? How would I classify it? But it's really deflecting. Oh, deflecting. Well, I mean, I'm not interested in that, but I don't know. Well, I mean, the way I heard that was it sounded like a healthy response, and perhaps it could be a responsible response. They've heard what was said. They're willing to listen to it. They're willing to incorporate it in their activities and reflect on it as they act in the future. So I thought it sounded pretty good to me, but I guess it could be a deflection. There's a way of kind of sometimes agreeing partially with someone to kind of diffuse it all. And so kind of the conversation ends, but you really haven't agreed to anything, and you kind of may continue with what you wanted to do. That seems like also an unhealthy strategy, if that's what you meant. Well, I'm just curious. I could see it going in both directions, you know. I'm not sure which monk you're talking about. But I'm sorry. Continue. I mean, could it be so extreme as to be classified as a reaction formation? I think it could be, yes. I think it could be a very strong reaction that is – you used the word deflection, I think it was a good word. To actually come back, it's partly agreeing in order to get the whole situation taken care of. I mean, some people agree so quickly because they're so uncomfortable. Oh, yes, I'll agree with whatever you say, just so you stop kind of criticizing me. And I could see that being very unhealthy, partly maybe based on fear, partly based on wanting to be left alone. I don't know. Yes? I think one way of avoiding that kind of response is to have the other person develop a practice of kind of repeating back what the person just said to you. Let's translate it. Show your understanding of it, too, though. This is what you meant to say, to the bishop. At least do that, and in that very act of translating that into language, I understand that kind of controlling the act. You're moving into a dialogue position for the other person. I think it's very good. Yeah, absolutely. It's one of the skills that they use in mediation, especially, is to have people repeat back. Yes, Marty? So a person could take something to heart and maybe practice more diligently, but in a very prideful kind of way to be an example or something like that. I mean, I never read that. I can't believe it. What a tricky ego. So there's a lot of Trumps, the practice in the That's why it's necessary to be sort of textually aware of what's going on. I just wanted to point out one of the interesting places to study a frustration, and then there were various strategies and responses we have to it. It's not necessarily in relationship to the world outside, but to the world inside, inside us. And particularly since we are a community of people who meditate, in relationship to our meditation practice. It happens from time to time, doesn't it? That you get frustrated in your meditation? And then, so how do you respond? Do you get aggressive? Do you get sulky? Yes, Bill? Just a personal clarification. These offenses that I was talking about in the Sutra, these are, I take it that these are violations of the laws of the Ranaiah, and they're like offenses for which they are scribed, not punishments, but Suppose that the violation is that the monk has been copulated, and he's out, in that sense. So this is a little more serious than you shouldn't be doing that. It's like you're in trouble. It can be. There's a whole range from the most serious. There's like four considered major offenses where if you do those, they don't even have to kick you out of the order. You're automatically not a monk for having done those. They're that serious. And then there's such things as, there's 227 rules. So they're graded whether it's really serious, somewhat serious, and minor. And some of the minor ones are such things that, like if you're a hem of your robe isn't completely lined up properly. That's an offense. So when I was ordained as a monk in Burma, I was ordained in the morning, and by about five o'clock in the afternoon, this other elder monk came up, slide it up next to me and said, oh, you have to make a confession. What did I do? I didn't do anything, you know? Your robe is a little bit off-center. So you have to hide through this old ritual. You have to get down on your haunches, and you have to go, sab de apatyaro karomi, which means obante, or elder. I would like to confess my transgressions. And he said, I couldn't believe it. He wanted me to do it for my robe. And most monks, you know, these really, that minor, they just let it go. No one says anything hardly, unless you're really... Am I deflecting responsibility? Ten years later, I'm still defending myself. Yes? Often when a child comes in and says, help him, or he does this thing, he doesn't think the child's going to accept his authority or listen to the rules. So it's sort of a mutual respect of the whole community, I guess. Everyone has to agree, and everyone has to have the same authority. That's beautiful. So to kind of translate this to the situation of the monks, it could be that these monks take these eight strategies, partly because the monk doesn't feel the community is going to respectfully listen to their side of the story. And so it's sometimes more complicated than just the monk, just the person. And so the ability of the community to listen to everyone. So listening, being willing to be uncomfortable, to listen carefully, take the time to listen is so important. Yes, Chris? I didn't hear you. You can be what? You don't have to be paranoid. You know when you've done something wrong, whether somebody else has seen you or not and criticized you for it, you're the first one to criticize yourself for these actions. And the reactions, my personal reaction to someone saying, you shouldn't have done that if the mind is the strongest when I know I should. So may all of you not experience too much frustration. And if you do, may you see it as the food for your practice.
