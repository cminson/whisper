 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome, welcome folks. It's nice to see your names and chats over there. Yeah. Okay, so yesterday I began with that formulation that there's a certain kind of the complications of goals, yeah, that we have goals, they give our life meaning, we don't achieve them. It's not great. We do achieve them. We lose the meaning, giving function of the goal itself. It's a different way of characterizing maybe dukkha, unsatisfactoriness, that wanting something is always different than getting it. And so the response to that is to turn meditation not into a goal directed pursuit. We see this in whole lineages, you know, just embody the Buddha or something like this. And that's real, that's real to sit without any sense of going or getting somewhere. It's an atelic activity, meditation. But meditation is also a tealic activity, to use that the language from Kiren's Ataya that I mentioned yesterday. It's also structured by goals, the goal of being free or more free. But the interesting thing about the way we make our way to that goal is we do, we make our way to that goal in an atelic kind of way. We're not pretending not to have goals exactly, but there's a sense of actually surrendering the goal making mind, the striving, the sense of being sandwiched in time between the past and the future. We make progress towards goals by giving up that orientation. And so we're aware, we're cultivating lots of spiritual faculties and cultivating the steadiness of mind, samadhi, cultivating a million things. But we do it all one moment at a time, and that moment is free of grasping and engineering and the desperation that we usually have around striving and goal making. So that's it. See what happens. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In the most general sense, our goals are wisdom, compassion, and to use Thich Nhat Hanh's language, understanding, love. Whatever progress we make towards the actualization of those goals, we can be happy with. So we just begin with a sense of the depth of aspiration, the reverence for those who have manifested understanding and love. And the sense of ourselves finding ourselves here in this stream, this lineage of understanding and love. And so there's an aspiration. But no urgency. We let go of our need to get anywhere, and in this way we get somewhere. Somewhere. Just pouring your awareness into your body. And blessing your whole body with awareness, blooming and buzzing, the constellation of sensations. All infused with the intimacy of awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All phenomena have liberation as their core. That's the Buddha. Every phenomena, every sensation or sound are a kind of invitation to know everything. But grasping, striving towards goals, makes things solid, gives everything a solid core. Not a core of liberation. And so we relax everything. Clanging always experiences a kind of friction, tension. We relax everything. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We practice being monastic in the sense that finally we're privileging awareness over our life. Over the relentless struggle to get our ducks in a row. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
