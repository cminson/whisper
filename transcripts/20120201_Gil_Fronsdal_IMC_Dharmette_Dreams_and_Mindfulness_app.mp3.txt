Dharmette: Dreams and Mindfulness

It occurred to me to say a few words about practicing 
mindfulness with dreaming. This topic comes up once in 
a while, especially from people on meditation retreats.  
There’s some idea that dreams are “The Royal Road to 
the Unconscious.” There are unconscious process ing, 
thinking, impulses,  and intentions operating in us. I don’t 
know if Buddhism has a theory of an unconscious , but it 
does n’t take a lot of reflection to realize that we certainly 
have subconsciou s processing inside of us that we 
aren’t really conscious of : our intentions , motives, 
feelings , and emotions. Or hormones  opera ting at 
different times that motivate us to think abou t or react to 
what we’re doing . 
 
Sometimes it’s a mystery to people why they do what 
they do , and what motivates them. P art of having a wise 
life is to have access somehow to the se deeper currents 
of thoughts , motivations , feelin gs and perceptions. Even 
with perceptions, we  don’t necessarily even perceive 
things as they really are . We often think we’re seeing 
objectively , but our perceptions are already overlaid with 
concepts, preconceived ideas, and bias.   
 How do we access thes e deeper currents  that drive s 
us? Some people believe  that dreams can be the  way. 
There are whole schools of dream a nalysis . It might be 
useful sometimes when  clearly remembe ring a dream  to 
analyze it , or reflect on the content. But f rom the point of 
view of mindfulness practice  – especially on retreats 
where  all we’re doing is mindfulness meditation – we’re 
not interested in analyz ing the content , or the thoughts , 
or the pictures  of the dream s.  
 
Rather, if there has been what’s felt like an impactful 
dream , the idea is to sit up in bed , and meditate with the 
emot ions that linger from  that dream. Whatever 
lingering feelings there are in the body  beco me the 
entry point. So you would sit up and feel, doing 
mindfulness of emotions . Feel them in the  body , really 
going into the  body, really feel ing what’s going on , being 
very present in the  moment . Put aside what happened 
in the dream . What lingers of th e dream in the present 
moment is what’s interesting. B e there and feel  that.  
 
For example, there can be dreams that are frightening . 
So then you would get up and sit with the fear, and be 
present for the fear. There can be dreams full of desire . 
Then you would  sit up with the desire. W hat lingers from 
the dre am becomes the focus of attention.  
 
This goes along with the basic principle of mindful ness 
– being present for what is, what your experience is – as opposed to what you think it is, or the analysis of it. 
Then you’re focusing on the body and on the  emotions  
– on what is  going on here . What I’ve found, for both 
myself and many people I’ve taught , is that it’s not that  
dreams are the “Royal Road to the Unconscious,” but 
it’s the body  that is . It is m indfulness of the body , being 
connected to  the body , and feel ing what’s going on 
physically .  
 
It’s doing  mindfulness of emotions  – and feeling the 
emotions in the  body . Then you learn how to hold that, 
and be present in a careful , direct way for what’s going 
on. Then, what opens up, what unfolds, what reveals 
itself is what needs to be known in some deeper way . 
You don’t  have to do a lot of analysis  – or even any 
analysis . Rather , it’s the careful, present m oment 
mindfulness that allows you  to begin feeling and 
sensin g in a deeper, deeper way what is actually 
motivating and driving you . 
 
The added benefit of feeling these things in the body 
allows them  to relax, resolve , dissolve, unfold, and 
settle out in a way that isn’t as easy  if we stay in the 
analytical mode  of trying to figure out, understand, 
analyze or interpret the dream , or whateve r else we’re 
involved in . If we settle and feel in a very simple way, 
eventually we can start seeing the places where we’re 
attached, where we’re ca ught, where we’re somehow 
frozen . And then we can begin to relax , relax , relax in a deeper way.   
 
Some people find that on a meditation retreat,  they stop 
dreaming . They might dream regularly at home , but 
something about the process of the retreats – 
something  happens , and  their dreams actually stop , or 
they don’t remember them . Other people find the 
opposite . In ordinary life they don’t remember their 
dreams , or the ir dreams are not very interesting . But o n 
retreat,  their dreams become more vivid , stand out , and 
are remember ed more clearly . Why is it different for 
different  people? Who knows all the  factors of the inner 
mental ecology that come  into play?  
 
There is neither a right way nor a wrong way to be . It’s 
not like you’re supposed to remember your dreams, or 
you have to remember them , or you shouldn’t have 
certain dreams . But if you’re interested in exploring 
yours elf in relationship to dreams through mindfulness 
meditation practice , then try sitting up in bed.  Sit up in 
bed; close your eyes ; or get up and do walking 
meditation. Be very present for what lingers, for what 
stays from that dream. See what happens  with that , 
what opens up.
