Dharmette: Everything Is Important

There is a Sufi story about M ullah Nasreddin, a wise 
fool. He has a garden but the garden is plagued by 
weeds. He tries to get rid of the weeds , but he has a 
hard time. He goes to visit all kinds of gardeners and 
master gardeners , and they all give him really good 
advice about how to deal with these weeds. He tries all 
of the advice. He’s very dil igent but it doesn’t work. H e’s 
at his wit ’s end about what to do about these weeds.  
 
He hears of this very old master gardener who works 
with the monarch of this realm. He makes it to the 
palace and finds this old wise gardene r. He explains the 
situation. He  explains all of the things he’s done to get 
rid of these weeds. The old wise gar dener thinks for a 
long time . Then he says “There’s only one more thing 
you can try. Love the weeds.”  
 
Maybe because I’m not a very wise gardener , I would 
prefer a little different approach. And that is, you don’t 
try everything first and then love the weeds. You love 
the weeds first , and then you try all of the different 
things you can do. Bring your love to what is there – to 
you, yourself, your challenges, your fear, your anger.   
You might have some little, smal l, idiosyncratic things 
going on in your little heart and mind that are a little 
challenging for you. You might have  things happen in 
your life which  are challenging. What would happen if 
you offered them your love first  – your kindness, your 
friendship, y our good will? And that’s the first approach 
to whatever is going on, to whatever is challenging, to 
have good wi ll towards it – to turn towards it with 
kindness, with gentleness, with tenderness, with 
respect.  
 
When I was a student at Stanford, I took a h istory  class, 
History of Japanese Buddhism . There was a lot to learn 
in that class , a lot of very rich history . Before or after 
class one day, I was talking to the professor . There was 
some aspect of Japanese history that we were learning 
that seemed kind of minor. I do n’t remember the details , 
but it was something like this: I said to him “Oh, so we 
don’t have to pay attention to that. That’s not important. 
That’s so minor. We can just put that aside.” He turned 
to me and said “Gil, everything is impo rtant.” Tha t made 
such a  big impression on me – everything is important.  
 
I studied in the Zen tradition. T he Soto Zen tradition has 
a pithy  little sound bite for some core aspect of their 
teaching, how the y practice. The expression is: a ttention 
to detail. It is very inspiring for me, very meaningful to 
be around people who offer care – and attention and love – to the details of their life.  
 
The first time I saw it in a Zen Center was when I was 
very young, I was just beginning to get interested in 
Buddh ism and Zen. I went to visit the Los Angeles  Zen 
Center. They met in a bungalow -like house in South 
Central LA. They were meditating in the middle of the 
living room of what used to be a house. It was a zendo. 
Maybe twenty people were there. The way they d id the 
meditation was they did a session of meditation , then 
ten minutes of walking meditation , then another session 
of meditation.  
 
We got up to do the single file walking meditation, 
walking around the perimeter of the room.  There was 
this woman walking  in front of me. She came to these 
black mats, the zabutons, which were all around the 
wall. One of them was slightly out of alignment with all 
of the other ones. She leaned down and straightened it 
out. My reaction was “why did she do that? Why in the 
world would you take the time to align a mat that was 
not straight?” I wasn’t even thinking about why I thought 
it should be left alone. This was attention to detail. 
Watching the Zen priests, the care with which they use 
their cups. They would hold and put d own their cups as 
if it was the most important thing. While they’re holding 
it, just that. Just be with it.  
 
All of these little ideas come together with the idea that maybe we can begin with respect, with love, with 
attention to everything. Everything is important. All of 
the people we meet. Maybe those people are important. 
It’s so easy to not see people as important, to not treat 
people as important, or that some peop le are more 
important than other s. We have probably all been in 
situations where there are people who are intensely 
engaged with each othe r. They’re  ignoring the people 
who are not involved in the conversation. Some people 
are not seen as being worth their  attention.  
  
There is another beautiful thing I saw as a very young 
Zen student. In 1979 there was a meeting of American 
Zen teachers. Many of them were Japanese. They had 
a meeting at Green  Gulch Zen Farm, where I was 
staying. They were having a business  meeting, talking 
about themselves. I don’t know what they were talking 
about. Because they were all there, there were about 
nine of them, they had a panel discussion with all of the 
Zen students one evening. I got to watch how they 
behaved. I remember wat ching one of the Zen teachers. 
Someone came and brought them tea as they were 
sitting there on the panel, at the table. One of the Zen 
teachers turned towards the person offering the tea as if 
they were the most important person at that moment. 
Not all the  august  audience sitting next to him. He was 
really there for that person.  
 
How do you meet your world? How do you meet your challenges? How do you meet the people in your life? 
The details of your life? What’s your first response to 
difficulties you have ? What about love? Rather than 
being the last response, what about the first response? 
What about respect? What happens if you treat 
everything as important? Your next breath? Your next 
in-breath  – as if this is the important thing for this 
moment.  
 
Whatever is in front of you, whatever the moment is, 
maybe it is the most important thing. Maybe it’s nothing 
to be discounted, thrown away, or dismissed. What 
happens when we live a life when everything we 
encounter is the most important thing of that mom ent? 
Every person we meet is the most important? What 
happens if every challenge we meet is the most 
important challenge for you to have at that moment? 
And so to meet that with care and respect.  
 
We see this on retreats a lot. Retreats are a very special  
place to be with yourself and practice. In that kind of 
environment, it’s very clear – at least to me. It takes a 
while for the people going through it. But teache rs have 
a different perspective . People have all kind s of things 
come up on retreat – all kinds of challenges that come 
up. It is just so great that we have this retreat 
environment to have challenges in. People think “Oh 
retreat. It’s supposed to be a place to bliss out.” I don’t 
know what people think.   
But maybe , “It’s the easy route to Nirva na.” So, if it’s not 
Nirvana by 4 o’clock , it’s probably not right. Y ou’re doing 
something wrong. But it’ s such a great place  to have 
challenges of all kinds , because  retreat i s this optimal 
opportunity to meet it with respect, with love, with care. 
Maybe your challenge at that moment is the most 
important thing for you to have. You don’t know what’s 
working through you. You don’t know what’s being 
worked out. You really don’t know what you need.  
 
I remember there was a person on retreat many years 
ago who  was having a very difficult retreat. So difficult 
that I, as a teacher, even thought , “Well, maybe this 
person shouldn’t be on the retreat.” This person had a 
lot of faith in the practice, really working hard. But I 
though t “I don’t know about this.”  I held my tongue. I 
didn’t say anything. About six months later the person 
came back and said “That was the most important 
retreat ever in my life. It was a really hard retreat. I 
learned how to be with difficulty. Then what happened 
was, in the last six mont hs, I had all of these personal 
challenges in my life , and I was prepared. That 
prepared me.” So, he didn’t know when he was going 
through those difficulties how important those difficulties 
were going to be.  
 
What if everything is important? Your challenges? The 
things that are most difficult for you? The d ifficult people in your life? To meet them with respect. They are 
important. To meet them with love. With good will. What 
would life be like if that’s how we went through the day?  
 
Those are my thoughts. Thank you all for coming. I 
appreciate all of you c oming here. Hopefully you have 
some good challenges. And if you don’t, that’s good too.
