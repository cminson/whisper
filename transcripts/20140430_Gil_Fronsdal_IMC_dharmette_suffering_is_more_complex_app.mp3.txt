Dharmette: Suffering Is More 
Complex

I would like  to offer you a little wisdom statement 
that may not be universally true , but I think it is 
broadly true. It is a useful statement to carry in 
your back pocket to reflect upon. That  is: 
“Suffering is always more complicated than 
freedom. Suffering  is alway s more complicated 
than peace. ”  
 
What I mean by this is that it takes extra effort 
on our part to suffer. If you are suffering in the 
way Buddhism understands suffering, it means 
that we have some kind of response or reaction 
– desires, wishes, aversions – some kind of 
reactivity to our experience in life. Without that 
reactivity, that involvement, then suffering 
wouldn’t be there. It is always there because of 
causes and conditions . Certain things have to 
come together for us to suffer. Suffering is not a  
simple, inherent part of life. It’s not that just 
because you are born a human being, you will suffer. Or that you are born with this shiny, 
perfectly round pearl  of suffering  that resides in 
your heart , and that  will survive you! You will be 
cremated and this little pearl relic of suffering will 
continue. No, suffering doesn’t have an inherent 
existence. Suffering comes together because of 
certain conditions.  
 
The primary condition you can do something 
about is how we get involved  in our suffering – 
how we react, how we get afraid, how we get 
tangled up in what is going on. That 
entanglement with things is the complication.  
 
Freedom is the disentanglement. Freedom is 
simplifying, being simple. For example, y our car 
gets bashed up in an accident on a rainy day 
because you hit a telephone pole . No one hit 
you; you hit the pole , and t hat’s embarrassing. 
Everywhere you go , you are in this dented up 
car, and your friends must wonder if you should 
even be driving. You start to take long roads to 
avoid your friends . You park far from their 
homes so they don’t see your car. If they do see 
it, you feel so much shame. That is the 
complicated world of suffering. To let go of that 
is just to have a dented car. You backed into  a 
telephone pole. That ’s all. Friends can think what they wish. You don’t have to hide it. Just 
keep it simple.  
 
Or, you are meditating and  your meditation is 
not working . If you are suffering because of that, 
chances are you have complicated it. A commo n 
complication people have is that they think they 
are going to get concentrated and that 
meditation is going to save them , and that t hey 
will reach a certain level of attainment; they will 
be a good person in the community. But  then 
they don’t get concent rated! Then  they are 
frustrated because of  this need about what is 
supposed to happen. So it’s a complicated 
relationship we have with meditation a nd what it 
is going to do in our  life. Let go of that. Then 
meditate. It ’s simple. You sit ; you take one or 
two breaths , and the mind wanders away. Come 
back , and do it again. It is very simple. You don’t 
have to make a big complicated story. Just be 
simple. There is a lot of freedom there.  Suffering 
is always complicated , and f reedom is simple. 
You might look at this and consider  it.  
 
The great Indian teacher Munindra -ji is famous 
for his slogan: “If it’s not simple, it’s not 
mindfulness.” We are not talking about 
accepting your life as it is  so that you can suffer better in a simpler way . You can progres s and 
become freer , but often it’s in a different way . A 
lot has to do with letting go. Letting go of 
complexity and complications. Letting go of the 
extra stuff we add onto our lives. Letting go of 
the second arrows we add. Unfortunate things 
happen to pe ople. And we add second arrows, 
making it more complicated than it needs to be. 
The bad things that happen are not necessarily 
the suffering; suffering is the second arrow.  
 
Suffering is something we can do something 
about. The primary thing is to be simp le. There 
is something really wonderful about simplicity. 
The characteristic s of simplicity are more peace, 
more ease , just being here.  
 
The simpler we get, the less there is that has to 
happen. The drive that something must happen 
belongs to that world o f complexity. The idea 
that nothing needs to happen is very intimidating 
to some people : “It can’t be that simple . It’s not 
enough just to be. Of course something has to 
happen. ” Look into that. What complexity are 
you buying into? What do you think has to  
happen?  
 How simple can you be? Maybe there are 
situations where you can’t be simple, like doing 
your taxes for example. I bet there are lots of 
opportunities in your lives for greater simplicity  – 
to appreciate it, to enjoy it, just to be!  
 
You might ca rry this slogan with you for the 
week: “Suffering is complicated; freedom is 
simple. ” See what it is like to be simple in the 
situation you are in. And if you are simple  – what 
would that mean? I s there freedom to be found 
in that simplicity?  
 
Thank you.
