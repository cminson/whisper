 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Here we go. Okay. All right. So hello and welcome everyone. Lovely to be with you. So many hellos we hide from around the world. Practicing our connection, our coming together on this earth. Practicing, practicing together. So the themes I want to bring in, maybe I'll just say a very quick word and we'll transition to meditating. And one is this appreciation, appreciation for this being who is me, being a character in this play called Life in a Particular Time, in a Particular Zeitgeist. I've been teaching at 7am about the improv of the Dharma, the Dharma of improv and taking on characters and seeing ourselves as a character. This kind of a character was showing up because of all these cause and conditions. So little lightness to the way we see ourselves, the way we relate to this being who is me. It's one idea I want to bring in and the other one is sense that, oh, this dear character, Metta for this dear character who's me. There's a particular time and the Zeitgeist that we're living in, this character is living in, listening to a podcast and some artist who was in New York at the particular time. It was a very creative time and they were just, you know, here we are. We lived through the famous COVID time and this is the Zeitgeist, just looking at us through that lens of, oh yeah, these are the characters. When we hear from different people, different generations, different things that have happened in time. Here we are living when the spread of the Dharma in the West is expanding so rapidly. Wow. It would be generations who would look back and say, wow, those people who lived at that time and the drama was really spreading in the West and they were just starting to have these online communities. So just appreciating ourselves, our efforts, our practice from this other perspective, from ways into the future, perhaps, anyway. So letting go of all that and let's just come to this moment in time to what we know right here, right now. Let's arrive together. And if it feels appropriate to close your eyes, to arrive, to settle in this body in this moment. And having metta, connecting with metta with goodwill, or this being who was me, this character in this play called life on this earth and this shape and this form, playing my part, being impacted by others, impacting others, doing the best I'm able to with metta for this character who's me, who has become me because of all the causes and conditions, genetic, historical, evolutionary, biological, so many causes and conditions. Wow. With tenderness, with care for this being who is me. Living this life they know. They know best. With each breath, appreciating. Relaxing, softening the body, the heart, taking your seat on this earth. I am here. This earth be my witness, I'm here. Doing my best. Cultivate kindness, wisdom, non-suffering, not causing suffering. As best as I am able. Letting this breath, the reality, waking up to this breath, the reality of this breath, make us present in this moment to this life. To this moment experienced only in the way we experience it. We sense it, we know it. Speak up, write awareness, not sleepwalking through our lives. you and there be a sense of delight, appreciation or awareness or consciousness in this moment being aware, knowing to be alive in this moment in time as it is perceived through our perception, through our senses you you stick it in As if we were watching ourselves from the outside, as if we were watching the movie of our lives, the way we watch historical movies, world wars or other historical dramas, and here we are, this period of time, watching the movie of our lives. We are the protagonist, doing our best. We know our hopes and aspirations. We know our challenges. We know the way we suffer. This protagonist suffers, we know. Can we watch this movie with compassion? Not with grief, but with compassion, with care, with appreciation, rooting for the character, cheering them on. Seeing tenderness. Maybe this movie slows down. Some particular moments, maybe we witness some of the challenges this protagonist, the protagonist of our story has had. We feel metta, feel compassion. Oh sweetheart, this was hard. Maybe we send them compassion and metta. Maybe we see some moments in the story where they're truly happy, intent, joyous, happy moments of their lives. We feel metta, we feel gratitude. Take your own time. We feel the same, that's what we're experiencing, metta, loving kindness, compassion, or the challenging passages, mudita, joy, maybe equanimity for the whole arc of the movie. Peace and ease, yes it's like this. And it's okay. See what your heart needs the most right now. Watch your practice. you you you you you you you you you you you you then see what your heart needs in this moment. It needs soothing. Let the practice of compassion lead. It needs uplifting. happiness for your own happiness as if you're watching the happiest moments of your life, your life on this reel, on this movie reel. Feeling happy for your own happiness with gratitude. Or maybe the tone needs to be just love, just appreciation. Or equanimity. It is like this, yes, the ups and downs, sense of peace, appreciating, simple days. The persistence, putting one step after another every day. See what your heart needs. And lean into those aspects of the movie of your life. It is nasshaj So if you think of you you you you you you you you you you see what seems like to arise as you're watching the movie of your life and the appropriate response is love, loving this character is doing their best, meeting joys, happiness in their life celebrating scenes of happiness letting yourself be happy reliving perhaps or being happy for those moments of happiness not so much reliving but monetizing gratitude arising with scenes of challenge, difficulty arise letting there be sucker, compassion, etc. another few minutes until we close the sit let your heart, your body lead, not your mind, not your thoughts appreciating the whole arc of the life of this protagonist who's here, of course, the story's unfinished yet to air live and yet with the perspective of the arc of the movie until now ups and downs, they keep trying they're doing their best to learn to be kind sometimes failing and it's okay for giving this character, for giving the story continues, you still have time to learn, cultivate kindness, compassion, forgiveness service, yay may we all know, appreciate the arc of our lives and know that we still have the chance as long as we're alive to learn, to contribute to cultivate, to wake up may all beings everywhere wake up to their goodness, appreciate and love themselves may all beings be free, including ourselves thanks everyone, thank you for your practice thanks for exploring this practice and in a novel different way we had never quite practiced in this way so many ways to practice so many ways to practice with the Brahma Viharas, the heavenly abones the four beautiful practices so the invitation tonight was to have a sense of perspective of ourselves the protagonist, as this play called our life and watching with the Brahma Viharas, watching scenes from our lives and whatever those scenes arise maybe they arise compassion, maybe they arise mudita, joy, yay maybe the whole arc of the movie gives rise to a conenity yes, ups and downs, ups and downs, yes this is human life, this is what it's like and always, always sense of metta always sense of good will, good will for this character it's trying their best so many, many things that might have come up and it's all good, it's all okay as long as there was a moment of kindness or compassion, or mudita, or any of the Brahma Viharas just one moment of it, it's all good it's all good, it's all planting seeds so with that I'd like to invite us to engage with each other in small group practice and the invitation, if you wish the invitation to participate in this way and of course you can participate in the groups but hold silence, hold compassionate, caring silence just show up with silence, that's perfectly fine and the invitation is maybe sharing a nugget, if you wish what was this like for you? it's okay to say I was sleepy, I didn't hear anything any instructions from the beginning, it's okay it's alright to just show up, it's perfectly fine having kindness for yourself, or anything else and you offer one brief nugget then the next person, the next person will come back to you, so you go around and around make sure everybody has time, so keep your sharing short and it will come back to you, so you can go around a few times and be kind, be kind to yourself, be kind to each other no asking questions, no directing, no giving advice just share what you want, share with, share silence that's perfectly fine, and so we really want to create safe spaces for each other so take care of yourselves, take care of each other I'm going to create the rooms now and and here we go, oh let's go alphabetically according to first name okay I'm opening the rooms, here we go...... are closed, everybody's back and we have a few minutes for reflections especially if you haven't spoken in a while in the large group I'd like to invite you to step forward and if you have spoken recently, step back so that we can hear from folks who haven't shared in a while, or ever so Amy please I love this perspective on looking at life as if we're like watching ourselves in a movie it's great, I think I'm going to carry that with me yay and it reminded me of two things, one is defending your life that old, there's an old movie where they're watching their lives after at the end and try to decide if they're going to go back to earth and do it differently and better, go on to something else it's a little bit of a cringing movie but it's similar in that way and then the other thing it had me thinking about was with internal family systems which is parts work where you have these different parts of yourself so as I was watching the movie I was like, oh there's this part of me wanting to do that and then trying to be compassionate and equinivitous about that and then this other part of me, the one's the opposite, oh that's cute, that's fun and then just kind of noticing all of it but trying to come from that Buddha, Dharma, Len as I'm watching it all, it's very sweet, thank you Thank you Amy, thank you so much, it was just so lovely getting goosebumps as you're sharing this compassionate perspective on your life and all the parts, and I'm familiar with IFS, internal family systems I love the framework, so to have that, I'm like, oh yeah that's that poor old sweetheart yes, yes, oh sweet, oh you won the complete opposite, oh you too sweetheart it's just, oh such a rich, thanks so much for bringing that in, love it and this movie you mentioned defending our like cringing movie I have never heard of it, so great, good to know there's some other frame that uses this I love it, that's great, this is awesome, thank you Amy Bill, please, and Lisa says thank you so much, it means a lot it's probably for both of us Amy, thank you Lisa the timing of it, Bill please what came up for me was gratitude, because I have a relatively newfound equanimity that has developed over the past year or so, and I went through some stuff today that would have bothered me much more a couple years ago, and now it doesn't phase me that much and I felt a great deal of joy over that, and it's because of the practice here of course thank you, yay, oh thank you so much Bill that just makes my heart so happy to know and then I'll see hearts showing up in the zoom space for you, oh my goodness this is so lovely yay, and clapping hands too, oh this is, we are, we're all celebrating your practice Bill, you are celebrating your practice, how wonderful to have the sense of oh yes more equanimities, something happened today that would have been really hard some time ago but look there's, wow progress on the path, this is so awesome Bill, yay, yay so happy making, see, so happy making, thank you Bill, this is so great may your deepening your equanimity continue, may it continue, it will continue you're practicing so there's no doubt, I have full trust, this is awesome people are asking what's the name of the movie, the name of the movie was the yes thank you Aimee, defending your life defending your life, PT, Kidacon are you saying that PT arose when you were practicing PT meaning joy arose when you were practicing, you're not quite sure about that but you can comment there, Sri Devi Hi Iike, really enjoyed the topic, so I have a, you know I asked a lot of questions so my question is I want to, you know, I'm most of, I like to be honest, so it seems that white lives are required by adults so I don't want to do white lives, so how do we say things, say the truth but at the same time, not hurt, I don't know don't hurt other person but at the same time it should be the truth Yeah, well truthfulness is, I actually recently wrote a piece on right speech, on why speech that just showed up, that just came out in lines for our magazine so you can look at that, but since it's a little off topic for today, what you're asking, but I will say that there are different guidelines for why speech and truthfulness is very important and it's important, not only truthfulness is important but even more so there is this idea of not causing harm, not causing harm so with the white lie, consider how are you causing harm, both to yourself, to others, is there a way to not cause harm and so it really becomes an inquiry but of course being truthful and factual is one of the, it's part of right speech and yet people often ask if say you were living during World War II and the Nazis knocked on your door and you were hiding people who were being prosecuted, do you have to be truthful, like in that well where's the harm, who's going to be harmed in what way, which is a really big frame and maybe in the cases that you're talking about maybe actually you're hurting your own integrity more by telling the white lie than actually just being honest and making yourself uncomfortable and making the other person uncomfortable, so through just a lot of considerations I can give just a one size fits all answers by just an inquiry for all the different questions that you need to ask all the different considerations for why speech you can look up the various considerations for why speech, there are multiple. Thank you. You're welcome. I look up to your article, yeah, thanks. Sure. And, oh, look, there is. I think there, Neil just shared a, an article. Oh, look at that it's already showed up. It's online. Okay. Thanks Neil. You are fast. Good heavens. That's so great. Please. I realized that I can't change my past, but I can change my reaction to it, the way I look at it and I can be compassionate about the past. Ruth, wise words. Thank you. Thank you. Powerful, powerful wise words. Wow. Beautiful. Beautifully said. Yes. Thank you so much for saying that so concisely powerfully beautifully. Wow. We can change our past, but we can change our reaction to it with more compassion, forgiveness, just the way. Yeah, beautiful. Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. And Fuzzall. You get the last word. Well, thank you for reminding me of that. Oh, anything else that was an appreciation for Ruth Fuzzall? Oh, wait, I lost you. Oh, there you are. You're muted there. No, that's all I had to say.
