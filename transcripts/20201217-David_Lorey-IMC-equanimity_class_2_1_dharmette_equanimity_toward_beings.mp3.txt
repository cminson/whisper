The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So again, a really good morning or afternoon, whatever it might be, wherever you are.
So as David said, we'd like to open it up for questions.
To some comments, we sent out some homework. We could read the Mahabharata Sutra,
about the elements, earth, water, fire, air, and Majamanakaya 140, about equanimity.
And just wanted to open it up if people had comments or questions.
And feel free for questions to raise the Zoom blue hand, your own hand,
or just unmute and speak. Everybody is practicing very careful speech here.
So feel free to just speak up if you'd like.
On Tuesday, Diana said we wouldn't be asking, we wouldn't be answering all questions,
but it sort of appears as if possibly we have.
I have a comment.
I wish I could have gotten these sutras maybe a week before the class started,
so I could have looked at them a little more carefully.
There's just so much in there, and it brings up so much forward.
And thought, I mean, this morning, just like an hour ago, I looked at a few new things.
I was like, oh my God, you know, how do I absorb this?
And also what came up, what I thought about was,
this is such a wonderful chance to do these kind of studies.
And I wish we could get a little momentum with this group maybe once a month or,
you know, get an introduction and then cogitate about it for a while
and then come back two weeks as a smaller group.
But I think people would be sort of happy to do that.
And so I'm just going to offer that out to the group to maybe think about.
Lovely suggestions. And it's nice to know you're getting the bug.
That's part of our objective. And just so you know,
we are planning a whole series of these in the coming year,
and we have dates mapped out.
And in some cases, we've started talking about the teachings.
And in at least one case, it should be possible to provide a suit
to well in advance for, you know, for reading.
So thanks, Chris, for that.
Yeah, another aspect of the art of sutra study,
or at least teaching it is that you saw,
if you looked at the sutras that we extracted relatively small pieces
out of much larger, more complicated teachings.
And so there's some art in deciding that that's appropriate,
you know, to not take it in the whole context.
And that's one more dimension of working with suit us.
I do.
Yeah.
This is the first time that I've done this,
like to be in a text like this.
And it says,
unrighteous greed.
And what came to my mind was, is there a righteous greed?
And what is there some kind of something I'm not getting?
Or how does that work?
Which one of my esteemed co-teachers want to go for this?
Talk about this.
David, you put your hand up.
Oh, did I?
I hadn't intended to.
Oh, okay.
I mean, I can say this.
Yeah, you know, one of the one of the really interesting things
about this practice is that there aren't judgments made,
for example, about, say, the self or selfing.
In other words, the implication is that there are skillful
and unskillful uses or skillful in addition to unskillful
uses of self in the practice and that the practice doesn't unfold
without skillful uses of self.
And in the case of greed, although we have a lot of associations
with the word greed, there certainly is a place in our practice
for wholesome aspirations.
And so conceivably that's sort of an aspect of that, you know,
a wanting, right, that can be a wanting for a wanting
that is consistent with the progress of the path until such a time
or a place or a moment in practice where even that can be,
even that wanting can be let go of.
Perfect.
I understand now.
Makes sense.
Thank you.
And Natalie, I see you have your blue hand up.
Thank you.
And hello, everyone.
Warm wishes from London.
And Tuesday's class, I love the phrase that was introduced,
equipoise.
And as I was taking notes, I kind of dotted the I in a rushed
and wrong way.
And when I came to revisit it, it almost looked like equipoise.
And that accident made me wonder if there's anything formally
distinct and meaningful about how balancing is frasily conveyed
in the Pali that I'm missing in the English translations.
So I guess my question is how does the phrasing or form of the
original itself express equanimity?
Kim, do you want to say something about them?
Well, I think the usual word for equanimity and it's actually
the same word for the Brahma Vihara and the factor of awakening
is upeka.
And that word literally means to look upon, I guess,
or to view from above, something like that.
So the word root to mean.
There is used in the later teachings, another word that is
Tattra Maja Tattah, and that is hard to spell and is also not
really used in the suttas.
It has more of an implication.
You can hear that word in the middle, Maja, like the Maji Manikaya,
the middle length discourses.
It has something to do with being in the middle.
And it has to do with being in the middle of this and yet being
balanced.
And so that's kind of the implication of that particular word.
And I didn't say it before because I wasn't sure how to place it in
the context, but since you've asked about the Pali.
So I think that's maybe another sort of intuitive understanding we can
have of equanimity is that there is something about being standing
aside and looking and having a big picture.
And there's also something about being right in the middle of
something, but not being distracted and jostled by it.
So maybe that helps a bit.
I don't want to add anything, Diana, please.
No, no.
I just love saying that we're a tetra Maja to talk.
It's just.
So I see that the Paseko and Henry have their hands up.
We're just going to spend a few, just a few more minutes with
questions.
And so probably we're going to end there.
So Mira, I see that you just put your hand up.
Okay.
Okay.
So the Paseko.
Good morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Yeah.
My question is the different flavors of equanimity that we've
been hearing about.
Is this like a conventionally accepted idea among
Buddhists or is this more of a more, more recent interpretation?
And just kind of wondering is that, is this very clear in the
suttas or is this something that's more of it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah.
So the suttas do not explicitly say, okay, here's this type of
equanimity.
That's part of a factor of awakening.
And here's a type of equanimity.
That's part of the Brahma vahars.
It's more comes out of people's practice.
Like the experience of equanimity in these different settings
have a little bit different flavor.
And maybe we'll unpack that a little bit more today.
But the Pali is exactly the same.
It's still the same word.
And it doesn't explicitly say that they're different in
different settings in the suttas.
And Henry.
Hi everyone.
Nice to be here.
Yes.
Good morning.
So I, maybe this is better felt kind of experientially, but I
thought I'd add that the Tattra Maja Tata is in the
Teravada Abhidhamma.
It's a universal wholesome mental factor.
So it's present in, present in building in all wholesome
states.
And in practice you do, you're going to get some equanimity.
It's there.
Fantastic.
Thank you.
Thank you, Henry.
And that was the last time we picked up this capstone idea,
which is also kind of reflecting that sense that its
equanimity is in small degree or big degree in all host of
wholesome qualities that as we practice,
we'll notice that.
Thank you, Ian.
David.
Yeah, you know, I think we can maybe start the first sort of
section of teaching today, which, which has my name on it,
but I'll do so by making sort of a segue from what Henry's
just offered.
And I think also from what the PASCO has,
has contributed, just to say that in last,
in Tuesday's guided, I think before or during or after it,
I sort of made the point that,
that equanimity doesn't have to be some far off goal,
but something that in a way we,
we invoke and we cultivate in the practice,
even when we close our eyes and bring our attention to what's,
what's here and now that,
that we're doing a balancing or as Ying put it,
describing the Chinese character,
letting go that has equipoise or equanimity in it.
And that, you know, the further exploration of that,
cultivation of that comes to have these different,
you know, these different applications as it were,
or flavors, which sort of connects with the PASCO's question.
So we wanted to turn our attention and I'm going to have to work
a little more quickly than I had expected,
but we love the questions and we could do just a whole class
of questions, but we'd like to sort of move our focus a bit
from the place of equanimity among the seven factors of
awakening and thus its orientation to sort of awakening
or wisdom and that aspect of the practice to the ways it turns
up in, as one of the Brahma Viharas,
one of the divine abidings,
one of the places of cultivating practice that,
that maybe speak more directly to the heart or that allow the
heart to speak, speak more directly or express itself or
find its voice, its own voice.
And we could do this using numerous sutras,
but we selected Majurna Kaya 7 known for taking its time
taking its title from or the title we conventionally give it
from the simile of the cloth that it contains.
And we sent around a version of this condensed version.
I should mention that I've condensed it and what I'm going
to bring up on the screen,
I further sort of edited to try to take the archaic gender
references out of it and kind of update them a little bit.
But let me look at my notes here.
So we're moving a little bit from the orientation of equanimity
as an aspect of how we meet our experience to how we perhaps
interact or regard other, other beings,
that part of our experience that maybe is social or that places
us in a natural world of other, other creatures.
The simile of the cloth from which the sutra takes its name
and I'm going to sort of bring up the sutra and I'm going to
move through it quickly and I hope that I can do so without
making people dizzy or making things sort of too confusing.
But the simile of the cloth is referred to twice in the sutra
here at the beginning where it's used and we love these,
we love these similes, these images that come to us because
they're frequently still relevant or they still make sense.
And this idea that the mind has imperfections and that when the
mind is cleared of these imperfections or again referring
to Yin's idea about letting go from the Chinese character
discussion on Tuesday, that when these imperfections are let go
of or loosened, that the mind becomes ready and prepared,
that it, that it's open, that it is ready in a sense for,
for practice and for the teachings to settle in and make a
difference, make their transformative presence known in
various ways.
And when a, when a practitioner has, it says in Majama
Nakaya 7, given up and let go, I think we can replace a lot of
these words with a synonym, let go, relinquished, relinquished
various imperfections of mind.
I love too that they're not like marks of evil or sin,
but just imperfections, you know, nothing more or less
important than daily regular imperfections that we all
confront, that when the mind is clean that way, clean like a
cloth, that unwavering confidence in the Buddha, in the Dharma
and in the Sangha, which isn't mentioned here, can, can arise.
And we then enter a path of practice.
And this refers, or this has a resonance with the question
that David asked at the end of the session last time about,
and we sort of responded by saying, you know, various of these
texts, it's not maybe that they're inconsistent, but that
they invite us to explore the practice in a lot of different
ways. And many of them present paths of practice or different
ways in and through the practice that give us kind of
alternate views of what's possible.
And they may fit some temperaments better or fit practice
at different times in the long cycle and trends of practice
in better ways or more productive ways at different times.
But they offer things to us that we can make use of when
they're appropriate and we can make use of them or sometimes
they just arise for us.
When these things have happened, when the mind is, when
there's letting go of some of the just imperfections of mind
to get in our way, get in the way of practice, then a
meditation practice is possible that opens up wonderful
possibilities. And as the meditation practice is
referred to here, when gladness happens in the mind as a
result of confidence in the teachings and some sense of
the proof of their validity and their efficacy, rapture
comes. When the mind is experienced as rapturous, the
body becomes tranquil and with that tranquility, a wholesome
pleasure, a pleasure that doesn't rely on external conditions
arises. And in one who feels this pleasure, the mind becomes
collected still. And sometimes we say concentrated.
And then we find ourselves in this condition available for
the arising of the Brahma Vihara, these divine abidings of
which there are four. And again, I expect most people here are
aware of them or know of them. The sort of heartfelt, wholesome
arising of benevolence toward all beings, compassion, the
ability and the interest in accompanying other beings in
suffering. Karuna, sometimes translated as sympathetic joy,
but we can think of as parallel to compassion and ability to be
fully present when other people are experiencing letting go or
when other beings are free. And then finally, equanimity,
appearing again in this sort of capstone position, if you will,
as the fourth of the four Brahma Viharas. And a practitioner
finds themselves pervading or that the mind, the practitioner
abides pervading, where is it? I can't find equanimity. There
it is. And as all two themselves, a practitioner abides
pervading the all encompassing world with a mind imbued with
equanimity. And I would just point out that these references
to directions to one quarter are a way of referring to what
we're taking as the cardinal directions of the time. We might
say east, west, north and south, straight up into the heavens,
straight down to the center of the earth. These six cardinal
directions, these quarters plus, so above, below, around and
everywhere to all as to themselves, a practitioner abides
pervading the all encompassing world with a mind imbued with
equanimity, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility,
without ill will. Interestingly, this is a wonderful state of
mind to be found in the meditation practice, at least as
they're developed here in this sutta. But they also can lead,
it can be a field for additional things. In this brief
mention, there seems to be an implication that this
meditation practice, this arising of the Brahma Viharas can
be associated with, with its arising can also arise a deep
and clear seeing of things. This appears to be a reference to
the four liberating insights or Four Noble Truths as they
come down to us in various texts. And this paragraph seems
to imply that in this state of mind, a practitioner can find
a great, really deep letting go, a very profound way of being
more awake, more free, more, more full heartedly engaged in,
in the world, one's own world in the world that includes
other beings in it. So that's a brief trip through Majnu
Kaya 7. And one thing that's not in this condensation, this
version that I, I condensed, I should say, and I changed the
references to bhikkhus and he just to kind of bring it up to
date. One thing that I didn't mention that I really love and
that I have a second, it looks like I have, yeah, a minute to
read is, is this passage just to give you a sense of how
earthy and lovely some of these things can be. A bhikkhu, a
practitioner who finds themselves in this state of mind, this
state of gathering, collectiveness and stillness of mind,
it says here, with the mind cleared of imperfections like
that white cloth, says, this, this practitioner can eat food
consisting of the choicest hill rice with various sauces and
curries. And even that's not an obstacle for this practitioner.
In other words, even those things can be enjoyed fully as
part of being in the world and then fully let go of. So it's a
lovely thing to think that this, this, this deep and profound
meditation practice also has this very real world expression
that it allows us to be, to live fully, to find our own voices
express the heart fully delight in others delight, delight in
our own light, the light in our own delight and be prepared to
to let go of it all. So yin, that's my teed up for your, for
the guided meditation.
