The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
For the practice of Mudita, this sense of continuous, you know, like feeling delight and joy for the continued prosperity and happiness of other people.
And it reminds me, you know, I was just reflecting on what other moments, you know, moments that we just don't even notice that Mudita is arising or that, you know, is what is happening.
It's like when you receive a call from a dear friend or even from someone that you've heard have been having a hard time or maybe not, but something happens, something fortunate, you know.
And you're like, no, oh my gosh, I'm so happy for you. Or, oh, great. Or you just see like suddenly a smile or something relaxes in your body and your face like smiles a little bit.
Oh, oh, great. That's great.
Other moments in the Sangha that I have felt, I have a sense of Mudita is like when we see other people talking or sharing or and there's like a connection or someone is giving something and the other person is receiving it.
Or there's an attentiveness as seeing each other.
And you're just looking from the distance, you know, it's like, yeah, it's like, oh, this is great how we're connected in the path Mudita.
So now we're going to continue today. Today we're going to practice with a neutral being. We have practiced already with an easy person with a very dear friend benefactor.
And today we're going to practice with a neutral being.
So let's, you know, sometimes let's have in mind sometimes, you know, just to plan the seed. I just, there were two thoughts in my mind that crossed at the same time.
And they didn't know I did it. Well, do I go this way? Do I go that way?
So, you know, there, there are some people saw some beings in our lives that we see like very casually, or we may see like one time, we just don't don't know them.
Deeply, there's not a strong connection of knowing this person. There's not like wanting to connect. There's not not wanting to connect. It's almost like kind of in between like, neither, neither one.
It could be someone at the store. It could be someone at the post office someone that just walk by when you're walking outside or moving outside or and someone said says good morning or just their presence passes by.
And they said, you know, I can include also pets or other, you know, non human beings that you may encounter.
But there may be people that we may consider neutral is interesting. We may consider neutral.
And at some point they stop being neutral. So, today, you know, if you can just see how it is how it is for you when we're practicing how it is.
As, as you consider you choose a neutral person, someone that again that isn't in in that place of yeah, there's not a strong preference a strong connection.
And you want to wish will be tied to them.
You know them, but it's not like you don't. There's not a strong social connection. Let me say.
Let me say it that way. It could be like you're completely disconnected. I didn't mean that.
So let's meditate and I will guide you and let's see how it goes. And at any point, you know, trust your practice and let your practice guides you.
Okay.
So arriving settling in here.
First, you know, establishing establishing mindful knowing mindfulness, knowing that you are aware.
Aware in this body, having a sense felt experience of the connection of the body with where he's making contact with where you're sitting, standing, lying down.
Even if you're moving when you're walking or moving in on any other ways, it's okay. Being aware.
Maybe taking two or three breaths.
Yes.
Being received by community here.
Maybe bringing a sense of appreciation for your good fortune to be able to connect in this way and practice together.
A sense of gratitude and appreciation to all of us.
And including yourself, appreciating yourself in any way you can.
The sincerity and dedication of your practice to cultivate this mind and heart.
Emotions may arise and pass.
Or thoughts. Oh, I have to do this or what are we practicing? Just showing up is enough.
And this is your time here. Other things can be attended later.
Now is the attending of the heart, the attending of this dear mind.
This dear body here.
Bringing awareness as you're receiving the sound of my voice.
Receiving sound or physical sensations.
It tells you you're being embodied here, your presence, embodied presence.
Practicing Mudita. Sympathetic or vicarious joy.
Appreciating the beautiful qualities, inner qualities of your inner Sangha, your virtues.
Being delighted.
It's nice to start with some Mudita for us if possible.
Then we move through other categories, but just to check, appreciating yourself and celebrating.
With delight, your presence here, virtues within you.
Having a celebratory heart.
Delighted in being here.
That's enough for Mudita to arise.
Having a felt sense.
Having a felt sense of some kind of Mudita joy for yourself.
It doesn't have to be anything huge or big or small, however it is, whatever arises.
Just having the felt sense of experience that Mudita is when it arises within you.
As you breathe in and as you breathe out, now you can imagine if you would please.
You're just going about and around doing an errand.
You see you have a felt sense and a clear image of you doing this.
Then you meet and suddenly you just see this first very easy person that when you see, you smile.
As you are with your plans to do anything, just to see this person, easy person, bringing it to mind.
You smile and there's some joy to see this person.
Then you start talking and this person tells you how their day went by and how wonderful it was for this person this day.
It could be very basic, very simple.
You just feel happy for them and say, I'm delighted to hear this. I'm delighted to see you and know that you're okay and enjoying this good fortune.
May it continue, may it continue this happiness.
Then this person says, well, great to see you. I have to go and you're there in a moment and you're having a celebratory heart.
Maybe like, I'm happy for this person.
Then you just notice that there's Mudita within you and like, gosh, what a good fortune to see this person.
I didn't know I was going to see them.
Then there's some kind of Mudita. That's great. I haven't seen them in a long time. It's great. I was able to see them today.
And there's some Mudita arising.
Take a moment to see how it feels, how it is sensed as you are here.
And then now you continue your day or you continue your day here.
And now there's this, maybe a neutral person, a person that you have seen before.
But you don't even know their name, where they live, but you recognize them.
Maybe you can bring the clear image of this person to your mind and heart.
A neutral person from all walks of life.
A person at the store, a person asking for money at the traffic light.
Someone behind you in the line to buy something, pay for something.
Everyone may have a moment of Mudita no matter where they're coming from.
Just seeing the sun just being treated with care and kindness.
So having a felt sense of how it is that you are feeling towards this person as the image is in your mind.
If it is in the heart that there's something coming up in the heart area or on the throat or belly or just relaxing in the body or not.
That can tell you how neutral this person is.
And now you can offer some phrases to this person.
May the happiness, whatever happiness in your life, whatever good fortune arises in your life, may it continue.
I am delighted, delighted for you, delighted for your happiness, your good fortune, your success, whatever success is for this person.
Whatever happiness is manifested, however it is manifested for this person, may it continue.
Not having to choose one way or another.
This person knows and you're happy for it.
May your happiness continue when your good fortune continues and grows.
May your happiness continue when your good fortune continues.
I am delighted for you.
As you breathe in and breathe out, I am connecting how it is that you are aware also of how it is for you wishing Mudita to this person.
How it is felt in the body, mind, heart.
And if you sense, you know, a strong contraction, something that is arising, and you see like, maybe this is, Mudita is not happening, it's okay.
The way to practice then is coming back to your mindfulness practice.
Recognizing, naming, giving respect and honoring what is arising, meeting it, getting to know it.
This is, this is worry or this is concern or this is happiness.
Oh yeah, it's, it's lighting up, yeah, happiness is arising.
Sometimes worry comes in or annoyance may come up.
It's not that strong or maybe strong, however it is, practice with it a little bit.
And when it stops being predominant, you can go back to the Mudita phrases as anchors could be your anchor, these phrases for this person, neutral person.
Or you can go to Mehta and meant from Mehta, then shift to Mudita.
Trust your practice, this purification practice.
I'll be silent now if you want to repeat the phrases that I offered or include phrases that you can create for this neutral person.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm wishing Mudita to a neutral being.
May your happiness continue and grow and be with you, this happiness.
May you see it and recognize it.
Thank you.
So now, letting the image of this neutral being fade away.
And shifting the attention to rest in this body, see how are you right now.
What is being received in this body as physical sensations.
Checking in the attitude in the mind, the flavor in the mind, if you would say.
Just to know it, name it, nothing to analyze.
Checking in if there's any emotion arising and passing, what is the state of the heart.
Again, naming it, respecting, giving space to whatever is moving through.
As this body breath itself, or as you listen to my voice.
And now bringing back the intention of continuing with Mudita.
Now, maybe sending Mudita, radiating Mudita to all of us here in all directions.
Or maybe using the phrases however you wish.
Just delighted you're here and happy for you that you have this time to practice.
May your good fortune continues.
May it grows. May it prosper.
And as you're sending Mudita to all of us here, radiating in all directions Mudita.
Guess what, you're receiving too, because we're sending Mudita to you too.
So take it in. Take it in these wishes of may your happiness however it is, may it continue.
May we bask in this collective delight of Mudita for all of us.
I'm delighted, delighted to be here and witness, witness your good fortune.
May it continue and never leaves you.
May it continue.
So now, checking in, checking in as we offer the last phrases of Mudita to all of us here.
The felt sense of embodied Mudita.
How it is sensed in the body? Where is felt? How it is felt? What sensations are being experienced?
And continuing with your mindfulness practice now, just to take in how it is that practicing Mudita.
Impacts this physicality, the mind, the heart.
Impacts this physicality.
So now as the bell, the sound, the sound of the bell arises.
See how you receive it, no rush, no rush to receive the sound.
Take it in, receiving the rising and passing.
Take your time to connect, open your eyes and look around.
Bells.
Thank you, thank you everyone for the practice being here, practicing Mudita.
And now I want to do something different today for the benefit of some of you that may not wish to, though is encouraged to participate in breakout groups, not yet, it's not happening yet, don't leave yet.
That maybe we can share now, you know, how, how, how was for you?
And then we can go into breakout groups and then we can go back and share again. But just few minutes to give the entire community an opportunity to see how was for you.
Yes Nancy please.
Thank you Bernie.
That was really beautiful, thank you.
I was thinking about Mudita, the people that you know, sort of, but don't really know. And feeling I got was such a sort of open, spacious feeling about letting go of any preconceived notions or, you know, initial judgments you have about
people when you meet them, and just being able to share some kindness and some graciousness towards them.
So yeah it was lovely for me, thank you.
Thank you for sharing.
Anyone else?
So not to have preconceived ideas like Nancy was saying, did Mudita flow?
Yes.
Okay, so, oh yes Neil please.
You know, so, so the one thing that struck me the most was, you said, you know, when you were doing for like, right a stranger or some neutral person, you know, you're like, see if you feel it in your heart see if you feel it in your stomach, you know, and if you don't, that's a statement about how connected you are to that person.
I thought that was very interesting to kind of use your bodily feedback as like a way to examine your mind, rather than, you know, assume you're a crappy meditator, you know, whatever.
Thank you, thank you.
No question, just, I thought it was interesting observation, an interesting statement.
Yeah, it was a provocative statement.
Because sometimes, and, you know, I wanted to see how, you know, when we practice we and we go into the phrases sometimes we just go into the phrases and forget that there's a body here that you know there's an interplay between what is happening and also other other other things that arise in our minds, you know.
And, you know, for someone that we really don't, I mean, like, it's like really a total stranger.
It may like, you know, like really pass as may your happiness continue.
Now, I give you an example.
I was eating some something.
I got something that I bought something to eat.
This person that attended me, total stranger, I have not seen them in, never.
And I had a sense of modita for them.
I was like, wow, you know, he, he was like, I don't know, like enjoy, there was something about how he was engaging in the work that it was like, he may be enjoying this.
I really am happy for him.
Until, in one moment, in some moment, long time after, I asked for something and I waited and waited and waited at the beginning.
You know, I remember the modita.
I was feeling, you know, this is, it's very dedicated.
And I could see the change in the mind, the mental process, you know, changing.
And it was through the feedback of what sensations I was feeling, I was feeling that the modita and at the same time, something was cooking, you know, there, you know, so I dropped that question for all of you, not only for that example that didn't come up,
but just giving you an example of how it is that it's been for me and how I apply that question.
So thank you, Neil.
Yeah, it's interesting.
Okay, so now for any,
one that would like to, to participate in the breakout groups, unless we're going to get ready here.
If some of you leave, thank you for your practice and let's just see who stays here for, oh, Shakti, yes.
I just had one quick query about the process.
Okay.
When you're talking about may your, may the happiness you have kind of grow and spread and stuff.
What if a person you encounter doesn't seem happy? I mean, how does that work? How if they're, if they don't have a base, you don't sense happiness in them.
Yeah, well, two, two things I would say, and then we can definitely less less than going to breakout groups.
It doesn't mean that that being would not have moments of happiness and good fortune in their lives.
It may happen that in the moment this stranger or any other person that you will not, you know, that because they're having a hard time or having a hard life,
it means that we interpret or, you know, conditions happen to be that they will not have one moment of your, one moment of happiness or delight.
So are we going to exclude them of Modita because they're having a hard time? It may not be permanent 24 seven.
So that's why it's actually that also, you know, to see the whole range, whole range of people, strangers that we meet and, you know, you too, may you have Modita, you too, may you have Modita, everyone.
So I hope that that answers your question. And now we really need to go into.
Yeah, thank you. Sorry for that late question.
No problem. No problem. So let's go ahead and let's see. We're all in groups.
And so we'll have this has eight minutes.
Yeah, eight minutes with a seven. Okay. And come back to share how how was for you to share your practice of Modita more in a group. Okay.
Here you go.
Okay, coming back, coming back.
And I hope you enjoy your conversation.
And maybe having one person sharing were almost at the time to leave but just want to give an opportunity to someone else and to be continued tomorrow.
And I may say something to Shakti if you show up tomorrow about your question, Shakti.
Anything else?
Any takeaways?
Yes, Michael.
There's can you hear me? Yes.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you for your wisdom and the small groups and deep bows for you to rising to the occasion to teach all these Dharma offerings. I am I'm seeing your name all over the schedule. So I think it's very important for me to thank you.
Thank you. Thank you, Michael. And, you know, it's a joy is Modita supporting dear friends that are in. Yes. Anyway, thank you so much.
So may the benefit of your practice. Yes. May you receive it with lots of Modita and may benefit everyone you come in contact with everyone without exception, if possible, without exception.
May all beings be free. May all beings be happy. May all beings know peace. May all beings know peace.
And now, if you want to unmute and say goodbye.
See you later.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your practice.
Thank you. Thank you for your practice.
Thank you. See you tomorrow.
