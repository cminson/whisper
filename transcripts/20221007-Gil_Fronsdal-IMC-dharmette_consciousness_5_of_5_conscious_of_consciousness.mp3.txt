So we come to the last talk on this five-part series on consciousness, and I've emphasized that I don't really know what consciousness is, but I have a premise and assumption that it's not a thing. 
It's not an entity, it's not its own standalone thing that can exist independent of anything else. 
But it's a little bit more like a hologram, maybe. 
A hologram can seem very real or very fascinating, and it can be a hologram of a real object, but the hologram image doesn't exist except as a hologram. 
And so consciousness is a little bit like a hologram. 
It's kind of the combination of all the different forms of faculties of attention we have, combining and working together, or being gathered together by the mind's capacity to construct, the mind's capacity to have an image or a sense or an idea of the whole. 
And this is part of what the mind does. 
It's a constructing apparatus. 
It's reconstructing, constructing our ideas of the world, ourselves, all kinds of things. 
That is a necessary part of being in this complicated world that humans live in. 
And we sometimes will reconstruct things inaccurately. 
We can see something then in the first glance, we think it's a snake, in the next glance we look at it and it's actually a stick on the ground. 
And so the mind is reconstructing things. 
And so it's kind of like the hologram, that all these pieces. 
But it's a beautiful thing, consciousness. 
And it's very valuable. 
It's wonderful to abide in it and have the clarity, because when awareness or consciousness feels very clear and relaxed and not entangled and caught up with all the concerns that we have and the objects of attention, then the consciousness can have a sense of clarity, of openness, spaciousness, peacefulness, qualities of freedom, qualities of happiness. 
It can be a kind of a rich world that seems to be in and of itself independent of what is known. 
And when the mind gets very calm and quiet in meditation, where we're not engaged with our thoughts, engaged with things of the world, sometimes it becomes very clear, or a very clear sense that there's awareness but no object of awareness. 
It's almost as if awareness stands out by itself, consciousness conscious, but not conscious of anything in particular. 
That hologram can be that clear and pristine. 
And in my meditation practice on retreats, when it came to such clarity and pristineness, I went to my teacher and said, I don't know if I'm supposed to be a Buddhist, because Buddhism teaches that everything is in constant, changing and impermanent. 
And I see that for everything except for this thing, consciousness, that seems to be everlasting and permanent. 
And rather than debating with me or explaining it was different, my teacher just said, keep practicing, keep looking. 
And so I kept practicing with a lot of confidence and faith in this practice until the point came that I saw that consciousness also is in constant, can disappear, can vanish. 
And its vanishing didn't mean that I died. 
But rather there was a marvelous, unprecedented kind of experience of freedom. 
And it can seem very frightening and unusual to have this kind of consciousness disappear and to experience that freedom from that. 
But I think it's one of the reasons why in Buddhism we don't reify consciousness as a thing, in the early Buddhism, the kind of basis where I'm teaching from, where consciousness is not seen as a thing, or reified, or permanent, or transcendent, or something that lasts after we die. 
Whatever consciousness is, it itself is part of the in constant, changing nature of this world we live in. 
And the freedom we're looking for is not the freedom for an experience of anything, including consciousness, but something which is almost a non-experience, which is in between all experiences, which is freedom, the absence of clinging. 
And that is the most marvelous thing there is. 
And at least for me, more marvelous than this radical purity of awareness and consciousness. 
So as the Buddha teaches mindfulness practice, he's teaching all these different forms of attention that we can do. 
He teaches recognition, clear knowing, clear recognition of what's happening. 
So important not to be overlooked, not to be bypassed. 
He teaches sensing, the kind of embodied feeling of experience, sensing of experience. 
He teaches sensitivity to the pleasant and unpleasantness of experience. 
He teaches observation as watching, seeing, abiding, resting in a seeing of things. 
And when all these become stronger and stronger, more developed, more highlighted, less agitated, less preoccupied with our concerns, then at some point awareness begins standing out in highlight. 
So much so that we know that we're aware. 
You know, if I'm driving in the freeway and things are difficult and I'm late, and I'm trying to deal with traffic and trying to get ahead of all the other people because I'm late, I'm not really aware that I'm aware. 
I'm aware of the cars around me. 
And in that sense, my awareness is impoverished. 
But to be aware of awareness, that is a wealth. 
That is fantastic. 
So finally, when I get off the freeway and I decide I'm going to kind of meditate for 10 minutes before I go to my meeting because I'm all frazzled, then maybe everything quiets down enough. 
At some point, I know that I know. 
I know I'm present. 
I know that I'm feeling. 
I know that I'm seeing. 
And so there's a kind of a higher order understanding, knowledge, perception that we perceive that we're perceiving. 
We know that we're perceiving. 
And at some point, this sense of awareness, simple, spacious kind of sense of what receives all perceptions, all phenomena, kind of the medium through which it goes and has no resistance to anything like the hologram doesn't resist anything. 
Everything comes through that door of the hologram, maybe, to us. 
And that sense of awareness can become strong, so strong that it becomes more interesting or more kind of the focus of attention. 
It itself is a focus of attention instead of all the things in the world. 
And it's kind of a paradigm shift for some people because some people's mind, their whole life, has been concerned about things, objects of attention and objects of thought and just always kind of navigating the world of objects and things and aboutness, what we're thinking about. 
But the paradigm shift is to take a break of occasion for the mind from focusing on something to resting in itself. 
Awareness, resting in awareness, awareness, knowing awareness. 
And in early Buddhism, we're not reifying, celebrating this as being ultimate in the final answer to everything. 
But rather, it's a, there's so much letting go, so much ease, so much trust in that place, that sometimes we'll find that it's massaging or it's working, even unconsciously, it's massaging the places of clinging and holding deep in our psychology and our mind. 
And providing kind of the trust to prepare us for the time when the mind is ready, the heart is ready, to let go of the deepest attachments, the deepest clinging that we live by. 
And so this experience of awareness, of clear awareness that the Buddha focused on is there as a platform to help this deep letting go. 
And the word the Buddha used for this clear awareness, I like to translate it as lucid awareness, is pati sati, p-a-t-e-s-s-a-t-i. 
And pati sati is this awareness that's so clear and present that we know that we're aware. 
There's a clarity around it that we sense. 
So the Buddha taught many forms of attention and that are leading to a deeper and deeper concentration and simplicity of mind, simplicity of attention. 
And it's a beautiful process to do this. 
And there are other factors that come to bear that influence this experience of simpler and simpler awareness or consciousness. 
Other faculties of the mind that affect the faculties of attention. 
And we can maybe call those attitudes, the attitudes by which we're aware. 
And so I thought that maybe we can continue this kind of series and maybe next week we can look at attitudes with a look at how attitudes might play a role in how we know the world, how we know ourselves. 
So thank you very much and I hope that you have a nice weekend and maybe this weekend can be a time when you give time to be curious about the nature of awareness itself, the nature of consciousness. 
Not to think, figure out what it is, but to see what is it about awareness, what is it about consciousness that it is possible to rest in, to abide in. 
And maybe you can find sit in a park or someplace looking at the sky or the clouds or something, someplace safe and reassuring, assured. 
And kind of explore what is this, what would it be like to rest in awareness. 
Thank you all.
