Practice Note : Being Actively Present

Probably one of the biggest issues to deal with or 
overcome in meditation is the mind that wanders off  in 
thoughts about the future and the past. It’s interesting to 
study that phenomenon  and understand how it works. 
There  is often a kind of passivity to it , where we find 
ourselves wandering off for a few moments, a few 
minutes, a few hours, or a few years . In that passivity 
where the mind wanders off , we find our attention is 
either highjacked , taken over , or lost to whatever  
concerns we might be having. There  may even be a 
relinquishment of our own agency , or our ability to direct 
our attention , or in a s ense be in charge of it.  
 
So there is an active part to mindfulness meditation 
where we try to overcome that pa ssive way in which we 
slip off. Sometimes it’s not so passive . People may  
choose to go off in thought. But instead of being  
passive, the idea is to be  more active in staying  present  
and being here. There is  an awakening of an active 
choice  or intention of, “Let’s be here.”  
 
It’s not always recognized  that active qualities are 
needed , because people sometimes just want to be soothed in medi tation. It’s a busy day ; the mind is  busy ; 
and they just want to relax and take it easy . The 
emphasis on relaxing  and settling in  is sometimes  
conducive to the mind feeling like it can just wander off 
freely back into its thoughts.  
 
Often  when we bring in the idea of being actively 
present, keeping the attention on the breath and on the 
present moment, then that  become s a magnet for all 
kinds of issues and attitudes we have about doing 
anything. When we do something, we have agency and 
apply ourselves, and then there are a lot of issues 
around : “I’m the one who’s doing it ;” “I can’t do it ;” “I 
have to do it;” “I have to prove myself ;” or “I ’d better be 
the best one.” There might be attitudes around success 
and expectations, and so there are  attitudes of “I have 
to try hard ;” or “I can’t really do it , so I’ll just kind of try.” 
All kinds of attitudes can come along when , “I’m the one 
who’s going to do it.”  
 
Part of what happens in meditation  is that  we have to 
bring some active agency to be a ttentive in the present 
moment . Then , over time , we begin discovering  all the 
ways we make that more complicated than it needs to 
be, u ntil we let it settle away , and just be actively 
present – here – without a lot of tension, striving, giving 
up, complace ncy, or ways in which we might tie it to a 
sense of self.  
 With time , we learn to bring an activity of being attentive 
in a very simple way. Initially  there’s always an active 
side to being attentive. But w hen our attentiveness gets 
strong enough , then at some point it almost takes over , 
and we don’t have to make so much effort anymore. It 
becomes effortless effort. Maybe we could say our role 
becomes more passive , and we have to get out of the 
way and relax. But i nitially , there has to be th at active 
quality , because if we’re too passive early on , then we’ll 
just wander off in thought.  
 
You might experiment  this morning  with th e idea of 
being actively involved in the activity of being attentive. 
With that  choice or  intention, see what you discover. 
See if it helps you to be present , and see if you begin 
purifying or emptying out all the extra stuff that you bring 
along with making effort or being active.  
 
I hope that makes sense. If so, t ry it out. If it doesn’t , do 
what you were doing.  Thank you.
