The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So for this week, the topic is the Buddha's Noble Truths, the Four Truths.
And these are often seen as the pinnacle of the insights, the core insight of the Dharma.
And the way they're worded is that one understands, one knows dukkha as it really is.
One knows the arising of dukkha as it really is.
And one knows the practice leading to the cessation of dukkha.
And the insight that these represent are not one, two, three, four insights that are separate, like first you know one, then the other, then the other.
The way the tradition offers them, the ancient tradition, is that these all happen together in an instant.
They somehow, maybe you can see the singular understanding, singular insight that then can be kind of explained or parsed out in these four different ways.
And sometimes it's said that this occurs like lightning, just boom, there, wow. Now I understand something.
Some people find it very inspiring that this is one of the central teachings of the Buddha, that the emphasis is on suffering.
Some people find finally someone's talking about suffering and stopping and taking good look and willing to address it directly rather than covering it over, ignoring it or something.
But it's not just a teaching, it is an insight. It's meant to be something to experience deeply for oneself.
And that might not seem so interesting to experience dukkha intimately and fully so that we can know it's arising and ceasing in the way to its ending.
And what we're seeing here is these four noble truths down through the centuries have been explained many ways.
It seems like they're a wonderful template for all kinds of teachings and all kinds of ways of perceiving or understanding our human life.
And that's part of the richness of them is their adaptability.
And so we find, if you probably just find modern books in English on the four noble truths, people who talk about them and start comparing how they say it with how they explain it.
And you see very quickly that people have different nuances and different ways of teaching it.
Theravada and Buddhists will teach it differently than Zen Buddhists, Zen Buddhists differently than Tibetan Buddhists. More traditional Theravada and Buddhists from Thailand might teach it differently than teachers in the West.
And you see it's changeable, malleable.
I kind of trust that everyone is speaking from some idea or some experience of what is most helpful for them. And then they presented that way.
In this ancient Buddhist tradition, or say this way, there are two primary interpretations or understanding of the four noble truths that I think are the most useful.
One is that it talks about the cause of suffering. There's suffering, the cause of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way.
The other is that it's knowing, it has to do with the changing, impermanent, inconstant nature of dukkha, suffering.
And so we see it arise, we see it cease, and we see it cease in a definitive way, in such an important way, that something shifts and changes.
There's a deep kind of change in the psyche in seeing the whole world of dukkha somehow crumble down, somehow dissolve, drop away temporarily.
And then we know something that is very powerful. Some people in the ancient world felt that the Buddhist path only begins when there's been this deep insight into, deep enough insight into the four noble truths,
that now one really knows what the path is about, because one has the personal experience of where it's going, albeit a temporary experience, but now one knows.
Now I'm on the course, now I know the practice leads someplace. It leads to this cessation of dukkha, of suffering.
So both of these, seeing the cause, seeing the inconstant nature of it, are quite powerful for people. And so I'll talk a little bit about both of them this week.
But today I want to say something about the first noble truth. And the first one is understanding as it really is dukkha.
And what is dukkha? It's often we say suffering in English. Some people find that troublesome, because they only use the word suffering for huge traumas, huge catastrophizing difficulties.
In the Buddhist term, the literal meaning of dukkha is pain. And sometimes it's a lot easier to understand what Buddhists are talking about it if we understand it to be pain or painful.
So for example, the classic description of what dukkha is in the first noble truth is that birth is painful. It's an adjective that we're dukkha, so birth is painful.
Sickness is painful. Aging is painful. Death is painful. Associating with what is unlovable, associating with what is not liked is painful.
Associating with what we love, not being able to associate what we love is painful. Not getting what we want is painful. In short, clinging to the aggregates that we've talked about some weeks ago is painful.
So here's a statement about all these things are painful. It's not saying that it's always painful, but they're so commonly painful that I think most people, if you say birth is painful, most mothers will say, yeah, it was painful, but that's not all it was.
Some people die and it's not necessarily painful to die, but to say it's painful seems like, oh yeah, that's often the case, or there's something painful about it, aging.
It doesn't have to be painful, but I think most people who get started getting older will discover that there's pain involved with getting older.
And this very human thing of being with what is we don't like, being with something that's unpleasant is painful, and being with what we love and what we are close to, not being able to be close to it, not being with our loved ones can be painful.
And so it's just naming a series of things that in this human condition, I think what they're trying to do is to lay out the full range of where people experience pain, emotional pain.
Oh, there's one more I didn't list, anguish, lamentation, pain, depression, despair is painful. All these things are painful.
So if that's all we do is to name it, then it's depressing. Then we can have anguish, lamentation, pain, depression and distress, despair.
But this is an honest look at and appreciation and recognition that this is part of the human condition.
And there's something about this that is optional, it's not necessary to be caught in some aspect of this pain.
And there's some way of freedom stepping outside of the outside of the game of what is pain and painful.
There is an alternative. And that alternative involves seeing the changing nature, the inconstancy of this pain.
And now in constancy, that means it comes and goes, maybe it is not good news, it means it's going to come back.
But what it does, it allows us at some point for the mind to find a place of letting go, some place where it's not part of the game,
not part of the cycles of pain and that keeps appearing and appearing.
It finds a place of rest or freedom or openness or expansiveness or some other game in town that changes the whole perspective.
Because what this Four Noble Truth is leading to is a life that is free of certain kind of pain, certain kind of dukkha or suffering,
that comes from how we relate to or live in this world of suffering.
And in a certain kind of way, we stop living in it.
The mind, the awareness, has found a place of refuge, a place of safety that is not separate from it all, but not identified with it.
But rather, if identified with anything, it's identified with freedom, it's identified with peace, with happiness.
So we start by a willingness to look clearly at dukkha.
And the text says, when sees as it really is, dukkha.
And whenever the text says as it really is, what it means is we're seeing the inconstancy, the changing nature of it.
That's the key thing.
That's what makes it a noble truth.
Not that we see suffering and suffer more, but we see suffering and somehow we're able to have the stillness, the focus, the clarity of mind,
to see it as part of the inconstant flow of changing river of our experience.
So if this makes sense to you, you might try today as you go through your day to observe the ways in which your dukkha comes and goes,
appears and disappears, that rises and falls, surges and recedes, that chances are your dukkha is not constant.
If it is constant, then chances are you're holding on to something.
And what are you holding on to?
I'm not saying that dealing with suffering is easy, but can you begin looking at it through a different lens, a different perspective than your usual one?
And can you step outside of yourself almost to be able to look at dukkha as something that's flowing, changing and constant,
part of the stream of perceptions that are constantly shifting and changing, that sometimes comes back to dukkha,
but then flits away and to begin kind of breaking up the solidity of everything and into the flow of the stream of experience.
So if looking at dukkha today is too much for you, of course you can stop, don't do it too much.
But to understand what we're going to do for the rest of the week, and this very important topic,
you might see if you can gaze upon your dukkha in a new way and see what happens.
So thank you very much and I look forward to meeting you here again tomorrow.
