Hello and welcome. This week is week 7. It's a bit different from the previous weeks.
Today we are going to focus. I don't know if you've heard about the Tongle practice.
It's a Tibetan origin practice. I think it has other traditions as well.
It's called an active compassion practice, although we are not doing anything in particular.
Basically, the practice translates from Tibetan to receive and give.
The invitation, in theory, to summarize, is to take the suffering and send kindness, affection, care, love.
It is as if we could recycle the suffering and turn it into good wishes, support, whatever you want.
It is not necessarily an easy practice. You can imagine that you are taking someone's suffering.
It can be a bit counter-intuitive, like, what do you want me to do here?
I'm going to invite you to do a couple of meditation exercises to see what arises.
The idea is what we have been building these last few weeks, discovering our inner goodness, our own benevolence, our aspiration to be compassionate.
It is a bit of starting to become more aware that it exists within us.
It doesn't mean that what I said at the beginning is that we are going to do something in particular.
We are going to be seated and we are going to be doing the practice. We are not going to do anything.
It is a practice that we use towards the suffering of others and towards our own suffering.
Something that begins to be realized is that the suffering of others is also mine and mine is the suffering of others.
When we start realizing anything that is happening in your life at this moment, and you think about the emotions and how you feel, and how that pain was.
You know that at this moment there are millions of beings going through similar circumstances.
Maybe the situation is not the same, but the emotions, the pain and suffering are very similar.
And in some way that connects us.
When we do tonglen, it is like admitting that humanity, shared from that point of view.
And to start accepting our own suffering, our pain, our anger, our bad thoughts, everything is accepted, everything is received.
Without criticism, without wanting to reject it, it doesn't mean that everything is fine.
We are not approving or validating, but it is something that is there and that you have to recognize.
I think we have talked about it in other situations where if you don't see what is happening, if you are not aware of what is happening in your life, in this being,
you can't do anything about it. And that is what our meditation practice offers us.
To start seeing what is happening here and give it a place. This anger, this humane, this contempt that I feel is human, this sadness, this depression, this joy, everything is part of this being.
And when you accept it, you start to see it in others and to soften a little towards others.
Just like when you feel anger or anger, you don't feel good, you know that the other person is not feeling good either.
Again, it is not about validating or being in agreement with things, but understanding them from a human point of view.
So, let's try to have a little sense. Let's do a part of the practice and let's start with a meditation.
And I'm going to invite you to find a very kind posture that really supports the body, that lets you soften the body.
And we are going to invite the body, like, okay, I'm going to soften it.
The worries are all there, ready, I put them here, I sit next to me, but I'm going to do this.
In some way, for the training of thought, if possible.
And moving a little bit the shoulders, stretching the arms.
It's my moment, it's the moment to sit down, to rest, to focus.
I'm taking a couple of deep and intentional breaths, inhaling through the nose and exhaling with a breath.
I invite you to exhale, really, like, letting go.
Your feet on the floor, feeling the connection with the floor, with the chair, with your chin.
Feeling the breathing in the body, receiving a breath.
And letting go, softening, when exhaling.
And breathing, normally, letting the body breathe alone.
We do a sweep, with the head to the feet, softening the muscles of the face, the mouth, the cheek.
Letting go of the shoulders.
Feeling the weight of the arms and softening the hands.
Feeling the movement of the chest, the movement of the diaphragm, softening the stomach.
Softening the glutes and the muscles.
Letting go of the hips and the feet.
Feeling the whole body breathing.
Feeling that the body breathes as it needs to.
Letting go of the shoulders.
I'm going to invite you to do a visualization, there is no correct way of doing it.
Don't force, just let go of what arises, what appears.
Maybe you have heard that from the point of view of the quantum physics of particles at the microscopic level, we are almost made of empty space.
This body composed of atoms and molecules.
Systems that always want to find a minimum energy base.
When we are, when the molecules, the atoms are at certain levels of excitement.
When they reach their point of minimum energy, they emit photons.
Particles of light, of energy.
From the point of view of biology, we have to consume carbohydrates, sugars, to provide energy to our body.
It's all an exchange.
The cells that metabolize and convert energy.
Our nervous system, our brain.
The cells that are communicated through electrical impulses.
All this to say, imagine maybe, how is that energy in your body? How do you feel that energy?
I invite you to take your attention to the center of your body.
Between the abdominal wall and the back. Maybe close to the column.
Imagine that you can see that energy in your body.
It can be in a form of light or sensations, colors, music, sounds.
And even beyond the ideas, the words.
Sintonize yourself with the somatic sensation of the energy of the vitality of the body.
Somos seres luminosos, vitales.
Resilientes.
Con una enorme fuerza de vida.
Siente, siente esa vitalidad, esa energía.
Esa oscilación que vibra con la respiración.
Sistele, diástole.
Corazón que se abre, se cierra.
Corazón que se abre, se cierra.
Corazón que se abre.
Imagínate ahora que al exhalar parte de esa energía, de esa luminosidad, sale del cuerpo al espacio que te rodea.
Sintiendo las vibraciones en la piel, por mi guión.
Con la fuerza del aire y los puntos de contacto.
Estamos siempre aprendiendo en evolución.
Somos capaces de una enorme compasión, mi amabilidad.
No hay nada quebrado, descompuesto, roto en nosotros.
Es todo un proceso.
Llevan de nuevo la tensión al centro de tu cuerpo.
Recibiendo el aire, el oxígeno.
Exhalando esa energía, vitalidad que te rodea y que tal vez puede tocar a otros.
Traemos un poco de movimiento suave, amable.
Respiración profunda y aprendo los ojos cuando sé el momento.
