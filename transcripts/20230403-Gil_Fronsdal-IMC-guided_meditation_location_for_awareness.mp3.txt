 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone. Warm greetings from Redwood City from the Insight Meditation Center. I've been away for a week and it's nice to be back and nice to be back here in this early morning, somewhat early morning way of starting the day. So thank you for being here. So when I first came to Buddhism, I studied Zen, when I was instructed to sit in meditation, one of the peculiar instructions that I didn't understand at that time was to put myself in the meditation posture and be with the breathing and to put my attention in my hands. The hands were together in a kind of mudra, kind of one hand on top the other in front of my belly, and the idea of putting my attention or my mind in my hands. And sometimes in Zen they had told me to put my mind in my belly, in the Hara in Japanese, the spot about two inches below the belly button, maybe about an inch in from the skin. So kind of in a similar place, the hands were kind of right in front of that place. And this idea of putting my mind there, it was a little bit different than putting the attention there maybe. But over the years, I've learned that we have many capacities for perception, awareness, sensing, knowing, and that it's a little bit of choice of the mind, not necessarily your choice if you're not conscious of it, of where we identify as the locus, the center of our attention. Where is attention up in the head and are we looking down on the breathing? Or is the attention in the breath, is awareness part and parcel of the experience of breathing, not separate from it? Is the awareness somehow disembodied kind of above and behind us watching the whole experience? Is it in our hands? Is it in our belly? Is it in a torso? And in fact, it's a little bit optional where we feel the locus, the center of gravity of awareness of attention, where we identify in a sense the center of attention. And that itself is sometimes what we follow along with where we identify ourselves, me, myself, and I. So it's a little bit optional. We can move around and kind of let different things be the center because it's a little bit of choice of the mind to kind of prioritize, rest in that particular part of the body for where awareness is aware. So I don't know if this makes sense to you. It didn't make sense to me when I first started sitting, but I think it's a very helpful idea and we'll talk more about this later. So for now, to assume a meditation posture and gently close your eyes. And spend the first minute or so of your meditation, relaxing your body as much as you can while letting the body have a certain quality of alertness. Being alert. Relaxing in the shoulders. Bring your attention to your arms and your elbows and your hands. Can you move or reposition them so they're more relaxed? So the elbows are not pressed in towards the body but are hanging loosely. And to relax in the belly, a soft belly. And when you're, and then to kind of sit quietly for a few moments with the rhythm of breathing. And as you exhale to relax the thinking mind, quiet your thinking. And then for a few minutes, it's heightened your awareness of the body's experience of breathing. Really let your awareness, kind of like it dials in, tunes into the breathing more fully. And as you're aware of your breathing, where's the place from which you are aware? Is it in the head? If it is in the head, where? Where? Around the eyes, behind the forehead, between the ears. Is it the upper half of the head or the lower half of the head? And if we locate a place, just a minute here, so where else might it be? Might it be somewhere in the neck, in the voice box? Might the place from which you know and are aware, is it in the chest, maybe in the heart? The solar plexus area is the location for awareness of breathing in the breathing itself. There's no sense of knowing or being aware in some other place than the breathing. Is the place of awareness, might it be in the belly? So in whatever place, if there is a place where is the place from which you're aware, what does that place feel like? Were the sensations that are present there may be a sensations associated with being aware. So being aware of the place from which you're aware Maybe breathing with that place, breathing through it, having the experience of breathing be received into the location from which, where you're aware. Breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, breathing through it, wherever your location is from which you're aware. Imagine that it's an easy chair that you can relax back into, settling back into that soft receptive chair so that your awareness relaxes, softens. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, to switch the location from which, where you're aware, to your heart, as if there's a chair, an easy chair in your heart. And you can settle into that chair that the heart is a place to relax its home, safe. And to imagine that you look out upon the world from the heart. You look out upon the world from a place of safety and nothing's required of you, not for the time being, nothing is challenging you or dangerous for you. The heart is at ease. Looking out upon the world with eyes of kindness and care. And if it, if you find that there is some kindness, some care, some love, compassion in your heart, that you can spread across the globe, spread wide and far. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may the way in which we look upon others and on the world, may they, may that gaze, that look, be soft, kind and compassionate. May we spread our kindness in the way in which we gaze upon the world. Thank you.
