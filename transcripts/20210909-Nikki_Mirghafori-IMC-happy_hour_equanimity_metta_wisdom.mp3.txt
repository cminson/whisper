 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Here we go. Okay, so formally, hello and welcome to happy hour, dear Sangha. So for today's theme of practice, I'd like to invite us to engage with the fourth brahma vihara today. The brahma viharas, the heavenly abodes, the four practices of the heart, metta being the first one where we spend a lot of time and happy hour working with metta and all the three, the three other ones also are different expressions of metta. They're not separate. The second being compassion, another expression of metta when metta kindness meets suffering. The third one being mudita or vicarious joy when metta meets someone who has really good fortune, either ourselves or someone else, gladness arises, vicarious happiness. And the fourth one is equanimity. Equanimity also thought of as the crown jewel of Buddhist practice and it shows up on so many different ways, so many lists and so many different flavors. The way it shows up on this list on the brahma viharas is practicing for ourselves, practicing for other beings. It shows up on other lists such as the seven factors of awakening, etc, etc. But here it shows in this way, in the way of practicing with respect to ourselves, with respect to other living beings. And remember that equanimity is related to metta is in the same family. So there is care in equanimity. It's not aloof. It's not, oh, okay, whatever. There's care, there's love in the sense of equanimity, in the sense of equipoise, holding what is. The way I like to invite us to explore, of course, we've explored all the brahma viharas in so many different ways, creative ways over the past year and a half now on our online global saga, but the way I like to invite us for today's practice is the following way. To consider perhaps times maybe right now, where there might be a friend, there might be a relative, there might be a loved one who's having perhaps a challenging time. And part of your instinct, perhaps caring for them is to jump in and swoop in and just make it all better. Or maybe there's a sense of frustration like, oh, why are you doing this to yourself? And can't you see? So there's so many different unwise responses that can come up here when there is lack of empathy, whereas what would equanimity look like perhaps in this particular case, in this particular instance scenario? So appreciating, appreciating, understanding the person's autonomy, really granting them autonomy, respecting their choices, caring, offering support, whatever support you can. But without both trying to step in and make it, fix it all in your way, not respecting their journey, not respecting their choices, not respecting that this is their life. And in the traditional phrasing of the equanimity phrases, it is said that all beings have their own journey, they have, and their happiness and unhappiness does not depend on my wishes for them. It's respecting their journey. And yet, it's not aloof, it's not cold, it's not turning your heart away at all. There is care, there is love, there is holding witness and supporting, helping in any ways that are both helpful, filled with love both for the person, for the friend, relative, and also for yourself. Remember, metta, equanimity is 360. So if you're swooping in and just taking over and giving up your own responsibilities in life, it's not really filled with metta for yourself, care for yourself. So the wise question, wise consideration is, how can I, how can I support, how can I be present? How can I have metta show care, love, compassion, both for this being in this situation, as well as for myself, as well as respecting their autonomy, respecting their journey, the choices they have made that have brought them to this place, and the choices they need to make, the lessons they need to make. And similarly for you, the choices you have made and the lessons you need to make. So how can you be present, loving, and also have a sense of 360 degree view of life, its ups, its downs, trials, tribulations, all of our choices, all the lessons that we have to learn as beings in our interrelationship. So that's plenty for setting the context today. So I'd like to invite you to let go now of all the words. There were too many words, too many concepts. Let it go. Let's land together. Let's practice together. Let's land in our bodies. Letting go of all the words. We're going to try on for size this practice. Just try it on. And if there are but, but, but, complaints and concerns, try it on for size and see what arises as you practice in your body, in your heart. So landing, landing in the body. Feeling, sensing your feet, these feet rooted. Feeling the earth, the contact points between the feet and the earth. Feeling, sensing your feet. Feeling, just tilling the soil, just tilling the soil. Feeling your mindfulness, awareness, one breath at a time, arriving, settling. Feeling, sensing your feet. flavors to anything around you. Receiving each breath in the abdomen. The full in breath received. The full out breath received. The full out breath received. The full out breath received. Taking refuge in this moment. The simplicity of this body, this breath, this expansive moment just here. Putting down thoughts, just gently saying, not now, thank you, not now. I'm connecting with awareness. Thank you. Thank you. I'd like to invite you to imagine you're sitting on top of a mountain where you have 360-degree view all around. Just imagine you're sitting comfortably. Feel your bottom. Feel your feet, feel embodied. Feel embodied in the body. And also sense of spaciousness all around you. There's space all around you. As if you could see far into the horizon from all directions clearly. Just imagine top of the mountain, let's take another few minutes to breathe. And let's settle with a sense of embodiment and spaciousness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now I'd like to invite you to imagine sitting, sitting on this high place, top of this mountain, seeing all around, as if you could see, as if you're looking into so many interrelated causes and conditions, past and present. So many things have come to be because of so many causes and conditions. Now as if you would invite this friend, relative, or someone in your orbit, choosing this being, the practice of equanimity, the practice for them. And if you're having a hard time choosing someone, or there is this sense of entanglement, but wanting to keep equanimity, you can't come up with anyone. It's okay to choose yourself. I'll do the guidance for this other being, whatever being you've chosen. So seeing the circumstances, this being, the life circumstances, seeing them, holding them, with a sense of care with metta, good wealth. You wish well for them. You want them to be safe and happy and healthy and have ease. And from this view, 360 view, far and wide, you can see that there are so many causes and conditions, so many beyond their control, beyond your control. There are some choices they have made, but perhaps you also get to see so many cultural, environmental, educational, family, genetics, systemic, zeitgeist, historical. And breathing, breathing, spaciousness. So many interconnections, so many interconnections, past and present. And the interconnection you have, the connection you have with this being, is one of them. It's one of the very many infinite causes and conditions. And they're all up to you, just as it's not all up to them. They are doing the best they can. They are doing the best they can for you, except that you're doing the best you can, as much as you can with metta, both for them and for yourself. Don't start thinking, but just feel into it for a moment and see what might open up. Your thinking mind cannot see beyond particular way of being. Holding this being with care and spaciousness, acknowledging all the causes and conditions. A kunemadee is not aloof. It neither pushes away nor falls into, with grief, as wisdom. Kunemadee is the marriage of metta and wisdom. Kunemadee is the marriage of metta and wisdom. I'll offer a few phrases of equanimity, maybe no phrases are needed. Just holding the space, spacious space with metta, acknowledging that we, the two of us are players in this big scheme called life, this mystery, doing our best. Being present with metta. Here's one phrase, if you wish, all beings have their own journey. All beings have their own journey. May I accept the arising and passing of all things with equanimity and balance. Or, I care for you. I care, I care about you, but cannot keep you from suffering. I care for you about you, but I cannot keep you from suffering. May I accept the arising and passing of all things with equanimity and balance. Or, I care about you, and I am not in control of the unfolding of events. I can't make it all better for you. I care for you, but cannot keep you from suffering. May I accept the arising and passing of all things with equanimity and balance. May I accept the arising and passing of all things with equanimity and balance. I can't make it all better, and I care about you. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding of all things. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. I'm not in control of the unfolding. Thank you all for your practice. So the practice of equanimity, it can be a little more nuanced or challenging or subtle compared to the other practices, hence it being the fourth of the brahmavihara. So if your experience was nuanced or not quite sure, it's okay. It's okay. You're practicing. You're practicing. So I'd love to open the space up now for any reflections, any questions that have come up, any insights in your practice that out of generosity you're willing to share with the sangha to support others practice from the place of a gift. Oh, this is what I discovered. This is what was interesting. This is what was challenging. So, and if you type in chat, in the Zoom chat, if you type just to me privately, I will read the reflection, not your name, so it'll be private. If you send it to everyone, I will read both reflection and your name. And you're welcome to raise your hand. Bill says, thank you for this. It was very timely for me as I have a friend going through difficulties. Thank you, Bill. And Barbara, please. You're still muted. There. Perfect. I know I thought this was a beautiful thing to meditate on and that considering someone who's suffering and you want to jump in to fix it, so often comes up with parents and children, adult children, where you still want to fix it. You still want so this is something to really meditate on. And how do you communicate the love and the boundary at the same time? The potent thing to think about. Absolutely. Thank you, Barbara. Yes, very important. Were there any other insights that came up for you and you're welcome to unmute yourself. And if not, it's okay with this particular important relationship in your life. Yes, you're unmuted, Barbara. Oops. Yeah. For me personally, no, it's just it has come up a lot. Just appreciating that this is this is significant. This is challenging and how so many conditions that you know, you are not in control of and you realize the other is not in control either. And that you just have to be kind to yourself and be kind to the other one. And yet you realize you can't you can't fix it. Exactly. Yeah. Thank you for that, Barbara. I appreciate how important that yeah, with the wisdom, the mental wisdom, how can they both, how can they both come together? And Patricia says, as a single parent, I should do this once a week, at least. So so thanks for bringing up what you brought up, Barbara. Yeah. So when I see your hands, I'm going to pause and let others because you shared last time. So just pulling forward, pulling back those who haven't shared in a while. I'd like to invite you to pull forward, please. Thank you. Peggy says it's advanced practice. Thank you. Jerry says, thanks. Very helpful as I got email today that a very good friend that she has six to 12 months to live with cancer. It has helped to see that each being is on their own journey. And that does not mean that you do not deeply care. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Thank you, Jerry. Thank you for that. Yeah. Yeah, they're reflections, especially if you haven't shared in a while, I'd love to to hear from you. The Sangha would love to hear from you. And also, if it was challenging or problematic, something difficult came up. That's okay, too. I'd love to. Let's bring it up. Let's be real. Just to say, in a meditation community, there is no such a thing as awkward silence. It's just silence. It's delicious silence. Don, please. When you said that you said the opportunity to take refuge, I really appreciated that resonated with me. You said that at least once, maybe more. And it was challenging, equanimity. And for me, it was meh. And I think part of it was choosing the right person and didn't make sense to choose me. And I wasn't sure who to choose. And so then I just devolved to this practicing loving kindness and listening. And I'll try it next time. And it's practice. And so I very much appreciate that. Yeah. Great. Great. Thank you, Don. Yeah. Beautiful. I appreciate the ease with which you practiced and you're sharing your report. Like, okay, you couldn't quite land on someone. You didn't, choosing yourself didn't seem appropriate. And just, okay, then I'll listen and I'll engage with meta and I'll engage later. I love that. That's EA for that practice report, which is beautiful. It's not the alternative. So many unwise alternatives could be like, oh, I can't choose the right person. I'm a failure. I can't do this practice. This is terrible. I've been practicing for months and months and months and I can't do. Right. Which, which, oh, sweetie, right. So to have compassion for that frame of mind also. And yet what I so appreciate in hearing what you're saying is like, well, it's not quite clicking, but yeah, I'll engage with meta. Yay. This is a period of practice. Fantastic. As I haven't said this actually in a long time, but I used to repeat every time during happy hour that no matter what comes up during happy hour, as long as you engage with it with meta, yeah, you're doing the practice perfectly right. So Don, you're doing the practice perfectly right. You're engaging with meta with whatever came up. So thank you so much for sharing that and, and, and supporting the community to hear that, to really to hear that reflection. Thank you. So, so the ones it's time. The time has come. This is a time. And if I wait any other, any later, we'll won't have enough time for the small groups. So the small groups, again, as always, we'll start with 15 seconds of meta for ourselves, for each other, the community, and then sharing as much or as little as you like about your practice. What came up for you, what was interesting or was challenging, and sharing it with equanimity. It's like this, so many causes and conditions for this practice. So the rooms are created, take care of yourselves and take care of each other. Okay. All right. So here we go. Welcome back, everyone. The rooms are closed. And just have a couple of minutes for any reflections that might have come up, anything you realized, especially if you haven't spoken in the recent times you're invited. Especially if you're new to happy hours, you haven't spoken before. Mm. Maelene says, these sessions help to take refuge in the sangha. Beautiful. Thank you for sharing that, Aileen. Taking refuge in the sangha. Ah. Yay. Indeed. Yes, and that ties also in with what Dawn was saying earlier, taking refuge, taking refuge. Diana, I am told you're raising your physical hand, which I can't see. Let's see. Diana. Okay, there. I'm asking you to unmute. I did know your camera is off also. Technical difficulties. Okay. My question is, I can know these phrases and I've been getting some success internally. But I ponder what to say to a person socially after they've been sitting listening to all this, caring, these tortured lives. It just somehow seems odd to say, I care for you, or maybe I can say, give me a hug, or I can. Yeah, got it. And for, yeah, for sake of time, I think I'll, I think I got the gist of the question. Since it's seven o'clock, I'll say this. So yes, this is not something that you're going to say externally. Like, you know, you're not going to say with someone, say, may you be safe, may you be happy? Like, it sounds so stilted. Right. So, so all you, all you need to do is to hold space is to hold space. You need to hold the space internally for yourself. You don't have to say it out loud. Hold a space of care with a whole the space of spaciousness for yourself and for the other person. And they feel it. There's so much that we communicate without words, but with just the space that we hold. Thank you for that question. Diana, that was a really good one. Yeah, thank you. So dear ones, we have come to the end of our time together. Thank you all for your practice. For aligning your actions with your intentions. May all beings be safe. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Thank you all.
