The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Starting in a simple way, just remembering yourself in this moment,
connecting to your experience in a simple way, maybe just acknowledging this
body sitting in this space and the place you're in, being with yourself here and now.
In some ways, as I land and I'm sitting, it feels kind of like gathering or collecting or
just arriving. There's not a lot of intense focus at the beginning, but just I'm like,
yep, I'm sitting here. There's body, there's feelings in the body. Yep, feel those.
There's a breathing, the breathing's happening, the experience of breathing.
There's some emotions and moods going on. What's happening there? Just in general,
how are you in the broader sense of how are you? Seeing if you can touch into
the feeling of how you are in this moment. Not thinking about it, not the idea about it,
but the feeling, the felt sense of the whole of you in this moment. That kind of receptivity
does, is supported by relaxation. Not looking for or trying to figure out, but really just to
relax and be willing to kind of see or experience or feel what's here, what's available, what's
already here. And often at the beginning, this kind of gathering or landing with experience,
it's not necessarily very precise, may feel kind of vague or diffuse, and that's okay.
Just, can you be with yourself in this vague, diffuse way in this moment,
acknowledging how you are,
maybe some tiredness, maybe some curiosity,
maybe some restlessness, maybe some calm, maybe some thinking,
maybe some tension in the body, maybe some relaxation, how are you in this moment?
And relaxation does support this, so it can be helpful to having kind of taken in how you are
in this first part, investigate or not so much investigate or try to figure anything out, but
just see if there's a willingness to relax in the body.
Maybe the face and head and neck can relax a little bit.
Maybe the shoulders, the arms, the hands can relax a little bit.
Maybe the chest and upper back can relax and soften.
Maybe all those muscles across the stomach and abdomen can relax a little bit.
We often hold that area kind of almost subconsciously, so maybe it can hang a little bit forward.
Maybe the middle and lower back and hips can relax, the legs, the feet.
And then too, perhaps there can be some softening or deeply inside the body in the
center of the core of the body. Maybe the inside of the throat can relax.
Maybe the heart can relax.
Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax.
This inner relaxation often isn't a doing, it's not something we can often try to do,
but if we just kind of attend to those areas with the invitation, we're checking in,
a seeing. Are you willing to relax or maybe do you know how to relax? We don't know consciously
how to relax those areas, but a gentle kind of touching in and invitation. Maybe the throat,
the heart, the stomach, the intestines can relax.
And then from this place of as much relaxation as is available,
stepping away from the intention towards looking at their body through relaxation and just be
curious about how is the body in this moment?
What do you notice? What's available? Maybe the breath is kind of obvious or
contact, sensations of the hips against the chair, cushion, maybe the feet or the hands.
Maybe there's a broader sense of the body.
Maybe perhaps there's an area of stronger sensation where the attention is drawn.
That's okay. It's just receiving what's obvious in the field of bodily experience.
Can there continue to be some measure of relaxation as you're receiving whatever is obvious?
Relaxed and aware.
If the attention is drawn to connecting with some particular area of experience like the breath,
that's fine.
Can there be relaxed and aware of breathing?
Or perhaps attention is taking in sound.
Can there be relaxed and aware of hearing?
Or maybe the attention is shifting first the body, some particular sensation in the body,
then another sensation in the body and then hearing.
Can there be a relaxed awareness of this shifting attention?
Relaxed with this breath, relaxed with the sound, relaxed with the body sensation.
Relaxed with this breath, relaxed with the body sensation.
Or if a particular mood or emotion comes in,
feels like that's pulling at the attention,
can there be relaxed and aware of that emotion?
Can just being with yourself, with your body, with hearing, with emotions, relaxed and aware.
Relaxed with this breath, relaxed with the body sensation.
Relaxed with this breath, relaxed with the body sensation.
Relaxed with this breath, relaxed with the body sensation.
Relaxed with this breath, relaxed with the body sensation.
Relaxed with this breath, relaxed with the body sensation.
Relaxed with this breath, relaxed with the body sensation.
