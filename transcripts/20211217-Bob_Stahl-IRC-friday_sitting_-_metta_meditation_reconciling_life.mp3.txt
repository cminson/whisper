early in the pandemic, I should say that the Insight Meditation Center that is
of course connected with the Insight Retreat Center, that they would have at a
particular time of day, maybe around this time, they would call it happy hour,
but it's an unusual type of happy hour because it's not filled with alcohol,
it's filled with loving-kindness, and that they would do each day a happy hour
of practice of loving-kindness, so it just occurred to me now, and it was around
this time each day that different teachers would come and offer some
loving-kindness. So here we go, and it's going to speak for a little bit, and we'll
go into practice. And we've been, you know, cultivating our mind and our heart
this week, and it's been very touching for me, and I know for all of us, talking
with the teachers as well, with just the sincerity of people sharing in their
practice, it's really, we're very touched, and we all support each other in this.
And so it feels that, you know, as some days have gone by, we've been collecting
and gathering and studying our minds, and there's some settling that's
definitely happening for a number of us, and perhaps opening to some insight,
some understanding of the places where we may get caught and stuck and see more
clearly into these patterns. And it seems to me that as our practice, as we
ourselves mature, there's also this facet of making peace, amends, reconciling,
perhaps the word forgiving, though that's a pretty charged word and very
difficult for many people, but some sense of making amends. This too is such an
important part of my life. I know for me personally, this is very important, and I
have this aspiration that on my deathbed, I'll have made peace with myself and the
world, and because I have that aspiration, it shows me I have some work to do, and I
don't know about you, but you know, it's like I have a very large book, actually
volumes of everyone who has kind of pissed me off since I was born, and all
written in very small font. I tend to remember when the feelings get hurt,
grudges happen, resentments. Our words and our connections can bring us together,
and it could also separate us, and we have a sense even behind the words
what's being said. That's why I love Maya Angelou. She has this beautiful
quotation that people may not remember what you said or did, but they'll always
remember and how you made them feel, and to me there's a truth to that, and in
this aspiration, for me personally, wanting to reconcile, to make peace,
particularly because I just know firsthand the pain of living with a
hardened heart, a resentful heart. So in these years, I've been practicing a lot
in this area, actually Jan, my partner and I, we've done some retreats, and this
is an important part of our practice, is this sense of reconciling, or making
amends, comes out of the loving-kindness practice. There's been a few people that
I've known in my life that have, I've actually first-hand met that really made
peace with themselves, and didn't die with resentment or a hardened heart, and
it was really quite amazing to be, to know someone like that, and gave me
inspiration to do the same. So there's actually a few different areas that I've
found to be so important, and one is to reconcile and make peace to the times
I've been hard on myself. The second is reconciling to those I have hurt. The
third is reconciling, making amends to those that have hurt me. And the fourth
is somehow reconciling with the way things are. This is the life that I got.
So these are four, I think, very powerful areas for us to bring some
investigation with. And, you know, there's times that we can be just so incredibly
hard on ourselves as I'll speak about this making peace to the times I've been
hard on myself. Born out of our conditioning and habitual patterns, we
may have internal identifications that we have, and I spoke about this last night
of internal identifications of our own deficiency or inadequacy, or that we
don't have, that our voice doesn't matter. So there's importance of
beginning to make amends inside our own hearts. I just want to open up just to
share a very powerful observation from Carl Jung about making peace inside
oneself, and he says, I can feed the hungry, I can forgive an insult, I can
learn to love my enemies, and these are great virtues. But what if I should
discover that the poorest of the beggars, the most impudent of the offenders, are
all within me, and that I stand in the need of the alms of my own kindness, that
I stand in the need of the alms of my own kindness, that I myself am the enemy who
must be loved, that I stand in the need of the alms of my own kindness, such an
important practice, making reconciling within our own hearts. And the second is
reconciling to those that I've heard, and yes, due to my own unawareness and fears,
woundedness, there's been times perhaps that I've been unskillful and caused
pain to another. It's powerful just even to recognize that, just as you might
think you have a lot of difficult people in your life, you could actually be a
difficult person for another, very humbling to know that, to acknowledge that.
And to me there's a very important aspect about this making amends to the
times I've heard another, and of course if it's possible to make an authentic
and genuine apology, that is wonderful. But even more wonderful, or an
additionally wonderful, well I'm going to say more wonderful, is to actually, once
you apologize for doing something, that you really make the intention of not
doing it again. This is actually how it's paid back, and in the Dharma there's a
very beautiful poetic phrase, it's called hiri uttapa in Pali, but the poetic
phrase part is becoming a guardian of the world, like a protector of the world.
Like when you realize that you've caused some pain to another, you make it your
strong intention to try not to repeat it. You know, it's one thing to keep on
going back in the room after if you've hurt your children and made them feel
small and say you're sorry, but it would be really even more helpful to not have
to go back in the room and say you're sorry, that you actually try to really
live your practice with your speech and with your intentions. So becoming a
guardian of the world, this is how it's paid back to the times I've heard
another. And it's powerful stories of extreme stories I know of a Vietnam
soldier who was a machine gunner and caused many many deaths, and after the
war becoming homeless and a drug addict, and then eventually getting into the
Dharma, and eventually became a monk, and has devoted his entire life teaching
that peace is the only way, and he'll go into war zones, prisons, areas where
there's a lot of problems, and speak about what it was like to have been a
soldier and have killed so many people and how they used to live with this. So if
he can begin to do this and make amends, and perhaps we can too. Becoming a guardian
of the world for those times perhaps due to my own unawareness I've caused pain
to another. Now seeing more clearly and understanding with compassion where it
was then, what I was living with, the unawareness, the woundedness, making
peace to those I've hurt, and in this third way of reconciling to those that
hurt me. Very difficult of a practice, but also we begin to understand that just
as I was capable to hurt another due to my own unawareness and fear, so too
others may have hurt me from their own unawareness in their own fears. Of course
it doesn't excuse the actions, perhaps it brings some greater understanding. Now
so this other facet that is so important that so long as I continue to live
with grudges, resentments, I will continue to feel pain. In that spirit of wanting
to live with less suffering and less pain, can I begin to neutralize the
resentment that's within me, the grudges, the ill-will, making amends to those that
hurt me. And this last quality is perhaps making amends with the world that I
have. Yep, maybe coming to terms, you may or may not win the Academy Award or be
the best rock and roll singer or you know the wealthiest person in the world
or whatever it is. It seems like so much of our life is like wanting
more, wanting more, wanting more and somehow wrapping our identity in that
what we get is who and we kind of lost touch with who we are. How can I begin
to make peace with the life that I have with my bald head, you know? This is
just, this is just what I got. And I mean you know when I was young, I had
straight hair, I wanted curly hair. Then in the times there was curly hair, I wanted
straight hair. Like making, how do I begin to make amends with what it is that I
got. So perhaps it was opening up into the sense of gratefulness. So we'll explore
this in a little bit more of a little practice and so just sensing into your
body, just inviting a place of comfort and awakeness. Perhaps a few breaths in
and breaths out, steadying the mind and the body, listening to some sounds or
orienting, feeling some touch points in the body, whatever supports you to be
present. Now just gently bringing the awareness into the chest area, contained
within this chest and ribcage with these vital organs of the lungs, our breath, end
of our heart, circulation, ventilation and how we find that just sensing into the
chest opens me, the sense of the preciousness and the fragility of this
life, of what's important. But one day we do know it will be otherwise.
As we sense into our hearts, sensing into our own way of just opening to some
reconciliation, making amends, whatever word that works for you, that sense of
being able to begin to make some more peace with yourself. Yes, we all have
our embedded conditioning that might think otherwise and have all the
evidence and the proof. But this is part of our identity that perhaps in time we
can go outside of the lines, beginning just to sense into our hearts with some
kindness and befriending, that these old stories are limited definitions.
Befriending such a kindness with our own heart. Yes, these identifications of
unworthiness, beliefs, part of our conditioning, and perhaps understanding
more about what led me to think in this way, but know that this is not all of me.
Restoring our sovereignty, our heart with great kindness and also to know that
everything that has happened in our life has led us into this moment and may
there be mercy and kindness, what has come before that has shaped us into now.
We're consiling to the times I've been hard on myself.
We're consiling to the times I've been hard on myself.
We're consiling to the times I've been hard on myself.
So this making peace, we're consiling to the times I've been hard on myself and
then just gently inviting in to the times perhaps that I've been unkind to
another, I've hurt another. May there be compassion and mercy for ourselves and
understanding where we were then and what we were doing and what was going on in
our life and our unawareness, our fears, our conditioning, bringing that light of
hindsight, wisdom, understanding, to the times that I've been hard caused pain to
another. It's the light of understanding that begins to set us a little bit more freer.
May be different memories arising, different difficult situations and
feeling perhaps a little bad about your part in it and yes, may there be
compassion, may you understand where you were then, the unawareness, the fear and
learning from it, that informs you that in the future to as best we can to try
not to repeat those ways that cause pain to another, becoming what's known as a
guardian or a protector of the world, beginning to make amends to those I've
hurt.
Yet another gentle facet and of course we may have to spend some more time later
with this reconciliation, but for now inviting in. That process of making amends
or reconciling to those that even hurt me with this understanding that just as
I've caused some pain to another from my own unawareness, my conditioning, fear so
to others, have hurt me from their own unawareness and fears and conditioning.
And again it may not excuse those actions but bringing some understanding
and again the importance of lessening because of our own suffering with the
resentments within us, the grudges, the hardened heart. The very least can we
begin to lessen some of the resentment and grudges. It's like a poison in our
own heart making amends even to those that have hurt me.
So painful to carry resentment and grudges making peace with their own
hearts.
So painful to carry resentment and grudges making peace with their own
hearts.
And then again another facet all interconnected beginning to make amends
or reconciling to the life that I have, the body that I'm in, how I've lived my
life, what I identify with, what I have, don't have somehow the way of reconciling
to this life that I have, the body where we grew up, what's happening, this whole
wide range of inequity. Those with more, those with less caught up in the worldly
things but somehow beginning now to, this is my lot, this is what's, this is the
life that I have and can I begin to make some peace with it, to knowledge my lot
in life. Again, contentment is the greatest of wealth. Seeing through all of
these different stories of I want and I don't want is the greatest of wealth.
Making peace with the life that we have, to those who've hurt me, to those I've
heard, to the times I've hurt myself making peace.
May all beings discover the gateways into their own hearts to grow with greater
wisdom and compassion. And for now may we just rest again in this field of
benevolence, of reconciliation, just allowing yourselves to rest in the
benevolence, great kindness. As we all are imperfectly perfect as each of us
are. Each of us no more so and no less so important than any other sentient being
within this universe. We are all part of the family of things. Just letting
yourself receive this grace, this loving kindness and just resting in it. Each of
us and our family, our friends, our world, all can take rest in this heart of great
benevolence. This universe can take rest in this heart of great benevolence.
Vastness of benevolence. Vastness of benevolence of great kindness. Just
resting in the vastness of great kindness.
Vastness of benevolence.
Vastness of benevolence.
Vastness of benevolence.
And may all beings dwell with peace.
