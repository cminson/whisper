The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Okay, to start our final sit for the day, for this beautiful day,
we'll take our directed awareness of mindfulness of the body,
maybe one step further, or maybe we can think of it as adding something.
And this practice requires that we kind of soften the thinking mind
and let go of an idea that everything has to, I don't know,
maybe perfectly make sense and instead to feel our way, feel our way into this meditation.
And that is to do a body scan, but this time to add some loving kindness practice to it.
So to combine a body scan with a intention, the wish,
that there be some well-being, some open-heartedness, or some warmth as part of our experience.
I first learned about this practice from something I read that Sharon Salzburg wrote.
Some of you may know Sharon Salzburg is credited with kind of really bringing loving kindness practice to the West, to America.
And she described that she learned it from this 94-year-old person who had tremendous amounts of energy and happiness.
She said that she taught with this 94-year-old person and just was astounded at his happiness and energy.
So that gave me some, okay, well, I'm going to give this a try.
I actually love this practice.
I use it a lot for myself when I'm on retreat sometimes to help settle the mind and the body and open the heart.
I don't know, feel some spaciousness, some warmth, some well-being.
So again, we'll start with a posture that is relaxed and yet also has some alertness.
Then you can, as I guide this body scan, and this time I'll start at the top of the body,
you can repeat after me these phrases silently in your mind, you can repeat them as a way to support your intention, your wish for there to be some ease, open-heartedness,
some allowing of whatever we might find in our bodies.
This can bring your awareness to your head, just in general.
May my head be happy, may it be peaceful,
may the eyes be happy, may the eyes be peaceful,
may the neck be happy, may the neck be peaceful,
may the shoulders be happy, may the shoulders be peaceful,
