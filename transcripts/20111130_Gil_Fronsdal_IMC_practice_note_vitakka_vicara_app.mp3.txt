Practice Note : Vitakka and Vicā ra

A very important functioning of the mind in meditation  or 
dharma practice  is something that’s  known in the Pali 
language as vitakka  and vicāra . Vitakka  is usually 
translated as placing or directing your attention at 
whatever you would pay attention to. In meditation 
practice, mindfulness works by applying your attention 
to notice something . That initial noticing of something is 
vitakka .  
 
Vicāra  is a different activity of the mind than the initial 
placing . It’s sustaining the attention there and keeping it 
going. Some people are very good at the first. For 
example, their mind  wanders off , and they come back to 
the breath , and  they can come back over and over 
again. But they don’t know about the second part , which 
is sustaining the attention  – hanging in there, hanging 
out, and staying present.  
 
An analogy  that is sometimes used in the text s would be 
something like a bird , which  – taking off from the ground  
– has to flap its wings a lot . But once it’s up in the air , it 
stops flying and just holds its wings out , and soars or 
glides. So initially there  has to be some  work to get up there , but then you glide. That sustained attention is 
gliding or staying present.  
 
The classic example of vicāra  is if you are going to 
polish a bowl , you have to put the cloth on the bowl . 
Then  the sustained attention is rubbing it  – staying 
present. If you just put your hand on and off the bowl , 
you’re not going to get it polished.  
 
I don’t know if this next is a good analogy, but this ability 
to sustain your attention  would be like flying a kite. You 
can get a kite up in the air , but to keep it up in the air , 
you have to sustain a certain amount of tautness on the 
string. If it’s too taut , the string  will break . And if it’s  too 
slack, the kite will fall down. There  has to be the right 
tautness to keep it up in the air. Sometimes , initially  
there has to be just the right tautness in your attention .  
 
This involves some work , and some  people are a little 
bit allergic to working in meditation. They think 
meditation is jus t about relaxing. But there is the  
sustained – hopefully gentle  – work of staying , for 
example , with your breath. It might seem like a bit more 
work, but if you can do it , it turns out to be a lot less 
work than letting the mind chatter with itself in 
conversation or in images.   
 
Sustaining this kind of focus of attent ion on the breath 
or wha tever you’re focusing on is one of the ways to help the mind become quiet. Part of the work of that 
sustained attention is to be alert enough to keep the 
mind from spinning out in a lot of thought. It’s not  that 
easy to do, but there has to be some alertness to notice 
that.  
 
Another  analogy I like for vicāra  would be when  listening 
to a very faint sound far in the distance that’s important 
to hear , most people would let their thinking mind 
become really quiet , because  when they’re  not involved 
in thinking , they can be more  involved in listening . 
Maybe you don’t try to strain when you  listen , but you 
have to be very intent.  
 
It’s the same thing when you’re staying on the breath . 
Sustained  attention involves intentness  to listen really 
quietly , and the thinking mind – the discursive mind, the 
mind that has conversations in its head  – you want to 
keep that quiet. If you’re lucky , perhaps you have the 
ability to turn  off, turn down , or let go of the discursive , 
conversational thinking for a moment. Part of that 
sustained attention is not just keeping your attention on 
the breath , but it ’s also having enough alertness that 
you try to keep a quiet , relaxed mind. It takes some 
work , but as I said , you’ll probably find that it’s actually 
less tiring  than letting the mind spin out. And it  helps the 
mind quiet down. At some point , the mind qui ets down 
enough , and you’re settled enough , that you no longer 
have to apply yourself anymore in order to sustain the attention, because now it is effortless  to stay there. The 
mind just stays present.  So that’s called vicāra , and it’s 
usually translated  as sustained  application of attention.  
 
Whether  you’re doing sitting meditation or walking 
meditation , you might today experiment  a little bit to see 
what it might mean for you to do this sustained 
attention. Each person has a different way of 
experiencin g or doing this. Don’t think that there’s some 
preordained way it has to be , but there is some way in 
which we can sustain the attention  – keep it there, keep 
it there, keep it there , hanging  in there, hanging out , and 
not getting swept  away with all the t houghts we can get 
swept away in.  
 
If this is interesting for you , you might want to 
experiment with that and find your way in that today. 
Hopefully  that’s useful. Thank you.
