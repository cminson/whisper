So, as we bring this second full day of our practice together to a close, this last formal
sit, as we sit embodied with the body, with the breath, with inviting a sense of goodness.
Ease warm heartedness in the heart, either practicing metta or compassion and bringing
to mind today so many moments, so many moments that have come and gone through this day,
so many moments of practice, life is practice, so many beautiful moments, so many challenging
moments, so many moments of neither, so many moments in this human life, piece together
one by one, here we are showing up, showing up continuing to be engaged, continuing to
be engaged, and as we send ourselves to bed tonight, I want to share few poems with you,
let them rest with you, let them be with you, let them shower over you, soothe you, perhaps
be dropped into your heart, into your body, for you to resonate like a bell, like a resounding,
beautiful sounding mellifluous bell, let them sound, resound within you, in the way only
first poem I like to share with all of us is dedicated to those moments, to the moments
of challenge through the day, the moments of sadness, grief, the brokenness, the broken
moments with their own grace and beauty and how they open us up, it is only those moments,
if it wasn't for those moments we would never learn the deep lessons of compassion for ourselves
and others, they are necessary part of the path.
So here is this poem by the poet Rashani called brokenness, there is a brokenness out of which
comes the unbroken, a shatteredness out of which blooms the unshatterable, there is a
sorrow beyond all grief which leads to joy and a fragility out of whose depth emerges
strength, there is a hollow space too vast, too vast for words, through which we pass
with each loss out of whose darkness we are sanctioned into being, there is a cry deeper
than sound whose serrated edges cut the heart as we break open into the place inside which
is unbreakable and whole while we are learning to sing.
We break open to the place inside which is unbreakable and whole while we are learning
to sing like the birds offering our song, the unique song that is us to the world, the
unique song that is our humanity, our being, the uniqueness of all the causes and conditions,
the grace, the beauty, the challenges, everything that has come into being in this expression
of divinity that is us living, loving, learning, learning to sing as the poet says.
The second poem I like to offer a part of it is by Cezlaw Milosh, it's called Love.
Love means to look at yourself the way one looks at distant things for you are only one
thing among many and whoever sees that way heals their heart without knowing it from
various ills, a bird and a tree say to them friend, I read it one more time such a delightful
song.
Love means to look at yourself the way one looks at distant things for you are only one
thing among many and whoever sees that way heals their heart without knowing it from
various ills, a bird and a tree say to them friend, to look at ourselves as we look at
the bird, the tree, others and our friends and they too look at us and say friend as
we've been inviting you to experiment with this shift in perspective seeing others seeing
yourself through their eyes, distant things.
Another poem I like to share is by Max Ehrman and it's called Love Someone and poem goes
love someone in God's name love someone for this is the bread of the inner life without
which a part of you will starve and die and though you feel you must be stern even hard
in your life of affairs make yourself at least a little corner somewhere in the great world
where you may be where you may unbosom and be kind make yourself a little corner somewhere
in the great world where you may unbosom and be kind this is a little corner you're making
for yourself it's a practice of Mehta it's a big corner loving loving even if you may
feel you need to be stern there's a part of you the self-judgment to be kind to be kind
in this great world and I will end a very short poem by Rilka
it's an aspiration so this poem is called I live my life and it's from the book of ours
titled love poems to God love poems to God here it goes I live my life in widening circles
that reach out across the world I live my life in widening circles that reach out across
the world I may not ever complete the last one but I give myself to it I may never complete
the last one but I give myself to it so dear ones we give ourselves to it we give ourselves
our heart like love poems to God love poems to humanity love poems to ourselves to all
beings everywhere and we give ourselves to it wishing you sweet dreams resting well tonight
and see you tomorrow morning
