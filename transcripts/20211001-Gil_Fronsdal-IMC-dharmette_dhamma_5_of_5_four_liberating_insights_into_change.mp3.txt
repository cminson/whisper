 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So this is the final talk on the fourth foundation of mindfulness. This is the area of mindfulness practice that we're studying, being attentive to the ways that we get stuck and the ways that we get unstuck. Or to say it in more Buddhist language, how we get attached, where we get attached, the nature of detachment, and how we get unattached or free, liberated. And I've presented this as a kind of a process. First we spend our time moving through the layers of attachment we have, the layers of stuckness and getting more and more subtle, but at some point when it's subtle enough, when our preoccupation stuckness doesn't predominate, then meditation practice opens up to a native and natural feeling of well-being that's here, which is the seven factors of awakening, which we don't have to be so concerned with exactly all seven. But right now I just want to say a sense of well-being, tranquil, happy, equanimous, a feeling of being at ease, a deep, deep way in this world. And that is the foundation for the last foundation, at last exercise, which sometimes is called the Four Noble Truths, so it's not called that in this exercise. And it's a little formula that appears repeatedly hundreds of times in the teachings of the Lord. And that is to know suffering, to know the arising of suffering, to know the cessation of suffering, and to know the way to the cessation of suffering. And sometimes this is called the Four Noble Truths, but that confuses it a little bit because what the Four Noble Truths have become down through the ages of wonderful teaching is a little bit more complicated than the simplicity of seeing change. And this fifth exercise is seeing rising and passing a phenomena, rising and ceasing of things and really kind of because we're so at ease and equanimous and peaceful, then we're at a readiness and ability to kind of flow and go along with the changing nature of the present moment, the river of change that's happening here. And the changing sensations of breathing, body, emotions, thoughts, sounds, they're all changing except for when we get stuck in the concepts of ideas and the stories related to it. And that also has layers of subtlety, if we're at the grosser level we're stuck in the stories. At the most refined level we might be stuck in very simple concepts, ideas of what things are. And the idea of breathing is not the breathing itself. And you can think about your breathing and have no connection to your breathing. And to really feel and sense the breathing and not so strongly through the filter of the concept, the idea. And then we're able to see the changing nature of all the little sensations are coming and going, arising and passing. And to really start resting or taking in this radical way in which things are flowing, changing all the time, is a kind of a massage on the remaining places in our mind, in our hearts, that are stuck, that are frozen, that are tight. And so it's a little bit hard to keep that stuck, keep it there. And so there starts to be a willingness and a relaxation into this place of ease and freedom that comes with resting and change, resting in how things are always moving and changing. And it becomes more and more sensitive to the subtlety of being stuck. And it can be even the idea that I am aware or I'm here and that's the change that I'm watching is a very, very, very subtle kind of innocent almost, a stuckness that also begins to dissolve when you really kind of rest in the ocean of change and just be with it. And so at some point this experience of just seeing arising and ceasing becomes the predominant experience of meditation and mindfulness meditation. And it doesn't really matter anymore what you're experiencing, like what it is, it's just the fact that everything is arising and passing and there's no overlay of concepts on top of it. And now there's even the subtlest kinds of stuckness are no longer operating, at least for the time being while we're in meditation. And then at some point the ceasing, the arising and ceasing, the ceasing happens more dramatically and there's a ceasing that really feels like something has radically dramatically stopped. Something that's been like the hum of the refrigerator suddenly stops and it's like, wow, that I didn't realize was humming even. And so something that we didn't even realize was there drops away and falls away, evaporates, collapses into itself or just is set free in some way. And then to recognize, oh, being able to see change at this level, that's the way to freedom. And in this fourth foundation of mindfulness, that's what it means at the last knowing that this is the way to the cessation of suffering, is to stay in the current of change. And the language here is suffering, knowing suffering, knowing the rising of it, knowing the ceasing of it and knowing the way to the ceasing of it, because as we get more and more into this field of change, then it's that stuckness, the place where we still suffer that stands out in the highlight and it stands out above the flow. And so then we bring our attention to that, to be present and see that until we start seeing that it too breaks up and is made up of arising and ceasing of things. And so at some point, after meditation is quite deep, and there's a lot of, like I said, the seven factors of awakening are established, there's a lot of well-being, that kind of the name of the game becomes just tuning into the subtlest forms of stress, of tension, attraction, all words for the subtlety of suffering in deeper meditation. So definitely Buddhism is about addressing suffering, and we do it all along the way, and because any place we're stuck has to be somehow resolved in order to drop into change. And so at the courses level, we're caught up in the hindrances, and that might take years to work through some of the stuckness we have. At a more refined level, we're stuck on self and identity issues that we're attached to. And then at a more even subtle level, we're still caught up in comfort and reacting to pleasure and pain and wanting or not wanting in the world and the sensations we have. And so we're kind of working through that. It's not an easy process, but boy, is it worthwhile. It's a fantastic thing to practice mindfulness and go through this process and end up in a process of radical change, and that's a change that's freeing, it's liberating. All along the way, throughout the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, throughout the whole process of what happens in meditation, the basic practice actually is always the same. It's just to be mindful, attentive, carefully, attentively to what's happening now. And in doing so, slowly learn how to free attention from any kind of stuckness, any kind of agendas, any kind of attachment to self, any kind of reactivity to anything at all. And so at first we start meditating. This is not so clean, but that's okay. It's always the same practice. Just do the best we can to be mindful of what's here and keep going, doing it over and over again, doing it in daily life, doing it in meditation, developing the capacity to be aware, to live in awareness, to live in awareness more and more and more. And so as we go through our life, we're living in a field of awareness. We're present and aware for what's happening in our minds, in our hearts, and all around us. And as we do that process, the practice is always the same, being aware, being mindful. And at some point, especially if we do enough meditation, we drop into this world of change and the change that is liberating, that's freeing. So that is the exercise, the fourth foundation. And hopefully that was clear enough. There's maybe many other ways of understanding it or interpretations, but this is the one that I like to present. So that's enough. Thank you. So, announcement. So next week I'm going on a small vacation with my wife up into the mountains to go hiking. And so happy that Nikki Murgafori will come and teach. She's been here before for our morning 7 a.m. sitting here at IMC and a wonderful teacher here at IMC. And you're being good hands with Nikki. And I'll be back the following week. So thank you very much.
