The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Welcome to now. Welcome to here.
What I want to talk about this morning is equanimity.
And actually the original title of my talk was equanimity in times of
uncertainty. And as I looked at that title this
morning, I realized that uncertainty was not in my thoughts.
It really wasn't about uncertainty. It was about
what is equanimity. What is it? What do we mean when we say
I would like to be equanimous? I would like to
realize equanimity in my life.
Before I begin, I want to give a thank you to the people
that I have met who participate in the online Dharma
practice groups. Because their questions
and their comments and inviting me into their practice in their lives
stimulates thoughts, reflections, their words reverberate
in my mind and in my practice.
And I've thought about that in terms of equanimity. When I woke up this morning
I thought, what is it that I really, really want to say?
I have a long prepared talk with all kinds of things in it, but
what I really want is for everyone to understand
what equanimity means in life. Why do we value it? What is
what's important about it?
I'm going to give you a quote from Gil. It was in an article he wrote about
equanimity. Equanimity, one of the most
sublime emotions of Buddhist practice, is the ground
for wisdom and freedom and the protector of compassion and love.
Equanimity, one of the most sublime emotions of Buddhist practice,
is the ground for wisdom and freedom and the protector
of compassion and love.
Equanimity, when seen this way, it's it's less a state to be achieved
but a way of being with our experience. It is a way of being
and not something that smooths over how we are, what our
experiences are. There's a supplement, a suppleness to
equanimity. Equanimity is not rigid. It is not
defined in terms of these are the characteristics
where you know okay you're there.
It really is a way of just meeting experience and what is it that allows
us to meet experience and not be blown away
by whatever that experience is.
One of the things we think about equanimity is that it's most accessible
on retreat. You're going to get calm, you settle
into your meditation and everything is beginning to get
rosy or not or you're experiencing an aversion
retreat or but the equanimity is what arises and you say
aha now that none of this is bothering me,
I can be in this state of evenness
but you know equanimity shows up in all kinds of Buddhist lists you know it
it's in the the seven factors of enlightenment and the four brahma vaharas
and the ten parames and it's the fourth
jhanak factor of concentration and the thing about equanimity is it comes
after mindfulness, comes after concentration, it comes after joy,
after tranquility,
comes after all of these things we practice toward
and the qualities of equanimity have to do
with presence with the experience, presence,
clarity and ease, a lack of struggle.
So of course it makes no sense to struggle to become
equanimous
but what does it mean this presence and clarity and ease what do I mean when I
say that? What do I mean by presence?
What is presence? You know someone asked me who were the people who
influenced me, what teachers influenced me in my practice?
This is really a marvelous question and not only who were they but
why was I influenced by them? What about them
caused me
to be motivated in practice and presence was one of them but
surprisingly to me I hadn't thought of it quite that way.
One of the earliest experiences I had was going to a bookstore
and Sylvia Borstein was talking about her book
that's funny you don't look Buddhist so I'll give you an idea it was
25 plus years ago and she what I noticed about her
she was talking about her book was that she had no wrinkles in her forehead
that she was totally at ease she did not seem to be concerned about
anything and I thought wow I want that I want that just
just here in the room. Another experience was going to see the Dalai Lama
there was a large conference in San Francisco over
2,000 people and it was on peace and the theme was
for peace in the world you begin with peace in your heart and then peace in
the family and then peace in your community and then
peace in the larger community and peace in the world
and that all began with you and as I was listening to him over the course of the
week at how he exchanged views with people
what became really clear to me was that everyone in the room
felt like he was looking directly at them
and seeing them his presence his being there-ness was so strong
that you could feel it across the room with 2,000 other people
and everyone thought that it wasn't a sort of projection
of Guru is on him it was really feeling
seen
feeling seen and and that presence when we experience presence
we are fully engaged in whatever the experience is that is happening
here we this person this person who's showing up with these
conditions in these conditions this conditioning
this person however it is is fully engaged
in this moment this this one this person you
you are in this moment this is what it means to be alive
normally we you know we we get lost in our thoughts and the thoughts were off
over here and you know the body is here and
sometimes we're slightly aware of the body and
what are we aware of
what is it that i actually know about this moment
the presence of total immersion in just this
this however irritating or sweet or whatever emotions come up
in the midst of it whatever twitches whatever bodily twitches this
this is totally in this moment this is the experience
this body is having and in conversation the other person
is contributing to whatever the experience is
are you there for that or is the mind off wondering
what you're going to say in response
presence the absoluteness of just being aware of this
experience this is presence to embody presence is to just be in it
the second item was clarity and i spend a great deal of my time
talking about seeing clearly and when i went through this talk that i created
and went down all the pieces of it i found seeing clearly i must have written
20 times and i thought okay so that means
something to you what does it mean to everyone else
it reminds me of a zen teacher one time who he he always told this particular
story at least once a year i i sat with him for maybe 10 or 15 years
and every year he told the story about the monk that turned into a fox
and i asked him one day why this story was important to him
and he looked really surprised and i said but you tell it all the time it has
real meaning for you and he told me what it was
but in the process of that i understood that the seeing clearly part
has to do with knowing the honesty of what's actually happening in this
moment you know we we think we know what's going on
and we apply a name to it we note and we say oh it's this
and then we dismiss it but the seeing clearly has to do with
saying uh what else is true about that
so so this becomes very obvious when you're talking to somebody and you hear
what they say and you say oh well and you form an opinion about what
they say and then you no longer hear what
else they're saying because because you know already
or do you so so i've also inspired by a book of poems
that a friend sent me this is by Ada Limone
and the book is a new book of poetry of hers called the herding kind let me see
if i can find this page the the piece is called calling
things what they are seems fitting right i pass the feeder and yell
crackle party and then an hour later i yell
morning dove after party i call the feeder the party
and the seed on the ground the after party i'm getting so good at watching
that i've even dug out the binoculars an old poet gave me back when i was young
and heading to the cape was so much future ahead of me it was like my own
ocean tufted titmouse i yelled and lucas laughs and says
thought so but he's humoring me he didn't think so at all
my father does the same thing shouts out at the feeder announcing the party
attendees he throws a whole peanut or two to the
stellar's jay who visits on a low oak branch in the morning
to think there was a time i thought birds were kind of boring
brown bird gray bird blackbird blah blah blah bird
then i started to learn their names by the ocean and the person i was dating
said that's the problem with you limon you're all fauna
no flora and i began to learn the name of trees
i'd like to call things as they are before the only thing i was interested
in was love how it grips you how it terrifies
you how it annihilates and resuscitates you
i didn't know then that it wasn't even love that i was interested in
but my own suffering i thought suffering kept things interesting
how funny that i called it love and the whole time it was pain
how funny that i called it love and the whole time
it was pain this is what seeing clearly is about
we have these ways of thinking about what's happening in our experience
and we got kind of entrained with that way of thinking
oh yeah love is glorious it keeps everything exciting right
well maybe it wasn't really love maybe it was something else
and becoming enamored of one's own pain is not uncommon
it's familiar oh this life is so difficult
and pretty soon everything falls into that quarter of life is so difficult
you know in the last week there's been the last week or two there's been a
lot of trauma in my immediate family health
related issues for various people and i myself was
worried that i might have had covid and i was you know waiting for two i could
take my pcr test there's all that unlimited
free thinking about oh my god everything's falling apart you have this
feeling that everything's falling apart
but it isn't falling apart it's just happening
rapid fire appears to be like this it appears to be like this but how is it
breathing also during the week it turned out
my grandson had covid and so he couldn't finish the last week of school
which was very upsetting for him he's nine
and i got to read to him every afternoon by zoom
for two hours which is a long time to read a kid's book and sound
you know enthusiastic and bright and carrying on the meaning in the in your
tone of voice and how delightful it was
now it isn't that i was finding delight in the midst of
pain and agony and sorrow but rather that both things were present
and that if i focused on poor milcomb
i would not be able to focus on the delight of telling this mystery story
about these little kids in this book i couldn't have engaged in the moment
because i would have been so worried about how is he feeling how's he taking
it in right which seems like a very compassionate act but is it
whereas the total engagement in just this
proved to be just delightful for both of us truly delightful
he was very eagerly setting up the next appointment well let's do it too
tomorrow no let's do it 230 because i have to finish my movie
just the the the excitement of justice
and how exciting that is to be engaged in the moment
and not focused on oh what could be wrong what might be wrong
and i knew this to say my pcr was negative
or i wouldn't be here
the moments where we believe we know what's going on
are the very moments to say really what is it that's happening
it is this seeing clearly into what my first impressions are and what
what does that mean to me now
it's realizing that experience does not have to be tied into meaning
it doesn't have to be tied into meaning the mind wants to make a story of our
experience you know a continuing story but
this is the only thing that's happening right now
my life in the past has not happened to me right now
you know this morning i'm planning to go up to seattle to
to visit another very new ill grandson and it's at the university of
washington and so i thought of a friend of mine who works there
is somebody that i went to graduate school with he was a postdoc i was in
graduate school and i thought wouldn't it be delightful to
see him and thoughts kept coming up of
from 40 years ago which is are not about now
and i watched the mind go back to those stories and i wonder what he's like now
and i reflected that i am nothing like i was then
that this person is totally different really different however
other characteristics may be true equanimity is an intersection
of suffering identity with self and ease
and to see how the impermanence impermanence
the ease of impermanence when you when you really
engage in impermanence you stop building meaning around every experience you
have
it's just the experience it's just the experience
and finally the other thing had to do with struggle and ease
i was thinking about that this morning as i you know i was walking calmly
through my house reviewing in my mind what i was i had 10 minutes
i was going along next thing i knew 15 minutes had passed
and i thought i will arrive later than i attended to arrive
now there's a couple of ways of thinking about that one is i'm
i'm going to be late and the other is i'm going to arrive
later than i intended and the difference between them
is seeing this is what's happening and saying
i need to move with alacrity versus i'm rushing rushing has that sense of
urgency and i have to change what's true
i need to move with alacrity is ah time to move
the difference between them has to do with how much i am struggling with how
things are how things are what is the struggle
with how things are it's not so so it's not saying that
being later than i intended is good it's just
how it is it's neither good nor bad i don't even have to say it's okay
it just is that's all that that is what it is not to
struggle that it's just like this
uncertainty can be unpleasant oh dear i don't know what's going to
happen or it can be exciting oh what's going to come
next it's still uncertainty the attitude that we bring to it that
we impose on the experience changes how we see it
and how the experience then is conditioned into the next moment
the difference between loneliness and solitude
usually turns up to be whether it was your idea or not
equanimity arises out of clear seeing and the absence of taking it personally
the absence of saying this is about the story of my life
it's useful when you think about equanimity to consider
when equanimity is not present when do i not feel
the stability the stability of being in this moment
because that is a key factor stability of mind
what's generally true is that we get pulled around in life
through the eight worldly wins you know the praise and blame pain and
pleasure gain and loss fame and disrepute so
this morning as i was sitting here there's a
a new thing that has occurred in the last few months in my sitting practice
which could be considered annoying and that is as i settle in
my jaw starts doing involuntary movement
it just moves quivers moves back and forth
and the first time this habit happened i was just
surprised and now i'm still surprised i still go
oh what is that and the mind wants to make meaning around it
it may be
uh i've been storing things in my jaw my life the tension of life and is slowly
working its way out it may be i don't know something medical it may be
who knows what's true is it's quivers and as i was sitting here i wondered the
thought of i was what does that look like in a mask
does that move back and forth does that is that strange
and then i thought ah working up working on
on a fame and disrepute i'm going to look like i don't know what i'm doing
up here i watched that like laugh that comment i
laughed it said oh it's easy that comes up all
the time things like that come up
what's important is to be able to see when they come up
that's the clear seeing part oh i'm trying to establish blame for why
this happened i'm going to blame at and t or i'm
going to blame you know pick pick somebody to blame
pick yourself to blame that's where self-criticism comes
in it's it's being blown to the side
what equanimity represents is the suppleness of mind the stability of
mind that takes it in and stays here
takes it in it doesn't have to run off and fix it or change it
or be blown away by it but just here there are two words that the Buddha used
when he talked about equanimity one of them was upeka
the other one i have to look up here because it's really
something i stumble over another word so upeka has to do with
seeing over it has the components of the word are
seeing over so in equanimity there is a
a broad view where you're not upset by the ups and downs you become very
aware of the coming and going of all things
and that looking out over that allows you to not be blown away by it
i may not be able to find this word i apologize
but i am oh there it is it is tatramaja tata tatramaja tata
and what it's a combination of words poly words
and it means to stand in the middle of all this
to stand in the middle so the standing in the middle
is not a rigid standing but it is a saying in order to be
in equanimity everything must be included
it's not about being a better person so that you can be
equanimous about having a better practice so you could be
equanimous it's about showing up with this person
in this moment moment and having the flexibility the stability of mind
to just say this is what's happening in this moment
and when you see clearly you can take the intentions that you have
you can recall your intention in life
and take the next step it is about choosing as opposed to reactivity
so yes equanimity and meditation is quite lovely equanimity when you're out in
the world with everything happening around you
is also quite lovely it's a recalling to okay it's like this
it's like this and that recalling allows us not to be blown away
by the eight worldly winds it allows us to be present for
okay here's how it is now i am still here
the presence of i am still here and i can see this is what's happening
it involves integrity honesty brutal honesty
it's seeing when you what you think is love is really pain
is just being really honest i see things coming and going
i understand that things arise and pass away
they don't have some specific meaning it is not about me
it's just what's happening here
and i have the stability and presence of mind
to allow that to be true
it turns out you know i there's there are all kinds of prescriptions for how one
cultivates equanimity but it seems to me equanimity is really
a quality of practice when that practice is incorporated
into the moment it arises by a fierce attention
to presence and seeing clearly and that ferocity has to come
with an open soft heart because otherwise we are rigid
and unfeeling and insensitive to what's happening
so the very things that hurt us that rub our raw spots are the places
that remind us how alive we are how in the moment we are
and needs to be included oh this this is what's happening
so there's a there there's equanimity practice how many of you have heard of
equanimity practice it's similar to metta
metta in which you repeat certain phrases
that are intended to bring your mind into the space where you can actually
experience what it is you're talking about so
i'm just going to briefly i do this practice routinely routinely i have
for many years because it reminds me calls to mind
the importance of the clarity of seeing that is so essential
things as they are so i'm just going to go through my phrases
i am heir to my own karma my suffering depends
on my intentions and my actions not what others wish
despite what i may wish things are as they are
may i see things just as they are
may i meet the arising and passing away
of all things with equanimity and balance
i am heir to my own karma my suffering or lack of suffering
depends on my own intentions and actions not what others may think
despite what i may wish things are as they are
may i see things just as they are may i meet the arising and passing away
of all things with equanimity and balance
now those are just my phrases i've said them over and over and over for years
i repeat them to myself when i'm doing walking meditation
to bring the mind in see clearly see clearly and what's happened over the
years as i repeat these phrases to myself
is i come to develop a kind of insight which is a deep understanding of what
those words actually mean
it was that that caused me to wake up this morning saying
what is it about equanimity i really want to say
what is it you know i could go through all these lists do this do that
cultivate it this way but what's true is that we need to learn to
experience and recognize when we are solidly present
when we are seeing clearly and we when we are not struggling
so i started the story about the difference between rushing and not
rushing the moving quickly and and rushing
and as i was driving along i thought this is really
interesting i know the difference between wishing i was
further along and leaning over the steering wheel and
and i'm just driving i'm just going there and i watch the
urgency come into my mind and i let the urgency go and say
this is not life or death
so i've become suspicious of urgency in my life
when i feel like this has to happen now or that really
does it have to happen now what is happening now
this often happens in conversations with my husband i'll be
we'll be talking about something and i'll get enthusiastic about something
and he will be his mind is on something else
he's thinking about i'm thinking about our upcoming road trip
he's thinking about the paper he's writing on an ecological subject
to support somebody's case with i think this is the the water sanitary district
i don't know his mind is there my mind is here
we're having a conversation and he finally says i really can't take in
anymore and i can feel the urgency of just this
the end of the sentence i have to just say the end of the sentence
and i just stop this is not urgent it's just a sentence
and to feel the ease arise in that that is experiencing equanimity
in the midst of triviality
is what's important about equanimity is that it is not inaccessible to you
it's totally accessible what's required is presence seeing clearly
and not struggling i'm not saying that nothing comes up in life
that we don't struggle against happens daily
it's to recognize the struggle and to say how does this fit with my intentions
and what's my next step not two minutes from now or next week
what's my next step i'm going to finish my coffee and then move
there is a patience that gets built in when you let go of urgency
just be here just be here
so i'm going to read you yet another poem to close
this is called proof everybody likes proof right
a kestrel eyes us from a high thin branch
and my husband is surprised it can hold the hunter's weight
he's small i say my husband says he's large
obviously depends on what you compare him to a hawk a white crown sparrow a ghost
an abstraction he looms not large to me but significant
a standout something cool about him that says today is the day to test his
metal in the mid-morning air flush with dead leaves in the
ongoingness of rusted mums a surge of relief comes
like a check in the mail look i've already witnessed something other than
my slipping face in the fog mirror the dog sweet
seriousness at being worshiped from nose to paw
i have proof a nearly twig like branch can still hold
a too heavy falcon it's not much to go on i know
it's not much to go on i know
don't belittle any of your experiences
equanimity has built into it a piece of hope
it is the hope that comes from the ease
of justice the end of struggle is to let go of struggle
it's not much to go on i know
but the result is living a full engaged life it is about being alive
and this moment is what we have to be alive in this one
i wish all of you the ease of a supple mind
a stable mind a mind that's able to come into the presence of now
so that you can know equanimity not as an idea or an abstraction
but as a way of being with things as they are
thank you thank you
so if anyone has any questions or comments i welcome them
i apologize to anyone online i'm not monitoring that because i don't
have the capacity to do that right now but
yes
do you have the microphone on um yeah yeah um this is off point but i was uh
questioning what is the story of the fox oh the fuck you brought it up and i did
left us hanging i did i didn't tell you that story i don't know if it's too long
it's it's pretty simple actually and it's relative
so the the story is about a zen master and he uh had achieved enlightenment and
his students said well so is there no more karma and he said oh there's no karma
and he immediately became a fox and the the sentence was that he should remain a fox for
a thousand years until he understood karma and that karma could exist in any moment enlightened or not
because karma is about your intentions and your actions
no it's not a quid pro quo or this leads to that it's it's in this moment that karma is created
or not created it is about conditions and so he became a fox and a thousand years later
someone was walking through the woods and they found a monk's robe and a little note that says
is if you find this robe it means i finally understand please bury my robes
so the story and i probably don't have it exactly right but those are the the brief elements of it
it basically was about how the arrogance of thinking i've got this in any moment just creates
it's not knowing just creates the the possibility for not seeing clearly
and so if it's into this actually very well but i avoided it because i i wanted to leave
some time and i tend to talk i've tend to put too many things in my talks so so i've tried
to leave that out but that's the story thank you for asking
does anybody else have anything they'd like to ask or say i think you put just the right
number of things in your talk oh thank you so much oh good i left out the seven things that
you need to do to enhance your practice to make you more available for equanimity but
we actually talked about a lot of them insight and integrity and honesty and well-being and
and so they kind of slip in i mean the thing about equanimity is it applies to it's where
all of the pieces of buddhism actually intersect and become realized the characteristics of
suffering and not self and impermanence all pump how we deal with those questions in the real
time contribute to whether equanimity is possible or not so i thank you for your attention for your
practice for your wisdom bye
