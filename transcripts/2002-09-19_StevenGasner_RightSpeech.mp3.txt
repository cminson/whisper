 So good evening. My name is Steven Gassner and a little about myself. I've been practicing with this center since 1995 and I've been practicing Buddhist meditation since 1983 for a number of years in Los Angeles at the Zen Center of Los Angeles under Joakobek and other teachers and also at Shinzen Young Community Meditation Center. The topic of my talk is wise and wholesome speech, sometimes called right speech. How I got interested in this practice was around ten years ago and I was with a colleague of mine who I work with who worked down south in Los Angeles. We went out to dinner with my wife and I started talking about a colleague of ours and I was actually gossip about the colleague and my friend got quite annoyed with me and started telling me how upset he was and about gossiping and how bad it is and he started telling me in the Jewish tradition about the practice of not gossiping. I was very distressed for what he told me for a number of reasons. First, I knew he was right, I shouldn't be gossiping and second of all I've been sitting for a number of years and I should know better. From that point on I started really watching my speech and watching gossiping and when him and I got together we'd always be extremely mindful about not gossiping. In the last eight months I've got a new interest in right speech and other of my colleagues at work said Steve, you know, we're senior engineers here and we shouldn't talk like sailors and we really should clean up our language and so I've been working with that. The topic of right speech is extremely important in Buddhism. It's one of the five precepts for those who don't know what the precepts are. For lay people there are five precepts, for monks there are 238 precepts and these are training precepts and they're to help us in our practice the five lay precepts are not to kill, not to steal, not to misuse your sexuality, not to lie, which is the right speech and not to misuse intoxicants. It's also one of the parts of the eightfold path which is the foundation of Buddhist practice on the night of the Buddha's enlightenment. His realization was the four noble truths and to reiterate those here. The first noble truth is the truth of suffering in our experience. The second is the cause of suffering which is craving. The third is that there's an end to craving. And the fourth is the path leading to the end of craving. Now in the eightfold path there's three aspects of the eightfold path. There's wisdom, morality and meditation and in the wisdom and the morality there's three parts and those are right speech, right action and right livelihood, right action composing the other four precepts and right speech being the other one. So you can see the importance in Buddhism. But if you really look at it, it's a really important issue in our lives from day to day. Several years back Sylvia Borstein who's a teacher at Spirit Rock came and gave a talk at the center and she started the talk by saying how many people have broken a bone in their body through their life and then she said how many people who broke it in the last year still feel the aches and pains of it and a number of people raised their hands and said in the last five years how many people and were less and she went by the time she got to ten no one raised their hands. Then she asked how many people have been suffering because of what someone said to them in the last week and a lot of people raised their hands. And she said in the last year still a lot of people and she got up to 20 years and people were still raising their hands. Rabbi Toulushkin is a rabbi who gives a lot of seminars on right speech and one of the things he asks how many people know in their family have a relatives who are not speaking to each other because of things that they said and a number of people raised their hands. There's also an interesting story about Isaac Asimov the science fiction writer who's very very famous wrote a number of books and his autobiography he says that when he was in high school he wrote something and he was asked he went up in front of the class to read it and he got a lot of verbal abuse from the teacher and put him down. And when he wrote his autobiography he was like in his 70s and he said it still affected him even though he was a very famous man at that time. And we should all reflect on how many of us have said things that we've regretted the people. Now as a mindfulness practice for me it's an extremely important practice many people wonder we sit on the pillow and how do we bring this into our daily lives. Our speech is one of the main ways we communicate with the world. It gives us it gives people our identity in the world gives us our ideas and also shows our negative side. So becoming mindful that is really important to do. It's also an extremely difficult practice because in many of our mindfulness practices sitting on the pillow we just can sit back and observe or if we're doing mindfulness of walking or driving there's input but as we're speaking we're doing something active so it makes it that much more difficult. You can also see the real workings of karma without speech if you say something really negative to a person you can watch the instant karma both in the person you're talking to and the person and yourself and the opposite by saying something nice you can really affect changes in a positive way. Now what does the sutras say about right speech? So quote here the Buddha says he says he dwells refaining from full speech a truth speaker one to be relied on trustworthy dependable not a deceiver of the world abandoning malicious speech he does not repeat there what he has heard here to the detriment of these repeat here what he's heard there to the detriment of those thus he's a reconciler and those at variance and an encourager of those at one rejoicing in peace loving it delighting in it one who speaks up for peace abandoning harsh speech he refrains from it he speaks whatever is blameless pleasing to the ear agreeable reaching the heart or bane pleasing and attractive to the multitude abandoning idle chatter he speaks at the right time what is correct and to the point of dharma and discipline he is a speaker whose words are to be treasured seasonable reasoned well defined and connected with the goal now this is the advice given to monks I spent a long time looking what he said to lay people and the only addition of what he said to lay people that I could find he says abandoning false speech he abstains from a false speech when he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of relatives his guild or the royalty example the royal court proceeding if he's asked as a witness continue to tell me good man what you know if he doesn't know he says I don't know if he does know he says I know if he hasn't seen he says I haven't seen if he has seen he says I have seen thus he doesn't consciously tell a lie for his own sake and with the sake of another over the sake of any reward this is very similar to one of the 10 commandments about bearing false witness now the summary of Buddhist right speech is when you speak to notice what you're going to say is it truthful is it useful is it kind and is it timely to say so the outline for my talk there are four types of speech I'll talk about which is also which is talked about in the sutras backbiting and gossip lying harsh angry or aggressive language frivolous and useless speech in addition I'll also talk about being silent and listening and finishing the talk with a discussion on wholesome and supportive speech so backbiting or gossip much of the information on this part of the talk I've gotten from this book which is called words that hurt words that heal how to choose words wisely and well by rabbi joseph luschkin I read this book around five years ago and gave it to gill and he was so impressed with it he gave a whole talk on monday night with on it and I encourage everybody to read this book the first what is gossip and the definition is is the dissemination of accurate information that will lower the status of the person to whom it refers to or it can be translated as negative truths and I'm going to give an example of this by telling a joke there was a rabbi a priest and a minister and they're at a party and they're drinking away having a good time and the minister says you know let's all tell each other our vices and being members of the faith will keep it confidential and this will help us in in our faith be better as ministers and rabbis so they all agree and the rabbi goes first the rabbi says well you know when I was in the army I accidentally had a had pork and I really loved it and so every six months I really get the urge and I go to a neighborhood outside my neighborhood and I have a pork rib dinner and I really love it and the priest goes I don't know how to keep this celibacy I mean it is it is impossible and and I'll be honest with you I'm having affairs with several unmarried women outside my parish and they all look at the minister and the minister is quiet and they tell the minister come on tell us you know and he says no I can't he says come on we'll keep it confidential he says confidential he says what I'll tell you I love to gossip and I can't wait to get out of here and tell everybody what you just told me so why do we gossip there are many reasons some people do it to raise their status while lowering someone else's we set we sometimes set up comparison in the mind that we are better than the person we are gossiping about some people do it because they are angry with the person with a person and they gossip about them some people derive great enjoyment from seeing people who are moral leaders be brought down to our level this could be one reason the minister gossip I think was more it's enjoyable I think it's this last reason is some people gossip to show they are in the know that they know something about somebody when I was in college I became friends with a person who later on went on to become the chief editor of the national inquirer and I was talking to him and I was asking him how they got their stories you know like woman marries man from Mars and stories like that and what was interesting was he told me about a lot of the stories about the stars and most of those stories are told by their friends their friends will call in and tell them about that and people who are in know something about somebody like to tell that to people and it makes them feel important there was a study done on teenage boys and teenage girls and they found teenage girls gossip a lot and the study found out that one of the reasons teenage girls do is because it's a social status thing if they know some private thing about somebody who's very popular they know that that person must be really close with them and it increases their status there is a great study that was done at Northeastern University on gossiping and in that study what the professors wanted to know was how fast the gossip would travel so they put out this notice and they put it all over the campus announcing a wedding that everybody's invited to and the wedding is going to take place on the steps of the student union and so they put the flyers all over the campus and they the wedding was announced for June 6 and they put the flyers out on June 7th and then they went around to find out how many people heard of the wedding and like 54 percent actually heard of the wedding and it was even more surprising 12 percent that the people actually claimed to have gone to the wedding and they thought maybe and actually they actually described about the wedding the bride in the groom the bride showing up in a beautiful wedding gown and the groom showing up tuxedo and going off in a limousine they thought maybe you know there really was a wedding that day and they checked into it and there wasn't so some people will not only gossip but they'll even change the truth there's a real lure of listening and to telling gossip the next time you want to gossip or hear gossip watch how your mind works and how it reacts i noticed mine is a real lure pushing to it and this is normal even with very advanced practitioners joseph goldstein in his new book one dama talks he's talking about the precepts he talks about one time being interviewed for an article and the person who was interviewed and was really trying to lure him into gossip and he says he can feel his mind trying to go that way but he was able to be mindful and have a wholesome speech and he felt very good about that not gossiping is very difficult especially in our culture our media newspapers are geared up for gossip when you hear a juicy story on the television or in the headlines in the paper do you skip over it or do you read it gossiping is also a social thing we find it interesting when we get together with friends and family it is something to talk about yet we all know the disastrous effects of it and if we don't i'm going to give you some examples sally clowes also teaches spirit rock gave a talk here around a month ago three weeks ago and just talking about people doing various things in their practice and one person was very committed to to write speech and the reason and he says he practices it all he practices it all the time not that he has right speech but the reason he's so intimately involved in is one time he was gossiping about somebody and that person happened to be in fact with him and hurt hurt it a disastrous effect of gossip is given in this book when president ford was president in sacramento there was an assassination attempt on his life and there was a gentleman next to the woman who had the gun and diverted it and the gentleman became a national hero over overnight so the media immediately wants to know all about him and they went and interviewed him he really didn't want to be interviewed and and finally he agreed and he said we'll just talk about the incidence of the of uh saving the president's life and so this piqued their curiosity why doesn't want to talk about himself so they dug deeply and they found out he was gay he was very involved in the in the gay movement in san francisco and then when the reporters went to his mother who lived in michigan i think was michigan and said how do you feel about your your son being involved in the gay movement and actually she didn't even know her son was gay and after that she didn't want to speak to her her son and when she died her father his father said that your mother doesn't want you at the funeral and this really broke his heart and ended up drinking himself to death and in hindsight the reporter said well if i had to do it over again i i wouldn't have said that and rabbi tlushkin in his his seminars asked how many of you can think of at least one episode in your life that would cause you great embarrassment will become known to everyone else here there's this invariably many hands go up and he's not talking about armed robbery but uh a minor things a good general rule if you feel the urge to gossip is uh to remember the golden rule would you want somebody else talking about things which you wouldn't want to be known but you want someone gossiping some of your weaknesses to people to quote the swiss theologian jonathan lavader never tell evil of a man if you do not know it for certainty and if you know it for certainty then ask yourself why should i tell it there's some categories of uh gossiping one of them is uh tattling and again there's an excellent example in this book of a friend of his who became engaged and um the woman's sister was speaking to their uncle and her uncle happened to say carol's a very sweet girl but david is much more accomplished and worldly than she is i'm afraid that is going to be bored with her and her sister actually told the woman's to be engaged this remark before this remark the woman was very close with her uncle and her father died and the uncle was going to walk her down the aisle and the relationship now is almost non-existent now the impression i got was that the uncle loved the niece very much and the problem with with tattling or gossip or anything is we always tell the negative things and we don't see the whole story for instance we don't go around gossiping hey did you hear the news joe's really a good guy there's uh some quotes in here by mark twain and blase pascal and he's a very good guy and mark twain and blase pascal uh on the subject blase pascal says i lay down as a fact that if all men knew what others say of them they'd be not four friends in the world and mark twain says it takes your enemy and your friend working together to hurt you to the heart the one to slander you and the other to get the news to you another category of gossiping is rumors things you're not sure are true the media is very good with this and rumors are usually of a of a negative quality also and uh when you hear a rumor about a person you should be very careful about it to find out whether it's true or not the last form of gossiping is uh slander slander's form of gossiping except in this case it actually is untrue and gossiping cause a lot of decisiveness in a community especially in a spiritual community um in many orthodox jewish communities the practice of not gossiping is taken very seriously there's a community center in new york where they have a poster on the wall and says don't gossip and there's a picture of a man shoving another man down into a meat grinder so you can see how so you can see how seriously they they take the practice they even have non-gossip support groups also there was a rabbi in the 1800s wrote the definitive book on right speech it's called guard your tongue his name is half its hymen and with a lot of orthodox people will do will actually put a picture of him by their phone to remind them not to gossip when they're when they're talking on the phone but how are we as practitioners to be skillful in our speech about gossip one is just being aware is a great start the second is see the great harm the gossip causes and as you practice uh these two over time i think your amount of gossiping will go down if you're angry with a person don't go around telling other people what a rotten person they are be constructive if you need to talk to other people stay focused on the problem not making the other person agree with you that the one you're angry with is the devil incarnate the best solution is you can actually talk to the person you're mad with talushkin recommends you know not gossiping cold turkey and if you have to gossip find somebody you're close with like a spouse or friend and do your gossiping there i have the uh opposite opinion i think you should find a friend or several friends who when you get together you make a uh a vow that was strong word but uh that you're not going to gossip and that's the way i started practicing it um the center here is a good place is i think the gossip level is very low in the center my grandmother was a great example of not gossiping when people be gossiping around her about somebody she'd always say can't you think of something nice to say about them the next topic is lying and i'm going to assume that all of yous are an outright liars or pathogenic lying pathogenic liars lying or or full speech can include slight exaggerations and numerous untruths to falsehoods for self-protection protection of others or self-angry and diceman or they can be deliberate lies told with malicious intent the effect of lying does two things one it ruins your credibility and trustworthiness which will either take a long time to repair or it will never be repaired with certain people the second is that lying can cause great the service to others because it diminishes their ability to trust themselves people uh think you're lying then they don't want to think it a great example of uh a person who had the trustworthiness an interesting example i don't know you people have seen the movie birdman of alcatraz it was with burt lancaster and robert malden but um birdman of alcatraz was richard stroud who he was convicted of murder up in alaska and went to federal penitentiary leavenworth and and there in a fit of rage because the guard wouldn't let him see his mother he killed the guard and they put him in solitary confinement the rest of his life and while he was there he became an expert on birds and on bird diseases and he was a real genius and then he went to study a bunch of other subjects and he was transferred to alcatraz and worked on prison reformation and there was a riot at alcatraz and the prisoners took over the prison and then um guards came in and abated everything and they weren't sure about one block where it was secure and richard stroud the um warden told people to uh to throw out your weapons and richard stroud got on the pa system and threw a gun out and he says that is all the guns and d block and one of the guards asked the warden how can you how can you believe him he says you know this prison has been a real pain in my side for the last 30 years but one thing he's never done to me he's never lied many of us remember when we were teenagers how we'd exaggerate to appear in the know or to make us more important than we are it's an example of also gossiping the next topic is harsh angry or aggressive language most of us know how quickly we can get angry and when we get angry at somebody our words become harsher and harsher it's sort of like we were getting into a physical fight where you use more and more violence except your words become stronger and stronger and you start to bring things in that have nothing to do with you're angry about how many times we heard people say to us i really didn't mean when i said to you i was just very angry but we all know that anger has lasting effects the expression is sometimes used when people get really angry and and when you use a lot of verbosity when they're angry is that they use their tongues as a weapon many people say they can't hold their rage there's an excellent example in this book of you said imagine yourself that you're really angry at let's say your spouse and you're yelling and screaming and all of a sudden your boss shows up at the door and it's very important for you to be nice to your boss you'll see how quickly your anger dissipates a friend of mine who doesn't meditate but he seriously involved in personal growth once told me the story at one time he was getting angry at his partner and then he realized that that he had a choice here he didn't have to go into a rage with his language and he can control his anger that he had choice here and when he told me this story i was really happy i told him it took me many years of meditating to come to this point so how do we meditate mediate through this again the golden rule is a good guide we do not like when angry words are hurled at us so why should we hurl them in other people the second is our mindfulness practice on the cushion uh we're with ourselves and we can feel the anger arise anger is a very complex process it involves thoughts and bodily sensations and emotions and as we develop our mindfulness we can skillfully navigate through these feelings and emotions remember it's not wise to bottle up your anger uh you need to search for a middle way common and wisely devices always take a few deep breaths before you talk to somebody when they're angry become aware of what is making you angry and again stay focused on that don't add extra stuff well your mother was a drunkard that's why you were that way or things of that nature um you can tell the person you're angry with that you're angry you need a few minutes to calm down before you can speak or you may want to even wait a day or two the next topic is frivolous and useless speech or not talking i got interested really interested in this subject several years ago several years ago my sister who was in new york said she wanted to come out here and sit a retreat and what she was really fearful of was being silent on retreats you don't speak and that she was really fearful of that she didn't think she can keep silent for for two days and as i started speaking to more and more people i kept on hearing that also and i know my mother would always say my wife and i would go on retreats and goes well you know you don't talk to cheryl while you're on retreats ago no or she'd go away and retreat for a month and you're not going to talk to her for a month i remember there's a couple after one retreat i was driving to the airport and we're talking about it says yeah a lot of my friends say that also and the woman said i didn't have the heart to tell them that your mind is talking so much that you never feel alone but um what is this urge uh we have to speak what is this uncomfortableness there's a number of reasons for that i'm thinking about i remember to back my first zen retreat and when i sat this retreat i didn't know many people the zen sent of los angeles and uh i slept in a room with six other people uh six or eight other people and i didn't know any of them and before a lot of people get to meet your roommates and talk with them but i didn't get a chance to do that and so at the end of the night i just went to the room and i had to go to sleep with these six or eight strangers i felt really really uncomfortable i just really felt the urge to say good night to them just to acknowledge them there so that's one urge the one reason why we feel the urge to speak and and use fearless speech is because we feel uncomfortable another reason is the mind could be restless if you notice on the pillow when you get restlessness try to notice those feelings when they come off off the pillow and what you do about them it's also wise to look at why you want to speak to people what's your motivation are you interested in self-aggrandizement are you interested in speaking in order to know more what other people have to say are you interested in having your views accepted are you truly interested in coming to consensus not that any of these reasons wrong there's no reason to do self-aggrandizement we all do it from time to time another wise thing to look at is silence and listening the power of silence i know i was on retreat last year and one of the students asked the teacher about the silence being silent and which is more powerful the silence of meditation and he said that many him and many teachers have gotten together and they concluded that actually the silence was extremely powerful that if you went for 10 days without speaking and didn't meditate that would be a very very powerful experience it is common over time as we develop a mindfulness we learn to listen to ourselves and also magically listen more fully to other people there's a wise saying i don't know who said it but you have two ears and one mouth and you should use them in those proportions there's great power in using words succinctly harry das baba is a great uh indian teacher who's actually one of ram das's teachers and he's taken a vow of silence as a matter of fact when ram das studied with him in india in the 60s he had a bow of silence in the way he communicates was through a chalkboard which he wears around his neck and so he writes and and there are many people who do indian practice who actually use that as a practice of a chalkboard and so you have to become really succinct and harry das baba is is in santa cruz now and i understand people who have met him uh it's an awesome experience there's also great healing and those who can truly listen i never met the dali lama or the karmapa but i understand people who have met the dali lama or the karmapa even if you're in a big crowd people a lot of people have said when they come up and talk to you it's like you're the only person there i'll give uh some other wholesome and supportive speech um this is also from grabby solutions book but i've been talking about things you shouldn't do but wise things to try to do is uh say thank you a lot i love you i finally have gotten to the point when my wife calls me at work and at the end of the conversation i will tell her i love her because i've seen some other colleagues do that i feel okay doing that asking people how you are and what do you need and most important i'm sorry and i give all these things things i say you shouldn't do and should do is not as as as moral imperatives but to try uh try it out um try being silent try being um talking a lot and and see the effect see the effect on you um sometimes people in spiritual groups become really silent and don't talk and they go to extremes and that uh advising that but see see what it feels like i'll bet i'll end my talk uh by giving a quote that uh gill actually gave several weeks ago which i found really profound he said uh people spend more time carefully choosing their clothes and they do their words and so i hope i've conveyed to you the power of words and the power of not speaking and i've been asked to announce there's um an inside dialogue retreat here next week uh september 27th and 28th this flyer is out there for it uh starting at seven to nine on friday and continues on saturday the 28th nine to five and a lot of this seems to be on speaking in this listening and right speech so that's my talk and i'll open it up for if anybody has any questions oh we can sit here in silence huh i thought thought this a lot because usually i feel like i'm getting in trouble when something is not clearly could i hurt somebody and have our time exactly is there's um plenty of gray areas and one thing i realized uh in the talk i wrote it down here but didn't emphasize it one of the most important things in speaking is to look at your intention uh when you speak like if you're being critical of somebody and and how to be critical i mean it's important if you're going to criticize somebody not to do it in public to call them aside so you don't um um humiliate but there are are plenty gray areas and like i said also it's so um uh in our culture to gossip but everything think twice about it um that people have a hard time when they get together knowing what to say if you if you don't gossip so it is a very difficult even um the rabbis talk about that um how difficult of a practice it is it is to keep it is to keep um with um community amongst it's uh you have a lot more self-support there's a lot more guidelines which are 238 precepts to keep being lay people uh it makes it harder but it's truly marvelous to meet people who who do practice as nice as my grandmother was her makkah woman she lived 102 um it's remarkable to see that how she wouldn't gossip about people there's also the question not so much of content of speech but how one interacts with others so for example you can hurt somebody by showing signs of impatience or being a little bit sharp and reply or not giving a personality or an effective reply and criticism by finishing some three sentences you get on with or saying oh you know it doesn't really make sense so i think there's something you may not say anything directly vertical but yeah right right right and he talks about that in there like if someone goes you know uh bill and you roll your eyes um it's not only verbal um but any gestures like that can be really uh hurtful to people exactly i think that's one of the hardest things to for um myself to do anyway is to back that up a few frames and find out and ask myself the question why how i postured that attitude why is it necessary to have that reaction right right and even more mindful of staying gentle in the approach on myself for having done it and having to back up out of it or apologize for it in a direct way for a long time i'd see myself that was going to gossip and even say well i really shouldn't say this but now i mean with this other gentleman who's got me to clean up my uh foul language or her foul language uh at work people know that his office and my office are no gossip zones that we don't we don't gossip in there it's interesting i posted it posted no one's no gossip free gossip zone gossip zone free area or something like that on my door and um i found that it was difficult for me to not to not gossip that seemed to be okay in my certain little area but other people coming in and having conversation you know with each other and gossiping and being you know the encouragement i'm hearing about your grandmothers intervening and say this this is a gossip free zone or looking at it and continuing to gossip to own my own space and um ask that of other people when they are there and one other notice on the um i love you you know is that my daughter taught me something that she had started you say which is long distance and they ask each other have i told and every day they say there's been going on for two three years you know have i told you how much i love you today and the answer you know the reply is to be no you know you have not and then use an example i love you as as many threads as there are in a carpet in the entire world and uh things then they say wow that's plenty much and it's a lot thank you you know and the other one in turn not a day goes by that i don't do that same thing with her and how easy it is to find out how boundless your love can be for example is a story in here um where a gentleman's wife died and they're at the the cemetery and uh the rabbi said well it's time to go home and he goes but i love my wife and i says i know he says um but it's time to go home he says but i love my wife but you know we really need to go home now so you don't understand i i really love my wife and one time i almost told her and i told that to uh my colleague at work and he said you know he's read articles that since september 11th people were really involved with that people are seeing the importance of their relationships and are doing those things more there's also one more thing i want to say in this book he he had a movement which was actually supported by um senator lieberman and another senator in here um to have a speak no evil day and it hasn't passed uh the senate but the bill the bill was uh uh the bill was there thank you for your remarks that's really really nice anybody else have any comments or questions or i have to say i wonder if it's right to you i know you said that you know you have to gossip and i think you all sometimes we do have to get some moments where we feel like we have to to do it in private and i found that even that's not a good idea because it just reinforces your sense that you're right when they're wrong and like it propagates this attachment of like having a higher ground in terms of character or whatever the issue is and it seems like you know i mean i have a probably similar work situation where there's a lot of gossip and it's hard to avoid it comes your way but i found that like people even even if you're thinking it you're too attached to the idea that you're right well it's he's recommending people can't quit cold turkey and after the book starts out saying that um he asked people in his seminars how many people can go 24 hours without gossiping and uh no one raises their hand and he says you know if you if you ask that to somebody who drank or somebody who smoked i mean they have a real problem and people don't don't see it as a real real problem so he's so you know one approach is cold turkey and it gives wise and skillful advice if you are going to gossip with you with your wife and and uh how to do it i said my approach was the opposite i just went on regulating with certain people i definitely wouldn't gossip then it got more and more so he's supposed to meditate till nine o'clock and uh a lot of people doing this meditation is lead a loving kindness meditation so i will lead you people in a loving kindness meditation so if everybody can sit comfortably and close your eyes take a couple of deep breaths and you want to concentrate about your heart center and there are classical phrases you can make up your own phrases for um loving kindness and loving kindness always starts with yourself and a lot of people have problems with that the buddha said you can search all the world and you'll not find one more deserving of love than
