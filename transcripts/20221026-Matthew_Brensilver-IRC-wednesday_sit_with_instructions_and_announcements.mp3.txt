 The spine reaches ever so gently toward the sky. In the earth gravity pulls the rest of us down. Between the expansiveness of the sky and the groundedness of the earth, we find ourselves. There is the breath. And perhaps just taking a few breaths in a way that feels conducive to relaxation. On your breath reach into your belly, reach into your toes. In the air reach into your body. In the air reach into your toes. There is your body, but not the image you have of the outline of your body. And not the memory of what your body looks like when you look in a mirror. But the constellation of sensations that bloom and collapse moment by moment. The constellation of sensations that bloom and collapse moment by moment. The constellation of sensations that bloom and collapse moment by moment. As we saw yesterday, the hands. Maybe there is some sense that where the body ends and space begins, a little porous. Maybe there is some sense that where the body ends and space begins. The body, this constellation of sensations, feels pervaded by space, is space. And the difference in the spaciousness of the body, the spaciousness of the space surrounding our body is a mere gradient of density. The constellation of sensations that bloom and collapse moment by moment. The constellation of sensations that bloom and collapse moment by moment. And some of what we do with our mindfulness and our equanimity and our love is continually dissolve. The somethingness, the solidifications, the densities of our body into flowing, vibratory space. The constellation of sensations that bloom and collapse moment by moment. But it's absolutely crucial. That we not have a scintilla of preference for the openness, spaciousness over somethingness. Solidification. And so quite naturally, a sense of urgency, pressure, a sense of a surge of motivation towards or away. Kind of building blocks of affect and emotion well up in us. And what might later become an elaborate story about the rightness or wrongness of samsara, the rightness or wrongness of about me, the rightness or wrongness about this path, this retreat, this life, germinates in the body. Kind of feeling circuits of the body often along the front axis of your body, your face, throat, chest, belly. But sometimes these affective states seem to coat the whole body in a thin film of feeling. Sometimes pleasant, unpleasant, sometimes intense, sometimes very subtle, but significant nonetheless. Sometimes more stable, more flowing like a lava lamp. And rather than trying to read the tea leaves of our body, of feeling of affect, rather than trying to understand what this feeling means for my life and my future, we open our heart-mind to it in its simplicity. We open our heart-mind to it in its simplicity. We open our heart-mind to it in its simplicity. We open our heart-mind to it in its simplicity. We open our heart-mind to it in its simplicity. The surges of motivation, of moving towards or away from phenomena, a sound we like or dislike, discomfort, pain in our body, the urge to fidget or scratch, the delight, the wish that this keep going. All of these have a kind of fingerprint in the affective circuits of our body. And we are compulsively reading the tea leaves of us body. But here, just for our time together, every emotional sensation means exactly the same thing. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Our knowing is suffused by our motivations. What we see is not separable from what we want. And so we practice letting go. Softening and gentle with the wanting. Practice caring more about awareness than our life. And we explore what knowing is like in the wake of letting go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Clinging, which the... identified as the central predicament of our condition. Clinging has no legs without involvement of these circuits of affect, of feeling, of emotion in our body. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I had this moment during this set where I just opened my eyes and looking at you. And just the sense of all of us just having, you know, the intensity, intensity of being human. And the fingerprints in our bodies, our bodies kind of orienting to signals of threat and opportunity moment by moment, of pain and the prospects for pleasure. And then our thinking, just trying to like grapple with all of it and make sense of it and find a way through the labyrinth of samsara. And just in that moment of seeing you, seeing us in that is very, very poignant, it's unverably almost poignant, this condition and, you know, all of us trying to find our way in a world on an earth that literally shakes. And so quite naturally we come to rely a great deal on the narratives, the kind of stories that we tell and the causal maps that we devise. I feel this because of that. If I get this, I will feel that. If I avoid this, I get this. And this kind of narratives, narrativizing of our life, of our body, of our feeling, very natural and important. And obscure is something important too. So we're learning as we enter the kind of heart of the retreat, we're learning what can be trusted other than our stories. So stay close in. Skill said. Travel, travel at the piece of awareness as Fred said. Stay with the rhythms of practice as best you can. Part of retreat, rhythms of it, and certainly for many people part of walking meditation at some point is you're being enlisted to develop equanimity with boredom. Maybe sometimes it's sparkling and alive and other times it's not. And we want to actually develop a kind of equanimity when the kind of flow of stimulation, it feels deficient. And so rather than reach out for more stimuli, we reach down into our body, into our feet. Couple announcements. We're going to be a very interesting volunteer for just tomorrow and Friday to do breakfast pot washing. Write a note to the managers. May is offering sign up practice discussions this afternoon and so perhaps if you don't have a meeting today and want some practice support, please feel free to sign your name up. Galen eyes, sheets are. We'll test to do the second round of testing today at 715 in the evening and please just bring the test if you have one to down to the dining hall area and appreciate your understanding all of this is kind of compromise as we navigate COVID risk and so if we're all negative, maybe so, the protocol will change and we'll let you know about that. And yeah, just this extra day, just in the interest of caution, being conscious of people's travel and the capacity to detect something better today than yesterday. Practice discussions or start again this morning, 930, just five minutes or so. And I have some in the afternoon, Gil has some in the evening, so just check your time. Yeah, I wish you a rich day of practice. Thank you. So, yeah, May will be sitting in with me today, just the same protocol as yesterday so if you're that's your welcome to generous to invite her to stay and also totally fine if you need privacy to have a one on one conversation. Okay folks, let's keep going. Okay.
