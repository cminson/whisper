During the meditation, I was remembering this wonderful teaching from Suzuki Roshi, who is the founder of the San Francisco Zen Center. 
And he said to have taught at one point or during one talk, this teaching that each of you is perfect just the way you are. 
And you could use a little improvement. 
And I think there's something for me that this line so perfectly expresses, maybe we could say two sides of our practice or two aspects of practice. 
One aspect of practice, we might call training or cultivation. 
And that we're learning something, we're learning how to do something, cultivating qualities of mindfulness, of investigation, of stillness, of calm. 
And in a way, it's not maybe that different from learning to play a musical instrument, maybe learning to play a sport. 
It's certainly closer in to who we are and it's different in a lot of ways in that the cultivation of mindfulness touches all of us, all of who we are. 
But there's a certain training aspect of that that we can develop in mindfulness. 
And we might notice that when we first start sitting, it's really difficult to sort of string anything more than a couple of breaths together. 
You know, we'll breathe, feel. 
That's why I like to say in the guided meditation, just experience one breath. 
If I think, oh, I got to be with every breath for 30 minutes, it's impossible. 
And we're actually not with, we're never with every breath for 30 minutes. 
We're just with this, this breath, and then this breath, and then this breath. 
Every breath is just this breath. 
So to kind of cultivate that feeling that I'm just with this and this just unfolds. 
So when we first start practicing, I, you know, I certainly know this feeling of the mind is all over the place. 
And occasionally, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the breath or oh, yeah, you know, we kind of come back and then go off again for a while. 
And we might notice that over time, with just a little bit of consistency, it's like sort of creating these grooves in the mind or grooves in the heart. 
And we start to, yeah, it just, there's just almost the way a puppy sort of gets trained. 
When we have the intention to be with the breath, the mind tends to go there and sort of relaxes into it. 
And it's, we're not such struggling anymore. 
I'm amazed with this puppy that my family and I have that it's almost like she'll, she knows she can kind of read my mind. 
So if I just like make a little gesture or get up, you know, at the same time, we're having routine is you have a lot of routine, and she just leaps up and runs over to her crate and gets in. 
You know, it's like amazing where she just, you know, she knows that she can, she's, you know, she's being trained in a way so she can anticipate. 
So there's a, so the side of practice that's training, that's, that's very important, very valuable. 
And then this other side of practice, which maybe we could call expression, you know, expressing something. 
And I think that's what Suzuki Roshi is, is alluding to in this, this teaching that you're perfect just the way you are. 
You know, it doesn't mean you, we have nothing to learn and nowhere to go to grow and develop, but it, it's touching into the completeness of this moment. 
And it's a kind of express that in a way that we don't know, you know, this is not a self improvement project. 
It's not like you get to every breath in a sitting and then we unlock the next level of the game. 
So, so it's, anyway, I just offer that as a, as a, to check in with yourself to see where do I tend to, maybe where now do I tend to, what side do I tend to fall on? Do I approach practice in a way like I've got to get something, I've got to fix my breath, got to get more concentrated. 
The grass is greener. 
They've got it and I don't, you know, or the reverse I've got it and they don't. 
And if that is our, our disposition, maybe it's helpful to bring in a little of this sense that nothing is missing right now. 
Or even if we, if we can't believe that, maybe just asking this question, what if nothing is missing right now? What if this is it? What if the Dharma is perfectly revealing itself in this moment of irritation, this moment of sadness, this moment of feeling how the foot has fallen asleep? What if this is a perfect expression of the Dharma? And then of course, you know, the other side, if we fall on the side of, I'm already a Buddha, what is there to do? I'm just going to sit here and wait for something. 
Lightning to strike. 
If I just sit like this long enough. 
I think it was Ajahn Chah who said something like, if sitting, if sitting, if sitting, if just sitting made us enlightened, then all the chickens would be, you know, would be awakened. 
We need to do something also. 
We need to make effort. 
We need to engage. 
We need to become aware of our patterning, our conditioning, of all the ways that we kind of get lost and get stuck and get diluted, you know, and to bring in some awareness and sit up a little straighter and bring in some intention and breathe. 
And, you know, and keep coming back. 
You know, it's like again and again, we get lost and we come back. 
We get lost and we come back. 
So these two sides of practice, cultivation or training and then expression. 
And hopefully, or maybe hopefully, there's a way that these come together, that these come together in us. 
There's doing and then there's non-doing. 
And one of the ways I think about the path of mindfulness or the path of vipassana is that it's a doing that at some point begins to undo itself. 
The word vipassana is translated as to see clearly. 
And so this is a path of seeing more and more clearly, getting closer, getting more connected. 
And the more we see, the closer we are, it's sort of like the less and less we need to do or the less and less there's a separate me who has something to do. 
In a way, we could say it's a path of intimacy, becoming more and more close, more and more intimate with our experience, with what's happening. 
And so if we start from the side of doing, as long as there's mindfulness, as long as there's awareness, then I have a lot of trust that that doing will balance itself with non-doing. 
So I wanted to share a line from Zen teaching and talk about it a little bit. 
And it has to do with this idea of practice as getting closer, practice as getting more intimate. 
And this is a line from a text called Genjokoan. 
And Genjokoan is, I think, considered the summation of Zen practice from a certain style of Zen practice called sotozen. 
And the founder of sotozen was Dogen. 
And Dogen has, I think it's like 93 teaching essays. 
And Genjokoan is the first one. 
And it's sort of said to summarize or express the practice from the Zen point of view. 
And the word Genjokoan is a teaching itself. 
It basically, it's sometimes translated as the koan of this moment, the question of this moment. 
So it's like, how, how, how am I, how can I meet this arising present moment? So it's so it's been translated as the question of this moment, the koan of the present becoming the present. 
I think Gil has translated it as the issue at hand. 
What is the issue at hand? And what is this? And this is a question. 
This is, maybe we could say this is the heart of practice. 
What is this again and again? What is this? And so there's a lot of teachings packed into the Genjokoan. 
But this one line was sort of speaking to me. 
So when you practice intimately and return to where you are, it will be clear that nothing at all has unchanging self. 
When you practice intimately and return to where you are, it will be clear that nothing at all has unchanging self. 
We might not automatically associate the word intimacy with meditation practice. 
You know, often the word intimacy, you know, certainly as we, as we use it in the West may refer to the closeness between people. 
And I find it, I find it intriguing and inspiring that in the in the Buddhist tradition, intimacy is sometimes used as another word as a synonym for awakening or for enlightenment. 
So to be intimate with all things, to attain intimacy. 
And for me, it brings something that might sound very abstract. 
You know, what is enlightenment? What, you know, what does that even mean? I don't know. 
But I kind of get, I think I kind of know, get a feeling for what it might mean to be intimate, to be so close. 
And so it implies a knowing, implies a closeness. 
And to me, it kind of implies a oneness, that it's not the intimacy of awakening perhaps, or the intimacy of our practice is not so much that there are separate selves and separate things that become one. 
But it's more like a recognition of this original oneness, the already one. 
It's like, oh, so there's a kind of recognition in that. 
And if we understand the path of practice as a path of becoming more and more intimate with ourselves, and with others, and with the world, and its whole range of experience, of range of feeling, if we understand practice as this journey of intimacy, then it also helps us to see where we separate, where we have barriers. 
What are the barriers to connection? Where do I want to divide, and separate, and not feel? Just aware of the time. 
So this idea of the path of practice is very much to look at our defenses, our resistance, our clinging, and anything that might block this intimacy. 
I think this is the first sort of public talk I've given in a while, and I want to just acknowledge everything that's going on in the world from the pandemic, and the protests and increasing awareness of racism, black lives matter. 
And just this morning, I was, anyway, I won't go through the whole news, but you know, this is happening, this is in our world, it's happening. 
And how do we relate to this? And I guess the question for me is, what can our practice offer? What can our practice offer ourselves, and what can our practice offer the world? And what I would say is that if we hold this idea of intimacy, of staying with all of the feelings, and with all of the difficulty that we really want to turn away from, we really don't want to watch, we really don't want to see, we don't want to talk about, it's uncomfortable. 
There's some things, watch the news on the computer, it's like, I don't know if I want to watch this right now, or read this right now. 
And sometimes that's wise. 
So it's not saying we just need to flood ourselves with every sorrow and every problem in the world. 
But just to notice, and just to hold this idea that there's a tremendous value in getting closer, in staying, in being willing to stay with what's difficult. 
And so what I would say that our practice has to offer, the first, maybe just a couple of points, the first is that it's an invitation to look at ourselves and to become intimate with ourselves. 
I think maybe it's human nature that we tend to want to look out there. 
We look out there for the source of our problems, and we look out there for our happiness. 
We think it's got to be, you know, even if we're, even if we're meditators, there's got to be some secret teaching that I haven't heard, right? Or there's got to be some great master who can just zap me. 
And, you know, right? So it's out there. 
And I think the, so the first invitation to intimacy in practice is to intimacy with ourselves, to meet ourselves, to know ourselves. 
And so in Genjokoan, maybe the most famous line of Genjokoan says something like, to study Buddhism is to study ourselves. 
To study Buddhism, to study the Buddha way is to study ourselves. 
There is no Buddhism outside of ourselves. 
What this practice is, what Dharma practice is, is again and again being willing to look at ourselves, to get close. 
The great Zen teacher and scholar, Shohaku Okamura, he writes about this word to study. 
And he says, this is not intellectual study. 
This is one of the meanings of this study, to study is to become familiar, to become accustomed to, and to become intimate with. 
So to become intimate with the Buddha way is to become intimate with ourselves. 
And there's this very beautiful way that he describes that the character for this study or this intimacy is the character for self beneath the wings of a bird. 
And this idea that we study ourselves, we learn ourselves the way a baby bird learns to fly, looking at its mother. 
And a bird is of course born with the capacity, the potential to fly. 
But it's something that has to be cultivated, it has to be learned, it has to be studied, to try and fail. 
And try again and fail, and try again and fail, watching the mother, watching the siblings. 
And then at some point it's like, yeah, I got it. 
So it's that closeness, that intimacy. 
And so the way, so maybe the way a bird learns to fly, learns to express its full potential, its full capacity for ourselves through our practice. 
We're learning to be a person. 
We're learning to be a full human being. 
We're studying the self, we're practicing the self, we're becoming intimate with the self. 
And so more and more we're becoming who we are. 
So that's the first kind of intimacy. 
And then the second kind of intimacy I think is pointed to in this next line where, so it's to study the Buddha way, is to study the self. 
And then to study the self is to forget the self. 
To study the self, to so thoroughly study ourselves, know ourselves, become intimate with ourselves. 
That something about that self can be transcended, something about that self can be gone beyond. 
So one of the ways that I understand this for myself in my practice is like, the way to big mind is through small mind. 
The way to our true self or our freedom is through really getting to know this personal self, this psychological self. 
So we get to know, we study ourselves, we study, we get to see where do I cling, where do I resist, where do I overreact. 
And we meet all of our humaneness with a lot of care, a lot of compassion. 
And little by little we're expanding our sense of who we actually are. 
And then so this idea of to study the self is to forget the self and then it says to forget the self is to be verified by all things, to be actualized by all things. 
So this is like our big self, our big mind, our freedom. 
And I imagine it a little bit like the feeling I have is drawing a circle of love around everything that can possibly be experienced. 
It's all us, it's all inside us, it's all included. 
There's nothing that's a stranger, there's nothing that's foreign, everything is included. 
And then in that way our thinking is not a problem. 
Our feelings are not a problem. 
They're not something to be gotten rid of so I can get to something called peace or Buddha. 
It's like those waves are seen or known as the water. 
Those waves are expressions of the Dharma. 
So Suzuki Roshi says, waves are the practice of the water. 
Waves are the practice of the water. 
To speak of waves apart from water or water apart from waves is a delusion. 
How wonderful is that? The water and waves are one. 
And it would be a shame if we spent our whole life trying to get rid of those waves because we have this idea that water should only be one way, perfectly still, that's really water. 
So he says, water and waves are one. 
Big mind and small mind are one. 
Whatever you experience is an expression of big mind, so it's an expression of Dharma. 
And I think of this as a radical intimacy. 
And so to practice intimately and return to where we are, we see that there is nothing at all that has unchanging self. 
I think when we're not intimate, when we're separate, when we're confused, we're very much living in the world of concepts and the world of our ideas and opinions and preferences and discrimination. 
And there can be a very fixed sense of self and other. 
But when we're close enough, that maybe even closer than our concepts, closer than our thinking, we can sense into this flowing Dharma, this impermanence, this interconnectedness, this mutuality. 
I am not separate from you, but I am because you are. 
I am because we are. 
And the doorway to this is our mindfulness practice. 
Our way to this is being awake, being alert, to being available to connect. 
I just want to finish with one little story, if I may. 
I apologize, I'm a little bit over the time. 
One of the, when I was doing a lot of Zen practice, one of my favorite parts of, so at the Berkeley Zen Center, there was a morning sitting, so it was at 5. 
40 in the morning, in the weekdays. 
It's early, but one of my favorite parts of the morning was at the end of the meditation. 
The Abbot, the teacher, would go to the doorway and would stand in the doorway. 
And as each student walked silently out of the Zendal, the meditation hall, we would turn and face the teacher and bow to the teacher. 
And the teacher would bow to us. 
And it was like this moment, this amazing moment of being seen. 
Because Mao, the teacher, you know, he wasn't just kind of going through the moments and, okay, okay, bow and bow and bow. 
You know, it was like to really look at each person and connect, just like this is a split second of connection, of to meet each other, for eyes to meet each other, and then to bow together in this kind of harmony. 
And it was a moment of intimacy. 
And for me, it was worth, you know, I could sit in my room at home, I could sit later in the day. 
But it was worth getting up at 5 in the morning, getting in the car, driving over the bridge, you know. 
There was something in that, that moment of connection. 
And so I offer that as something that is, I think, available to each of us more than we realize that what is it to make ourselves available for intimacy, to hold someone's gaze, you know, just a little bit longer, to look, to connect. 
Something is expressed in that, you know, we're not doing it. 
We don't meet each other in this way because we're, you know, because it's good for our practice, whatever that means. 
You know, this is an expression of our practice. 
This is an expression of who we are in that moment, that moment of meeting, that moment of, and so this is just, what is it to go through our day, to live our life in a way that we're bowing, we're bowing to everything, bowing to everything. 
So I'd just like to finish with the rest of this poem, this passage from Genjo Kohan. 
To study the Buddha way is to study the self. 
To study the self is to forget the self. 
To forget the self is to be verified by all things. 
To be verified by all things is to let the body and mind of self and the body and mind of others to drop away. 
There is a trace of realization that cannot be grasped. 
We endlessly express this ungraspable trace of realization. 
Thank you very much. 
I look forward to endlessly expressing ourselves together. 
Thank you. 
I have a few, thank you for your attention and your presence. 
I have a few announcements. 
One is that next Sunday, Matthew Brensilver will be giving the Sunday talk, and it will be the same format that you can stream it on YouTube. 
You can be on Zoom. 
The link will be in the calendar. 
And there was another announcement. 
I think it was that if you're on YouTube right now, Yan Li will post the link. 
You're welcome to come over to Zoom and then we'll have our practice discussion led by Tanya. 
Thank you, everyone. 
Thank you, Tanya.
