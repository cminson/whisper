The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
I didn't want to just sit up here and give you a dry lecture. I'd like this to be interactive.
I see some friends in the audience who have been studying this a lot longer than I have,
so if I veer off course, I invite you to correct me or give your opinions or your corrections.
So feel free at any point to ask a question.
I'll ask you some questions. I won't call on people individually, but I'll give you some questions to chew on.
For anything more than just a simple, very simple question, let's see if we could use the microphones.
Over the years, I've pretty much attended all of the Sati events, either live or virtually.
The recordings here are really fabulous to study, and I'll be referring today to some of the particular daylongs
that have been taught here in the last ten years that are, I think, very relevant for Suta study.
And really the theme of today, as it says up on the screen, and really I think the mission of the Sati Center
is to combine serious study with practice, not just so that we're academic intellectuals looking at this material,
but we're actually delving into it and maybe enjoying it on an intellectual level,
but then integrating it into our meditation practice and using what we learn in very practical, useful ways.
So we'll have a period of discussion with also some meditation periods.
You can use those however you want, if you want to.
I encourage you to get up and move around, but if you want to do walking meditation,
if you want to just use the bathroom and sip a cup of tea, whatever you like or sitting meditation,
there'll be about half hour periods and about an hour, 15 minute discussion sessions alternated with a lunch break in the middle of the day.
And I don't think we have to be in strict silence during the meditation periods,
but if you want to talk, maybe we could have some places where people who want to just kind of go within
and digest the material, places where they could be in silence like this room.
And I guess it's a little hard in the kitchen because the kitchen kind of lends itself to talking and discussing,
but maybe just outside here on this front area could be in silence as well, so this room and that.
So if you want to do some walking meditation or get a breath of fresh air,
and then the rest of the parking lot and the places on the street if you want to.
And I think that'll just give everyone some options on what they want to do during their periods.
So today I'd like to invite you on a journey back in time to the thought world of the Buddha.
We're really going to use the sutras as a way to get back to who the Buddha was,
what was the milieu that he came out of, what kind of transformation,
and try and get a beat on what kind of transformation he had in his life,
and then went on to teach, and then how that evolved over his 45 years of teaching
and became what we call the dharma.
And then that was after his death, has been transmitted down now 2,500 years to our current time.
This is like any journey to a foreign land. We'll encounter some interesting characters
and we'll need a certain amount of preparation for this.
We'll also be speaking a foreign language, and I don't just mean Pali.
I mean definitely we'll look at some Pali words and everything I'm going to talk about here,
everything in the book is in translation in English,
and we're very fortunate to be English speakers to have so much of the sutras translated now
into very good quality translations in English.
But the foreign language I'm talking about is just this thought world of the Buddha.
We're familiar with a lot of it, like the Four Noble Truths and the Dharma,
the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, these kind of terms,
but it's really helpful to be clear on what they are.
And then I'll be also writing some Pali terms up on the board.
I like to use different visual aids just to aid the learning process.
We'll talk more about what Pali is, and I'll try and remember all the diacritics,
which are additional markings that are made on the Pali terms.
Not all Pali words have it, but it's a phonetic language in the way it was first transcribed.
So those are just some general comments of how the day would go.
And then kind of the material we'll cover, as I mentioned,
will be just some background of sutra study and Pali and the history,
and then looking at the historical background of the Buddha,
because that's very relevant to what he developed and how he presented the material,
then his life and his awakening and death eventually,
and the rise of the Dharma, his teachings, and then the Sangha,
the community of monks and nuns and laymen and laywomen who were very much influenced at that time
and have been the custodians of the Dharma that have brought it to us.
So I thought we would start with, oh, and we'll end the day with the metasuta.
Gil has a very beautiful translation of it, and hopefully if we have time,
I will play a four-minute audio clip of the metasuta being chanted by Dhamma Ruan.
I don't know any of you know him.
I'll tell you a little bit more about him, but it's really beautiful chanting of this,
so it kind of will help us see how this all was transmitted to us through chanting over these many years.
So let's start with the question on why are you here.
The bigger question is why study the sutras, why is this of relevance and what brings you here today.
Anyone have some general comments on why they're interested in the sutras?
Because I'm still suffering.
The comment was because I'm still suffering.
Any of you too?
Yes.
I'm here because I get, I need more foundation for what I'm doing, and it gets a little confusing
if I hear people say, I'm not, I don't consider myself to be a student,
but it's a common thing that I hear that people stop believing in me,
and, you know, that it's kind of a client or, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
So I just want to get a better foundation for myself for what I'm doing and not feel like I have to apologize
if I'm with family members who are of another persuasion and very devoted, and it works for them,
but it doesn't work for me, and so I just need a better foundation for why I'm doing this with some facts,
and maybe you'll cover this later, but I wonder, all of these teachings,
are there hidden things like, has been found in the Bible where there are hidden books and translations
and, you know, political stuff, and I wonder about that a lot.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah, remind me of that question.
It's a really good one, and I have some thoughts on it, but no definitive answer.
Yes?
I'm here because I'm somehow drawn or feel this,
and I've called it Buddha Elixir without reading anything about Buddha or knowing,
and I don't know why I call it or I've collected some Buddha statues and just go, oh,
and now I finally realize the center was here, and I thought this would be good to find out why I'm just so,
and I'll listen to chance and not have a clue of what they're saying,
and I'm also, for whatever odd reason, not being a traveler, feel we're all drawn to go to Cambodia,
so that's why I'm here.
I'm looking forward to it.
Thank you.
Anyone else, any other comments?
I'm here to try and find the chinks in the armor of Buddhism to disprove the theories of the Dharma.
I think, at times, I've had that kind of approach that just can't make sense,
or just kind of a defiance, maybe, or a criticism of it.
I'll talk a little bit more about that attitude.
I wrote down a few things that, and thank you all for elaborating on more.
Primarily, why I study the suttas is to really help my meditation practice.
I like intellectual things, and maybe that's something I get attached to,
but I really see the suttas, if I can discern when I'm getting caught up in my head,
and really take in the teachings, and we'll talk about that in a minute on how to do that,
I find that in my meditation practice really is aided.
There's a lot of really pithy phrases, some aphorisms, some analogies, some stories
that give really concrete examples on how to deal with certain situations,
like if somebody's attacking you verbally, or if you're tempted to be unfaithful to your spouse,
or just a lot of different stories in the suttas that I find,
even though they're really steeped in kind of a language in this thought world of ancient India,
which we'll go into in a minute, and there's a lot of agrarian references.
There's also a lot of stuff that's very relevant, so practical advice.
It's fascinating, I think, where all of this began, and how it's evolved in the different lineages that we have.
At IMC and Sati Center, we're just kind of one evolved lineage.
We've been influenced by many, and we're lucky that our founder, Gill,
has a real strong Zen background and a really strong Vipassana background.
We get kind of the benefits of both worlds, but I find the history fascinating.
I think that essential for practice is a certain amount of faith.
Just coming here today, you had a certain amount of faith that you all have a lot of valuable things you could be doing today.
We have some faith that there's something here that might be of use in our lives.
I find that reading this material really provides inspiration and helps to build faith.
There's more I'm sure you could come up with, but I'd like to also maybe give...
I don't want to say why not to study the suttas. I think that would be pretty bold of me, but some caveats.
One was given by the Buddha himself in Majamindakaya, the middle length discourses in Sutta No. 22.
We'll talk a little bit about what all that jargon means, but called the simile of the snake.
He talked about learning the Dharma and talking about the Dharma similar to grabbing a snake.
If you grab the snake in the middle, in other words, if you grab it wrong, the snake's going to reach around and bite you.
But if you grab it behind the head, apparently I've never grabbed a snake,
and maybe this was something they needed to do in ancient India, but I've never grabbed a snake.
If you grab it behind the head, you can then manage it, it won't bite you, and you can do whatever you want with the snake.
So he used that analogy to tell his disciples not to grab the Dharma wrong,
and specifically what he says is to impress others and to win arguments.
I've certainly fallen into that trap to feel like, oh, I've got this little nugget about the Dharma.
For example, some of my chums on the sati board, one man in particular,
I don't think we intend to do this, but we find ourselves debating about all of this,
and then as soon as we fall into that, it's like, oh, wait a minute, this is not an intellectual argument
that we're not here to win or impress others.
Also, another caveat I wanted to give about sutta study is sometimes when I'm reading things or learning about them,
I can get triggered, it can bring up stuff from the past,
or I think a lot of us here have relationships with maybe the religions or the faiths
or the traditions that we were raised in, and some of the language, depending on who does the translation,
the language can be very biblical sounding, or it can sound, you know,
especially some of the suttas are written for, I say most of the suttas were written for monks.
There were mixed audiences, and there were men and women, so there were lay people in monastics,
but at times they're pretty stark, pretty stern, a lot of discussion about avoiding sensual pleasure,
becoming addicted to sensual pleasure, and really striving diligently to practice.
This kind of language, I think, can be inflammatory to some of us
and feel like it's being very judgmental or stern.
It's not to criticize that or say that there's a problem with that,
it's just maybe as we go through it and as you study the suttas to see how things come up for you
or if you're reading a passage and you're finding maybe you're reading something about devas
or about two feet to heaven, there's different aspects that you'll find in the suttas
that you might find just fantastical or kind of whimsical or just improbable, whatever that is.
Just see if you can approach it with somewhat of an open mind and say,
this is what this book says, I don't understand rebirth, I can get it grasped conceptually,
but I've never had a rebirth experience that I can remember, so I just hold that lightly
and say, okay, this is something that comes up again and again and again in the suttas.
It's probably important, it's possibly real, but I can't confirm that,
or at least I haven't yet confirmed that through my meditative practice,
so I'm just going to kind of hold that now, those teachings on that as a possibility.
Any comments or questions so far?
Let's go on with another slide here.
And kind of a blueprint for doing this or any type of dharma practice is found in the suttas themselves.
This is D. N. means dig in the kaya, those are the long discourses, sutta number 33,
and that's the name in Pali, sanghiti sutta, and this is a sutta that has a lot of lists of different things
and one of the lists is different types of wisdom, the term for wisdom is panya,
and I think some of you know that term, and these three different ways,
and it's kind of, I look at it as sort of a hierarchy of what we can do in our practice,
and there's sutta maya, so this sutta is not the sutta that we are studying today,
that's what tuti sutta, but this is the word to hear, which is how it was initially done,
and maya is made, so this is basically wisdom gained by hearing,
and I added reading because a lot of us now these days, we listen to dharma talks,
but we also read dharma books, and I brought kind of my top ten here to use also as visual aids
when we go through the Pali canon to how big these things are,
but also if you want during the meditation period to come up,
and I'll make some recommendations for further reading after today.
So sutta maya panya, so wisdom gained by hearing or reading, so that's what we're doing here,
we're talking and we're reading and we're kind of getting the foundations of what the dharma is.
I'll use these two terms interchangeably, dharma and dharma.
In the book I decided to go with dharma, that's the most common that we hear in our culture,
and that's the Sanskrit version of the term, and dharma is the Pali version of the term,
so that's not a typo, it's just how it is on the slide.
Then there's chinta maya panya, and chinta is mind, so this is really,
I look at it as the wisdom, the panya that we get from thinking about,
digesting, reflecting on what we've read or heard, that's the next step.
And then there's bhavana maya panya, so bhavana is one of the terms used for meditation.
It technically means cultivation, development, so I look at it as more of an experiential wisdom
that we can get both on the cushion and off, but it's more of an intuitive, more of an insight that comes up.
So this is kind of a blueprint for how we can work with this material and use it skillfully,
and just to kind of review, I think hear the material or read it with an open mind, contemplate it,
maybe take some time to digest it. It helps if we can do that with others, we can discuss it with our friends.
We have this term kalyanamita, spiritual friends, people on the pathway who are also doing this,
and many of our sutta study day-longs here at the Sati Center, we do that.
It's helpful to reread passages or read different translations.
One of the big translators in English of modern versions,
the first English translations came out in the 1800s, late 1800s, early 1900s.
It tells you how long ago that was, and some of that language was done by,
I think they were Anglican government officials in India, British Anglican,
and a lot of the language sounds very biblical, and they use the term vau and this kind of stuff.
But we have a lot of modern translations, and Bhikkhu Bodhi's been quite a prolific translator.
He's translated a good portion of the suttas, and also Ajahn Jeff, who's one of the teachers who presents every year here,
and he's a supporter of the Sati Center, and quite a scholar,
and also a person who, I think skillfully, combines the teachings with practical wisdom on how to meditate
and how to take it to the next level.
And then after reflecting on the material, then to just kind of sit with it and meditate,
and not, at that point, maybe we can drop away the intellectual and the words,
and get into just what's going on in our bodies and our minds.
It's really the insight, meditation, vipassana practice that we do without really having an agenda.
Just see what happens, how it evolves over time, and what comes up naturally.
So, any questions on that or comments?
It's all pretty basic stuff so far.
Now, what is a sutta?
That's the Pali term, sutta.
In Sanskrit, we'll have sutra.
So you might hear that term.
I should just get rid of this pen.
Sutra.
And in the book, and today, I'll use sutra, mainly.
And this, it's not really clear when it started to be applied to discourse.
We kind of translate that word into discourse or teaching.
But initially, it meant to hold things together to bind them.
It's the same root as the English term we have, sutra.
Sutra is something I do in my day job.
At some point, it came to mean discourse or scriptures.
It's really a word from Pali.
And Pali, going to this a little bit, is a language.
It's part of the Indo-Aryan languages.
And Sanskrit is kind of the one that most of us know about that.
And we don't think that the Buddha spoke Pali, actually.
This is the language that the teachings have been passed down in the Theravada lineage.
And actually, we think, anyways, there's a complete version of what the Buddha taught in the Pali canon.
And it's the only canon.
There's another canon, the Chinese canon, and many canons that were lost over history.
But it's the only surviving canon, the only surviving collection of works.
And we'll go over in some nitty gritty detail on what it is to this day that we have.
But we think that maybe the Buddha spoke Magadhi or several related dialects.
These were similar to Pali, but there's some differences.
We're not a linguist.
We did have a linguist here a month ago, the Satya Center, Sean Kerr.
And he gave a Dailong on Pali.
And what is Pali?
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
And I was here for that.
It was fantastic.
It's recorded.
He has a great handout, and all of those are available on the website.
So if you're interested in digging deeper, there's his Dailong.
Another Dailong on Pali, kind of from some scholars, a different approach two years prior to that.
So we have a lot of materials on that if you're interested in going further.
And for our purposes today, I'll just throw out a few Pali terms as we go along.
But I won't.
This is not a class on Pali, and I don't speak very much of it.
So it's a dead language, kind of like Greek and Latin.
It's used still liturgically.
There's monks and nuns and scholars who know Pali, and they speak it to each other, and there's writing in it.
But it's pretty much a language of the scholarship of the Pali canon.
And Pali was, you know, this is a preliterate time.
The Buddha didn't write.
None of this was written down.
There was spoken verbally, and at some point the Pali language was transcribed into different characters for writing.
I have some examples of that.
It was, you know, phonetically transcribed.
And, you know, a great source of information on the history of early Buddhism comes from King Ashoka,
was a king that had conquered much of the Indian subcontinent about 200 years after the Buddha's death.
The Buddha was probably born.
The latest figures are about 480.
We use the term BCE, you know, not to be Christian.
Instead of saying before Christ, we say before the common era, and we use CE, common era, for what would be AD.
So about King Ashoka lived about 200, I don't know the exact dates, 250 BCE.
And he left a lot of stuff written in stone.
He erected these huge pillars all over India and then wrote on them lots of things, you know,
like how he was a wonderful ruler and, you know, all the wonderful things he was doing for his people
and, you know, laws and, you know, things like that.
And actually some sutas are actually written on these.
And this is an example of, this is probably not Pali, it's probably Magadhi, you know, just historically, in Brahmi script.
So this is one particular script that exists.
And so people have learned this and they've deciphered these and we've, you know, found hundreds of these all over India.
And, you know, there's people who spend their whole lives just studying what's written on these things.
It's pretty fascinating.
And the story of King Ashoka is fascinating too.
If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't be here today, you know, in this configuration, you know, studying this.
Because probably his efforts to disseminate the Dharma, but specifically through this and through missionary work,
to sending people to Mesopotamia, to Sri Lanka, to Central Asia, to other places, possibly Southeast Asia at that time,
allowed it to really blossom and grow in those areas.
And then at some point we'll get to this at the end of the day.
Buddhism was snuffed out or became extinct, I think is a less stilted word, in India.
And now there's a revival of Buddhism there.
And there's, you know, it's coming in from different doorways, but it was very vibrant for about 1,500 years in the subcontinent of India.
A lot of evolution that happened there.
And then it became extinct in its homeland.
So that's Varami's script.
Here is Singhalese script.
Or so I'm told, I don't know, but I have some experts here in the audience who are nodding their head.
And this is an Ola leaf.
So an Ola, I think it's, is it a palm leaf or is it some, yeah.
We'll get to this in a minute on how things were transcribed.
But this is Pali in Singhalese script.
And then here's what we have in Roman script.
This is how, you know, if you wanted to read the sutras in the original language in Pali, you could learn this.
And then, and, you know, this is all available written out now.
So this is from the phonetic sounds of the words that was written down in Roman script.
We'll come back to this quote here in a minute.
One other thing I wanted to say about the Pali Canon is it.
In addition to being a complete, well, we think a complete body of teachings of what the Buddha taught.
It is a living tradition.
That is, it was transmitted through the Theravada school through the centuries.
And these were, you know, monks and nuns and lay people like ourselves who would go on and, you know,
they would learn the teachings, they would memorize them, they would transmit them to the next generation.
But they'd also practice them.
So it's, you know, I think that's one thing that's important to say about it.
As opposed to, you know, now what's happening is we have some texts that are being found in the central Asia
that, you know, are preserved from, you know, a thousand years ago or so.
And they were just kind of found.
And there's no real surviving tradition of the different schools that Buddhism evolved into after the death of the Buddha.
Many of those schools have become extinct.
Actually, all of the initial, it was supposedly, what is it, 18 schools within a couple hundred years after the time of the Buddha.
And supposedly the Theravada school is the only one that survived.
Now Mahayana is kind of a separate thing that's very much evolved after that period from these different schools.
And that's become, you know, a very big lineage.
It includes both, you know, different types of Mahayana.
Buddhism includes Zen and Tibetan is a type of Mahayana.
It's Vajrayana, the Pure Land schools, Chan, which is similar to Zen.
All of those are Mahayana schools.
And probably in terms of modern times, the number of people practicing in these different schools,
you know, probably the majority are in the Mahayana.
There's a lot of Chinese and Japanese and other parts of the world who practice different forms of Mahayana.
Theravada is probably a minority and of course there's a growing number of Tibetan Buddhists in this world.
So this brings me to a point of this question of what is this word we have?
Buddha Vachana, the word of the Buddha.
Sorry about that squeaking, you know, that can be annoying.
Buddha Vachana, the word of the Buddha.
And how do we know what the Buddha said?
I mean, you know, we've been to so many Dharma talks and I'm already probably a couple of times a day.
Buddha said, but how do we really know what is the word of the Buddha?
You know, what is something that I made up?
Or, you know, I was trained by Gil and, you know, all the different teachers in the insight meditation community.
So how do we know if it's something that, you know, I made up or Gil made up or maybe Jack Cornfield or, you know, Ajahn Chah.
Or, you know, you can go back all this way.
So I don't have the answer for you. I mean, that's maybe a rhetorical question.
And we'll talk about some...
Well, actually, why don't we have a little discourse about that?
How could we... I told you a little bit about, you know, we have these suttas we can read now in English.
We have some knowledge of history that, unfortunately, ancient Indian civilization
was not really interested in accurate historical records.
And some of the dating that's been done is actually from the civilization that existed at that same time, the Greek Empire.
And there's been some triangulation-based, because they were very interested in keeping accurate historical dates.
So we don't have any... The Buddha never wrote anything. His immediate disciples never wrote anything.
We've got this mass of teachings now. How can we be certain?
Yeah, let's do the mic for that.
As far as I know, we can't be sure, because the suttas, the polycanon, wasn't written down until, like, 400 years after the Buddha's death, roughly.
And that's quite a long time. A lot of things can happen during that time.
And I think scholars have figured out that some parts of the polycanon are indeed older than other parts.
And so other parts are maybe added later and may not reflect what the Buddha actually taught.
Or maybe a few things are borrowed from Hinduism.
But we study the polycanon anyway, because most of it seems very consistent within itself.
And it just works so well, so brilliant, and so effective in reducing suffering.
Thank you. Yeah, that's great.
I like the idea that we don't know, that we are within a space of inquiry.
And so that seems like that models the essence of it for me.
Wonderful.
And also, it seems that something that the Buddha teaches is that this is all open to investigation.
And that you can find out for yourself if what these teachings are true or not.
Yes, thank you.
Those are good comments. So basically what happened is the Buddha...
This is what we think happened anyways, right? We'll never maybe know for sure, because there were no digital recorders.
The Buddha gave these teachings, and then his followers remembered them after he died.
And there's some in the suttas, there's some image of some repetition and awareness of needing to carry the teachings on while the Buddha was still alive.
And we'll talk a little bit about that.
After he died, within I think it was six months, there was what's called the first council, which was a gathering of awakened ones, Arahant,
some say 500, who got together to really say, okay, is this what he said?
And everyone had to be like a consensus on this is what the Buddha said on these teachings.
And then in that kind of the key figure was Ananda, the Buddha's cousin and really his right hand man.
He was kind of his broker, I guess might be a way, or his agent, but also he supposedly had an amazing memory and was able to recall everything the Buddha ever said.
In one sutta passage it says 84,000 different teachings.
I don't know, that might be a little hyperbole there.
So he would recite these suttas and then the collection would say, oh yeah, that's right.
I assume they would correct him if he was wrong and then everyone would agree on it.
And then Uppalli, another man recited the Vinaya, and we'll talk a little bit about that, but that's like the discipline, the code, the monastic code, and the stories around that.
So these two parts were kind of established at that point.
And then there were teams of monastics, monks and nuns who spent their whole time doing a type of practice.
It wasn't probably intellectual, it was their practice to chant and recite these, not all of them, but a certain portion of them.
Although apparently there's still people alive today that can recite the whole Pallikan and his memories, they haven't been like brainwashed by TV and iPhones and all that stuff.
So that their memories are really amazing and they have contests in Burma and Sri Lanka where they test these and recite these people.
But apparently there's this whole lineage, and this goes back to the Vedas, really, of people being able to carry on a lineage orally from generation to generation.
And then, as Bill said, about 400 years after the Buddha's death, these groups of reciters, this was in Sri Lanka at the time.
There was some threat to the community, maybe famine, maybe war, where there was a risk of, you know, if a certain number of monks were to die out,
they would no longer have those teachings. So there was writing at that time and they wrote it down at that time in Pali.
That's the language they were using at the time.
So at some point it probably shifted from the Buddha's initial lang-tang of Magadhi or some dialect to Pali, and then it was written down in Pali.
And then we saw that Ola leaf, it was transcribed out on these leaves.
And these leaves last for, I don't know, maybe 50 years. I mean it's a tropical climate, so they do decay.
And then so at some point somebody's got to write that out on another leaf, you know, and that's been done for generations.
And now we have it in digital form, and there's all different, you know, in the different Pali was, has been transcribed in singles,
these Burmese, Cambodian, Thai, Laotian, Roman script, Devanagari, those are the main ones. There's possibly more.
And now it's done digitally, but at some point someone had to write all this out, you know, copy it, you know, from one generation to next.
And then we have, you know, going from the Pali, this is Ajahn Jeff's translation.
I used, for copyright reasons, I used his translation in the book and in the stuff I'll be showing today.
So someone took the Pali, Ajahn Jeff in this case, and translated it into English, and that's how we have it, the form we have it today.
So a lot of steps in that process, a lot of room for error.
And I have a slide in a minute that we'll look at that shows, you know, what I think are all of the different steps.
What was translated in English?
Oh, the first translations from English were done in about the 1880s to the early 1900s.
And then there's been ongoing translations, but the kind of the modern set of translations we have, Wisdom Press has done,
and well, I'll give more meanings, this has done a multiple of the Nakayas into English, and these are Bhikkhu Bodhis, Ajahn Jeff, also known as Tennisero Bhikkhu,
has done many translations as well, and he makes his available for free.
We have the book's Handful of Leaves here.
You can also, on the website, Access to Insight, this is all in the index, the resources of the book, Access to Insight you can get.
So the question is why was this just translated on the 150th?
Well, because the people who spoke English didn't really encounter the Dharma until about that time. It was really the British colonization of India and Sri Lanka and all of Southeast Asia,
where these basically civil servants and attorneys in the British government came across the Dharma, and they were interested in it, they knew that these were living traditions,
so people practiced that, and they initially, when they encountered them, thought this is some weird pagan religion and it's not worth our while studying,
we're Christians, and at some point people started looking at it and translating, and they learned Pali, they learned the Singhalese version of Pali and studied it,
and especially the attorneys and the civil servants were interested in it because it was legalistic, or it seemed to be logical, maybe for some of the same reasons that were attracted to the Dharma,
and then they at some point started translating it from Pali into English, and then it's taken off since there.
But there wasn't a lot of contact between the two civilizations, and at least on the level of sharing the Dharma.
It had spread throughout Asia, and you could get teachings and a certain amount of the sutras available in Tibetan or Chinese or Japanese, but English was very recent.
Okay, thank you. Stephen, are you interested in Pali? Do you have different traditions? Do you have private traditions that you always see?
No, in Sri Lanka, we actually have some Sri Lankans here, and I don't know if you want to make a comment, but it's being translated into vernacular Singhalese as well.
I think there's been a more effort and maybe some economic pressures to get more translations in English.
I don't know how much of the Pali Canon is available in Singhalese.
Well, yeah, the Canon in Pali, but isn't it translated also to vernacular Singhalese?
Okay, and that's all available. Well, that makes sense. So probably more translations than in English.
That's a little confusing, because just like this, there's Pali, and then there's English. They have Singhalese characters on that Ola leaf.
This is Pali, and then it's also translated into commonly spoken Singhalese, and I don't know if people who read Singhalese can read Pali pretty easily.
I guess there's similar languages.
Thank you for the question.
Let's just do a little bit more here.
So here is the Pali Canon, and sometimes it's the same as the Tapitaka.
Which means three baskets, basically. So there's three baskets to the Pali Canon to Tapitaka.
There's the Vinya Tapitaka.
Yeah, it's in the book. Thank you.
Did we run out of books? Okay, we have some.
The Sutta Tapitaka and the Abhidhamma Tapitaka.
So initially, at the time of the Buddha, we think, there was just a dipitaka, two baskets at that first council we were talking about.
The Vinya, which are the monastic codes, they're also some very interesting historical information.
Why these different rules in the Theravadan monastic lineage? I think there's 227 rules for monks and 312 for nuns, monks or bhikkhus and nuns or bhikkhunis.
And so these are just different books that give the rules and stories behind them.
And it's fascinating because when the Buddha would set down these rules, as you can imagine, there would be some monks or nuns who would try and get around them or some incident would happen.
And so there would need to be clarification or another rule or some rules kind of counter an earlier rule.
So the Sangha was very much a growing body.
And then what we're primarily interested in, I'd say here today, but also I think what's more easier for us to access the Dharma, to glean information for our practice is the Sutta Tapitaka.
And so when we say, when I use the word Sutta, today's the Sutta Study Day, this is what we're studying.
We're studying these five books.
We're studying the Dighana Kaya. So those are the long discourses. And this kind of gives you a visual on how big it is.
This is very thin paper, small writing, and actually probably if it was fully translated out, there's a lot of repetition as part of the oral tradition.
Passages were repeated over and over. And it's a mnemonic to remember.
There were quite a few mnemonics that the Buddha used. He was a master teacher. So we're familiar with the list, the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Pathway, the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination.
So there's all these lists. There's the repetition that we see, oftentimes when in the suttas, and we'll see this today, the Buddha will say what he's going to teach, he'll teach it, and then he'll say what he taught.
So we have that repetition, and we'll have the exact wording repeated several times. Or there may be a negation.
So he'll say what is skillful. Actually, he usually starts with what's unskillful, what unskillful behavior is, and then what is skillful.
So you get that kind of dichotomy there. He uses a lot of synonyms, especially for very complex things like nibbana, awakening.
He'll have a whole string of words that he'll say to describe that.
And then just really, I think, beautiful similes, these analogies. I mentioned the one about the snake, grabbing the snake, but there's a lot of these images that, one, give us a glimpse back in time to what it was like in ancient India,
and also show us what he meant, kind of a very tangible description of the Dharma.
So that's the digga, nikaya, long discourses, and they're just kind of broken up. This probably wasn't the schema that the Buddha used.
Certainly, we don't think it was the original schema, but this is how the tradition has organized this unwieldy body of knowledge.
I mean, this is just the tip of the iceberg, these books here. I mean, there is a lot of information here.
This is the majima, nikaya, the middle-length discourses. That first one was translated by Maurice Walsh. This is translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi.
This is one of his. And this is a real, I think I know a number of people here have spent some time with this book.
Of these different five books, I would say this one is the one that has probably about 90% of the Dharma in it.
It's just an amazing book. It has, among other things, the Satya Patanasuta, I think many of us know, is the four establishments of mindfulness.
It has information on mindfulness and breathing. It has a complete set of teachings that the Buddha gave to his son, Rahula,
on the whole gradual path of awakening, which resulted in his son becoming fully awake in an arhat like himself.
It gives a lot of really colorful similes. There are teachings on different aspects of the Noble Eightfold Path,
just a real, a lot of wise speech, just a lot of very beautiful stuff.
It's a daunting book. Gil did a year-long sutta study course here, meeting monthly, and it's all recorded on the website and with the handouts.
So if you're really into a challenge and you really want to dig into it, he may teach that again.
I know it's available through the Sits and it's available for self-study on the website.
The translator of this book also has this phenomenal collection of audio files where he goes through each sutta in detail.
Sometimes there's like, for the Satya Patana, there's ten hour and a half long talks going through in fine detail on that sutta.
And then this is the Samyutta Nikaya, the collected discourses of the Buddha.
And this is really kind of like a hardcore meditator's manual.
It has a lot of the same teachings that you'd find in these other volumes, but they're kind of come out from different angles and the teachings are kind of broken up.
And this again would be bigger, but they'll use like ellipses, little dot dot dot, meaning they're repeating the passage that was given earlier.
So there's a lot, you know, if it was fully written out without the repetitions.
I mean, all of the information's here, but just for to save ink and pages, they didn't write the identical repetitions out again.
And Guttara Nikaya, that's the numerical discourses.
And Bhikkhu Bodhi has a translation of that that's actually due out this month.
So that'll be available.
And then there's this huge collection, Guddaka Nikaya, which actually means the minor collection or smaller collection.
But if you look at it, there's 15 different books in here and a lot, you know, a lot of these like Dhammapada, you know, to put a plug in for Gil's book.
He did a translation of the Dhammapada.
And that's probably the most well-known, most commonly recited collection of sutras.
You know, I think a lot of people read that and they're very pithy verses, you know, and you can read the whole book in, well, in theory, in a sitting.
But it's pretty, it's a lot of stuff to digest, but it's, you know, it's very accessible.
And over the generations, it's become a real, I don't know, a book of Psalms or it's become like a real commonly known and beloved set of sutras.
And, you know, there's the Udana, Ituvitaka, the Sutta Nipata, different things.
Probably many of us have heard of the Jataka tales.
These are the tales of the Buddha's former lives before he was awakened, you know, so a lot of them are like stories of animals or people and, you know, just kind of how,
supposedly how the Buddha worked through his, the Parames, his different mental, spiritual perfections to become a Buddha.
This is all legend. I'm not going to go too much into the history of that, but.
And then, and some of these in this, this Kudaka Nikaya collection, some of them are probably later editions.
They probably weren't things that the Buddha taught himself. And that's what we think most scholars think about the Abhidhamma Pitaka.
Abhidhamma means higher or other dharmas, other teachings.
And this is, it's an amazing collection of very detailed description of how the mind works, how the dharma works.
So what scholars believe is that after the Buddha's death, practitioners sat down with the dharma and they went into the territories with the Buddha admonished not to go into,
like, what happens after you die? What's the origin of the world? You know, just a lot of, you know, these kind of metaphysical questions.
And there's some of you know the simile of the arrow. The Buddha gives this simile where, you know, he said, a monk comes,
I think this is Majama Nikaya 66 I want to say, but a monk comes to him and says, you know,
if you don't tell me, you know, these questions, this series of these metaphysical questions, I'm going to leave the sangha.
And the Buddha says, well, you know, you're crazy because I never said I would tell you those things.
And those things are not important and I won't teach them.
And you know, it's kind of like you're this man who's been shot with a poison arrow and his friends gather around and they bring,
we'll bring a doctor and the doctor is going to pull the arrow out and the man says, no, wait a minute.
Before you pull it out, I want to know who shot me and I want to know what kind of poison this is and I want to know how the arrow was made
and what this, you know, and he has like these 10 questions about this, you know, what happened to him.
And he's really focused on that rather than pulling the arrow out.
So this is the simile of the poisoned arrow. And so the Abhidhamma kind of appears into that territory of, you know, these things.
And it also gives a very detailed look at the human psychology and goes into things like dependent origination in very much detail.
And Buddhist legend has it that the Buddha during one ranger treat went up to two seats to heaven and taught the Abhidhamma to his mother,
who had died a week after he was born, but who had been reborn there as a deva.
And he went and during this ranger treat, he taught her the Abhidhamma and then he came down to earth periodically to fill,
sorry, Putta, one of his disciples in on what he had taught his mother.
This is the lore or the legend around it. You know, I mean, I don't have any way of assessing that.
I mean, most scholars deny that version, but you know, I think most traditional Theravadans would say that's what happened, you know, and that's the truth.
So I'm just throwing that little tidbit out there for you.
So that's the...Tipitaka.
And last thing before we have our first practice period, our meditation, our break, whatever you want, however you want to spend your time.
I want to briefly go over all of the sources of error. You know, we talked, we touched on that.
We have this body of knowledge now. How can we specifically look at what's possible? Yes.
Yes, please.
Okay, so I guess I'm learning about the teachings of Buddha for the suffering part of listening and suffering.
But as indicated in, you know, these books or canons and whatnot, there's also a tendency to mis-defy or present Buddha's life in a mythical way,
which I think kind of detracts from really learning about what I believe to be the core teachings, which is really about how the lesson is suffering.
Now, for example, I think in the last year or so there was, I think there was a PBS two to four hour series by Richard Gere.
And I'm like, that's like, talking about demons and stuff, I'm like, that's not really helpful for me.
And plus, on top of that, you know, I visited other Buddhist study groups that have lineages and whatnot,
and that didn't appeal to me either because there's like rituals and whatnot associated with that.
So how much of that is from Buddha's teaching versus just things that kind of took a life on the zone and evolved into more of a religious format?
And that, to me, I've always kind of, that's kind of what I grew up with.
I mean, I grew up with Buddhists that had a lot of rituals and, you know, like around death and birds and whatnot.
And it just never appealed to me much like rituals in other religions.
I was actually raised a Catholic and that didn't appeal to me either.
So, I mean, I guess I'm trying to understand is, you know, the aspects I'm learning about the core teachings really appeal to me.
But all this other stuff, how much of that is really from Buddha and how much of it is just kind of evolved on his own and that I don't find particularly useful?
Yeah, well, that's a great question and it's a question that's on a lot of people's minds.
You know, there's a lot of controversy and we'll go into the background of that time period.
But, you know, we've had some teachers come here at Satya Center.
I think some of you probably were here, John Peacock and Stephen Batchelor.
And they, Stephen Batchelor wrote a book called The Confessions of an Atheist Buddhist.
Is that what it's called? I think it's Buddhist Atheist.
And in that book, he really argues the point that, you know, the later tradition and the time imposed all of these mythical, what he calls mythical elements on it.
So there's this whole movement called secular Buddhism on our board.
We have Tony Bernhardt and I think he gave it day long here on secular Buddhism.
I know he did in Sacramento for us at Arsanga, but I think he did that here too.
John Peacock was here a year ago. We had Stephen Batchelor.
And so they really are, you know, they're scholars and they're really trying to say, hey, this is, you know, this, what's in here is really, and we'll go into this in the next section.
Brahminical, you know, from the Brahmins of the time.
And the Buddha was either using that metaphorically or it was later added by monks, but this is not the true teachings.
And of course, I have no way of judging that.
I mean, I think that the model that I gave earlier of how we have to take the teachings in and hear it from different perspectives and then work with it intellectually, reflectively, and meditatively and make our own opinions.
Because there's people, even in this audience, who probably really hold, you know, in their heart this whole belief in rebirth and karma and how that's so essential to their Buddhism and their meditation practice.
And there's people, you know, here who, you know, they just, that's just a bunch of hooey, you know.
And so I think we all have to find our own way through this, but, you know, certainly if you enter this journey on sutra study, you will encounter, you know, demons and Nagas and devas and Mara, you know, is used a lot.
This kind of anthropomorphic misation of, you know, human greed, hatred, and delusion.
You know, there's, you know, this whole cosmology in Buddhism of different levels of heaven.
You know, there's the six realms, the human realm, the animal realm, the hungry ghost realm, the warring god realm, and then the heaven realms and the hell realm.
So there's all of these other elements that you can't help but encounter in the sutras.
So you either have to read over them and gossip over them, see what you can take away from them.
But, you know, it's the point you're raising, I think, we all have that, you know, question of how to relate to that.
And, you know, we're also 2,500, almost 2,600 years removed from that time period.
So it's, you know, this is a different culture in a different era.
So I don't consider myself a secular Buddhist. I still hold all of that, maybe true.
I don't, when I teach meditation classes, I don't incorporate it because it's just not relevant to the students, you know, at that level.
But it's something, karma and rebirth, maybe, you know, I don't know. I can't disprove it, you know.
So I don't want to get too far off course.
I think just one last slide here.
So in addition to the, our previous slide remembers, Tapitaka, this is the Pali Canon.
We have this huge body of post-canonical literature, which goes down to, I mean, modern texts, this book might be considered.
So these are, they're also called the commentarial or exegetical, I can't say that word.
Exegetical.
Exegetical, yeah, thank you. The doctor then means coming up.
Tradition of later, not so much the Buddha, but later authors.
The big figure in this is Buddha Gosa, who was a monk who lived about a thousand years after the time of the Buddha, probably born in southern India,
and then moved to Sri Lanka and joined the main Theravadan lineage there, or, you know, as part of it.
And he took commentaries.
So these are detailed analysis about the suttas.
Pretty much for most, many of the suttas, there are commentaries in addition to the sutta themselves.
There's this, you know, this work that, you know, says this is what the context was and, you know, gives background information.
This is what the Buddha meant.
Sometimes it'll go into specific words and there's sub commentaries on the commentaries.
A very important book is the Visuddhimaga, translated to the path of purification, written by Buddha Gosa.
And this has become really the, I guess, the de facto meditation manual of the Theravadan tradition.
You know, that, you know, through its passage through Burma and Thailand and to us here, that a lot of the way we learn about meditation
and learn about the dharma comes through the lens of this book.
And it's an amazing book.
I mean, it's kind of one of the faults of the suttas is things aren't always organized.
And they, you know, you'll get a detailed description of this and then not so much here.
For example, meditation techniques or how to do loving kindness practice is not really laid out very concretely in terms that we might understand
on how to actually do it, you know, not just to read about it, but do it in the suttas.
But in the Visuddhimaga, it is laid out a lot more concretely.
So we see it through that lens and there's, you know, advantages and disadvantages of that.
You know, that this may be influenced by the time, a thousand years of distance and other factors.
But it's just to know that, and there's a movement to kind of put the Visuddhimaga aside and, you know, go back to the original teachings.
The early, what's called the early discourses, the suttas.
And to muddy the waters even further, there's the whole Chinese canon which has, was just held by the Mahayana schools.
And it has a lot of different things, different sutras in it, but it also has a lot of those same parallels to these suttas.
There's different vinyas for different schools and different avidamas.
There's two full avidamas and maybe three, and there's maybe five different vinyas.
Theravada is just one, and Theravada has one avidama.
So, for example, in this Majamindakaya, we had Venerable Bhikkhu Inali here last year at the Satya Center.
And he is, he knows multiple languages.
He's reading sutras from the Majama Agamas, kind of a parallel book to this,
that were transmitted, transmitted through different lineage in different countries and different times.
So they diverged at an early point.
And he's triangulating and comparing the sutta from this collection and the sutta from that collection,
from the Majamindakaya to the Majama Agama, and seeing, you know, what's the concordance?
Do these agree? Are they the same?
And there's, you know, there are some variations, but there's a lot of agreement.
So the thought is that the suttas and this other collection, which is just beginning to be translated in English,
it's available in Chinese for over 1500 years, but just beginning to be translated into English,
seems to be pretty faithful.
So if we look at the errors available in what we have for us today.
So, right, the Buddha's words, maybe they misunderstood at that first council, maybe they got it wrong.
Then it was transmitted for 400 years, maybe there's some error that drifted in there.
At some point it shifted from what the Buddha spoke to Pali, which are very similar languages they gather.
But then it was converted from oral form to written form.
So writing it down, there could have been some possible errors there.
Copping texts, you know, those Ola leaves over and over through the centuries,
maybe, you know, you just get one word, one letter wrong and that can change the meaning of the word.
And there may be some, there's some evidence of some passages that may have been intentionally changed
or out of confusion of the people involved.
Translation from Pali to our language, there's some, you know, error that could be entered in there.
Not understanding the cultural context, that was kind of the question you raised.
And then our bias, you know, we hear these suttas, but we, you know, we think something else.
We have some different ideas about it.
You know, there's a simile where the Buddha describes these blind men feeling different parts of an elephant.
You know, one's feeling the trunk, one's feeling a leg, one's feeling the tail.
And they just, they can't see the whole picture, they're just seeing that, feeling that part that they're touching.
And they're trying to describe it to each other.
And they get into a brawl actually because, no, it feels, you know, it feels like a big tree stump, you know, the leg.
Or the tail feels like a, you know, a whisk broom.
So they have this, and so this is, I guess the Buddha was saying this is us, you know, kind of sometimes getting things from our own,
and we know this, you know, from our own perspective, we certainly are biased.
So that these comparative studies of these two different bodies of text show us that even though there's all these sources of error,
there still seems to be a lot of agreement.
And you mentioned internal consistency.
That's another piece, I think, that argues for the value of studying sutras is that you read one sutra here and then you read somewhere else.
And very seldom will you get them to actually say, you know, to disagree or to be totally, you know, one's totally off base.
You know, there's really good concordance internally and externally.
Shall we take a meditation period now?
Does anyone have any question on that before we break?
Okay.
So let's have a meditation period for 30 minutes, and I'll ring the bell right before it's time to come back in.
Thank you.
