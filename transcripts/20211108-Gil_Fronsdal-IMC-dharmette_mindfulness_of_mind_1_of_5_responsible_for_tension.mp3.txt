 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So today we start the week on mindfulness of the mind, and it's a continuation of these last four weeks where we kind of explored the basic instructions for mindfulness meditation that we teach here at IMC, kind of exploring the territory. First week was mindfulness of breathing, then mindfulness of body, then emotions and thoughts. With each of those areas, it's easy to get focused on those things. So we're breathing and we're focusing on the breathing, and the breathing seems like what's most important. Or if there's pain especially, we're focused on the pain in the body, and that seems the most important. Or for emotions, the emotion seems really central, key, juicy. And so the attention is focusing on the emotion, or on thinking, whatever it might be. And that's part of what mindfulness is. But in doing so, what's also important is the focus itself, is the attention that's brought. How are we with the attention? What attitude comes with the attention? And it's a little bit like driving a car with a windshield that's been cleaned, and maybe going a long road trip on the freeway. And ever so slowly, the windshield gets dirty. And it happens very slowly, and you don't see it building up. And after a while, you don't really realize that you're a little bit straining to look out the windshield. And it's a little hard. And then maybe you stop to get gas and you clean your windshield. And lo and behold, wow, is it clear again. And you realize that some of the tension that was building up was the difficulty of seeing. But you hadn't realized it was difficult. It happens to me sometimes with my glasses when I wear them, that they get dirty without me knowing it. But I don't really notice sometimes that things aren't quite right with trying to see. Because the focus is so much on the driving and getting and being safe for the other cars, we don't notice the seeing itself and how that's changed, or something like that. So the art of this is to be able to step back or turn the attention around 180 degrees and notice the quality of the attention we're bringing, the quality of how we practice. And so there's always two things. I like to say, there's only two things. There's what's happening and our relationship to what's happening. And so here we're going into the domain of how we're relating to whatever's happening, whether it's within us or around us. And starting to notice today, because today's the day we focus on relaxation, are we tense? Are we contracted? Are we tight? Are we pushing? Are we forceful? Are we resisting in a tense way? And it's easy to justify that tension and tightness, because there are challenges the world brings. And so it's easy to say the problems out there, the problems with that thing that I'm focusing on. And we have to fix that or do something with it or get away from it. Not noticing that there is this tension that's building up. And not wanting to maybe even take responsibility of that tension. When we do mindfulness practice, when we're focusing on the Dharma, the way that we relate to what's happening is crucial, is central. The way that we, the attitude we have, the reaction we have to it, the way in which we bring attention to bear on whatever we're doing, that is really part of the pathway of suffering. And it's a part of the pathway where we can have the most regular and ongoing responsibility or make the biggest difference. Maybe it would be a little bit like, I'll say the analogy I used before, that if, well say it this way, that if someone's angry with you, say it's not on a scale of one to ten, it's not ten, maybe it's a five or four or something. But it's still what they're angry about, seems to you, not right. And so you get upset. And part of being upset is being tense. Now the person who is angry, you could perhaps ask them politely to stop being angry. You could perhaps insist that they have to stop or you walk away. Or you could ask them, let's talk about it. Or you could shake them upside down and try to shake the anger out of them. All kinds of things, new options you have. And sometimes most of those might work, but sometimes they don't. And so then the irritation, the frustration can build and the tension builds as well. We might say that person is making me tense. And that's, in some kind of way, there's a relationship between that person's anger and the tension you have. But the tension is your contribution to the situation. That anger goes into your mind. And maybe you have associations to when anger is a frightening thing. Or anger before there's been injustice to you. And here's getting the person's angry and it reminds you of all the injustices you've had to suffer. Or maybe there's fear and the person's anger happens to angry, happens to remind you of an angry bully when you're young. And so all these reasons why the tension and the reactivity might arise, but that belongs to our inner world, our inner life, our preferences, our experience, our memories, our judgments, our desire to protect ourselves. All these things come into play. So there's pathways. There's a loud angry voice coming to us. We receive it, we hear it, we hear it and we process it. We process it and feel afraid and we tense a certain way. We process it and feel angry and return and it tense up in a different way. And so that's the pathway. And then we react and we maybe get angry back or we say something. But if we can sit in that place where there's a choice, whether to be relaxed or tense, whether to go with attention or allow it or to relax, then we're getting close to where the Dharma is. Now we're focusing on our contribution to our suffering. And that is one of the key things that mindfulness practice can do or that Dharma does is we're very keen to take responsibility to our own contribution to whatever is difficult. It doesn't deny that things need to be changed or fixed in the world, but at least we can always look at what our contribution is to our suffering. And the place that I'd like to recommend today is how you've become tense, how you've gotten contracted, tight, pulled in, the ways in which you kind of feel the compulsion to push and to do and kind of restless. And so that can maybe be relaxed. Not relaxed and softened so the real world issues are denied if there are real world issues, but relaxed so that we can come to them with the most wisdom and the most care and from the best place that we know. The more tense we become, most people don't respond with a lot of wisdom, don't respond with a lot of care, and sometimes respond in ways that are actually detrimental. There's a lot of justification, kind of unconscious for being tense. There is a lot of justification or feeling that the blame isn't the other person or the situation. And so that keeps the focus out there. In mindfulness of the mind, we're turning the mind attention back to see what is happening in our attitude, our relationship, and with ourselves. And that we train ourselves to do that, to keep looking there and see where the tension is, see where the... and then relax. And to be given the instructions to relax might seem superficial, not very profound, not very spiritually ultimate or valuable, but it's... relax is a kind of a simplistic way of referring to the deep letting go, the deep opening up that spirituality, Buddhist spirituality, kind of moves to. And so relaxing is part and parcel this movement towards deep freedom. And so to take seriously the way we become tense is bringing us into the territory of the world where we contribute to our suffering and where we could contribute to our freedom from our suffering. So don't overlook your tension. Don't justify being tense. Maybe occasionally it's okay, but the opportunity in this practice is to turn around, take an honest look at it, and see what can relax. And then once you're kind of relaxed, then you can turn your tension around again to what needs to be addressed. So may... let's take a look at what we've done. May the bliss of relaxation, the blessings of relaxation be something that you study and work with today as you go through the day. It's not a simplistic thing. It's a... this is a deep root in so many profound areas of our life. And hopefully you'll enjoy it. May your shoulders, your belly, your face, your eyes, your hands, your heart, and your mind.
