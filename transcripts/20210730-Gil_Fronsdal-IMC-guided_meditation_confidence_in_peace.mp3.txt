 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good day. Hello to everyone. And as a follow-up to this week of meditations and teachings, I would like to offer you the idea or the possibility of meditating with confidence in peace. To have confidence that orienting oneself towards what is peaceful here and now is healthier than being involved in reactivity and distracted thoughts. There's a teaching that, or an idea, a phrase that the highest health is nirvana. Nirvana is the highest health. And to sit in this confidence and peace is to sit close to where it's healthy to be. Reactivity, greed, hatred is not exactly healthy to have for ourselves or for the world. But also you can feel in meditation the work of reactivity. To spend a lot of time spinning out in thoughts and desires and aversions takes energy. And it's kind of like the energy that's extra, that's a system which is not running smoothly. Whereas peace is not the absence of a running system of our humanity, but it's allowing it to run smoothly with the least amount of extra energy. So to sit with confidence in peace. So beginning by assuming a posture, perhaps a posture of confidence. Even if you don't feel confident, perhaps your body can still express it or manifest it as if you're confident. Apparently there's a saying in AA, bring the body and the mind will follow. So to bring the body into a confident posture and let the body become still, quiet, gently closing the eyes and attuning yourself or allowing yourself a soft stillness in the body. Not a holding yourself still, but a kind of coming to rest in a bodily stillness. And then to take a few peaceful, quiet, deeper breaths, maybe three quarters full to the lungs. Now longer exhale where you settle yourself, drop yourself into your body, into a quiet, restful, still place in your body. As you exhale, relaxing the body. And then to let your breathing return to normal and gently, not without much ambition or any ambition. As you exhale, soften in your body, relaxing in your face, relaxing in your shoulders, in your belly. And then takes a moment just to sit here quietly, becoming attuned to wherever they're in the body. The body feels peaceful or still. There might be a lot of agitation elsewhere in the body or in the mind. It's okay. It's allowed to be there. But for now, find the place of peace or stillness, calm within. It might be in the hands, in the small of the back. It might be a quiet, still place and deep in the torso, anywhere it might be. And to appreciate and value that within which is peaceful or calm. And to have confidence in that more than you would have confidence in your distracted thoughts or your reactivity or the confidence in agitation. And perhaps becoming mindful of your breathing. And perhaps that breathing is supported by the peace within. Even if the breathing doesn't feel so calm. Breathe through the peace, breathe with the peace. And as you exhale, relaxing the thinking muscle. Finding a place in the mind too that might feel peaceful or quiet or still. And then as you're sitting here today meditating, let your confidence be directed or grow out of whatever sense of peace or stillness, calm that you feel. Breathe with it. Breathe through it. Breathe through it. Being mindful, aware in a peaceful way. Having confidence in peace more than your confidence in anything that is agitating or distracting. For these minutes being attuned, aligned with that which is peaceful. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
