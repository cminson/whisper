 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Now we can start with paying attention to the body. What's the simple acknowledgement of how the body is here or sitting? I can pay some attention to areas in the body that might be a little tense right now. For each of us, there might be different areas. So you can go ahead and just, with some gentle and kind attention, be with that part of the body that feels a little tense, or multiple parts of the body maybe. Sometimes just this gentle and kind attention can help release some of it, some of the tension. Not that this has to happen, but sometimes it does. So, if you feel complete with that, then you can maybe pay some attention to the breath. The simple in and out flow of air, making the belly or the chest rise and fall. We don't have to strain too much. You can just receive the breath. It's there anyway, whether we strive or not. When you feel ready, you can open up for all experiences, all bodily experiences, and all mental experiences. Maybe you notice some thoughts of how this day is going to be like, or what you did yesterday, maybe you're relatively quiet. Whatever it is that's here for you right now, you can just be with it without it having to change and be different. Just as we receive the breath, you can receive all experience. You don't have to go look for anything. You can just sit back and relax and let experience come to us. Sometimes unpleasant experiences arise. Sometimes we want to push them away. Or we feel like, oh, I don't want to experience this. It's a completely natural, understandable pattern. We can try to be with this pattern of unpleasantness coming up and the pushing away. Just a gentle presence for what is happening in the mind. Even the pushing away doesn't have to go away. This way we can be with all experiences. Whether it's a struggle, whether it's difficult, or maybe it's when it's pleasant and calm or happy. We can take, so to speak, a little step back and just observe. Thank you. Maybe the mind is settled a little bit. You can also experience the subtle joy of just being in this present moment. If you're simply present for just this moment, you can often experience a subtle joy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you you you you you every time we get lost in thought when we get back again you take the opportunity to See if we can recognize the subtle joy of being in this present moment. On this way, each time we get back from a little trip into our thought world, get a little present. This present of being in this present moment. You can see the subtle joy of being in this present moment. You can see the subtle joy of being in this present moment. You can see the subtle joy of being in this present moment. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you take a moment to appreciate ourselves or taking the time to meditate we're investing this time in ourselves and becoming maybe a little bit happier or more grounded or more at ease. We can thank ourselves for this, for our wholesome intention to meditate and practice, and the wholesomeness of our intention and of our practice can also be shared with all beings everywhere. This way it just multiplies. We don't have to keep it fully to ourselves. That's something that appeals to you and you can share the beneficial energies, the wholesomeness of today, today's meditation with all beings everywhere. May all beings everywhere benefit from the wholesome energies generated through our meditation together. May it contribute to their freedom and their well-being.
