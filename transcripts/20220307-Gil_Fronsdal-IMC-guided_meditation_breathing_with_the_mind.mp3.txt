 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So hello and welcome to this Monday morning meditation, where we begin the third foundation for mindfulness, for the cultivation, the growth of awareness. And this third foundation is usually called, is in Pali, it's called Chitta, C-I-T-T-A. And in English it's sometimes known as mind state in this context. Sometimes the word Chitta simply refers to mind. And now sometimes we can appreciate what it is, maybe sometimes by the attitude of mind that's present, the general mood of the mind, the kind of gestalt, feeling, sense, awareness of our inner mentality, the kind of whole of all the inner mental life maybe. In the West we often point to the head as being the locus, the place of the mind. A long Asian tradition in Buddhism is to point to the heart as a center for the mind. I like to think of it as related, it's related to the quality of our inner life, that part of our inner life that may or may not be influenced by events around us, the circumstances of our life and things. And that in the deeper places of the mind, deeper capacities of the mind, is kind of how we feel and sense and experience ourselves independent of, kind of when we're on our own, in our more private sense of our experience. So we'll just do a general meditation on the mind and then tomorrow we'll go on to other aspects of it. So to begin, to take an alert, relaxed meditation posture and lower your eyes to maybe 45 degrees to the floor. And if it's comfortable, gently close your eyes. And before doing anything else, notice what's the general state of your mind right now? It's a general state of your inner life that may or may not be independent from what's the circumstances that's happening right now. Are you more on the agitated end of the spectrum or more calm? Are you more settled or more activated? Are you uneasy in any way or is the inner state at ease? Are you comfortable with your inner life, inner state of mind, state of heart, or is there a discomfort about it? Whatever way it is, let it be that way. But with breathing right in the middle of it perhaps or imagining that you can breathe, accompanying how your state of mind is, state of heart, gently take a few long slow deep breaths. Breathing in deeply, breathing out. As you exhale, relaxing your body. As you exhale, relaxing around the state of heart. The state of your mind or heart. And letting your breathing return to normal. And maybe if you continue relaxing on the exhale, begin by relaxing the mind. Whatever it is for you, the mind is. Maybe it's the place from which you think. Where there might be some tension or pressure or agitation. On the exhale, let that relax and soften. Or maybe there's a pervasive mood that somehow is related to the functioning of your mind, your mental activity. As you exhale, relax the body. As if relaxing the body. So settling around your mood, your attitude. Relaxing the face. The shoulders. The belly. And then a gentle awareness of your body breathing. And being aware of breathing, there's kind of a meeting, meeting place of the mind and the body. The body has its sensations. And the mind somehow knows it. Experiences it. And what would it be like to have a balanced awareness? Knowing the body's experience. And aware of the mind knowing. What I'll say next is that it doesn't matter if you're new or flee- friendly to sleep this With the regularity, the constancy of breathing in and breathing out, as a massage or as a mental connection to your state of mind, the state of mind through which you're attending, aware of breathing, the focus being on the rhythm of breathing, breathing with however your mind is, however your inner state is, just breathing with it so that you're not reacting to it or caught in it or against it. Just a regular breathing, coming and going. Good! is a general quality or state of your mind predominantly colored by desires. What you want are the wanting mind or is it predominantly colored by aversion? Wanting something different, something to go away. Or is it colored by confusion, uncertainty? Or is it colored by confusion, uncertainty? Whatever way it might be, breathe with it. Breathe with it, a gentle way of brushing against it, not needing to fix anything or concerned with anything, but awareness brushing fast, brushing through how your mind is one breath at a time. Breathe with it, a gentle way of brushing against it. Breathe with it, a gentle way of brushing against it. Breathe with it, a gentle way of brushing against it. Breathe with it, a gentle way of brushing against it. Whether your mind is happy or sad, elated or in the blues, eager or reluctant, whatever state way it is, breathe with it, breathe through it. A kind of refuge in breathing so you're less reactive to how you are on the inside. Just accompanying it with the breathing. Breathe with it, a gentle way of brushing against it.......... good good good good good knowing the state of your mind whatever it might be and see if the knowing of it or the feeling of it, whichever it is you can know it with space as if there is a lot of space surrounding it so rather than being caught in the web of how we feel the knowing is wider, more spacious and however we are is within that open field of experience good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good and as we come to the end of this sitting become familiar again with the state of your mind the mood of the mind, the attitude how has it changed from the beginning of the meditation? perhaps now at the end of the inhale as you begin to exhale can the mind relax more deeply? or can you relax deep into the mind to where the mind maybe is quiet still maybe where the mind is calm like the ocean a few feet under the waves the ocean is quiet and calm whatever the turbulence of your surface is dropping down into your quiet place and then turning your gaze out across the world and see if your gaze, your way of considering the world that you live in to look upon it kindly let yourself be still and gaze upon the world kindly wish having good will, well-wishing for this world wishing well, wishing happiness for those who suffer and those who don't wishing for the peace for those who are not in peace and those who are not in peace and may all beings be happy may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere be free
