 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDharma.org. Hi everybody. Tonight I'd like to offer what is traditionally called the Wayseekers Talk. This is my story of how I came to the Dharma and what I've learned in my investigation of suffering and freedom, freedom from suffering and freedom in suffering. I'll start with an ending which in that is also a beginning. It was at a point in my life where the suffering felt like it could not get any worse. Just the thought of having to reach down and to tie my shoe brought me into total despair. It's like, what? I have to do this again. I have to tie my shoe again and then I have to tie the other one again. How many times in my life have I tied my shoe and how many times will I have to do it again? In my life I had tried as we all do. I think it's part of being a human being all the many, many, many, many ways that we escape. I think in our nation and in the West really escape is almost a religion. We have it honed to a fine art. The ability to escape. There's so much offered in the form of escape through media, through advertising. We were able to get anything we could possibly want or need. We're offered escape through entertainment. We're offered escape. We're fed fear. We can escape into fear. We can escape into anything over and over and over again. We can use that escape as a way of directing the attention away from ourselves. I can look at something outside of myself as what will make me happy, what will make me complete, what will make me a good mother, a good teacher, a good human being. I can look outside of myself as to the reason why I am so miserable. It must be because the world is a terrible place. It must be because of the state of the country. It must be because of the state of the economy. Has nothing to do with me. We can look outside of ourselves endlessly for the reason why I'm not happy. I'm not happy because it's something outside of myself or I will only be happy because I don't have enough. It's like this condition of enoughness. If I only had enough, if I only had enough money, I'd be generous. If I only had a good job, I'd have enough money. If I only had enough of this or that, I'd be less afraid. I could sleep at night. I'd be a good mother. I'd be a good person. I'd do the right thing. I'd be a good person if I only had enough, this enoughness. Once again, this enoughness is something that I look for outside of me. It never occurred to me to look inside myself for the reasons for my discontent, for the sense of not having enough. I built this box. I went to extreme measures in order to escape. My form of escape came in alcohol and drug addiction. I built a box. With this, I was able to feel I had control. All I really had to control was whether or not I had enough drugs and alcohol. I didn't have to worry about anything else outside of me. I didn't even have to think about it because I felt as long as I had enough drugs and alcohol, everything would be okay. I built this box for my whole world centered around it. I didn't even see that I was suffering. I didn't even know I was miserable. I prevented any feelings from coming up and out. I thought I had control. I thought I was really able to control my life. I lived in the illusion of complete control. If I didn't have enough, I was miserable and then I could control that by trying to get more. I did this over and over endlessly. My life fell apart. My life fell apart. My career was in shambles. I was just a broken image of a mother. My relationships fell away. I caused harm. I caused harm to others. I caused harm to myself. I didn't even know what happiness was. I was numb. I was numb. I lived in darkness and I was afraid of the light. The only time I felt what I thought was a semblance of peace was many, many hours into the night. Then when the sun came up, when it was time to wake up and I heard the birds singing, I just wanted to die. I just wanted to cry. There it was. Even just thought of having to tie my shoe again put me into complete despair. So I had a disease, a dis-ease. I had a disease of alcoholism. I'm so fortunate that I live in a time where there is a program, there's a solution for this disease. That's Alcoholics Anonymous. You know, it never occurred to me that I could do something like that. It was offered to me. It was offered to me. Someone said, why don't you go to a meeting? It was like, oh, oh, I could do that. And when I entered into a room of Alcoholics Anonymous, a meeting, it was the first time that I was able to be honest. It was offered to me the ability to be able to be honest. So I was able to at that time to practice a spiritual principle. Because traditionally, when someone like me walks into a meeting for the first time, we can raise our hand. We can say, my name is Kathy. I'm an alcoholic. In that, I was admitting my powerlessness over my disease and I was practicing honesty. And what I thought even then in doing that was a little kernel, a little taste of freedom within the suffering, within the extreme suffering that I just, just slightly knew was there enough to get me into the room. By being honest, I was also tasting freedom. And you know what else I was doing when I did that? I was doing something different. I was, I was breaking habit patterns, breaking the cycle of suffering by doing something different. Now in Alcoholics Anonymous, there's a framework. It's a model. It's a model for recovery. There's the 12 steps. And as I've come into practice, I've, I've looked at those 12 steps in terms of the Four Noble Truths. I've looked, I've looked at them. I've looked at the whole program in the terms of the Dharma. And I really like that. I really love how the two, the two for me, and I think for many others is very much intertwined, the Dharma and, and the 12 steps, the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. Because when I, when I sit down, when I raise my hand and I admit my powerless, powerlessness, I am suffering. Suffering is known. I know I am suffering. I am powerless over alcohol. And what's the reason? What's the reason? What is the reason I am suffering? I am suffering because I cannot control my drinking. The reason is known. I am attached to something that is impermanent. The second Noble Truth, the second Noble Truth is known. In Alcoholics Anonymous, there, there, it's called this a solution. There is a solution to this disease. In this disease, in Alcoholics Anonymous is a spiritual disease. It's laid out as a spiritual disease. And there is a solution. And this is the third Noble Truth. Peace is possible. There is a solution. And then the fourth Noble Truth is the eightfold path. And in Alcoholics Anonymous, it's the steps. There is a solution, the steps and the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. So I love that. I love, I love how they go together. And for me, Alcoholics Anonymous has been the roots, the foundation of my spiritual growth. I, you know, I bow deeply. I bow deeply to the program. I bow deeply to the fellowship. There's a strong fellowship, a strong Sangha within AA, a very accepting, very uncritical, mobilized force that comes together to, to help each other. We help each other on our quest, on our quest for sobriety and our quest for spiritual growth. It's really, it's a beautiful thing. And when we work the steps, we can begin to clear out. We can begin to clear out what are called, what are called character defects, but it's more a matter, it's not so much a matter of clearing out, it's a matter of really seeing what's, seeing what's there by, by working the steps. We see, I see my patterns. Force comes around them. I'm working a program that, that allows for living an ethical life. I'm practicing generosity. I'm being of service. I'm extending my hand to another alcoholic. So it's laying this wholesome foundation in my life by my actions, by my words and by my thoughts. And so we go through the steps. I go through the steps and we come to a step. It's called the 11th step. And in that step suggested that we'd go towards a spiritual path, sought through prayer and meditation. So it's, it's suggested that I pray and I meditate. Well, I live in Marin County. I live close to Spirit Rock. My my best friend worked out at Spirit Rock. She still does. And that's how I came. First came to the Dharma was, was to Spirit Rock. And I, and you know, I threw myself into the program and to the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous and I really did the same when, when I began to practice when I went out to Spirit Rock. Initially, I would go to Monday nights. There's a, some of you may, may have gone there. There's a sitting group on Monday nights and a class. Jack, Jack Cornfield often teaches there. Big, big, big group. Very different from here. This is very intimate here. And it's a lovely group and I began to volunteer for the family program. And my, my, my career has always been with children. I worked with children, but when I was in the darkness, I couldn't do it. There was no way I could be around kids. I couldn't be around anybody. So I gave myself some space for that, from that for a while, but then I began to be able to to substitute, teach again. And I began to volunteer for the family program at Spirit Rock. And it's a wonderful family program out there. There, there's several family days. And there's a family retreat and the Dharma's offer to children and to families with songs and with stories and and there's often a monastic presence. And it's a, it's a really, it's a really beautiful program. And and I loved it and I got a little taste of meditation. I began to meditate. I began to sit still and I began to watch my mind and my heart. And I began to watch my body. And I liked it. I didn't, I didn't really know what it was telling me yet. It didn't really know what I was finding out. I didn't even know if I was finding out anything. I actually, you know, I don't even know now. I don't need to know. You know, it's it's it's OK to just be able to sit and observe and feel the feelings and see the thoughts. And to know them and to begin to know them. And so I wanted to sit a retreat. Now you know there's all sorts of retreats out at Spirit Rock and you know being being being drawn to intensity. I thought about I want to immediately plunge into a long retreat. I want to go for it and just like go into deep Samadhi and and and escape. You know, once again, escape for like two months. But I didn't do that. I didn't do that. I was it was suggested to me by Dharma friends. Very, very valuable on the path. Dharma friends to begin with a woman's retreat and begin with a short retreat. And I and I'm really glad I took I took that suggestion. And I thought I had, you know, I'd begun to meditate before them. But boy, I don't know if any of you have ever sat a retreat. But that's when you sit a retreat. You know, that's when. That's when you really see what meditation is. That's that's when it's the sitting. That's when it's the really the sitting with a mind and the body. You know, for for hours at a time. And if you sat retreat, you know, the schedule can begin very early and go very late. And in the sore, the sore body and the bells and and what I don't I only get six hours sleep and and the Dharma talk and feel like entertainment and. All these all these words, all these concepts that I've never heard of before, you know. I'm really pretty fortunate. I'm actually very fortunate because for me sitting. Sitting comes fairly easily. My body can sit without a lot of pain, but it's it. It took me a long time to hear what was being said. But I did get glimmers of it. I did get glimmers of it. And I loved I loved what I heard. I love the precepts. It went right in line with what I had learned through the steps and what I learned through the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. The precepts are part of are part of the seal of the ethical conduct. And and I understood that because I'd had that I'd had that ground grounding. I'd had that foundation. A I understood what what what I've you know, what I've since heard the teachings on many times that. When I live an ethical life, when I'm honest, when I try to be honest, when I try not to cause harm. When I don't take that, which is not given to me. When I, for me, cannot indulge in any intoxicants, I'm not saying that's the case for everybody. For me, when I don't do any of those things. Then my mind and my heart. Are freer. And I'm living what's called a blameless life. And when I'm practicing Selah and I'm living a blameless life, that is the cause and conditions for Samadhi, for concentration. Which can open to wisdom and compassion. So I began to hear this and I and I and so Selah, I love Selah. It's it's just it's it's so important for me on this path. And it's it's it's I always come back to it and I always come back to the precepts. It's it's just such an integral part of of practice. For me. And I loved I loved taking refuge. You know, I love to just like take refuge in the Buddha and the Dharma and the Sangha and. You know, when I first started doing that, it was just beautiful to be able to chant and and hear the various ways the teachers would interpret it. And. And you know, as time has gone on, my understanding of what that means to take refuge in the Buddha and the Dharma and the Sangha. Has deepened, my understanding has deepened and my understanding will continue to deepen as long as I continue doing this. Initially, initially, it was just it was a beautiful, it was a beautiful ritual, you know, and I felt I felt a part of I felt a part of everybody else. I felt a part of of the whole. And as I continue to practice. I have an understanding that that refuge. Is inside of me, you know, the refuge is inside of me and. And that's no different than. Then you. The refuge that's inside of me is also the refuge in you, it's the refuge in the Buddha, it's the refuge in the Dharma, it's the refuge in the Sangha. It's like it's like when I was always looking outside of myself. As a way to escape to blame or to grasp onto. Because I could not look inside, I could not cultivate what was inside of me. I learned to do that, I learned to do that, I learned to have a deeper understanding. I have had a deeper understanding and I look forward to having a continuing deepening into what what taking what refuge means. And of course, mindfulness. You know, that's the foundation here, mindfulness. So mindfulness initially for me, like I. You know, I'll tell you, I'm still I'm still I'm still working on that one. And it's becoming a lot more graceful. In retreats, I can practice I can practice mindfulness in many different ways. And. And what's the really coolest thing is the ability, the kind of natural flow of the mindfulness that comes out of meditation into an out of retreat into daily life to be able to to be mindful in daily life. Is really freedom because. As I begin to to to to. As I begin to build, as I begin to to it's more it's actually it's not building it's it's it's taking away. So it's right there, you know, is that stillness that's inside of me becomes more apparent. Through this process, I'm going to be able to. More apparent through this process of removing of letting go. And maybe there's a little bit of removing, but it's not it's not really anything I'm doing, it's just this process of letting go. For me, began with with those twelve steps of that letting go. And I recognized it there. I recognized it. And when I first was working the steps as I let go. And the stillness and I see the stillness. Now becomes apparent, we use the word higher power, you know, as I let go and here's the stillness, the freedom. It's right here, it's right here and and with mindfulness. I can begin to see this mindfulness helps me. Let go and not build and not build and not build and not fill and not solidify inside. So I am able to more fully come come to what is already here to the stillness. But you know. What I've learned as well. That when I. When I try to do things a certain way, when I hear about a practice or a teaching or an instruction. Or mindfulness should look like this or concentration should look like this or. Meta should look like this meta that it should it should look this way, do it this way. So when I think that things have to look a certain way in my practice. I suffer, I suffer, I attach to the practice, I attach to the technique. And what I'm you know what I'm really beginning to learn and it's just it's so great is I'm I'm learning that it doesn't have to look any certain way. We all have our own path. We all have we all have our own karma. And so our path, our practice is going to be it's going to have our own flavor. It's going to be unique to us. Certainly there are guidelines there. I mean, there's there's these amazing teachings that we have and there's these amazing teachers that we have and and there's guidelines. There's suggestions, there's teachings, they're helpful. You know, they keep they they steer us, they can steer us onto the path over and over and over again. When I veer off the path, you know, I've got teachers and I've got I've got. I've got the Dharma, the Dharma books and I've got the information and I've got the instructions on retreat to kind of steer me back on. But but the more I practice, the more the inner trust is there, the more I begin to trust and have confidence in my practice. It does not have to look any certain way. And I have friends who help me with that. We have spiritual friends. I mean, here we are, you know, we're here. Even though we each have our own path, we each have our own karma. We do have a common purpose. We're here to we're here to learn. We're here to learn about the Dharma. I think that's why we're here. I think that's I think that's probably why you're here. I know that's why I'm here. So we have our spiritual friends. We have our we have our teachers. Gil Fronstell is my teacher. I would imagine that that many of you know who Gil is. And he's given me many gifts, but. Really, really, the greatest, the greatest gift he's given me such a blessing is when he's told me. Do your practice, Kathy, you do your practice. I have and when he says to me, you know, I have complete confidence in your practice. I trust your practice. It's such a gift to me to hear to hear that from him and just to to to give me that instruction. Do your practice. It's it's a great gift from my teacher. And I've learned a little bit about Metta. I used to fall asleep. In Metta's sittings, I had so much aversion towards Metta, and I thought it should look a certain way on retreats. I would literally fall asleep. Metta is loving kindness is the is Metta's a Pali word in the English translation is loving kindness. It's it's a practice that's taught. I won't even go into it. Some of you may know it. Many of you may know it. And it's a it's a state of mind that allows for friendliness towards myself and to others to arise. And I just sat the Ajahn Sammato retreat and I loved how he described Metta as as uncritical. It's an uncritical friendliness. So it's not it's it's it's in the word loving kindness. It's not you know, it's not the kind of love that's an attached love. It's it's a kind love. It's an uncritical friendliness. I love I love that way of putting it in. And so, you know, when when the phrases came along and the practice came along, I was like, I just can't do this. I can't do this. And it's not that way for everybody. For some people, do they just, you know, I overflow with Metta right away. What a lovely thing. Not the case for me. And what what I've found is that Metta Metta, when when the stuff starts to clear away, when the habit pattern starts to clear away, or at least I see them. You know, it's like this weeding process to pulling the leaves, pulling the leaves and there's a little more clarity. Well, you know, there it is. It's like if it for me, it's it's it's it's not the case. It's like, for me, it's arisen, it's come in a very natural way, this uncritical friendliness towards myself and to others. That doesn't mean there's not a lot of criticism towards myself and others too, but it's being balanced out with an uncritical friendliness. Yeah, it's really nice. It's really nice, it's really natural. Ajahn Sumedho used another, something else he said, he talked about rearranging the furniture. He said, what we do in our life, what ordinary we do is we continuously rearrange the furniture and then we die. It's like this life of just, rather than clearing out, rather than maybe opening up the boxes, and you may have heard this term, unpacking, this process of meditation, of mindfulness, it's about unpacking. So ordinarily what we do is that we not only rearrange the furniture, we actually get more furniture and shut the windows and shut the doors and cover the boxes and we rearrange the furniture and then we die. And meditation does begin to unclutter the mind and the heart. We can give away the furniture, just let it go, just give it all away. And then in the giving away, there's freedom, there is freedom. Even within suffering, there's freedom. Because suffering is, you know, I'm a human being, here it is, here is suffering, I am a human being and there is suffering. But there's also freedom. And there's just the moments of ordinary freedom. The ordinary freedom, where I'm not grasping onto anything, I'm just being, it's a beautiful thing and I really, I really, I love the ordinary freedom and I savor it, I taste it. It doesn't have to be these deep, deep, deep sublime states while sitting in meditation. It can just be right here and now. We can be free, I can be free. And taste those, taste those moments, those are precious moments, those are important reference points. They're sustaining. A gift of meditation, a gift of practice has been in my relationships with the world. I have a beautiful relationship with my daughter. I teach preschool. I love it. I love my children. They're my teachers. My daughter is my teacher. I have an opportunity to offer them the Dharma in a way that they can hear it. I don't talk about the Dharma to them. I can do that at Spirit Rock, but I can offer it in the way they can hear it, which is really valuable and they give it right back to me. I'm so fortunate to be able to do this. I love it. I love it. So I'm more present in my relationships with the world. I'm more present in my relationships with you, with all of you. That's what the Dharma has given me. I read something today from Pema Shodron. It's from a book called The Places That Scare You. Interrupting our destructive habits and awakening our heart is the work of a lifetime. It is the work of a lifetime. I get to do this now. I get to do this. Interrupting my destructive habits. Doing something different. Making a change. Creating space around those habits. Getting freedom. Beginning to awaken my heart. It's the work of a lifetime. I get to do this. I'm so fortunate. You know, it's not like I just love to tie my shoes these days, but you know, I don't fall into despair. And when the sun comes up and I hear the birds sing, you know, I may have to get up and go to work, but I can look at it positively. I don't want to die. I want that day. I'm okay about stepping into that day. It's the path of wakefulness, the path of waking up. I want to read an instruction from a Zen master. I'll close with this. The breeze at dawn has much to tell. Don't fall back to sleep. Thank you. And if you have any questions, comments, Dharma tips, I'd love to hear them. We'd love to hear them. Hi, I want to thank you for interweaving the two programs. It was especially meaningful to me for very personal reasons, same thing. And I'm really touched by how you were able to take this sort of linear program and kind of weave it into the Dharma and the precepts. And that was really lovely. And I'd like to ruin my poem at the end too. I'd actually like to have you share something that you share with the preschoolers that isn't talking about the Dharma, but that is making the Dharma available. Can you think of some way to share that? Yes. Yes, I can. There's a few things I do. And I think that as I think that teachers, a teacher with the I mean, I have so much respect for teachers in general. So I think part of teaching really is we are we are offering the Dharma all the time. But because I have this practice, you know, I have I have a more of an attention behind it and I or a different attention. I work with kids with the elements. We talk about like I may guide them to a meditation. I don't tell them that that's what we're doing, but I'll ask them to feel their body and to and I sing songs as well. So so we sing songs. I learned at Spirit Rock about about the elements. And then we'll we'll talk about our bones and what our bones are made out of and the bones of the earth. And I'll ask them to feel their bones and they may do it like this. And then I'll say, you know, sit still and feel your bones and and what's your blood made out of and breathe. What's the air? And where's the fire? And and they begin to do it. You know, they fire. They feel the fire is here. And then and then we tie it into emotions that your fire is coming up or or you know how teachers say crisscross applesauce. Well, I say Earth touching Earth and they all go and they they go into the earth. And we talk about, you know, their Earth touching. So so be careful when your Earth is touching their Earth or be careful when you're touching the Earth. So we so we we work with the elements. I teach them a forgiveness practice that, of course, once again, I don't call it a forgiveness practice, but I I have them really look at each other and and and I and I stay with them and we do some counting. I do some counting and and I just they begin to melt as they really see each other and forgiveness really comes. So that's a couple of the ways. Thank you. You're welcome. It's so fun to work with kids because. You know, the layers, there's not as many layers. Hopefully. So they can they can just. They can just melt. So much more easily. It's really lovely. I get a lot out of it. Thank you. I know very little about Buddhism. My daughter brought me here. But could you explain maybe I'm dance, but could you explain a little bit the metaphor of furniture? Yeah, I can try. I can try to explain it. In Aja and Sumeto is in the Thai forest tradition. He's he's who's the one who gave his teaching. He he is the senior abbot who was the first ordained Westerner in the tradition in Thailand many years ago. And he brought it over. He's an American. He brought it over to England. And he's like the beloved senior abbot in this tradition. And. It can be it can be outside of ourselves or inside our inside our minds, inside our minds and our hearts, you know, the outside of ourself of of changing what our life looks like. To to to to distract ourselves from, let's say, what's inside changing what our life looking like, changing conditions, changing locations. It's that that that that enoughness wanting if I only had enough of this constantly rearranging relationships, etc. It can look like that on the outside. And then on the inside. I. I'm sure you know, I'm sure that you have or I don't know, maybe you don't, but but. As we begin to as we begin to wash our mind, we see how the thoughts of. The planning. The organizing in the mind. The referring back to. The fantasies. The emotions, the feelings, how they just spin spin around in our mind all the time. And. And they're very compelling. You know, I mean. I can believe my thoughts, I can believe my thoughts and I can replace one thought with another. You know, this one, this one isn't this one isn't really working, so I'll replace it with this one. I'll replace this wanting with this wanting or maybe maybe I'll replace this wanting something with not wanting this or or the thoughts of not liking someone, you know, the emotions of anger or or or I mean, it's so compelling that the whole world we build inside of our minds. So the renunciation on the outside, the letting go on the outside of things is a huge practice. But man, letting go the renunciation of what's going on in here is like. You know, I does that help at all. So so with mindfulness. Sitting in meditation and using mindfulness, we begin to. See the thoughts coming. The wanting the desires, the not wanting, we begin to see that and we don't run after them and build a whole story around it. It's like we keep our seat, we take our seat and. And just and begin to see them come, come and go. And, you know, that begins with with with. Just sitting still and making that commitment to watching the breath. And of course, when we watch the breath. Before you know it, you know, we're often thought. Over and over and over and over again, because that's the nature of the mind. That's what we do. We think our mind thinks, you know, it's been my mind's been thinking for a lot of years and. And it does not want to let go of those thoughts. So when I see that I'm thinking. I mean, there's many ways you can do it. You know, you can actually say, oh, thinking, thinking. And that's a moment of mindfulness thinking. Or you can just go back to the breath, you know, and I do that over and over and over again. It's a lot of work. You know, there's it's it's a lot of work. This this practice meditations, a lot of work. I find it to be worthwhile work. And it's hard work. It's a it's a wild ride. Yeah. Is it compatible with being a writer or a scientist? I mean, is that just temporary way of relaxing? I mean, let's say you're a writer or you're a scientist. You have to be thinking. Well, this isn't about not thinking. This isn't about not thinking. So, yes, I mean, it's compatible with anything and everything is compatible with being a human being. It's not it's not about not thinking. It's about beginning to see the places where we get caught by our thoughts and where the thoughts lead to reactions. So where I get caught, you know, I have a thought before I know what I'm reacting. Maybe I'm initially reacting with more thoughts, but before you know it, I'm reacting with my body, with my words. So we can learn to to see our thoughts, have more space around our thoughts to see our thoughts. And create a little space between the thinking and the reaction. And it allows for the possibility of reacting or responding with with mindfulness and some healthy, healthy intentions. And to see, we begin to see how we do these certain things over and over and over again. And then it causes us harm, it causes us suffering. I'm sorry, it has to do with emotion, negative emotion. You mean it. I'm sorry. I don't want to bring this to a low level. You know, people here probably experience. I could just stop. Anyone else want to see the microphone? Go ahead. No, I don't. I don't want to. Okay. Does anyone else have any more questions? Okay. You spoke about the 12-step program and Buddhism. And I know that in the 12-step program, they speak about arts and the steps that there's a God. And a lot of people in different ways have obstacles to the perceptions. And I know that the point of the precincts is intoxicants. It's not to take any intoxicants. I take intoxicants every day from coffee to sugar to Coca-Cola to chocolate to, and sometimes it's too much. It just whacks me out, you know. And so I've been trying to get those intoxicants out by not doing them as much. But that's the big one, especially the sweets. But the God thing, I've never had a problem because I've always thought, you know, that any spiritual path is just love and kindness, is the higher vibration of energy. You know, it's just a perception of what the higher energy is. It's a name, nothing more, you know. I've heard it said in these rooms that be very comfortable that Buddha is sitting behind you, you know, things like that. So I never had a problem with it in any perception as far as energy. Ultimately, all the paths lead to the same mountain top. It's just different paths to the same divine thing, which is ultimately love and kindness. It's more compassion, a higher vibration of compassion, understanding, acceptance, serenity, you know, the levels that we reach from investigating the different joys of actually being on the path of any spiritual thing. So it was really nice for you to kind of relate it in a way that's universal. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's nine o'clock. Yes, you do. Well, it's kind of ridiculous for me to say because I don't need to start meditating. But in response to her question, just about like what meditation is and if it's disconnecting from thought. And for me, I feel like when I meditate, it really brings me back to the moment. Whereas when I don't and I let thought like I'm in the past, you know, I'm in the future and I'm making these assumptions that I don't realize I'm making. And it kind of just puts things in perspective and it just makes me like, OK, I'm breathing. I'm in the moment and you know, the world's not ending. Like everyone doesn't hate me. Like I'm just here and it just lets me put perspective on my thoughts and slow down my mind. Yeah, that's great. Thank you. That's great. And I'm reminded, as I listen to you speak of the Bible verse that says, I've not given you a spirit of fear, but of power and love and a strong mind. And I really like those concepts. And this is basically, I think, what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I know I noticed you've mentioned things like the things we cling to, the aversions that we have, the wanting, all of those. Would you say are rooted in a sleepwalking trance of our egos and the sense that our egos are perhaps what the ego seeks its own agenda and that that agenda is not necessarily in the interest of the being within you and that that being is separate from the ego. What I would say to that is, I would say investigate that for yourself. That's what I would say to that. What the wanting is rooted in, the roots of the wanting or the not wanting. There's this endless cycle that is happening. And I think it's important to really look deeply into that, into the wanting and the not wanting. And I think that, you know, I'm reluctant to go into any sort of teaching around that. For one thing, I'm not an expert and also it would take a little while. But I really think that's what this practice is about, is to for you or for me to look deeply into our own wanting. And see those roots, see those roots, see those roots of suffering, see those roots of ego, see those roots of fear, see the arising of self over and over and over again. Would you say awakening, the concept, the thought of awakening, the experience of awakening is... Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I had it close enough. Would you say that the concept of awakening or the thought of awakening, the experience of it is, could be rooted in the breaking free of habitual reactions within the mind? That are built within our ego. I would say that when I have a moment of freedom right here and now, that I have broken free of habitual reaction. Maureen, I mean... And it's lovely, the questions are lovely, I appreciate them. I'm learning from you, but it's also past nine o'clock here. So I'm happy to continue talking and also I know people have to go. Okay. Thank you so much. It's been a pleasure. Thank you.
