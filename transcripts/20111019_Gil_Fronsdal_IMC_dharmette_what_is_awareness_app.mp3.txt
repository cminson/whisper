Dharmette : What Is  Awareness ? 
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

What’s closest to my mind to talk about is awareness. 
Ours  is a tradition of mindfulness , where the emphasis 
is on mindful attention to what’s happening in the 
present moment. Mindfulness is a particular way of 
carefully noticing, cognizing , and perceiving what’s 
happening in the moment. When teachers like me talk 
about mindfulness , we use a variety of seemingly 
synony mous words . One of the se words is ‘awareness. ’ 
You might say , “Be mindful ” in the same breath as , “Be 
aware ” – as if they’re the same thing. You might use the 
word ‘attention. ’ Occasionally , people might even use 
the word ‘conscious ’ in the same way. It seems  like they 
are all the same , but,  in fact , there are distinctions to be 
made between these different words.  
 
The word ‘awareness ’ is often used quite freely, but how 
is that  distinguished from ‘mindfulness ’? What is 
awareness? Bu ddhists who want to refer back to the 
teachings of the Buddha might ask what word the 
Buddha use d in his language  that can be translated as 
‘awareness .’ Or how do we back -translate the word 
‘awareness ’? That’s  a little difficult .  
 We have modern psychologists who are also trying to 
define these things. There are  clinical definitions of what 
mindfulness is. As clinical research gets done , you get 
narrower and narrower definitions of what mindfulness  
is, because the  researchers  have to have narrow the 
definition in order to do clinical trials . Otherwise , how d o 
you know what you’re studying?   
 
Then you have psychologists and brain researchers  
who are trying to figure out, “What in the world  is 
consciousness ?” There  are all these theories , and every 
few years , there is a new theory that tries  to explain 
what consciousness  is. As far as I know  – and I haven’t 
followed the literature  – I don’t think anybody has an 
adequate handle yet on what consciousness is. What 
does it take for a human be ing to be conscious? What is 
consciousness and how does it operate?  
 
One of the interesting things about awareness  – if I’m 
allowed to use this word now without defining it  – is 
sometimes it seems so obvious what awareness is. 
We’re aware, right? You’re all aware of listening to me?  
Some awareness is operating. So , what is that 
awareness you have? If you fo cus on it , and try to 
understand what the awareness  is that allows  you to 
notice what I’m saying, you’ll  tie yourself in knots pretty 
quickly tr ying to define or clarify  what it is. What’s 
operatin g here? But it seems so obvious.  It’s natural to 
be conscious  – but what  is it really to be conscious?   
For most of us , consciousness generally operates pretty 
smoothly. You’re just conscious. You don’t  think about it 
much. We don’t have to orchestrate being conscious. 
When we  get in our car to drive on the freeway , we’re  
not really trying to figure out exactly what 
consciousness is , and how to bring it into operation. It’s 
just there. We’re focusing on other things, like the stop 
sign, speed limit , and the cars in front of us and around 
us. There’s a lot to pay attention to, but you’re not going 
to pay attention to consciousness . Consciousness is 
taken for granted.  
 
For people who  have physiological pro blems with their 
brains , consciousness may not be so obvious. It  actually 
gets pretty co mplicated. The whole act of perceiving 
and understanding the world is not a smooth, 
harmonious operation . Researchers  say that 
consciousness is made up of different elements that 
come into play , and some of  these  elements  – 
physiological and  psychological brain functionings – 
aren’t operating correctly  anymore . How people are 
conscious and what’s going on is not happenin g in a 
way that is smooth and easy , and it can become 
difficult.  When it’s operating smoothly, it’s  very easy to 
see consciousness  as a unitary event : you’re conscious 
or you’re not. When you’re focusing,  consciousness is 
just a  single thing. Consciousness  is consciousness .  
 One of the things that can happen, especially  in 
Buddhist  practice  and medit ation practice, is you can 
begin to feel how malleable awareness and what we 
might call ‘consciousness ’ is – at least in the way that 
we sense, fe el, or experience  it. At some point for 
people who meditate, as we get concentrated, relaxed, 
more open, and settled , there is a sense of the mind.  
You know there are these words that can be 
synonymous with consciousness and awareness. I 
brought in a new word : ‘mind.’ What does he mean 
now? People say that  the mind, consciousness , or 
awareness becomes broad, expansive and  large. The 
Buddha actually talked about one of the things to be 
aware of when you do mindfulness practice is when the 
mind becomes expansive, op en, and big. Especially 
when you have that as a reference point, you can feel 
sometimes how the mind, awareness , or consciousness 
can get contracted. It can get very tight , fixated and 
focused on something. There  can even be a sense of 
darkening of awareness as you get focused and caught 
in a certain kind of thought. And t hen you can relax , and 
feel it get expansive and open again.  
 
With that open, expansive awareness, people have the 
sense sometimes that it’s not limited by the boundaries 
of their body  or their skin. It feels like it’s broader and 
bigger than even  their body. But is it really? Is it like 
radioactivity that radiates out beyond the edges of a 
uranium rock, and just goes on and on? Is awareness like a hot stove where the heat radiates beyond the 
stove? Does awareness  radiate  beyond the body , or is it 
just a way of experiencing when there is no concept of 
boundary?  When we’re relaxed and open, it  can be  
experienced that way. But awareness doesn’t actually 
go beyond. Or does it go beyond?  
 
You can get into all kinds of philosophical puzzles . 
Awareness  doesn’t have to go on beyond somehow  
because I’m aware of the tree over there. So awareness 
has to be at  least as far away as the tree? But what is 
awareness? Is awareness really  as far away as the 
tree? Or is it that the light is bouncing off the tree and 
coming back to  us, and there’s  no awareness going on 
out there ? But it’s  light particles that are comin g into 
here, and the mind reconstruc ts it. As the mind 
reconstructs it , it’s very easy to get a sense that we’re 
not really usually thinking about  the light coming in here. 
We’re just thinking that we’re aware of the tree , and the 
tree is happening within awareness. So , therefore , if it’s 
happening within awareness , the awareness is as big 
as the tree. People  have this cosmic idea that 
awareness encompasses the whole world , and that it’s 
boundless. But is that rea lly kind of an optical illusion?  
Is it really the case that that’s  how it is?  
 
You can have a sense that the awareness is tight and 
constricted. Or awareness  is expansive. It’s possible to 
feel that in your awareness, you’re separated from what you’re paying attention to. You have like a bird ’s-eye 
view. You’re  an observer watching what’s going on. It’s 
possible to have awareness and bring it close in , and 
feel like you’re  really intimate . It’s almost like you’re 
absorbed or collapsed into the experience , and you 
become one with the  experience . There’s no separation. 
People talk about non -duality, and collapsing or sinking 
into it.  
 
In the Vipassana world, a djusting your awareness is 
sometimes talked about. S ometimes you have a broad 
angle lens on your awareness , and you take in the big 
picture . Sometimes you take a close -up lens,  and you 
get really close in. There is something  about awareness 
where  you can adjust it and change the  lens. 
Sometimes you look in a really  refined  way, like with a 
microscope , and sometimes you step back and you 
have this big , broad 360 degree awareness that takes in 
everything  – not the details necessarily  – but really 
broad and expansive . 
 
The Buddha talked about how when the m ind gets 
concentrated, the mind – again , what  is the mind ? – 
gets malleable , meaning it can be shaped and  formed 
like malleable clay. You can’t do anything  with hard 
clay, except break it or ignore it. But , when the clay is 
soft, it’s malleable and plastic . You  can move it and 
shape it. When we’re really  attached , tight, and caught 
up in things, the mind becomes brittle or hard. But , when the mind is soft from concentration, a soft mind is 
malleable  – it can be shaped. And o ne of the things that 
can be shaped and shifted is awareness itself. We can 
make it expansive , and we can make it narrow.  
 
How we experience awareness might have something 
to do w ith the object of awareness , of what awareness 
is aware of . It’s rare to have awareness by itself without 
being aware of something. And the thing we’re aware of 
sometimes shapes how we experience awareness. For 
most people, it’s  hard to be aware without a sense of 
being the one who is aware. So the sense we have of 
who I am as I’m a ware also shapes how we experience 
awareness.  
 
It’s possible that awareness is not a thing, but a 
process. Since  it doesn’t have any shape , weight or 
form, the sense of it is very much influenced or shaped 
by our relationship to it, our concept s of it, or  what’s 
going on around it. Maybe  it morphs and changes.  
 
It’s beautiful when  people have the experience of 
consciousness or awareness being vast, permanent, as 
the background sens e of everything, or the stable 
source  which experiences all the changes in the world. 
This can be  very helpful and supportive. But , it’s also a 
beautiful experience to be able to take awareness and 
narrow it d own, to be focused, and really collapse in to it 
and experience  it. There  are a lot o f beautiful t hings you can do with awareness , which  are valuable , and which 
should be appreciated and respected.  
 
But what is it really? Some people say  it’s permanent ; 
it’s eternal ; it never dies. It feels that way , but is  it 
really? Is the  fact that you feel or experience it that way 
an accurate indication of what’s  really true?  
 
They say sometimes that when  awareness experiences 
emptiness , it somehow begins to feel as if it has some 
of the qualities of emptiness. Emptiness can have a 
quality of being timeless  or eternal . It’s just there. So 
awareness  is like that empty space , but is it? It doesn’t 
make sense to talk about emptiness being etern al. 
Emptiness, what is it?  
 
Awareness – consciousness  – can be malleable . It can 
shift and c hange. What we do with our mind and the 
activities  of our mind can shift and change  how we 
experience awareness and consciousness. We can 
have beliefs and attitudes  in relationship to what 
awareness / consciousness is. Some of those beliefs 
can feel ultimate. But , it’s also possible to watch how 
the mind constructs ideas of ultimate , and how  the mind 
has ideas about and relationships to what we call 
‘consciousness. ’ That’s interesting. It’s important to 
notice when the mind has these constructs  and ideas 
around  all this.  
 My understanding of  the path of mindfulness is that 
we’re fascinated and curious about how all this works. 
We just keep  coming back to be ing mindfu l and we 
notice,  “This  is how it is ; this is what it is. ” We also  get 
more and more subtle noticing  the little movements of 
the mind in all directions, all the activities of the mind, 
and the beliefs  and ideas.  
 
I would say that what awareness is is not that important 
for the purpose of learning how not to cling to any of it.  
What’s important is that we  learn not to cling . That is 
where our refuge is. Also our freedom  – our safety  – is 
found in not clinging . When  we don’t cling , awareness 
can be what it is. We don’t need for it to be any 
particular way. It can be many ways. It can be the way 
that is useful and supportive in different circumstances 
in our life. The less clinging  there is , the quieter the 
range of experiencing awareness and consciousness , 
and the more awareness can stand out as something  
significant and important among  all the different things 
going on  in this life . When we cling , it tends to obscure 
the functioning of awareness or consciousness. With 
less clinging , consciousness stands out  more .  
 
But what is it?  I don’t really know.  
 
So I apologize for taking all thi s time to tell you about 
somethi ng I don’t know. [Laughter] But I do know about 
not clinging. I hope that awareness does not become one more thing to cling to , but rather one more thing to 
not cling to.  
 
Thank you.
