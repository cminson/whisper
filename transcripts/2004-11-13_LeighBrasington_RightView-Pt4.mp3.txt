 So following on that, how do you strike the balance between saying what you mean or pointing to what you see as a problem or a cause of suffering, but then pulling up short of getting entangled in disputes? This path is difficult. This path is not easy. If this path was easy, we'd all gotten enlightened a long time ago. Yeah, this is very tricky. I mean, one of the things to do is to recognize when you're having a conversation with someone about, say, what's going on in Iraq at this point, and point out, yeah, so far the US military has managed to kill 100,000 civilians, most of them women and children. This is producing a great deal of dukkah. Okay? And then just step back and let them be educated, if they're open to being educated. And if they say, no, it couldn't have. You say, this is what I've read in some studies. Okay, but just present the stuff. Don't try and convince the person. Okay? Don't try and refute the other person's stuff. Simply look at yourself as trying to educate, right? Rather than trying to change somebody's mind. Look at yourself as simply, oh, this person could do with a little more information and you're simply providing information rather than trying to get them to come to your viewpoint. Most often people don't change their minds. I've had this view for a long time. I'm not about to change my mind, even if it's wrong. I'll carry this big dung on my head in a rainstorm for hours. Since we spent most of the morning talking about wrong views, I guess it's time to get on to right views. As I mentioned, right view is the first in the eightfold path. And it's interesting that not holding to fixed views is so important and yet also having right view is the first of the eight important things. This is from much of an Akaya number 141, which is the exposition of the truths. And this material actually occurs in quite a number of places. Dig in Akaya 22, some place in this, some Uten Akaya, where the truths are given in some detail, including the eightfold path, which is the fourth noble truth. And what friends is right view? Knowledge of Dukkha, knowledge of the origin of Dukkha, knowledge of the cessation of Dukkha, and knowledge of the way of cessation of Dukkha. This is called right view. Now, interestingly enough, here we have a description of the four noble truths. And we're on the fourth truth, eightfold path, and the first bit of the eightfold path, where we have a description of the four noble truths. The Buddha's teachings are holographic. If you attempt to understand what's going on and take only a linear viewpoint, you will miss some of the most important aspects of the teaching. You will certainly miss some of the depths. So we have this big teaching, and you come down to this little part of the big teaching, and there's the whole big teaching again. It's the Mandelbrot set. And this is right view, the four noble truths. Now, as I mentioned, this is not a cosmological explanation of the world or anything like that. It's basically the viewpoint to take when examining the world. One of the ways that can be quite productive on the spiritual path is to simply go around noticing Dukkha. I give this exercise to people on retreat, and there is some reluctance to take it up. It's like, can't you find something more cheerful? But it's a very powerful practice. Just simply noticing all the unsatisfactory things that you can encounter. Just paying attention. Taking as your viewpoint, how satisfactory or unsatisfactory are the things that I encounter. And then it could be very minor things. Or it could be very major. Someone dies. Also, when you encounter Dukkha, look to see if there's any craving involved. If the origin of Dukkha is craving, and Dukkha has arisen, if the Buddha is right, there must be some craving around. Now, the Buddha said, don't believe things just because I told you so. Investigate for yourself. So, if you're doing the practice of investigating Dukkha, you also need to do the practice of investigating. Is there any craving? Any wanting of things to be different from the way they are. And then, if you do identify some craving, see if you can somehow manage to let go of the craving. Now, this is a tricky bit. I tell you, let go of craving. The Buddha comes and sits here. He tells you, let go of craving. But it's still really, really, really hard to do. But sometimes, sometimes you can actually loosen your grip, back it off, and see what it feels like. So, use this as, again, a viewpoint, a way to investigate. And then, the eightfold path, eight things to do to learn to let go of craving. Eight practices, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. So, this is, this view, this right view is sort of an orientation, and is centered around the four noble truths and the eightfold path. Now, one way of looking at the four noble truths, or at least the first three of the four noble truths, is that they are a summary of some of the most important points of dependent origination. Dependent origination is a more detailed explanation that covers the same material. Sometimes you find it given with nine steps, sometimes ten steps, sometimes a dozen steps. Sometimes you find it with just pieces of it there. I mean, it's quite obvious that it's only covering these four steps of it, things like that. So, we could say that right view is a view that looks at things in terms of dependent origination. We especially could say this if we turn back to Majmanakaya number nine. This particular suta has the title Samadhi, right view. Okay, so the suta on right view. And it starts out, once the blessed one was living at Savati and Jada's Grove on Appendicus Park. And there the Venerable Sariputta addressed the monks as follows. Friends, and friends, bhikkhus, friends they replied, the Venerable Sariputta said this. One of right view, one of right view, it is said, friends, in what way is the noble disciple one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, has arrived at the true Dhamma. Okay, so this tells us some ideas, some hints about what right view would be like. It's straight, and it leads to perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and leads one to the true understanding of the Dhamma. The monks reply, indeed, friend, we would come from far away to learn the Venerable Sariputta, the meaning of this statement. It would be good if the Venerable Sariputta would explain the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, we will remember. Then friends listen and attend closely to what I say. Yes. When friends, a noble disciple understands the wholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome, in this way is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has attained confidence in the Dhamma, and arrived at the true Dhamma. Okay, so the first aspect of right view is the wholesome and the unwholesome. And what is the unwholesome? What is the root of the unwholesome? What is the root of the wholesome? Killing living beings is unwholesome, taking what is not given is unwholesome, misconduct and sensual pleasures is unwholesome, false speech, malicious speech, harsh speech, gossip, idol chatter is unwholesome, ill will is unwholesome, a wrong view is unwholesome. This is called unwholesome. And what is the root of the unwholesome? Greed, hatred and delusion. And what is the wholesome? The opposite, abstaining from killing, etc. And what are the roots of the wholesome? Non-greed, non-hatred, non-dilution, or generosity, love, wisdom. When a noble disciple has thus understood the unwholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust. He abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion. He expatriates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit I am. And by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge, he here and now makes an end of dukkha. In that way too, a noble disciple is one of right view, whose view is straight, whose perfect confidence in the Dhamma has arrived at the true Dhamma. So we have the wholesome and the unwholesome and the root of the wholesome and the unwholesome. To understand basically the precepts and to understand the causes, greed, hatred and delusion, it causes us to break these precepts and to understand their opposites. Saying, good friend, the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the very venerable Sariputta's words. Then they ask him a further question. But friend, might there be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view and has arrived at the true Dhamma? There might be, friends. When friends, a noble disciple understands nutriment, the origin of nutriment, the cessation of nutriment and the way leading to the cessation of nutriment, that way he is one of right view. Now nutriment doesn't really get talked about much in Vipassana circles, but if you read the suttas, you find nutriment showing up a lot. And what is nutriment? What is the origin of nutriment, the cessation, the way leading? There are four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that have already come to be for support of those seeking a new existence. What for? They are physical food, gross or subtle, contact, mental volition and consciousness. These are the food we feed upon, the physical food, like you just did an hour ago. Contact, sense contact. We go out seeking food, we also go out seeking beautiful sights, nice music, good thoughts, etc. We want to think these. They provide sense pleasures, hopefully. That's why we go out and seek them, to get the sense pleasures. So they are our nutriment, this contact, this sense contact. Volition, our intentional actions. We feed on our karmic resultants. I am born of my karma, I live supported by my karma, I will inherit my karma. Whatever I do, whether wholesome or unwholesome, that I will inherit. So our volitional actions are the basis of our karma. The Buddha said, karma I declare, oh monks, is intention. So our intentions generate who we are. And then the last one, consciousness. This is usually spoken of as the consciousness of the being about to be, of being coming into consciousness. When a child is conceived, there is a consciousness that is said to arrive in this being. There has been a lot made of it, and we had a question earlier about the necessity of believing in the reincarnation and all the cosmology and so forth. I think we could also look at consciousness as nutriment, and that, hey, we'd rather be conscious than unconscious. So we seek to be conscious of things, to know what's going on. And with the arising of craving, there is the arising of nutriment. I mean, you might have gone out to eat just because it was time to go out and eat, but you might have also gone out to eat just because you were hungry. You wanted food, so you went and got nutriment. With the cessation of craving, there is the cessation of nutriment. If you're not craving anything, the odds of you going out and seeking something, why bother? And the way? Well, the eightfold path, of course. And then we have the same repeated thing about how if you do this, then you lessen the tendency to great hatred and aversion and can abandon the conceit I am. So the wholesome and the unwholesome and nutriment. Saying, good, is there another way we could look at it? Oh, yes. When friends, the noble disciple understands dukkha, the origin of dukkha is the cessation of dukkha, and the way leading to the cessation of dukkha, and that way, one is of right view, has arrived to the true dhamma. And now we have the standard discussion of the Four Noble Truths in brief. What is dukkha? What is the origin of dukkha? What is the cessation of dukkha? Birth is dukkha, aging is dukkha, sickness is dukkha, death is dukkha, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are dukkha, not to obtain what one wants is dukkha. In short, the five aggregates affected by clinging are dukkha. This is called dukkha. This is the standard definition of dukkha that's given. Birth, old age, sickness, death, pain, grief, sorrow, lamentation, despair. Others say having to associate with the unloved, not getting to associate with the loved, not getting what you want. And then it says curiously, in short, the five aggregates of clinging are dukkha. The five aggregates affected by clinging is another way I've seen it translated. Or basically, the five aggregates that we have a tendency to cling to. We cling to material objects, our bodies. We cling to pleasant vedana. We cling to the absence of unpleasant vedana. We cling to our perceptions. We cling to our thoughts and emotions, views, being some of them. We cling to consciousness. This clinging is dukkha. The origin of dukkha is craving, which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, delights and this and that. That is the craving for sensual pleasures, the craving for being, and the craving for non-being. This is the origin of suffering. The craving which brings renewal of being. Sometimes you translate it, you see it translated as the craving to be, or the craving that leads to becoming. But I think this is probably a little more accurate. The craving which brings the renewal of being. You're sitting around, you're feeling bored, it's like, let's go do something. I'm craving some sensory input to feel alive and then I'll really be. So this is the sort of craving that can lead to dukkha. And then the three types of craving for sense pleasures. We want to see nice sights, hear nice music, think nice thoughts, etc. And craving for bhava and vibhava. Bhava is usually translated as either being or becoming, and vibhava not being or not becoming. Now it's true, one of the strongest cravings that we have is the craving to be. Somebody cut you off on the freeway and you're frightened because they just sort of threatened your being. Well there may be other things involved there, but if somebody does something that looks like you might die as a result of it, you crave for that not to happen. But I think the best way to translate bhava would be more in terms of being and having. I want to be healthy, I want to have a nice job, and then vibhava, craving for not being and not having. I don't want to be sick, I don't want to have that politician doing that thing. These are the types of cravings that go on and lead to dukkha. What is the cessation of dukkha? It is the remainderless fading away and ceasing the giving up, relinquishing, letting go, and rejecting of the same craving. This is the cessation of dukkha. The path, the eightfold path. Now interestingly enough, the four noble truths are laid out in the form of an Ayurvedic medical prescription. The disease, dukkha. The cause of the disease, craving. The prognosis. We get a good prognosis, it's curable. Just stop the craving bit. And then the actual prescription to take down to the drugstore and get filled out. Right? The eight things to do, except you don't take them to the drugstore, you do them all the time on your own. The actual medicine. So the eightfold path is the medicine we take for overcoming the disease of dukkha. And of course when a disciple does this, they overcome great hatred, delusion, stop the conceit, I am becoming light. Good. Is there some other way we can look at this? Well, yes. When Friends, a noble disciple, understands aging and death, the origin of aging and death, the cessation of aging and death, and the path leading to the cessation of aging and death. That also is right for you. And then there's a discussion about what it means to grow old and die. You know, wrinkle skin, hair falling out, teeth falling out, discarding the body, etc. With the arising of birth, there is aging and death. With the cessation of birth, there's the cessation of aging and death. You know what? A die. Quite simple. Don't get born. Don't get born, you don't die. Right? Get born, you die. I mean, this is what the Buddha was set out to find, right? He wanted to know why this old age sickness and death and what to do about it. This is his question. Why do we die? Well, we die because we get born. Well, of course, that only leads to the question why we get born. Saying good, the bhikkhus delighted, and then they said, is there some other way to look at this? And sorry, Puthu says, well, yes. A noble disciple understands birth, the origin, the cessation, the path. And what is birth? You know, entering the womb, getting the senses, etc. And what is the arising of birth? Birth arises with becoming, or being. Actually, the word is bhava, again. Being and having. The cessation of birth, the cessation of being and having, and the eightfold path. And this, of course, is right view. It leads to enlightenment. Good. Is there another way to look at it? You get the picture. It goes on through, the suta goes on through the steps of dependent origination. I'll cover them fairly quickly. Being, bhava, being and having. There are three kinds of being. Sense, sphere being, fine material being and immaterial being. The cosmology at the time of the Buddha was divided into quite a number of realms. I believe around 33, something like that. There are the lower realms, the hell realm, the realm of the hungry ghost, the asuras, the animal realm, the human realm. These are all sense-sphere realms. And then the lower deva realms, which are also sense-sphere. Then there's the fine material realms. These are higher up deva realms. And then the immaterial deva realms. That's one way of looking at this. Another way of looking at it is the realm of the senses. That is, your senses hanging out as you wander down the street, looking in the stores, drive down the freeway, etc. That's the sense-sphere realm. Also, you can practice meditation. And as you get into the first four jhanas, which are known as the fine material jhanas, you enter a different realm. That's a different way of being. And then as you get even more concentrated, you enter the immaterial jhanas. The deeper levels of concentration would take you to yet a different way of being. So another way of looking at these three realms are in terms of your practice. Sort of a gross ordinary level, a really concentrated level, and a super concentrated level. And of course, understanding being in terms of this is a way to further yourself. And the arising of being is due to clinging, which of course is the next way. The origin of clinging, there are four types of clinging. Cling to sensual pleasures, clinging to views, clinging to rites and rituals, clinging to the doctrine of self. So sensual pleasures. The Buddha compared sensual pleasures to being in debt. If you're in debt, you don't quite get to take the day off. Take off a month, don't work. No. You've got to keep paying the debt. You do that, the bank comes, repossesses your car, your house, all the other stuff. You have to keep working. Sensual pleasures are the same way. There is not a sense pleasure that is ultimately satisfying. There is no sunset good enough that when it finishes you go, wow, that was so good. I never need to see a sunset ever again. No, at the end it's like, wow, that was so good. I'm coming back here tomorrow night. Or you hear a piece of music, that was the best piece of music ever. I could go deaf at this point, it would be fine. No, you never think like that. It's like, what else did this composer write? So we're continually seeking this. Clinging to these things. Rites and rituals. Hey, we're cool, we're Westerners. We don't do rites and rituals, right? We let all of that go. But if you look at rites and rituals in terms of habitual habit patterns, we might find ourselves a bit caught up in things that we just have to do. We figure it has to be like that. And if it's not like that, well, we experience dukkha. We're clinging to these habit patterns, and they can be everything from your cup of coffee in the morning to, I don't know, your spiritual practice or your political views. Clean to, whoops, I skipped one. Clean to views themselves. We cling to views. We know how it is. I'm sure everybody here has an opinion about the election. Why it went like it did. Everything from the religious right to it was stolen. We've all got our explanations. Or, this is preordained by God, or this is the way it's supposed to be. We get our views of how it's going to be, and we cling to these views. These can provide a source of suffering, and then cling to self. It feels like there's somebody home. It feels like there's me. I mean, right now it feels like I'm doing the talking. It probably feels to you like you're doing the listening. A little while ago it was you who was eating. This is a side effect of being embodied and having the type of mind that we have. If you go looking in there, everywhere you look, that's not self. But knowing this, and even having practiced it, we still cling to this conceiving of a self. So understanding clinging, understanding how we get caught, is part of right view. And of course the cessation comes about with the cessation of craving. And you do that through the Four Noble Truths. So another way of looking at right view, craving. There are six classes of craving. Craving for forms, that is, sights. Craving for sounds, odors, flavors, textures, and mind objects. So craving via the senses. Now the word craving is a translation of the Pali word tanha, and tanha means thirst. Really wanting it. Wanting it so bad that if you don't get it, you're going to be upset. Often we hear that desire is the problem, but that's not what the Buddha said. It's not desire that leads to dukkha, it's craving that leads to dukkha. If you want something, and you don't get it, and you're not upset because, well, you didn't want it that bad, there's no dukkha. But if you want it so strongly that if you don't get it, you're going to be upset, well, that's craving, and that's dukkha. Now the tricky bit about desire is awful close to craving. It often sort of leaks over into craving. But if you can want something, it'd be totally fine if you don't get it. No big deal. It's not a problem. But if you want it, and it doesn't happen, it doesn't turn out that way, you don't get it, or you get it and you lose it, that's going to lead to dukkha. And that's because you really wanted it. That's the craving. And craving arises because of Vedana. And so understanding craving is right for you. It leads to enlightenment. Vedana is another way of looking at it. And there are three types of Vedana. Pleasant, unpleasant, neutral. And there are six types of Vedana. Vedana that arise dependent on the eye, the ear, the tongue, the nose, textures, and the mind. This sutra mentions just the six types, but other sutas you find the three types mention in the chain of dependent origination. And where does Vedana arrive from? Contact. Contact is another way of looking at right view. The origin of contact, or there are six classes of contact. Contact through the eye sense, the ear sense, etc. The arising of the six fold sense base is the origin of contact. Basically, you got senses, you got them hanging out in the world, there's going to be contact. You might have noticed you were sitting here meditating and there was that sound, whatever it was. The fact that you didn't want to hear it didn't come into play at all, it just showed up. I don't know whether they were working on somebody's tooth, or the street, or whatever, but it came into your ears. You have senses, they're working. Now you closed your eyes, so you could turn that sense off, but you couldn't close your ears and turn it off. And you might have noticed it was a little bit difficult to close your mind. It just kept yammering away there. So we have these six senses, and just having these six senses that are functioning in the world means there's going to be contact. View is also view of the six senses, how they arise, cease, etc. There are these six sense bases, and again it just lists them, and they arise because of namarupa, mind and body, or mentality and materiality. If you have a body, and it had no senses, well, it wouldn't last very long. You'd be in a coma, and if they didn't force feed you, you'd be dead pretty quickly. The senses are actually a necessary survival mechanism. If you have a working body, it just sort of comes with senses. So having a mind and body is just where the senses come from. So understanding materiality is another way of looking at right view. What is materiality? Materiality is... What is mentality and materiality? What is the origin cessation in the way leading to the cessation? Feeling, perception, volition, contact, and attention are called mentality. So we get the four mental aggregates. Sorry, we get three of the four mental aggregates. Feeling, perception, volition, which is a type of mental formation. Contact, which actually occurred earlier in the list, we had contact. Remember, the Buddha's teachings are holographic. Don't expect everything to show up linear. You get to one point, and something you already passed reappears. And attention. Attention might be closely related to consciousness. So we could say that mentality is the four mental aggregates, though in particular it brings out volition, contact, and attention, instead of just simply concoctions and consciousness. The four great elements and the material derived from the four great elements, this is materiality. These together are namarupa. Mind and body. And where do they come from with the arising of consciousness? Consciousness is another way of looking at right view. The origin of consciousness, cessation of consciousness. There are six classes of consciousness based on the six senses. Where does consciousness arise from? Now in some of the recensions of dependent origination, it says that consciousness arises from mind and body. That is that consciousness and mind and body are interdependent. A simile that's given is two sheaves leaning up against each other. Pull away one, the other falls over as well. That they are interdependent. That consciousness depends on mind and body, and mind and body depends on consciousness. This makes sense. You have a mind and body but no consciousness? Not going to function very well. The mind and body fairly quickly ceases unless of course you force feed it. You have consciousness without mind and body. Now wait a second. How do you do that? It's sort of like you've got to have a mind and body around for consciousness to be there. I tend to look at it as like the hardware and the software. The hardware, that's the body. The operating system, that's the mind. In consciousness, that's the programs you're running. You've got to have all of this. They're interdependent. You take away the computer, programs don't run, operating system is useless. You've got a computer, you've got no operating system, you've got nice software. It doesn't work. You've got to have the whole package. The teachings of the interdependence of mind and body and consciousness make sense. In this particular suta it says that consciousness depends on sankaras, the word I'm translating as concoctions. Here it's translated as formations, fabrications is good. I like concoctions. Of course, concoctions are a way of looking at right view. There are three kinds of concoctions, bodily, verbal, and mental concoctions. The things that you do with your body, the things that you say, the words, the sentences, the paragraphs, and then the thoughts you think. These are also concoctions. Where do concoctions arise from? They arise from ignorance. Looking at ignorance is another way of looking at right view. What is ignorance? Not knowing about dukkha, not knowing about the origin of dukkha, not knowing about the cessation of dukkha, not knowing about the path leading to the cessation of dukkha. We're back to holographic again, running into something we found earlier. This is called ignorance with the arising of the taints. This is the arising of ignorance with the cessation of the taints, this is the cessation of ignorance. Now the taints, the Pali word is asava. It's usually translated more literally as outflows, or sometimes you see cankers. Anyhow, the taints are another basis for right view. They are arising and ceasing, etc. And what are the taints? What are the origin of the taints, the cessation of the taints, the way of leading to the cessation of the taints? There are these three taints. The taint of sensual desire, the taint of bhava, being and having, and the taint of ignorance. With the arising of ignorance, there's the arising of the taints, with the ceasing of ignorance, there's the ceasing of the taints. So we had the taints were dependent on ignorance and ignorance is dependent upon the taints. Once again we wind up with the two things supporting each other. The two not so pleasant things supporting each other. When a noble disciple has understood the taints, the origin of the taints, the cessation of the taints, and the way leading to the cessation of the taints, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust, he abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion, he expropriates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit I am. And by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge, he here now makes an end of suffering. In that way too, a noble disciple is one of right view. His view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at the true Dhamma. This is what the Venerable Sariputta said, the bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Venerable Sariputta's words. Okay, so the short explanation of right view is that it's the Four Noble Truths. The long explanation of right view is the wholesome and the unwholesome. The, the, the, the. Nutriment, the Four Noble Truths, the twelve links of dependent origination in so-called reverse order, death, birth, becoming, clinging, craving, Vaidhana, contact, six senses, mind and body, consciousness, concoctions, ignorance, and then the taints. So right view would be basically understanding these and understanding how they come into play, understanding what's going on, seeing their arising, seeing the causes behind their arising, seeing their cessation. We could in a sense say that dependent origination is right view. We could say that understanding the wholesome and the unwholesome, nutriment, and the taints is right view, if we want to look at it in detail. So I'm going to stop at this point and see if there are any questions or comments on these two sutas in their descriptions of right view.
