 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDarma.org. Here we go. Sorry about the no sound. Kind of these gizmos are changing. And... We'll start again. With a warm welcome. Good evening, good evening. Thank you for letting me know that there was no sound. We're all in this together. I think that you can... Yes, okay, good. You can hear now. So to begin our guided meditation... Just to sit and know we're sitting. Feeling the pressure of the chair or cushion against the body. Feeling grounded, connected here. And checking in with the sound. Check it in, you can check it with the sound. Or with the body. Is there a way that the body might feel a little bit more balanced or connected? Or here? Is there a warm-hearted, gentle way in which you can just finish arriving at this moment? And it might be that there are areas in the body that have some tension, some tightness. Can we bring a warm-hearted awareness to those areas? Some caring attention. Whether it's a knee or a back, or maybe just tension in the shoulders or in the eyes or in the jaw. Can we allow it to be there? Can we allow it to be there? So often we have a version to these uncomfortable experiences. Of course we do. Can we explore and experiment? What is it like if we don't have a version to uncomfortable bodily experiences? Can we greet them? Hello? You again? Hello? And bring in that same warm-hearted attention to the sensations of breathing. Feeling the expansion, contraction that goes with inhales and exhales. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And when the mind wanders, again an opportunity for some warm-hearted attention, non-aversion. Just noticing the mind is wandered and begin again with the sensations of breathing. Thank you. Thank you. Is there a way in which we can practice mindfulness with an attitude of warmth and care? Whatever might be arising, can we have an open-heartedness? Jack Kornfield describes mindfulness as loving awareness. Can we practice with loving awareness? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
