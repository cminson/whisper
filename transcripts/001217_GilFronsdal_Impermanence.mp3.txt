 If you have any questions about the instructions or about your experience, the difficulties you have, at the beginning it's nice to give a forum for that if you'd like. Yes? I have two questions actually. One is, what happens if a feeling and a physical sensation... So... I had in mind talk about impermanence today. Impermanence is one of the central teachings of the Buddha. And more importantly than the teachings, it's meant to be one of the central realizations or experiences, insights that come with Buddhist practice. And most cultures, most philosophies and religions have had some mention, some appreciation of impermanence. Here in the West we have the famous statement by Heraclitus that you can't step in the same river twice. Buddhism distinguished itself a little bit in being kind of putting impermanence really at the center of much of its way of life or its understanding, its realization. And we're having a very thorough analysis of it, very thorough understanding of it, of impermanence. Japanese culture, which has been very much influenced by Buddhism, is impregnated with this notion of impermanence. The Japanese psyche is kind of ready to pick it up and see it. And moments notice the morning dew on a dew drop on a piece of grass. It's kind of one of the great symbolic symbols of Japanese culture. Because the morning dew will evaporate as soon as the sun comes out. It's there kind of quite temporarily. And there's a famous, probably the most famous piece of classic Japanese literature. It's kind of like the foundation of Japanese literature. It's with everyone kind of the first thing people memorize or something they read. I don't know what it'd be comfortable to like in English, but it's kind of like them. It begins this way. It's called a hojo-ki. This text was written some 600 years ago. Ceaselessly, the river flows and yet the water is never the same. While in the still pools, the shifting foam gathers and is gone, never staying for a moment. Even so is the human being and human habitation. So this most famous piece of Japanese literature opens with this pointing towards impermanence. Things are constantly shifting. In the Buddhist tradition, there are probably, we can probably distinguish three different levels of understanding impermanence or realizing impermanence. And the first level we can call perhaps the conventional level of impermanence. The second level perhaps we can call the vipassana level, that the insight practice, the practice that we do. And the third level is the level of realization. And the first level is often what people will talk about a lot, the conventional level, the obvious level of impermanence, what we can most commonly see in our life, that life changes. And even if we hear a lot of Dharma talks, a lot of the talks often refer to the conventional aspects of change because of the tremendous, you know, that's what we have to cope off and that's where we're kind of negotiating our life. Birth, sickness, old age and death. As people get older, it's quite common for people to develop a greater, if not appreciation, at least a great, greater sensitivity to the things that are constantly changing, not only in their own body, but in their family and friends and people around them. The AIDS epidemic brought home impermanence in a very dramatic way to many people. I remember some years ago teaching on retreat and a man came on retreat and explained that all his friends had been died for maids and he was the last one left of his great circle of friends. And so there's a lot, you know, in a sense, not to make it trite or we can call this conventional level, the obvious level of change. And there's a lot of wisdom that can arise from facing and confronting and understanding that level of what's obvious in conventional life. And in a sense, meditation practice helps a lot with this. And meditation practice is helping us develop some constancy in the midst of that kind of change or some equanimity in the midst of it. Or to quote a recent presidential inaugural speech, we were supposed to make a change our friend, which was Clinton's statement when he was started as his presidency. And meditation practice is one of the ways to feel find some equanimity, find some peace, find some some acceptance of this world of change. As we sit and sit in the middle of our sit mindfully in the middle of it, of our life, we notice certainly notice a change of our life, but all the things that pass away, all things new things get that arise. But we also notice more importantly, our relationship to that, our reactions to that, the ways in which we resist certain kinds of changes, the ways in which we hold on to certain things because we don't want them to go away, the ways in which we are afraid, the ways in which we get angry, the ways in which we get confused, the ways in which we hold on for security, all these kinds of these are very conventional psychological reactions that people have towards the changing nature of life and how things shift. And as we try to sit and be still and watch the breath and stay present, it's very hard to stay present in the present moment if the mind is fixated on wanting things to be a certain way. As soon as the mind is fixated and wanting to be a certain way, then it kind of, the present moment is constantly flowing, constantly changing. And as soon as the mind wants to fixate on something, either through resistance or holding on or whatever, the present moment is going to leave you behind. It's kind of like you go to, Eric Leithis would go to a river and rather than stepping into it twice, he would try to take a bucket of water and lift the bucket, fill it with water and walk around and say, I have the river here. Look, it's the river in this bucket. And we'd all laugh, right? How silly, the river is, you know, it's kept flowing and it's not in the bucket of water. Or you take a polarized snapshot of your life and you go around looking, showing everyone, this is my life, you know, pointing to that and not noticing that, you know, life is continuing to change. So there's all kinds of ways in which we get fixated and part of the function of, basic function of mindfulness practice is to help unfixate the mind so that the impermanent flow of life doesn't leave you behind or you're not left behind because you're holding on to things. And a lot of psychological insight can come with this level of meditation practice, psychological insight into how we are common patterns of relationship to life. How we, you know, attachment or clinging or fixation takes many different psychological forms, greed, ambition, fear, insecurity, you know, the whole range of things. And so part of mindfulness practice is to really see all these things, to see them. One famous list is the list of the five hindrances, which can be seen as ways of not being settled on impermanence, kind of the mind fixates on things. And the breath is one of the great ways of learning to be comfortable with this flow of change. The breath, even though it's a kind of impermanent phenomena, it comes and goes. It has a constancy, it keeps reoccurring over and over again. And it's a fantastic place to settle the mind and develop a constancy of attention. And so the more constant the mind can be on the breath, paradoxically, the more comfortable we can be with change with the mind can be less and less fixated and more fluid without things go. To have a daily and regular meditation practice that is constant, it becomes a phenomenal aid to helping us see impermanence and be comfortable in it. To sit every day whether you want to or not. To sit every day whether it's a good idea or not. To sit every day whether you can or not. Just to sit every day anyway. And so because then you take it out of the realms of your choice and you have this constant reference, constant place where everything else is changing, shifting and changing, becomes obvious. So having some constancy in your life is very helpful for seeing change. As the mind gets quieter, one of the things we notice in meditation is that when we first sit down to meditate, the mind is like a monkey mind, it's quite busy and active. And that's the last thing, everything in the world is relatively constant compared to how the mind is. And then the slowly there's a shift in meditation where the mind actually becomes stiller and more constant. And then as it does that, then the impermanence of life around it becomes highlighted and becomes clear. So with time the mind becomes stiller and quieter in meditation. And then with that, the mind becomes an instrument for seeing impermanence in a clearer way. So this conventional level of seeing impermanence is where a lot of the common wisdom of human culture concerning impermanence arises out of. And as I said, I think you find a lot of people who give Dharma talks will often give examples at the conventional level of impermanence to inspire us to have a new relationship of understanding. They might talk about being present for a parent as a parent was dying and be really seeing that level of impermanence and tremendous impact that had on them and how it changed very much their relationship to themselves, to life. And it's very transformative to really be able to face and see impermanence at the conventional level. The insight of the Pasana practice goes further than that. Or maybe I shouldn't say further, it's different than that kind of conventional understanding of impermanence, even though it's important. The insight of insight practice is not insight into our psychology, it's not insight into that which is personal in our lives, which we have such a strong bend towards looking at what's personal, what's in it for me or what's my particular, how does it relate to my story or my biography or my self-concept. And people often think of insight as being, oh, that's how that, and now I understand why I do that. This happened to me 10 years ago and now that's just the way I am and I finally see how my psychology works. Those are all important insights. The insight of insight meditation is not the personal insights but refers to the insights which are universal, which are common to everyone and not just unique to any individual, but that's which we all share. And some people, because we have such a very strong personal bend, this is self-preoccupied, might not at first glance have any appreciation or there's any value in recognizing what is universal. But what is universal in a sense is understood to be the underlying basis for the personal. And if you understand the basis for the personal, you have a different relationship to the personal. So the function of insight meditation is to go deeper below the personal into that level of our life which can be said to be, I don't know, impersonal sounds cold maybe, but universal. So at this level we're dropping into what can be called the process level of our life as opposed to the conceptual level of our life. The notion of permanence to a great degree belongs to the world of concept, of conceptualization. We have fixed ideas of how things should be and many of you probably have encountered someone who had a self-image of themselves in a certain way and they were stuck there in that image and it's very easy as an outsider to see, oh you know, you're not that way, you know, you don't have to hold on to that fixed concept of who you are, you're actually constantly changing. Or someone holds you in a fixed idea of you and you did something once and you know maybe you were generous once upon a time and now they're always expecting you to hand out from you because they figured that's who you are, they've locked you in, or once you were angry and now they're always afraid of you because they assume that's who you are. It's very easy to kind of then live in these fixed ideas which are concepts and miss that actually that people and individuals are constantly changing and flowing. There was a psychological study done some years ago of children and they gave two sets of children the same test and I think the test was like multiple choice answers and the first group of kids they said there's one right answer to each of these questions and you have to find it and you'll be graded accordingly and the other group of kids they said there's a number of right answers for each question they were all the same questions save answers the second said there were a number of right answers and so they took a test and taking a test was not the important part of the experiment the important part of the experiment was after the test was over they asked the kids to I think they had maybe pictures or something of different kids some kids who had disabilities some kids who had a normal kind of whatever that is and they had to choose from this group of pictures the kids that they would include on some kind of sports team and the results of the experiment was those kids who had taken the exam where there was one right answer tended to discriminate against the kids who had disabilities when they chose those teams and those kids who had been told there's actually several right answers to the same question they were much more flexible and willing to see maybe people with disabilities had their own strengths and brought something in and they could also be served on those teams. Was that interesting? So we have some other sometimes fixed ideas of how things are and they get in the way of there's some prejudices in certain ways. My son who's three has very few and many depending on the day or the situation of these fixed ideas and some situations are you know quite fluid for him like decorating a Christmas tree. I have certain ideas of what should be right what Christmas decoration is in a tree but he understood that you're having nice things from the tree just so he went into the closet and got a clothes hanger so we now have a clothes hanger from a Christmas tree that's his contribution to the decoration you know I wouldn't have thought that I live in a fixed world and he was quite perturbed this morning coming here because he got out he was here and he's outside with someone watching him and he looked up in the sky and the moon was in the sky and he was quite upset though not upset but he was like you know is is it going to be evening soon you know what's going on here you know because the moon for him comes out at night um so we live often in in the world of fixed ideas fixed concepts and in order to move from the conventional level of understanding and permanence to the unconventional to the insight level we have to drop out somehow drop out of the fixed ideas of how things are and begin discerning or seeing clearly how things are actually experienced prior to the ideas we have about them and um and that's a big training to learn to somehow drop out of our thoughts and concepts of ourselves the world around us how things should be and begin seeing how things actually are in the moment moment experience so for example physical pain when um many people react very strongly when they feel physical pain in their body and but the reaction often happens to the filter of their concepts and ideas um how many times have you had a little ache somewhere and you've thought oh cancer you know I've had that and then um I had recently actually it doesn't happen you know my distant past when I was you know before I practiced I mean happened recently and I thought oh that's a odd thing to happen and it must be cancer so and then we went to the doctor and the doctor said no it's something else and because of the contrast of thinking he had maybe was cancer it was like oh great but if I hadn't had the contrast of thinking it was cancer I would oh it would have been a downer to hear that I had that but oh great anyway so we have these ideas right there there's a pain and so we have this pain and we have this idea of what it might be we latch on and we often then live quite removed in a sense from the pain itself we see it through the filter of our concepts and ideas it's a fixed thing the pain I hate it this is shouldn't be here we have self-pity we have embarrassment we have fear and we kind of hold it in a sense at a distance through all these ideas we have a boy is meaning what what's going to happen it's all that what we train ourselves to do in vipassana is to drop below this convert this conceptual ideas and to feel the pain directly for what it is how it actually is experienced and lo and behold what you'll find if the mind can be constant and held there with a pain is you'll find the pain is shifting all the time and it's not some fixed idea of pain but it's is made up with different kinds of sensations it's very interesting sensations pulling tearing stabbing twisting searing tearing you know just a lot of you know particular sensations that you can identify and if you get really close to it really feel it at the process level of that experience you'll find that the pain is not even constant it's not even standing there fixed as a big kind of glob of pain that's unmoving but if you're really close to it and really feel it directly you'll find that pain is constantly in flux like a dance it might just be in a little square inch of your knee but in that square inch is you actually find it arises and passes and little moves around a little bit in that space and there can be a lot of equanimity when you start seeing it as being a dance it's not so constant it actually arises for a moment then rises another place for a moment even though it's only a millimeter you know distance from the first place it you know changes your relationship to it and there can be a lot of equanimity get really close to it and sometimes it can feel just like vibration and it can lose its characteristic of being painful even though it can be quite intense so the same thing with emotions that can happen at it from a distance our emotions we can latch on to them receive them as being fixed oh my depression oh you know and often we have strong emotional reactions sometimes kind of so-called negative emotions and I think for many of us there can be kind of almost an unconscious tendency to seeing our emotions as being oh this is it you know we wake up one morning we're depressed it's oh you know we kind of respond if i'm going to be depressed forever this is it and we forget that sometimes things change a lot or we latch on to it some various ways we take our emotions as being somehow at least it's fixed for right now for the day or for the hour this is the way it is but if you drop down and actually begin exploring what the actual experience of having that emotion is you can drop out of the ideas the fears the interpretations the clinging the attachments to it the resistance to it the assigning of meaning to it that we have we drop below that to actually experience it very directly immediately how is it experienced you'll see that the emotion itself is like the pain is actually in motion quite a bit emotion means in motion moving out it's in emotions are in motion and and you find for example you get really close to anger and you find if you really get really close to your anger you'll see the anger is experience of certain sensations in the body and those sensations are in flux or changing the closer you get the more you see that's changing and then if you see the changing aspect of emotion if you set it in motion again then it's a little bit harder to have this have these conclusions that arise out of some might arise out of the notion that it's permanent this is the way it is even if it's permanent for the hour or something so the insight practice inside side of of uh the insight level of impermanence the second level we're talking about today it happens and we can drop out of the conceptual level and start seeing our experience much more in the immediacy of how it actually is being experienced it's a big training to do that it's not easy again developing some familiarity and concentration on the breath is very helpful for this because the breath is a process the breath is not a concept and the more you can drop down into the physical experience of breathing the more you're training your mind not to kind of follow the byways and alleyways or whatever of concepts and ideas but rather to let go of that and see things more directly um so the the insight level of impermanence is to start seeing the impermanence of our direct experience and our direct experience is always changing and impermanent it said that the first level of the first time a person really drops down into the insight level of insight meditation is really drops below the concept and starts seeing things as arising and passing um that this is called this level of insight is called tender vipassana because your vipassana practice is actually quite tender vulnerable or unstable but tender i like the word tender vipassana and tender vipassana level of practice lends itself to a whole bunch of dead ends in practice and these dead ends are called the ten i have this great name in english called the ten defilements of insight isn't it great defilements of insight you've been trying hard you know for you know these develop all this insight and there's defilements in your insight the tender and the list is great i haven't memorized them so well but um they include things like um effort mindfulness equanimity resolution clarity light um i mean all kinds of things we kind of think we want even in practice but all those things we end this tender vipassana these kinds of experience can often happen a lot of light a lot of joy a lot of clarity a lot of really strong dedication in practice a lot of clarity of wisdom a lot of clarity of wisdom and understanding can occur and a person can latch on to that that's it now i got it and that attachment and latching on the fixation on those particular states is what makes them a defilements because it's very important as we move into this level of impermanence being able to see the arising and passing of things that we don't latch on to anything it's not like you like you it's like you finally learned how to swim and you go in the water you've been holding on to the side of the swimming pool and finally finally you'll learn you can let go of the swimming pool the edge of the swimming pool and then you latch on to the diving board you know it's kind of like kind of that way to kind of this so the tender vipassana um there's a zen koan i forget the names of the two zen monks and one of them says something like what should i do when i experience the ceaseless arising and passing of things and the other monk responds who's arising and passing is it so he's not telling him what he should do he's kind of asking him to look deeper and saying who's experiencing that arising passing or the zen master dogan who said uh when the 10 000 things arise and pass all at once just give up control give up control give up any notion that there's a self in the midst of that stream of flow of arising and passing often even though when the arising and passing becomes quite pronounced in practice there can still be some attachment to a fixed person as a reference for that i'm the one i'm the one who's experiencing it and we have to soften that also that also softens with time and the the the function the purpose of having these universal insights is not to have universal insights this is often a misunderstanding people will have these great insights that was the universal insights of buddhism and then congratulate themselves and say wow you know i've got it this is it this is so important you know and we latch onto that the purpose of the universal insights in and of themselves are just kind of neutral they're not too many maybe in and of themselves are not valuable it's their role in helping us to let go of our clinging which is important to the fact that the person seeing this level of practice is not as important as the person allows this these insights to massage their clinging to let go of their clinging and and clinging is really the the release of clinging is really at the heart of what the buddha was teaching at in india especially at time of the buddha most indian religions i know about appreciate impermanence this phenomenal role of impermanence in life and are somehow developing their religious philosophies on a foundation of appreciating the impermanent nature of life some of the indian religions um and it also also was a tremendous appreciation that there's a lot of suffering in life and perhaps suffering in life was a little bit more obvious uh back then than it is now maybe not for some of us but some some experiences that are sometimes suffering free today or relatively suffering free were often lethal deadly in ancient india i think you know probably majority of of uh of uh births uh were not painful they were certain they were many of them were deadly for some of the people involved um so suffering was very obvious that some people in ancient india equated in the world of impermanence with the world of suffering so the very simple equation suffering impermanence equals suffering with that kind of simple equation the only solution was somehow to get rid of the world of impermanence to step out of it to leave it behind to um and to find some transcendental level that some place where things are permanent permanent bliss or some place is totally removed from this world of impermanence um and what that meant that was a kind of transcendental approach to practice religion where this world was this world was discounted this world was not seen as a place where realization could occur this world was kind of then very very easily negated for its value so that so a renunciation became for some some of these people renunciation and became very important they're just going to renounce this world my understanding of uh buddhism is they made the equation differently rather than saying impermanence equals suffering they added one more piece to the equation and they said impermanence plus clinging equals suffering and as soon as you add one more piece to the equation you can you can kind of take apart the whole equation by just removing that element of clinging and so the buddhah focused then not on the world of impermanence but rather our psychological relationship the attitude we have to that world as being the place where you can do the spiritual work so you you could be left with a world of impermanence but you but you can be free of suffering by no longer clinging and the insight into the and the insight into the into the into impermanence at the insight level is is to help train us to begin to let go because when we start seeing their direct experience their direct experience is nothing which is fixed and permanent it doesn't make any sense to hold on to anything because it's gone and one of the great you know as this experience of impermanence becomes and becomes stronger in vipassana practice one of the sometimes confusing and kind of um sometimes humorous or experiences is um we put so much effort effort in our practice to be in the present moment present moment is kind of like the god of vipassana and um and then when when your concentration is really strong you realize actually it's impossible to be in the present moment but you can't get to it it's already gone by the time you bring your mindfulness there and you're always like one moment behind and so if you're always one moment off behind the present moment you can't really hold on to the present moment even or anything in the present moment and so you so it could be an experience of kind of going to bring your attention to hold on to something and by the time you get there it's gone it's gonna be very confusing um but in any case so uh slowly kind of it's a training then and beginning to let go and it's a slow training it's the number of kind of classic steps that happens in that kind of um letting go and then finally there's a third level of impermanence which is the level of realization of enlightenment and um and this is not uh it involves more than just seeing the impermanent phenomena of life more than just beginning to loosen the clings we have but it involves the final letting go of maybe not final because these things often come back later but at least for a moment um it's kind of like your your um i don't know what's in the image and making up an example here i don't know if it's a good one but um you finally finally made it to the edge of the pool you're still still still up on the dry ground and you put your foot in and you see oh the water is cool and you whatever it's nice and then you put another foot in and you say well that's you know that's now i know what the water is wet and that's great and then you put your hand down and you feel oh actually the water is constantly flowing by maybe it's not a pool it's a river and um there's a little wave and you feel it's always impermanent this is fine and um and then you realize well now you've really seen the river and now you're not going to have any fixed idea of what the river is anymore you've carried this image in your mind for you've never seen the river before but you carry this image from this snapshot someone took many years ago and you've always had this image of the snapshot of what a river was and so you carry that with you forever and you come to the river and you see actually it's not that way anymore great and you begin letting go of your attachment that the river should be look a certain way and while you're standing there one of the sand banks you're standing on slips away and you'd step back anyway so you realize oh wait a minute the river is constantly changing and then finally comes a day where you jump in the river and then the river just you know then you become the river or you know that's the right technology but you then participate much more fully in the impermanence of the river you're not observing it from the outside but you in a sense become part of what flows in the river and the experience of nibbana is kind of jumping in kind of letting go or falling in though we don't maybe we don't want to call it the river because maybe you don't fall into anything you just simply fall and or say it another way it's letting go of the last clinging we have so there's no clinging at all so in all for all these levels in british practice for all these different levels of impermanence developing a constancy of practice a constancy of mind is really important we appreciate impermanence but we're trying to develop the mind to be constant to build some strength of mind so the mind can hold itself with equanimity in the flow of change hold itself constant and in the flow of change hold itself constant so that no matter what happens you're willing to keep the mind the present come back to the present no matter what happens we train ourselves to can we come back to some feeling of some graciousness about what's going on in the present can we come back to some feeling of equanimity perhaps in our relationship to what's going on can we come back to some relationship of some kind of constancy to the present moment and as we do that i believe what happens is that that the constancy that we discover it becomes less and less at doing and more and not doing so that the mind when the mind gets really still very clear very empty it's very constant because it's empty not because we're trying to do something and hold it in a fixed way so i hope that this talk is an encouragement for you all to develop your constancy without constancy i don't think there's any buddhism and the function of constancy is to so we can be we see more clearly and appreciate more clearly and and and um um so that we can end clinton's presidency as it began by knowing how important it is to make change our friend regardless who's president so those are my thoughts this morning any comments or questions please i don't think so i mean the um i think that uh there certainly can be value and and joy in having photo albums um that you said a truly mindful person would be very attentive that they don't be they don't get attached to those pictures so it's you know it's it's remember it's always it's photo albums plus clinging which is suffering you don't have to get rid of the photo albums you just have to get rid of the clinging now what some people will find is that it's sometimes helpful to get rid of the photo albums because they're so addicted to them so as a temporary measure they might kind of let go of them so they can kind of get beyond that and then after some years they'll come back and you know and and start doing photo albums again but that's a strategy it's nothing nothing to do about the nature of photo albums it's just oh given who what my mind is it's useful to not be involved in photo albums for a while until i kind of develop a bit more mental health yes your tree level i sense there's generally a free flow between conventional and um and the insight but the realization that you jump in the river or lightning always if i go to six in my my quality it's sort of a kind of permanent thing to do you think this is much free flow in and out of the second or third layer and less focus on um i don't know quite how to answer that the um probably yes you know to all of it the um the um once a person has become um as you know jumped into the river they might get up and leave the river again but then they always know that it's possible they always know what the feeling what it's like to be totally wet from head to toe they know what it's like to be floating in the river and so they know that as a possibility and so that's something which they will carry with them but they might go back on shore and they might go back to whatever else they were doing and maybe they weren't changed so so you know so dramatically by that so many of their old habits are still operating but they have some sense they have some physical embodied sense now there's another possibility and and there's a reference point for something how powerful that reference point works in a person's life i think varies a lot from person to person and i don't know all the i don't know why it's very so much from person to person it seems some people it makes little very little impact on their lives and some people it makes a huge impact on their lives um you know so um now is there a flow back and forth between them um i think that depends a lot on on how a person the impact that that kind of experience has on a person and it seems to be variable from person to person um um i've been told by my teachers in berma that there are some people who have the experience of nibbana and not really know it they kind of go and describe something to their teachers and the teachers say you know that's it and oh oh really that didn't seem like much and other people you know who you know it's like the big bang theory of enlightenment you know so it's it's you know we're all we're all individual and very different so it's very important not to have some fixed idea of what how it's supposed to be um so i don't know if that was satisfying answer to your question probably not yes uh yeah well the oh the um the first experience of uh of enlightenment uh you know it doesn't change a lot of the person's attachments unfortunately so uh not only that but some people can actually become worse rather than better because uh conceit for example still operates and so there's more to be conceited about and so you know some people get more arrogant and stuff having had some taste of that so the first experience in and of itself that often doesn't change a person that radically um now um the um maybe it's useful to remember that when the buddha defined or described enlightenment or different stages of enlightenment he did it negatively by what was absent and the absence of something can be permanent right i mean if if uh if you know if you you know lost your arm in an accident and so you were became one armed person uh you know you're not going to get the arm again that's a permanent phenomena the absence of that arm is basically permanent you know it doesn't exactly make sense to refer to it as you know impermanent because impermanence refers to things that exist things which don't exist doesn't make sense to talk about them as being impermanent so things things which are absent are not impermanent there's absent and certain certain certain abstract concepts are also not things and so you know in the abstract democracy is permanent you know it's whatever yeah in the practice of it in details of it you know in actual life maybe democracy is a changing phenomenon so does that respond to your question yeah and also you know the memory of experience is relatively permanent i mean the question is how well do we remember is a big question but um maybe our memory is changeable but you know what you know you know if you go you know if you go and visit something if you go you know if you go if you go to england you've never been to england before and you go to england and then you leave england the fact that you've been to england is a permanent thing you know that's it you know it's no one's going to take that away from you the world of impermanence is not going to take that away from you the actual experience of england is changing because actual experience only was there when you were there and then it stopped but the history of having been there is permanent please or some if it's possible it can be helpful just let go sometimes letting go is a great practice just let go of it if it's possible it's not always so easy to let go the basic practice in mindfulness is not to let go so much as when you find this clinging there is to one of the practices is going to turn your attention very clearly on the clinging and then we investigate the clinging really feel and explore that clinging get to know it the the um the um one of the one of the important principles of the appasna practice is we don't so much go after the not the ideal as we try to study bring our attention to what keeps us from the ideal so if the ideal is not to cling we don't try then to chase after non-clinging we try to really understand our clinging really well and if you're phenomenally familiar with your clinging if you're connoisseur of your clinging you know all the ins and out of it then then you're more you're more likely not to be caught by it and easier to let go of it so you know don't if you find yourself clinging to something don't condemn yourself or criticize yourself for being you know a bad buddhist or something say great there's that clinging i i need to get to know it i need to study it great there it is i get to so that i can become free of it eventually but let's get really get to know it so i think that i have to stop thank you
