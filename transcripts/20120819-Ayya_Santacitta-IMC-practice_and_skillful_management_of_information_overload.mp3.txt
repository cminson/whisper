The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
And thank you so much for inviting me to speak here today.
And I'm originally from Austria so I have a bit of an accent.
I hope you can get used to it soon.
I wanted to speak about, today I wanted to speak about overwhelm, you know,
because we are getting so much information every day,
including what I just was informing about, about the state of the environment,
that, you know, people have, we have a tendency, including myself, you know,
to just kind of turn away from the amount of information we receive every day.
I have heard recently, you know, that the amount of information we receive in a week
equals the amount of information people 200 years ago have received in a lifetime.
So I'm sure you know what I'm speaking about.
You know, the emails and the computer, the iPods and iPads and advertisements.
And there's just so much information coming towards us.
This is very difficult, you know, to keep an open heart and an open mind
because we have to make boundaries because otherwise it's just going to become unmanageable.
We just can't deal with it.
And the mind tends to either, you know, shut down or go into confusion, basically,
not being able to attain to anything.
So it's very important, you know, to get to know yourself and to bat off what you can choose
or to say that you don't take in more than what you can digest.
And for example, this video which will be shown today after my talk,
it's a very inconvenient truth, you know, to really keep one's heart and one's mind open
to this information is not easy.
But if we do have a practice, then, you know, that's a very good beginning.
You know, to get to know yourself, how you are, how your mind and heart, you know,
is habitually dealing with unpleasant information.
You know, information which can be quite scary, really.
And the first thing to do is to really stop and just kind of turn inside
and see, you know, how the body and the mind is habitually going into different patterns
of, you know, protecting the status quo and to really make friends with that
and not put a version on top of it because this is very natural
and it has a necessary function because we need, you know, to protect ourselves from overwhelm.
But then, you know, if we are just getting stuck with our old patterns
and just repeat them again and again, that's also not the right response.
So we need to find a balance by, you know, really recognizing where we are
but at the same time, you know, holding the bigger picture.
And I think meditation is the perfect tool for that.
You know, just to meet ourselves where we are in the present moment
but to keep it in perspective, to keep it in balance.
And, you know, as soon as this sense of struggle arises in the body and in the mind
and I'm sure you know what I mean, you know, when we kind of feel a tightening
or, you know, getting carried away by thinking about the past and about the future
if you just feel, you know, that this is kind of starting to arise
the best way is to just really stop and turn towards it
rather than habitually turning away from it into distraction.
And, you know, this is a lifelong practice
and, you know, if we keep on going with it and if we find, you know, a support
like, for example, you're coming here to this group on a Sunday morning
which is a very wonderful thing to do to give up, you know, a day where you could
maybe, you know, many people probably still lying in bed or doing, you know, things
which are maybe much more exciting than coming here, you know, in this kind of very plain environment
and I'm hearing people speak about turning towards unpleasant information.
So that's, and it's a very good step, you know, to find the support of a group
where there's people like-minded, people who all, you know, have already recognized
that there is work to be done, that if we don't attain to our minds that we will
perpetually, you know, repeat the past again and again.
So we really have to stop and turn towards what's happening right now
and then meet it wherever we are with it and find, you know, like-minded people
where we can get some inspiration and some encouragement
because we can see and we are not alone with this.
There's many, many people who are all in the same boat.
There's only two kinds of people, the ones who know that there is some work to be done
and the ones who don't know yet.
But at one point in time, you know, everybody's going to wake up to that truth.
And, you know, we can, the struggle in the present moment, we can use that very struggle
for, you know, learning. It's like, you know, the burning of the struggle.
At the same time, you know, shines a light because everything which burns makes a light
and this very burning, you know, of the tension of being with what is can illuminate the past for us.
So it's not like anything is going wrong. It's a very natural process.
And, you know, to use whatever is happening, to use it to shine a light on the ways of the body and the mind
and to get to know them intimately.
And that, you know, that very understanding lightens up our lives in the sense that we see much more clearly
and through this, you know, seeing clearly, we also, we put down some unnecessary luggage we carry around.
So it's a lightening up in two ways, seeing more clearly and also becoming lighter.
You know, having more buoyancy and having more resilience to be able to kind of, you know, move with life with whatever is happening.
And, you know, a regular practice is such a wonderful opportunity for cultivating this lightening up.
And, you know, if you drive a car and you get stuck in the mud, if you just, you know, drive it forcefully to extract yourself,
you know, by just pressing on the accelerator, it's just going to go deeper and deeper into it.
What's really needed is to kind of stop and, you know, have some skillful support in order to come out of that.
Because if we force ourselves, that really doesn't help.
So we really have to get to know ourselves and see, you know, what do we need in order to be able to stay open.
And everybody needs slightly different support.
But you only find out if you have enough resilience to look what it is you need.
And then trusting, you know, that if you really connect with that, that you will find the right support to know the next step and the next step and the next step.
And, for example, in looking at this video today at the end of the talk, if you are interested to see that,
this is such a kind of very powerful, how should I say, like a powerful five-minute presentation of, you know, where we are as a human species on this planet right now.
And there are still people, you know, who don't believe that this is really happening.
But I think these people, they get less and less.
More and more people can really, you know, resonate that the situation is very urgent for people to have the courage to stop and look.
And not that we have to immediately now kind of do something about it, but because we might know what is the right thing to do, and that's totally okay.
But if we never stop looking because we're afraid we don't know what to do, then we're never going to know what to do.
So at one point we just have to start, you know, and, you know, to be able to turn towards experience for healing and integration to occur, we need inner strength.
And that inner strength can only come from, you know, getting to know ourselves inwardly very well, you know, how we're reacting to what's happening around us.
And the thing to do that together, you know, in a group is much easier than to just do it by oneself because we can see, you know, that we all are in the same boat with this.
And it's not only the, you know, not only human beings.
There's also like the animals, animal friends and plants and minerals, everything. We are all in the same boat because we all, you know, are completely interconnected.
And we can't really say, you know, where one of us starts and where the other one ends.
I mean, our sense organs give us an impression that we are separate entities, you know, walking around in the world.
But in reality, you know, we are totally interconnected.
And we need each other in order to sustain our lives.
And through meditation, we can get an intuitive understanding of this truth.
Because meditation, you know, it starts with some intellectual instructions, but then, you know, we have, through experience, we have to bring it down into the heart to really kind of digest it and integrate it so that it becomes part of the way how we function.
And that's what wisdom is all about, you know, and the Buddha's understanding of wisdom is that's not like a body of knowledge, you know, depending on how many books you have read or how many sutras you know by heart or, you know, which page number and which book.
That's a good starting point.
But then you have to find that information, how it plays out in your own experience. That's what wisdom is really all about.
And, you know, the most often apparent, you know, entrance into the Dharma is the truth of impermanence.
And I'm sure you've heard about that before many times.
But to really know it deeply for oneself, to really know that completely is one way, you know, how we could express what enlightenment is all about.
To really fully know that everything which is arising is ceasing is one way how we can describe what enlightenment is all about.
So don't, you know, don't take that lightly if somebody says, you know, one of the central truths of Buddhism is impermanence.
I've heard that many times. What's the next thing?
So, you know, to fully understand that is enough, basically, if we can really go very deep with it.
So, it's called one of the three characteristics of life.
It's the first one impermanence.
So it's also a Pali language called Anicha.
And, you know, this truth of impermanence is not only, you know, to be applied on everything outside of ourselves,
but also inside of ourselves, our feelings, thoughts, perceptions, everything, you know, which is arising within this body and mind
and which sometimes, you know, is very difficult to stay steady with because it doesn't feel nice.
And we tend to get carried away by just, you know, turning towards distraction,
not being able to stay with it.
And the word aversion comes from the Latin word, verbto, which means to turn away.
And I'm sure if you pay attention, you can see the whole energetic system of the body.
If something comes in, so we don't want to know a person comes, we, you know, we don't want to deal with.
We can really feel that the whole system is just kind of turning, wanting to, you know, deal with something else,
something more nice, something more easy to be with.
And there's nothing wrong with that, but it's good to know it so that we can develop, you know, a choice, what we want to do with our lives.
And, you know, and so getting to know these different patterns, how we are built.
To getting to really deeply, getting to know that.
That is a way of how we can express what it means, you know, to become mature, to grow up.
To, you know, to grow out the toys of distraction, one after the other, slowly but surely.
Like a little child, you know, which maybe like when they grow up, at one point they are not interested in certain toys anymore,
because those toys are not a bad or anything, but because they just have lost interest, because they've seen a bit further.
And there is no more value for them in this, in the old distractions.
And I think this is, we know what the Buddha, in his teaching, what's called a true renunciation.
A renunciation which comes not from forcing ourselves, but which comes from wisdom.
Because we have seen deep enough and, you know, certain fascination with certain things just drops away naturally.
Sometimes it's also called like disenchantment.
And then, you know, we have more space in our lives to attend to things which really matter, rather than distracting ourselves.
And, you know, according to the teaching, there are three levels of this true renunciation.
Which comes from, you know, really understanding what matters and feeling really an urge to give up that which doesn't really matter enough.
So that we have more, you know, more space for making the right choices.
And the first level of that true renunciation is, you know, to become interested to live according to what's called in the Buddha's teaching the five precepts.
And they're just like basic guidelines for saying living.
They are all based on, you know, not harming oneself or harming others.
And, you know, to really understand that this is not only, you know, like, we are not only doing that in order not to harm other people,
but it's also actually how we protect ourselves from harm.
And from remorse, you know, and from feeling heavy about the way how we live.
So that's, we can call that ethics and in a party language is called sila. And they are, you know, considered those five precepts.
They are considered basis for meditation to be able to develop well.
Because the mind, you know, which is protected by the five precepts is a mind which can find peace in the meditation.
And then the second level would be, you know, to start to determine and find out, you know, where we do,
leak out a lot of energy in terms of, you know, wasting it by doing all kinds of things which we don't really need to do.
And where we, you know, distract ourselves with endless watching, different things, you know, being kind of addicted to certain ways of not being fully here with what's happening.
And I'm sure, you know, all of us have several of those toys in our lives. I have it too.
And sometimes, you know, I allow myself to just let it go on for some time, but sometimes I don't allow myself.
And it depends on just what's needed in the present moment to just find the right balance.
And the last level, you know, after, you know, living a life of harmlessness and trying, you know, to not leak out too much of our precious energy
by, you know, kind of making decisions how much we really want to distract ourselves.
And then the third level would be, you know, to recognize how we identify with whatever is happening, how we identify with our thoughts about it,
how we get constantly drawn into identification with, you know, with past ways of experiencing things which we are projecting onto the present moment.
And just, you know, develop that awareness, that mindfulness which kind of takes that as a wake-up call to say, you know, we are not really sure if this is going to be this way or that way
and to keep the mind open, you know, keep the mind open in the sense of something new can come into our lives, something which can help us to find more space around our experience.
You know, to just see a possibility to react in a different way.
And basically, you know, not turning away from what we experience in the present moment and trusting that if we stay with that not knowing, you know, instead of re-enacting the past,
we just have the courage to just stay open, to not know what's going to happen next and allowing, you know, something new to come through from the depths of our being.
In the depths of our being, we are connected with this very vast web of life and that has an intelligence which is much far beyond, you know, the intellectual capacities we have as a single, you know, little person
to just allow ourselves to tap into this much vast intelligence which has always known what to do, you know, since the Big Bang 14 billion years ago.
So, you know, we don't have to sort it all out with the sinking man. We need to use the sinking man, but it's not the only way which we can access in order to respond, you know, to what is happening.
We need to balance that out with something much bigger and for that, you know, we have to be able to stop and we have to be able to make space for this much bigger intelligence, you know, to come through so we can act in ways which are
you know, which are up to the task.
You know, and this great intelligence, if you believe in the Big Bang has happened maybe about 14 billion years ago, since then, you know, so much has happened and nobody has been directing all of this.
But to really recognize, you know, that we are part of this huge unfolding and we can, you know, we can get lost in habitual ways of thinking that we are just like, you know, little separate entities walking around in a hostile universe
and we have to just protect everything, otherwise we're going to run into one problem after the other or we can just recognize that we are part of this huge unfolding of this vast web of life which has, you know, developed from a
mass of lava or whatever into iPods and Mozart, Sonatas and many other amazing things and most beautiful fish and most amazing giraffes or all of those amazing animals which are sharing this planet with us.
And that the situation we are in now, that this is actually just another huge challenge which, you know, which we can use for a new flowering and we can all be, you know, we all can all be part of this flowering.
And in order to be able, you know, to know how to embody it, we have to make space for this information to come through and that means, you know, we have to recognize that we repeat the past again and again in a habitual way.
And the meditation is the perfect technology to help us, you know, to see what's happening and not in a way, you know, to put ourselves down or force ourselves to be different, nothing of that.
To just see what we are doing because once you see it clear enough, it just starts to unravel.
The problem is that we don't see it clear enough yet.
And therefore we need teachings and we need support and we need to come together and do this together and encourage each other that it can be done because there have been many going this past before us so everybody can do it.
The Buddha also was just, he was a human being who had a lot of courage and he put in a lot of effort in his practice.
But also, you know, all of us, if you want to learn any skill, playing the piano or driving a car or any profession or whatever, you have to put in some time, you have to put in some effort.
Otherwise you're not going to learn it and meditation is the same thing. You have to put in the time and the effort.
It's not going to just come to you if you do it, you know, once a week here. Even that's wonderful, but you have to do it more often than just once a week.
And then you just start, you know, with what you can manage. Maybe you can manage 20 minutes.
It's a very good way to start with 20 minutes.
And recognize that this is really a lifetime's practice and that we are part of this vast web of life.
And we are doing this not just for ourselves, we're doing that for the whole.
Because we are part of the whole. We are not separate.
And to just really, you know, go into the depths of the experience and really see that appearances are one part of the human life, you know.
The appearances of people and houses and cars and flowers and all of that. That's one side of the coin.
But then there is on the other side of the coin, this is a vast network. This is an amazing, mysterious process.
And we have to hold it both in balance, you know, not getting carried away by the appearances.
And for example, if you watch that video afterwards, you could just get carried away into complete despair.
Because you think, ah, it's all too late. You know, there's nothing I can do.
I'm just going to indulge in entertainment and just make the best out of those few years I have left and then I die.
That's one way how you can, but I don't suggest that.
Because that would be a waste of this opportunity, you know, of being born as a human being,
it's a very great opportunity according to the Buddha.
And also, you know, you wouldn't have good influence on the people around you.
So taking this as a really, as an opportunity for practice and as an opportunity to, you know, to make your life as an offering for your own benefit and for the benefit of the whole.
Because if you approach it from that angle, you know, then everything starts to change.
There's no more obstacles there. There's only opportunities.
And I know, I mean, it sounds a little bit, you know, sometimes it's very difficult to hear this and really open your heart for that.
I have that experience myself too, but it is just part of the learning.
And it's basically, you know, it's basically a redirecting of that longing, you know, to arrive somewhere, which we all share.
You know, always wanting to arrive at some kind of, some place to rest and some place to stand on, you know, somewhere where there's peace.
But we can't arrive there, you know, by distracting ourselves.
We can only arrive there by really turning towards all of those things, you know, which we feel they're interrupting our peace.
Because, you know, what peace is really all about, it doesn't mean that everything, that the river of life is just stopping and freezing.
And you have just, there's nothing happening anymore. That's not what peace is all about.
But it's much more about understanding the bigger picture, you know, and understanding this truth of impermanence,
which is just like one of the fundamental laws of being born in this world.
We have to embrace it and we have to open up to it and let it show us the way how to live in peace.
Whenever the sense of struggle comes up, it's like, you know, a wake-up call.
Whenever there's a sense of struggle, then there's a resistance there.
And you just notice that.
And notice it, you know, with wisdom and compassion, because it is very normal, you know, that systems, you know, shy away from unpleasant, from irritation.
Even, you know, the smallest little microbes, so you can investigate in a petri dish, if you poke it, it's going to try to escape.
This is just part and parcel of how we are made, but we can know it.
And then we can really deeply get to know it, and it's going to transform.
And this is, you know, a short way how we can describe what wisdom is all about. It's not being afraid of impermanence,
not being afraid of forms, you know, not being afraid of feelings, and not being afraid of perceptions.
And training ourselves to not turn away from what life is, is coming up with for us.
And meditation is the perfect tool to develop that strength.
And, you know, I'd like to give an opportunity for questions, maybe for 10, 15 minutes, and like to end with a quote by His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
And he says, you know, if there's a situation in your life where there's nothing you can do about it, he says, no reason to worry, because there's nothing you can do.
And if there is something you can do about it, then there's no reason to worry, because then just go and do it.
So I just found it a very sweet way, you know, of saying what I tried to say in the last 40 minutes.
And I myself, I'm also not able to do it all the time, but I think I know it to quite some extent, meanwhile.
And that's how it starts, you know, to just know where you are at and then take it from there.
Do you have a microphone if there's anybody have any questions?
You mentioned the microbe in the Petri dish responding to stimulus.
Does that mean that the microbe has a consciousness?
Yeah, I would think so, yeah. A rudimentary consciousness, yes.
Thank you.
Thank you for your talk. Could you say a little bit more about the difference between what we do to distract ourselves and what we would call an interest or fun?
I think it's the intention, you know, with what you bring to anything you are doing.
One knows oneself and you can do one and the same thing and at one point it can be an interest or something you do together with others for fun.
And then another day it can be a distraction, it depends, you know, why you're doing it.
I would think.
I notice it, for example, when I'm reading sometimes, you know, sometimes I read something out of interest because I want to learn something, I want to understand something better.
And another time I read something because I'd like to just escape, you know, somewhere in another world for some time, which is okay too, but it's not about, you know, that there's no judgment in it, but it's more like just knowing what you're doing, you know.
Mm-hmm.
So sometimes when I'm that person you described and I'm feeling discouraged because there is so much to do and I'm capable of only doing very little,
then I have to, I guess I have to choose because I can't do everything.
But I must confess to feeling that wondering sometimes the state of the planet and its obvious disintegration if this is not a manifestation of impermanence.
Yeah, it is also, sure.
But, you know, it has always been impermanent anyway, but it depends on which direction it's going, isn't it, and what kind of an input we have as human beings, you know, we can either have a supportive and benevolent input,
or we can have, you know, go at it in a way which can be exploitative and having the impact it does have, you know, by dominating, you know, the resources of the planet
and using them in a way where there's just a small amount of people using a lot of resources without consideration, you know, for other forms of life and other people.
That's what I mean.
Well, I think I understand how I personally don't have to contribute to the deterioration of the planet.
I guess my question is more around how hard do you fight?
I think it depends, you know, on how far you want to go with it, you know.
But definitely you're never going to fight, I think, in a way where you add to the negativity of it, isn't it?
But just seeing what you can do in your personal life and that everybody has to find for themselves, you know.
Like I was saying before, where I feel the best way is to really go inside yourself and find that space so that the next step for you will become clear.
What is the next step for you, what you can do?
And for me, what I can do.
And then just, you know, do that.
And not expecting that you're going to kind of have it all laid out in front of you very clearly, you know.
I just know the next step and the next step, like when you're driving the fog, you know.
You just know a few, maybe one or two meters in front of you, you know, and then you do that.
And then you do the next thing and the next thing.
And this can be very difficult because we would always like to know the whole thing and will it end, you know, will the story end happily ever after?
Then I'm happy to do it, but if I don't know, it's much more difficult.
And just to know that too, that's part of being a human being.
We want everything to be wonderful, you know.
I mean, I want that too.
But then, you know, knowing what you want and knowing that you can't know and then just letting it go.
Yeah.
This is what I mean, you know, to meet the situation with healing and transformation.
You need that inner strength for it.
You know, it's not going to be served to you on a platter, the whole thing.
And then you know exactly what to do and you have the guaranteed outcome.
That's not part and parcel of the human experience.
It never has been, you know.
Only the challenges which we are facing now hasn't happened, you know, before as far as we know, hasn't happened for a very long time.
But it's a great opportunity for applying, you know, what we have learned from the Buddha.
And even, you know, now this is a much bigger incentive than it ever was.
Because now we really don't know on a very big scale.
So it forces us almost, you know, into cultivating that strength.
There's many people, you know, who think it is actually a very golden opportunity, you know, for consciousness to make a leap,
which it wouldn't do under circumstances if they wouldn't be so pressing.
So maybe then I ring the bell and you can set it up for the video.
