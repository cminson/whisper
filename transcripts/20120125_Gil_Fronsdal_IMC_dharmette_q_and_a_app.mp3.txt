Dharmette: Q&A 
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by 
Gil Fronsdal on January 25, 2012  
 
 
Rather than giving a talk this morning, I’d like to 
see if there are any questions or topics you 
would like to raise , and  I will try to answer, 
respond, discuss.  
 
Question er 1: Do you have any suggestions for 
mindfulness in the context of a difficult marital 
relationship? I’m seeing it as a huge opportunit y, 
but it’s very challenging.  
 
Gil: Maybe you need to divide up t he marital 
circumstance into  smaller pieces. What are the 
different areas of your marital life, your family 
life, that could use different kinds of attention?  
 
For example, how are you personally with your 
emotions and feelings? How are you caring for 
yourse lf in it? Do you have friends to talk to? Do 
you meditate in a way that helps you to settle? 
Do you have some way of tracking yourself 
well? Do you go underneath the surface of your usual thoughts to see what y our intentions  and 
values are? So, do you have  the personal side 
taken care of the best you can?  
 
Then the other side is to ask if  you understand 
your partner well enough? Have you taken the 
time to really understand or dig deeper into this 
other person to see the ir beliefs, emotions, 
needs and values?  
 
Sometimes people in the middle of a marital 
conflict or interpersonal conflict c an’t see beyond 
the conflict itself. They keep bouncing off the 
conflict. There may be more going on here. Step 
back to better understand , not only yourself , but 
also the other person. Sometimes the more 
dramatic the conflict is, the more important it is 
to understand the other person. Often that is 
what people don’t do.  
 
Then there is the area of the communication 
between the two of you. Independent of the 
conflict, w hat is the nature of the your 
communication ?  
 
What is the nature of your relationship? W hat is 
its history? Why have you come together? What 
do you find valuable in the relationship? What do you find difficult? Independent of the conflict, 
understand the nature of the relationship. There 
are people who find themselves in conflict, but 
then th ey step back and see that the conflict 
makes sense because years ago they made a 
choice , and now it is playing out. They have to 
take some responsibility.  
 
Then how do you communicate? Do you have 
open communication? How do you communicate 
around the conf lict you are in now? Do you have 
any ground rules for how to talk? If there aren’t 
any, maybe it’s time to set some.  
 
In terms of mindfulness  practice , I think of 
mindfulness as honesty out loud. Is there a way 
to practice mindfulness out loud that is not  
offensive? Not attacking anyone , but just saying, 
“This is what I am feeling. I’m afraid. I’m angry.”  
 
Does the other person listen? Do you have any 
hope of having a conversation? If not, if you 
don’t feel that the two of you can have a 
productive conver sation around your conflict, 
then sometimes you need to get help. Marital 
counseling is often recommended. Get a third 
party in the room to bring more safety and 
stability into the conversation.   
That is my attempt to try to divide up the pie. All 
of these aspects of the marital pie need to be 
addressed and looked at. And then you bring 
mindfulness to it. You bring your attention and 
care and focus. You try to have some non -
reactive attention to what is going on in the se 
different areas , so that you can learn from them .  
 
And then, in terms of your practice, what do you 
see as the opportunity for your practice in 
addressing this? Is this an opportunity for you , or 
is it just an unrelenting drag that you wish you 
didn’t have? This is what occurs to me now . Do 
you want to ask something further?  
 
Questioner 1 : The biggest piece of the pie for 
me now is how to be compassionate. I feel that I 
understand a lot of wha t is going on for him , but 
I find myself responding in a way that is angry or 
frustrated , and I have to deal with it. There ’s a 
large historical wound that is two gen erations  
old. He may have chosen it , but we are dealing 
with it because it comes up in our relationship. 
Can I bring compassion to that instead of 
frustration?  
 
Gil: That’s beautiful. I support that. When I hear someone like you talking about this, what I hear 
is separation. He has the probl em, two 
generations of this problem. “And I am angry 
with him for this problem , but I’ll try to have 
compassion for his problem.” Yes, compassion 
is useful. Maybe that’s a growing edge for you to 
have that, but I hear the separation and wonder 
what is being left out. My bias would be to say 
that it’s not him.  
 
Once you marry someone , then in a close 
committed relationship, you are a system. You 
are in the system together. You chose him. 
Something about you as well got involved here. 
The fact that you are with someone who has two 
generations of family problems is not an 
accident. I th ink it is useful not to see it as an 
accident. What is it about you?  
 
When you spoke about having compassion for 
him, what  popped up in my mind  was, “What 
about compassion for yourself? ” Not just in the 
abstract, but , “What is it in you that needs 
compass ion?” 
 
Hopefully this gives you something useful to 
think about or explore. And if it’s not useful, then 
leave it here.   
 
Questioner 2 : Do you have a choice about 
when you are going to be together with some 
people that you were once connected to, like 
family people, but you don’t want to be so 
connected to them anymore?  
 
Gil: I think the question is, “Do you have a 
choice to pick and choose some people? And 
sometimes is it appropriate to make the decision 
to not be connected with them anymore?” The 
generic  answer is yes, sometimes it is 
appropriate to choose. I say ‘generic ’ because I 
don’t have enough of the details. There are so 
many different kinds of circumstances.  
 
If I went to someone and said, “There’s 
someone in my family that I don’t want to deal 
with for a  while. I think I’d like maybe six months 
to a year break to fi nd myself , because it’s so 
difficult.” Then you might say, “Oh, poor Gil, he 
probably should do that.” But then you hear that 
it’s my two kids. I don’t have a choice if it’s my 
kids. I’m committed ,and it would be very 
damaging to them if I took off for si x months.  
 
But I have distant cousins I hardly ever talk to. If one of them were a really difficult relationship for 
me, because they were  always angry and in 
confli ct, and every time I went to see them , there 
was always a lot of anger going on  and I’m worn 
down , then I might say that I need to take a 
break from this person until I can regain some 
strength and stability in myself. I am not 
obligated to spend time with them  just because 
they are  my cousin. Pulling back might be 
useful. And there may be friends like that as 
well. 
 
One criterion is to ask , “Is useful or helpful to be 
involved with this person ? Or is it unhelpful and 
damaging? ” And then you find your way. 
Hopefully , behind every decision like this is a lot 
of care and compassio n for everybody 
concerned. I’ve known people to make these 
decisions in a selfish way, just for their own  
sake , without any care for the other person. 
Then there are people who never think about 
themselves , but only about the other person. 
That is damaging too. It’s good to cons ider 
everyone in the picture in deciding  how to act 
wisely.  
 
For some people , it might be the wisest thing to 
say, “This is not working for me. I am having trouble. I have my own issues. I need to take a 
break from certain kinds of relati onships. Don’t 
take it personally.” Maybe that discussion can 
happen, if it’s a good friend  willing to have such 
a conversation .  
 
There are so many interpersonal dynamics that 
come into play. Part of the role of mindfulness 
practice and  mindfulness medita tion is  to help us 
in a few ways. We want to get settled and calm , 
so that when we are exploring we are not  doing 
it with an agitated mind that can’t see clearly. 
Another way is to help us to be mindful of what 
our intentions are. What are the beliefs and 
values that inform how we make the decision? 
It’s amazing how we can spend days and weeks 
of our lives and never see what lies underneath, 
what drives us. Mindfulness can help us settle 
enough to see the underlying issues in order to 
make wiser decisions.
