 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello, everyone. Welcome. Welcome to our sitting, practicing together. I invite you to all arrive here. This is I'm having right now. It's as if we're all settling into a quiet meditation hall. Maybe a little bit of a gentleness and care is offered. As we settle in, arriving here gently, softly, not joking ourselves around, not forcing anything to happen. Quietly settling in into a sitting posture, or whatever the posture you're taking for this next 45 minutes or so. Arriving may be a process for most of us. Take some moments to arrive. Allow the body really sit down. Maybe with some intentionality. Being deliberate, taking a sitting posture. Now we're making ourselves available to however the body is sitting. Making contact with the floor, the chairs. When the arrival becomes full, maybe we also feel the support of the ground. Landing here and now, present experience. And our awareness is already here, knowing that we're here in this body, this mind. Receiving sound. Sensations in the body. Fleeting thoughts. Maybe repuls of emotions. We are available to this. Not wishing something else to happen. Being pulled by our preferences. From a stable ground, we align. Allowing our body, heart and mind with our aspirations, values, integrity, and virtue in our virtue. We align with a wholesome, skillful, and beneficial to ourselves and others. And sometimes the alignment is felt as some kind of ease in the body, maybe in the heart. Her heart is unburdened. Whenever you're ready, open your awareness to receive the felt sense of Earth element. The hardness of the bones. Weight settling down. The strength holding this body up. The bones holding this body up. Maybe a hint of the stone is coming. Along with the Earth element. Relatively speaking, unmoving. Relatively speaking, not totally unmoving. Allowing this earthy body resting on Earth. With the steadiness and stillness of the Earth element. Maybe you already are aware of the Earth element. Movements of the breath. There is a stillness in the Earth element. There is a movement in the air element. Still moving body. Water element may avail itself. Feeling into the water element. Moisture in the mouth. Maybe you feel some sense of fluidity inside of the body. More than 70% of our body is water. The water element may settle along with the Earth element. Maybe a sense of sitting in the still pond of water. Maybe waves and ripples on the surface. Thoughts, emotions. Yet they can be held by stillness. Quiet. Silence. Silence. Letting go of any momentum, trying to figure it out. Matching some ideas we may have in our head. Let the body speaks for itself. We are available to the felt sense of the body however it manifests itself. Now if you wish, maybe you can follow along. Becoming available to the fire element in the body. Maybe there is some warmth in your palm. Coolness in some part of the skin in the body. Warmth of the outer breath. Maybe coolness as you breathe in. This body experiences different temperatures. You may even feel some heat in the belly or the chest. The coolness of the face, the skin of the face. Certain emotions may have an embodied fire element. The coolness of the body, the calmness of the body. The coolness of the body. Without trying to push them away or wishing them to go away, you're resting in the knowing of the fire element. Embodied experience just as is being kind and truthful to this experience. Now here we make our awareness wide open. Receiving whatever is available to us. So watchSome of the videos Dodged, Thank you. Thank you. Whatever arises and passes away... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Where the movement of the air element is obvious... Where the heat, where the coolness is clear... However it is, receiving, receiving the blessing of this life. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
