So we're going to start with a guided meditation and I've been exploring the last few weeks about the Satiputana Sutta, the Sutta on Wise Mindfulness, Right Mindfulness. 
And last week I talked about mindfulness of breathing and the Sutta section that talks about mindfulness of breathing. 
And within that it talks about breathing with attention, experiencing the whole body. 
And so I thought I would do a guided meditation that kind of points to that possibility. 
The Sutta has four kind of steps. 
I'm just going to read the steps and read the section of the Sutta. 
And then you might, you don't have to try to track this, but you might notice during the guided meditation that we'll be kind of going through this. 
And how does one abide, contemplating the body as a body? One, gone to the forest or the root of a tree or an empty hut sits down, breathing folded the legs crosswise, set the body erect and establish mindfulness in front. 
Ever mindful one breathes in, ever mindful one breathes out. 
Breathing in long, one understands. 
I breathe in long. 
Or breathing out long, one understands. 
I breathe out long. 
Breathing in short, one understands. 
I breathe in short. 
Breathing out short, one understands. 
I breathe out short. 
When trained when felt, I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body. 
One VMS this, I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body. 
Oneucking in tranquilizing the bodily formation. 
One trains this, I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation. 
So that's what the words in the sutta say, a couple points or pieces to note. 
The first part, the Buddha is just simply talking about aware, breathing in, long or short, being aware of that. 
And then, I tried setting mute upon entry but it didn't seem to work. 
So I would like those of you to mute if you can. 
I'm not seeing a possibility of my muting Kathleen. 
So if you could mute Kathleen, that would be helpful. 
So the first part of the sutta talks about just establishing being aware while breathing. 
And then it says one trains to experience the whole body while breathing. 
That's the part we'll explore in the guided meditation. 
Tanasarabhiku is a teacher I learned this particular style or technique of whole body breathing from. 
And he uses the translation for this word experiencing. 
He uses the translation one breathes in sensitive to the whole body. 
One breathes out sensitive to the whole body. 
And for me, that's a helpful word that it sensitive has a quality more of receptivity while experiencing may have a little bit more of a sense of I'm doing looking for something. 
I guess that's me but the word sensitive was helpful. 
So we'll begin with relaxation because relaxation is a really supportive condition for concentration. 
When the body is relaxed, the mind tends to follow and be a little more spacious and relaxed. 
And as the mind is relaxed, it's very natural and useful, more natural and useful to connect just with what's happening in the present moment and then to receive, to be aware of the breathing. 
So we'll start with a little bit of a scan through the body, allowing the attention to rest and connect with the sensations in the head and face, and seeing if there can be relaxation, a softening around the head and face, the muscles of the head and face. 
Relaxing the neck, tending to the experience of the neck and shoulders and seeing it back and soften and ease, have some ease there. 
Softening the arms and hands, the chest and upper back, all those muscles around the rib cage. 
Softening the muscles across the stomach and abdomen, middle and lower back, hips. 
The legs and the feet. 
And perhaps there can also be a softening inside in the deeper core of the body. 
Maybe the inside of the throat can relax. 
Around the heart, maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax, and then to seeing perhaps the mind can relax. 
When the mind is not relaxed, when there's tension in the mind, it tends to be caught and worries concerns about the past, the future. 
So maybe the mind too can, there can be a setting aside of worries and concerns. 
Perhaps for this stretch of time. 
from this place of as much relaxation as is currently available, having kind of a sense of inviting the breath in to awareness, rather than looking for it or trying to find the breathing anywhere, just exploring the possibility of breathing and knowing that you're breathing. 
Perhaps there is a place where, as you've invited the breath in, there's a place where that experience of breathing is kind of, there's a kind of a sensitivity in the body to know that through the bodily experience. 
Might be in the nose or mouth, the back of the throat, might be the movement of the chest, the expansion and contraction, rising and falling of the abdomen, and it may be that the place or the kind of sense of the experience, the physical bodily experience of breathing is broader than one particular place, might be a bigger area in the torso or maybe it's a sense of kind of following the breath in and out, just noticing how, how, how, how is the body sensitive to the breathing right now? And exploring a very receptive sense of that, receiving that sensitivity of the body, letting the body show you how it experiences the breathing, settling back and relax and receive the breath in the body. 
Knowing you're breathing in, knowing you're breathing out. 
If the mind wanders or when the mind wanders. 
At some point the awareness will return, in that moment it can be helpful to acknowledge the return of awareness and rather than trying to jump back to wherever you were before, check into relaxation, allowing the body to soften and then opening to being sensitive to the breath, inviting the breath into awareness again. 
And how is it in this moment that the body is sensitive to the breathing? One encouragement in exploring whole body breathing. 
Exploring is to explore comfortable breath. 
This can be explored a little bit with playing with how you're breathing. 
Sometimes a slightly longer breath at the beginning can be really supportive of comfortable breathing, but be curious, for myself I found kind of asking the system to help me find a comfortable breath, dropping in a kind of request. 
May the breathing become comfortable and then not trying to do it or make adjustments, but just seeing if the mind and body kind of receive and honor that request by allowing a more comfortable breath. 
It's kind of like tapping into a deeper kind of wisdom that might be available in our system. 
May the breathing become comfortable. 
Feeling relaxation. 
Then wherever there is this sensitivity of the bodily experience of breathing, maybe in your nose or throat or chest or abdomen, just exploring from that place of whatever you're noticing, there's awareness of that experience in the body, as if that awareness were kind of like a bubble, a stretchy bubble, allow the attention, the awareness to kind of expand to take in a broader bubble of the body. 
Feeling insensitive to the body, my exploration of this, allowing the bubble to broaden. 
Relaxation of awareness supports that, it's like that bubble becomes more stretchy than the more relaxed we are. 
Feeling insensitive to the body and this expanding bubble of awareness, relaxing and receiving just what's available to be known. 
Maybe that bubble can expand a little bit further, taking more of the body, relaxing, receiving, breathing insensitive to the body. 
It's very nature, we can't look or aim the mind at this, it's more like stepping back and seeing what comes in. 
Maybe that bubble can expand to include the whole body, breathing in sensitive to the whole body, breathing out sensitive to the whole body. 
Maybe some of the sensations experienced in the body don't seem connected to the breathing and that's okay, it's kind of this tracking of knowing, breathing in and breathing out, the breath like a candle in the middle of a room, the sensitivity to the body like the awareness that the light of the candle lights up the room. 
If it feels stressful to try to be expanding to the whole body, just allowing there to be a receiving of experience in whatever part of the body that's comfortable to receive. 
Breathing in sensitive to the body, breathing out sensitive to the body. 
Allowing a relaxed attention to receive. 
The breath in the body. 
Breathing in sensitive to the body. 
Breathing out sensitive to the body. 
Breathing out sensitive to the body. 
Breathing out sensitive to the body. 
Breathing out sensitive to the body. 
Breathing out sensitive to the body. 
Breathing out sensitive to the body. 
Breathing out sensitive to the body. 
Breathing out sensitive to the body. 
Breathing out sensitive to the body. 
Breathing out sensitive to the body. 
Breathing out sensitive to the body.
