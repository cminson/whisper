The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So we come to the fourth of the five hindrances. And these hindrances are, you
know, when they're strong for us, it's kind of like tailgating the car in
front of us on the freeway. And we don't have to stop the hindrances, but we want
to end their hindering quality. So for example, restlessness, agitation, can
hinder our ability to see, to calmly recognize, to calmly consider what's
going on. It hinders our ability to be wise and be clear about what's happening.
We don't have to stop being restless, but the idea is to not have the restlessness
into fear anymore. And one way to do that is to practice mindfulness. And today
I'm referring to mindfulness as the practice of stopping in order to
recognize what's happening. And perhaps if we don't appreciate the stopping, the
recognition is done kind of quickly, automatically, kind of part and parcel of
the usual ways of the mind working. And it's not really stepping out of the
stream of restlessness, agitation, to take a look at it. So something inside
stops enough to take a good look. And then, or a good recognition, oh this is
what's happening, I'm restless, I'm agitated. But let the recognition
be calm. And learning how you can have agency in one particular area, and that
is the agency to take the time to recognize what's happening calmly. Take
your time. Oh, restlessness. It can be like that in your mind. Restlessness.
Restlessness is happening. The mind may be going at 90 miles an hour, but the
recognition is kind of like a person maybe who is driving in the slow lane, or
probably standing on the side of the road, and oh look at that. Speed, a car
going by fast. And so to recognize calmly, the act of recognition is where we
take some agency. And then in the agency, in that recognition, then to pause
afterwards, to register, take in that experience. And what that can mean is to
register, take in the experience of restlessness in a deeper, fuller way, and
make space for it, and really feel it in that space that's been created by the
recognition. It could also be taking in the impact, the effect, that recognition
has, stopping and recognizing has. It might create a little more space, a little
more calm. It might slow down the restlessness and agitation we might
have. Restlessness and agitation is part of life. You know, even in deep
meditation, you can feel sometimes. And it doesn't, it might be a tremendous amount
of calm, but the mind kind of gets a little bit excited. I mean, sometimes it
gets excited about meditation. Oh, look, I'm so calm. And you can feel the mind
getting a little bit agitated or excited. And, and so to recognize and relax and
let it settle down again. The two words for restlessness and, you know, it's two
words. So both words imply this hyper arousal. These things are a little bit
more excited or restless or activated than, than, and so one of them is just
called restlessness often or agitation. And the other word is sometimes called
worry. Sometimes it's called regret. And I don't know, you know, it's hard to know
exactly what the poly word is supposed to mean. But the principle that this is
hyper arousal state that can happen, it can be worry, it can be panic, it can be
fear that we've, it can be regrets. Regrets can keep us turning away, turning
away, you know, with a lot of energy. It could be, you know, anxiety that keeps us
activated. And so to recognize what it is, anxiety, regrets, just kind of physical
agitation, restlessness, mental agitation, restlessness. And, and to
calmly know it, calmly recognize it. And get to know what it's like. And the more
with all these interests, the more we learn to be familiar with them and really
know what they are physically, emotionally, mentally, behaviorally, then the more
we're able to see it coming, we can recognize, oh, I'm beginning to go in
that direction. And when we can, if we can catch something as it begins, there's
often a little bit more ability to back off or to pause more or let go of it.
So, but, but in order to do that, it takes a lot of familiarity.
So with restlessness, anxiety, remorse, agitation,
look forward to the day when in meditation, you can have a nice spout of it.
Rather than viewing it as unfortunate than a drag, and you have to get,
figure out some way not to be agitated. And this is proof that you're,
you know, you should never be meditating. Take it as an opportunity to study it and
get to know it. I've had fascinating meditations where I was restless,
and it felt like ping-pong balls kind of bouncing inside my body. And I was just
kind of amazed to watch this energy and like, where did this come from?
And, and just sit there quietly and feel the ping-pong balls bouncing off the sides of my body
from the inside, kind of feeling, feeling the surging energy in their arms and the legs and,
or the mind that doesn't seem to want to stop chattering.
To be amazed, wow, as opposed to being horrified or upset, and then take the time to
the, okay, this is the time I was been looking for, a time for me to really take in the experience
of restlessness, agitation. Let me just kind of sit in the middle of it, and like sitting in the
middle of the fire, sit in the middle of it and just really, this is my chance to feel it, get to
know it, become familiar with it. Let me see if I can understand, see something new about it,
something I've never known before. Is it in my little finger? Is it my toes? No. Where is it?
Do you feel any of it in your, along your back? Well, maybe and maybe not. Where do you feel it?
Where is it? What's, what's activated? And what are your beliefs around it? What are your second
arrows that you have about restlessness, agitation, having regrets, having anxiety, and maybe it's
the second arrows, maybe it's the reactivity we have with them, which is a fuel for the agitation,
for the fear, the anxiety, whatever it might be. And so this thing about assuming agency,
assuming that we have some ability to meet the situation we're in, we can't necessarily change
it or control it, but we have some agency over our ability to show up for it. And so to stop,
okay, I'm agitated, okay, I'm going to stop for my agitation, as opposed to kind of keep doing
everything or something, I'm going to stop for my agitation. And if you do that and stop, maybe
even close your eyes, maybe you find your shoulders relaxed a little bit. And that's the beginning
of some different way of being with it. And then the agency of calmly recognizing. So, you know,
if you, if you use, if you want to recognize verbally in your mind, sometimes that's very helpful.
And just say to yourself in a calm way, Oh, this is restlessness. So that you're
decoupling the mind that does the thinking from the restlessness itself. The mind might be mostly
restless, but out of, you know, it's like if you talk to someone who, you know, if you talk to
someone in the library, you might feel agitated, but because it's the library, you talk quietly.
And so you talk quietly in your mind, Oh, this is restlessness. And then you pause or you take
time, maybe a luxurious time to feel and know that experience. And, and this way we're getting
we're getting wise about restlessness, anxiety, remorse, regrets, agitation, the whole family
of things that happens when we get hyper aroused. And we're finding a different way to be with it.
And begin to appreciate when you're familiar with agitation.
Once you're familiar with your agitation, also take the time to become equally familiar
with the time when you are not agitated. When you feel, we do feel calm or peaceful or settled.
Do the same thing there. Stop, recognize, pause and really feel it. And here,
we're being able to recognize calm states or peaceful states. We can also see them coming. We
can see hints of them and allow them to blossom because we recognize them and make space for them.
And also, it makes more room for them to appear to be there. And we can somehow let that be a richer
part of our life. So restlessness, anxiety, I hope that you don't have much. I hope the practice
supports you and not having been caught in it. But I also do hope that you look for an opportunity
to get to know it better and have a different relationship with it and practice your agency
of being a calm recognition. And so maybe today, I'm sure that there will be some occasion for
something in the family of agitation, restlessness, excitement to occur. And take a good look at it.
So thank you all. So then tomorrow, we'll have this Zoom meeting afterwards. And I'll post later
today the Zoom link on the IMC What's New, put it in the calendar, IMC's calendar, and I'll also
post it tomorrow on the chat. So hopefully between those three places, you'll find it. And I look
forward to meeting with you. And it's a little bit of a kind of a mark, maybe to mark our two-year
anniversary of doing these YouTube. So thank you.
