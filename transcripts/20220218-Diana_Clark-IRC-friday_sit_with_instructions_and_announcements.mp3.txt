Good morning.
So this morning, we're going to move to the category
of the so-called difficult person.
We're expanding the spheres, these circles,
moving towards boundlessness.
And with an encouragement that we all go at the peace that
is right for us.
So just to pay attention, be sensitive to your experience.
Tune in to what is happening with you
to help you navigate or discern what
is best for you at each moment.
Difficult person is still a bit more challenging.
It might be a stretch.
And I want to spend a little bit of time talking about this
before we go into the guided meditation.
And one is, what does it mean, this idea of a difficult
person?
It's just somebody with whom we're currently having
some difficulties.
So they are not inherently different or difficult.
They are not inherently one way or another.
They're not eternally fixed as the difficult person.
It's more about how we experience them, our perception
of them, right now.
So it's more about our relationship, our perception,
not about them and the nature of them.
And it's important to keep that in mind, right?
Because just as we're expanding categories,
you might have noticed that sometimes people
that were in the other categories slip
into the difficult category, right?
The dear one becomes a difficult person
when you remember that time that they did that thing.
That was upsetting.
So just an invitation to maybe soften this idea
that we have sometimes about that we're going to fix
or change or something the other person.
Instead, this is about our relationship, our perception,
our experience of this other person.
And so difficult means in this setting for this purpose,
difficult means there's some tension,
there's some friction, a little bit of irritation,
a little bit of dislike, some non-smoothness.
It is not abject loathing.
We're not jumping right into that.
It is not hatred.
It is not rage.
It's just where it's a little bit difficult.
On a scale of zero to 10,
where 10 is this murderous rage,
we're choosing a three.
So it's someone with whom we have minor difficulties,
not our ex-partner,
which we had this terrible, ugly separation.
It's not that family member
that we haven't spoken to for decades.
It's not the neighbor from hell.
It's not the politician that just makes our blood boil.
It's just someone with whom we have some tension.
Just allowing these to sphere our circle of love and kindness
to just naturally stretch a little bit.
And then when it feels comfortable there,
we just stretch a little bit more.
And of course, of course,
we want to heal our relationships
with all the difficult people in our lives.
And in some ways,
we might wish that we could throw some love and kindness at them
and make them be different in our relationship
to be smoothed over.
Of course we want to do that.
But if that had worked,
you would not be in a retreat with love and kindness.
Instead,
you would have figured out how to do it
and you wouldn't have any difficult people in your life.
So just an encouragement not to jump into the most difficult person,
even though there might be this wish to heal this relationship
that causes us a lot of pain.
Relationships can cause pain.
And for me,
this is one of the beautiful things about letting kindness practice
is we plant seeds and they sprout.
In some ways it might be like we go to the gym
and do bicep curls with dumbbells,
not because we want to get better at doing bicep curls with dumbbells,
but because we believe it will make our biceps stronger
and to help us when we need to pick up heavy groceries
or pick up grandchildren.
So we train in one way,
a little bit contrived.
Our bells don't need to be moved.
They're perfectly happy just being there,
but we do it as a practice.
And then it shows up to help us in other areas of our lives.
So not the most difficult person.
Some approaches.
We might need some support.
So to bring in some reflections in addition to our practice.
Nikki's been talking about seeing the common humanity.
Maybe we could reflect just like me.
They wish to be happy.
They're trying to find their way that makes sense to them.
Maybe we don't understand it, but just like me,
they wish to be happy.
And maybe it's helpful to reflect,
to bring to mind this saying that hurt people, hurt people.
So on some level, if this person is harming or insensitive
or unknowing, maybe they're acting out their own pain,
hurt and distress.
Maybe not.
We don't know.
And so they recognize in that they have some of their own
difficulties and that's why they behave the way
that they do.
And maybe there's this little bit of compassion.
Maybe this loving kindness kind of shades into some compassion.
We have that they are hurting.
This is why they hurt others.
So those are some reflections that might support
loving kindness practice for the difficult person,
for the mildly irritating person, for the annoying person.
Something else is to see the person holistically.
Most people have at least some good qualities
alongside what we find challenging.
Maybe their speech is not wholesome or skillful,
but they seem to take care of their families,
take care of their responsibilities.
See them holistically or to see them through the eyes of other people.
Most many people have friends or partners or family members
who care about them or at one time cared about them.
All of us have mothers, fathers, other family members
who cared about us.
So can we maybe see the difficult person through the eyes
of someone else?
And to be clear, we are not condoning any inappropriate harmful behavior
they have done.
We are not denying what they have done.
We are not repressing.
We are not pretending like it didn't happen.
We are not denying the harm that they have caused.
Instead, we are bringing some healing to our own hearts.
We are doing this for our benefit, to create the conditions
in which more ease and spaciousness can exist in our hearts and minds.
We are not doing this because we expect it will change them.
We are not doing this to make it all go away, the difficulties.
We are just allowing the problem-ness out of our relationship drain away.
This practice might bring up some difficult emotions.
Keep in mind some of the strategies that Nikki and I have been talking about.
We might think about as making a bigger container when we feel the tightening, the clenching of resistance, reactivity, and contraction.
Can we bring some ease, some spaciousness?
Can we make space for that and maybe saying the phrases anyway?
But to be sensitive to the way that we are saying the phrases, sometimes there might be this,
may you be happy, you know, that kind of a tone.
So being a little bit sensitive, can we do this with a lot of patience, a lot of space, softening, opening,
recognizing that META has this quality of spaciousness?
So if we feel like there's this clamping down, collapsing, is there a way in which we kind of make more space?
Whatever way makes sense for you?
And this includes going to another category.
The lovable being oneself.
Maybe shifting the perspective, tune into the body, allowing the body to find some more ease and spaciousness.
But find whatever works for you.
No requirement to spend all day with the difficult being.
Be flexible.
Be sensitive.
Be yourself to be surprised, allow some malleability.
And honor your experience.
Expect your experience.
Okay, so for the guided meditation, just allowing ourselves to get settled into a comfortable position.
The body that's in this room, this environment, this moment here and now.
Thank you.
Maybe taking a moment to scan through the body and notice those places of tension or tightness and allowing them to soften as best they can.
It's okay if there's still some tension, there's no requirement that it be otherwise.
It's okay.
Keeping the awareness, light, open, sensitive, tuned in to the bodily experience.
It might be that with the exhale, there's a certain amount of release, certain amount of letting go.
It's okay.
And then staying sensitive to the field of the body when you feel ready.
Bringing to mind, bringing into the heart, the image or sense of the loveable being.
The dear one, or maybe oneself, whatever feels easy and accessible at this moment.
Perhaps remembering or bringing to mind.
Their goodness.
If that feels helpful.
Visualizing, sensing.
And if it's supportive, offering them warmth and kindness with the phrases.
May you be safe.
May you be healthy.
May you be happy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Harmonizing, collecting the whole being in this stream of well-wishing.
And the sense of lightness, openness, ease.
Thank you.
And then within this state of well-being to whatever degree it's available to you.
Bring to mind now the presence of this so-called difficult person.
Perhaps imagining them here in the room with you today.
But whatever distance feels appropriate.
Maybe they're far on the other side of the room.
Maybe they're just in the doorway.
Not quite in the room.
Perhaps they're a little bit closer.
Whatever feels comfortable.
Sensing into where it feels appropriate to be in the presence of this difficult person.
Notice any responses in your body and heart and mind.
Inviting those responses to soften.
Release.
Reconnecting with the intention to wish this person well.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
If need be.
Bring in a reflection.
Just like me, this person wishes to be happy.
Just like me, this person wishes to be happy.
Just like me, this person wishes to be happy.
Just like me, this person wishes to be happy.
Just like me, this person wishes to be happy.
