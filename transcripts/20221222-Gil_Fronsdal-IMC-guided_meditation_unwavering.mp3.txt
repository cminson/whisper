So good morning, hello everyone, and welcome to our Friday meditation and teaching.
The Thursday, today's Thursday, tomorrow. So I'm already thinking ahead a little bit.
So the theme for this week has been the Buddhist teachings on right effort.
And there's four of them, and today's topic is cultivating, maintaining, growing wholesome states.
I'll talk more about that during the talk.
But for this meditation, I want to point to a very important wholesome state, wholesome way of being,
that maybe is the foundation for the growth, the development, the allowance of other wholesome states.
And that is being unwavering, an unwavering way of being in this world in meditation.
So to be unwavering in our application of ourselves, our doing, unwavering in our thoughts, unwavering in our mind and heart.
So in the body, maybe that experiences a kind of stability, to feel stable here, to, in the mind, maybe its steadiness,
to hold the course, to hold the mind steady on something.
And maybe in the heart, I don't know, what the quality of unwaveringness is of the heart,
maybe it's kind of a devotion, or maybe it's a kind of feeling, an attitude of yes to being present, to being here, regardless.
And this idea of being unwavering as being an important mental quality, the foundation, kind of gives us a sense that
cultivating wholesome qualities of mind doesn't have to be like all these wonderful things like love, or goodwill, compassion,
which are maybe kind of very important, but maybe sometimes even a little bit forced, or maybe not so accessible.
But if we can cultivate stability, steadiness, unwaveringness, then that is the ground from which the wholesome, other wholesome can grow.
To be wavering, to be unsteady, unstable, that's the ground from which the unwholesome, the unhelpful states of mind grow.
So for this meditation, we can focus on being unwavering, being steady and stable.
And when your mind wanders off in thought, don't you come back to your breathing, come back or re-establish a stability of the body, a steadiness of the mind,
and kind of a settled, subtleness of the heart, subtleness in the heart that is yes to being present.
Stable, steady, settled, unwavering.
So assuming a posture for meditation that allows you to feel stable in your body,
it might be a posture that's a little bit more intentional, a little bit more engaged and active than a posture that you're prioritizing being comfortable.
It's important to be comfortable up to a point, but it can be overdone with the loss of kind of bringing the body into an alert stability that supports
the kind of energy of being present.
Gently closing your eyes and breathing deeply, relaxing the body as you exhale,
with the idea that the exhale is moving into a stability of the body,
where the weight of your body settles into the seat or the place where your weight is supported by the chair or the bed or wherever you are, the floor.
Letting breathing return to normal.
And then as you breathe a normal breath, is there some way that you can steady your mind?
Kind of like you would if you were going to do a very precise movement like threading a needle.
Steady the mind, letting go of thoughts, relaxing the tension of the mind, settling whatever way the mind is agitated in favor of where the mind is steady, stable.
And then as you breathe, maybe on the exhale, just settle your heart, almost like your heart happily responds to the pull of gravity to relax and settle.
Quieting the agitation of heart.
And if you find yourself wondering off in thought or very much caught up in thought, you might go through these three steps on your way back to breathing.
Find some stability in the body, some steadiness in the mind, and some subtleness in the heart.
And with that, begin again with your breathing, with an unwavering attention to the next in-breath, to the next exhale, one breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
Chances are, if you're wondering a lot in your thinking, the mind has some agitation in it.
It's wavering and unsteady.
Relax deeply as a way of steadying the mind.
Stabilize yourself here in the present moment with your body.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
One breath at a time.
In the next couple of minutes before the closing, gently, with a gentle way, can you be a bit more stable, settled in your body?
So the body is more present, more aware of its embodied nature.
And gently, steadying the mind, the attention, may be on itself.
Underneath your concerns and preoccupations, agitations, settling into a deeper layer in the mind,
where it's stable, quiet, settled.
Appreciating just being aware, being conscious.
And settling the heart as if you feel reassured.
Safe as if for this next few moments everything is good.
All is good.
The heart can rest for a few minutes, be content.
And from this unwavering stance of stability, steadiness, subtleness, from deep within you,
what wholesome quality seems to want to emerge.
What goodness, what sweetness.
What is it that wants to appear and flow?
That's something that's enjoyable or appreciatable.
To be stable, steady, settled makes it possible to be more sensitive, aware of the world around us.
To be with others and let their being register for us.
Feel a connection that doesn't require words.
In the presence of people that we care for, when we're settled there might want to,
love might want to emerge, kindness, goodwill, delight.
Settling back.
And then ending this meditation with extending our goodwill out into the world.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.
May it be that in our stability, subtleness, steadiness, unwavering ability to be present that we contribute to the welfare and happiness of everyone.
Thank you.
Thank you.
