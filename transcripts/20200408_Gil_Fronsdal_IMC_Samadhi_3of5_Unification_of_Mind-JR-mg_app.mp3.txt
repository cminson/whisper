The theme of this week is concentration or samādhi . The 
word samādhi  is more or less a noun. It is related to two 
verbs: samahāda  and samāhita . These two words, which  
are more the activity tha n what  samādhi  speaks to, have 
the meaning of placing something together, bringing 
together, unifying, gathering together.   
 
Samādh i is not a laser focus of the mind, but gathering 
together, bringing together. I like the word ‘compose .’ 
Everything gets composed. All of who we are, gets 
composed together – ends up coming into harmony, into 
unity. One of the words related to samādhi  is ekodi, 
sometimes translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi as ‘unified ,’ and 
by another monk, Thanissaro Bhikkhu , as ‘unity .’ The audiodharma.org  idea of unification, of bringing into harmony, is a very 
different feeling for samādhi  than the idea of a laser 
focus of the mind.   
 
The di ctionary definition of samādhi  has two meanings. 
One meaning is , “the action or power of focusing one's 
attention, or mental effort. ” The other meaning is , “a 
close gathering of people or things – the action of 
gathering together closely. ” Both of these me anings are 
related to what samādhi  means in the Buddhist tradition.  
 
One of the ways that this comes together is that we're 
building on the idea of settling the mind, or settling our 
experience, settling into our experience. Rather than a 
laser focus, it's that everything settles to the bottom, like 
marbles in a bowl. The marbles settle into the bottom of 
the bowl , and sit there at rest  – settling, gathering 
together all the disparate parts of who we are.  
 
It's very easy to end up living a life that's fragmented. 
For example, if I tripped this morning and injured my foot 
in the dark, part of my body sitting here could be feeling 
the mild trauma of this, or the fear of falling. Another part 
of me might be sitti ng here feeling delighted to be 
together with all of you in this way, sharing the Dharma. audiodharma.org  My mind might be thinking about what's for lunch, and 
wondering what I ’ll find in the refrigerator. Then I might 
be with a conversation I had yesterday , and the 
challenges or the delights of that conversation. Then I'm 
wondering about this and that. My intention is to try to be 
focused on my breathing.  
 
All these different things are going on almost at once, 
kind of swimming around, bouncing around – the mind is 
fragm ented, divided, agitated, spinning around. The 
process of samādhi  is settling and gathering together, so 
that all the disparate parts of ourselves are no longer 
fragmented, but are gathered together and work 
together.   
 
Our attention, our intention – our physicality (the physical 
sensations of our body ),  our emotionality (our emotional 
experience ), our cognitive experience (the thoughts we 
might be having ) – are all are gathered together for the 
same purpose in meditation.  
 
For example, if we're conc entrating on breathing, all 
these different parts of us are coming together, being 
gathered together, to hold the experience of breathing, audiodharma.org  or to be together with experience of breathing, to be in 
harmony  – this gathering together.   
 
Now you don't have to work too hard at this. It’s enough 
that we're trying to overcome any sense of conflict with 
anything when we meditate. There's nothing that is 
considered wrong or something to be gotten rid of . It’s 
just something else to be held : "You too come here . 
Come here and let me hold you . Let me include you 
here." Not including that we're going to keep thinking ! 
But the thinking mind just relaxes : “It's okay. Be here.”   
 
When my older son was quite young – probably three 
years old – he went to a preschool with marvelous 
teachers. They were kind of my heroes – the goodness 
they brought to the children was one of the best things 
going. I felt like these are the people who ar e creating 
the foundations for a wonderful society. They were kind , 
generous , and wise.  
 
There was one thing that I really loved to watch when I 
sometimes visited  the classroom. These three - or four-
year-old kids were playing, running around like crazy, 
yelling and screaming, doing what three -year-olds do. 
When it was time for something different to happen, one audiodharma.org  of the teachers would stand tall in the middle of the 
classroom, and begin to whisper . They were  not trying to 
stop the kids from playing or anythi ng. They j ust st ood 
there, whispering.  
 
The kids nearby would notice, and they would come and 
sit in front of the teacher. Slowly  other kids, and then the 
whole class would hear the whispering. They'd all gather 
together and sit around the teacher , and then the 
teacher would sit down and tell the story.  
 
It's possible the kids knew what was coming  (a story ). 
But the idea of not forcing the kids to be quiet, or to stop 
what they're doing  – and instead  to harmonize, and 
gather together in this peaceful way. The whole 
classroom got settled and quiet.   
 
It's a bit like when I was in elementary school. I 
remember having a little red U -shaped magnet. I would 
pull it across the sand in the sand box. There were little 
metalli c iron flint particles in the sand. If I'd go back and 
forth in a straight line, the little iron pieces would arrange  
themselves in a line. This is like th e idea is of coming 
back to the breathing – let the breathing be the 
whispering, or the magnet –  and everything begins to audiodharma.org  settle. Everything gathers together – settling, and 
holding together.  
 
Earlier in the week I talked about settling and centering 
the mind. As the attention gets centered, steadied , and 
settled, it becomes the gathering place, the magnet and 
support – if we don't keep giving the energy of our mind 
to distractions and other things in the wrong way. The 
consequence of this gathering together, settling, 
unification , and harmony is – for the Buddha – that we 
become  peaceful. The direction that samādhi  takes us 
towards is peace.  
 
One sense of peace is the lack of conflict. If you find 
yourself in conflict with anything at all when you're 
meditating, you might want to see if there's some other 
perspective with which to hold it.  
 
Maybe this matter will be forever – so then just hold it 
and include it. Maybe there's a way of not being in 
conflict with it, but also not caught up with or  involved in 
it. You make room for it . You  hold it in the palms of 
awareness : “This too is included. This too.”  
 audiodharma.org  I like the  image of the palms holding something – the 
palms themselves are silent – without words or ideas. To 
let something be held in the palms of awareness is to 
allow things to set tle into quiet stillness. My mind might 
still be thinking, but I'm not living in the thoughts . I'm not 
identified with the thoughts , or so interested in the 
thoughts.  
 
I'm interested in holding everything , and everything 
coming together, settling in. To have that happen with 
something like the breathing does become a kind of one -
pointedness. But it's one -pointedness of everything 
coming together into one place – as opposed to forc ing 
the mind.   
 
What meditation, concentration, samādhi  has to do is 
letting go, relaxation. The movement of applying oneself 
and then sustaining attention is like coming back to rest 
in awareness , and then stay ing there for a while. Open. 
Include everything.  
 
Finally, th e idea of , "This too," instead of having conflict 
with anything . This too in some way should be included . 
This too is held in awareness . This too is brought 
together into harmonizing, gathering together, becoming audiodharma.org  composed and unified in the present moment.  Samādhi  
as the unification of mind.   
 
As I’ve said before, most of the time we are beginners. 
Just k eep coming back  and letting go . Center yourself 
over and over again on your experience. Once you can 
do that a little bit, then you can move  into connecting 
and sustaining attention. As that continues over and over 
again, connecting and sustaining – and the sustaining 
becomes longer – then it naturally begin s to be like a 
magnet that pulls everything else together. Things settle , 
let go , and come together. Over time , with samādhi , 
you'll experience more and more really being here and 
settled.   
 
One word for unification of mind, which  may be more 
meaningful f or some of you, is calming the mind. 
Everything becomes calm.   
 
The Buddha said that the support for deepening 
concentration is happiness . That will be the topic for 
tomorrow.  
 
I hope th e ideas of unification, "This too," and including 
everything  also point towards a way of being in the world audiodharma.org  where your presence promotes non -conflict , and 
supports everyone else to find some peace and 
settledness.  
 
May all beings be peaceful ! Thank you.
