One of the ways that awakening or liberation have been defined is being free of the three roots of ignorance, greed, hatred, and delusion. 
And one of the reasons that I really resonate with that particular definition is that it seems tangible. 
It's understandable. 
I've seen people who are kinder than me. 
I've seen people who are more quantumist. 
So it's something that seems very doable as a human being. 
They're also called the three poisons because they poison our happiness. 
And they give rise to all the second, sometimes greed and hatred sound a little strong when so much of our daily duke, daily suffering can be over things that seem much more trivial. 
But it includes all the secondary defilements like irritation and being judgmental, being uptight, tense, just wanting an ice cream as opposed to greed. 
And delusion gives rise, that's the tricky one. 
And the one I'm going to focus on more is it can give rise to arrogance. 
We don't really realize we're being arrogant when we think we're better than everybody else. 
We just think it's true, pride, confusion when we think we're lesser than anybody else. 
Restlessness and doubt are filled with delusion. 
Greed says, I want. 
Hatred says, I don't want that. 
But delusion says, I don't know what I want. 
I don't even know that I'm wanting or not wanting. 
In the process of letting go, that we do in practice, that we've been doing this whole week, we weaken these roots. 
And when we weaken the roots, we also strengthen just naturally the generosity that arises when greed gets weakened, the loving kindness that arises, the goodwill when we let go of aversion and hatred, and the wisdom that arises. 
I've seen so much wisdom this retreat, I mean, I'm so moved by the wisdom that I see in this room. 
When we look at greed, it's very, if we look at it closely, we really spend enough time hanging out with it, we really can see that it's painful. 
In fact, people even say, I want that so badly. 
I think there's some love song, it's, I love you so much, it hurts me. 
So we notice it, we do notice that, but we get caught in it so much that we don't really often notice, we are so caught in our wanting, we don't notice the dukkha of it, the pain of it. 
Most of us have known moments of contentment. 
It's such a relief not to want anything. 
It feels so nice to just, I don't need to have anything right now. 
I've got everything I need right now. 
It's such a relief to not be wanting. 
In the same way, if we pay attention to anger or any of the similar defilements of anger, we notice what happens in the body. 
The body, the blood pressure goes up, the heart beats faster, the muscles get tense, or face flushes, all these chemicals coursing through our body, and it doesn't feel good. 
You do that long enough, your body gets really unhealthy from chronic anger. 
We call it stress, it's a type of stress. 
But with the lesser defilements, even simple things like aversion to sound, I don't know if you've noticed on retreat sometimes, something not major shows up that's really unpleasant and we tense. 
We snoring, maybe we tensed. 
But when we notice the painfulness of anger, then we have much more of a tendency to drop it. 
The common analogy is that anger is like a hot coal in your hand. 
If you see it, you're naturally going to drop it. 
You don't have to say, let go, yes, let go hot coal, no, it's just natural. 
It's what we do, and that's why in the practice to look at our greed and aversion really carefully, really notice it, really notice the dukkha inherent in it. 
The delusion by its very nature is something we don't see. 
The primary quality of delusion is that it thinks it's true. 
Delusion can range from really gross things to really subtle things. 
In retreat in particular, I've heard this more than once, but it's happened more than once, and that's why it gets told a lot. 
There's a thing that people refer to, they call it a vipassana romance. 
What happens is you see somebody on the retreat and something about them and you start projecting all these things about them. 
I know I've been told by people who've done this that they actually imagine getting married, having kids, the whole thing, and then at the end of the retreat they meet the person and oh, this is someone else, this is somebody totally different. 
So that's a vipassana romance, it's delusion. 
And when they met them, delusion, when we see delusion it goes poof and it's gone. 
I got caught in the opposite, the vipassana vendetta. 
I was in a retreat like this, and the person, I was on one of the cushions on the floor, and the person in front of me, every sitting, they'd get a little further back closer to me. 
And by the, towards the end of the day, there's Zavutan was touching mine and my feet hadn't nowhere to go to move. 
And so the moment that, I finally noticed that they were doing that every day, and so I immediately at lunch, I'd move it back, and I just had all these terrible thoughts about this inconsiderate, selfish, self-absorbed, terrible yogi. 
And it was interesting because at the end of the retreat she came up to me and she was one of the most sweetest, most beautiful people I've met. 
And she said to me, I really hope I didn't disturb you moving my seat back. 
The person in front of me had this scent and I had trouble breathing. 
And so I kept moving away from it, trying to be able to breathe okay. 
And it was just a moment, all of it went away, all my ideas and images and actually months of thoughts about her went away. 
We can all see the effects of societal delusions, you know, wars are fought because people believe that theirs is the only way, you know, and so many people believe theirs is the only way. 
It's, you know, if it weren't sad, it'd be really comical. 
On a personality level, you know, we get all these delusions about, you know, believing that, you know, I've heard this on this retreat a few times, you know, that we're not okay unless we're perfect, unless we do everything right, otherwise we're not okay. 
And we're never perfect, you know, so that's a very painful, painful delusion. 
And it's amazing how many of us are run by that, that it's not okay to make a mistake. 
When I was in my 20s, I had opened my chiropractic office, it's the second time I'm mentioning that today. 
I mean, this week, you know, I hardly had any money, you know, so this was like a really big deal to me. 
And I leased my equipment, so from kind of a small company at a discount. 
And so I got this X-ray machine and, you know, processor for to develop the films. 
In a very short period into this, I came into the office one morning, and my entire wall-to-wall carpet was flooded in chemical sludge. 
And I had to, you know, had to cancel my patients, of course, and I called, you know, angrily called this guy, and they just ignored my calls, absolutely would not call back. 
And I was enraged, I was so, so angry, and I could really had trouble getting off it. 
But I just had serendipity, though. 
Someone who was a mentor to me called me, you know, and so they got to listen to me for 10 minutes, you know. 
And at the end, you know, he very quietly, very nicely said, you don't have to be a victim, and for whatever reason, I was ready to hear it. 
And everything just flipped, everything flipped in me, and all of a sudden this feeling of helplessness and anger was gone. 
And I just said, oh, I can actually do something now. 
And it was just, you know, and that's how delusional it is, you see it, you know, and he was just able to point it out to me, which was just such a gift, but something in me just really transformed. 
And I was able to, you know, next morning I, you know, rented something and took his extra equipment, machine, dropped it off as his front door, and proceeded to get my office back in gear, you know, but it's a power of breaking through delusion. 
You know, it's any moment we do that, it can be so life-changing. 
And Buddhist practice, you know, those are kind of like very, we call more gross delusions, but Buddhist practice points to much, much subtler delusions. 
And so they take, they take a quieter mind to see them usually. 
And the core delusion that Buddhist practice addresses is the delusion of the three characteristics of human existence, impermanence, which is what we've been talking about, impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not self. 
And I spent a lot of time in my early practice frustrated, very, very frustrated by trying to understand delusion. 
You know, I remember sitting on retreat and hearing a talk about greed, hatred, and delusion, you know, and I'd watch, you know, you know, my mind, you know, I'd get a verse of, yep, I can deal with, you know, that I can, that I can meet, you know, and greed, yep, I can meet that. 
And then they say delusion, it's like, huh, you know, I was confused, deluded. 
Part of the strength of delusion is that we tend to see what we expect to see. 
An example, there was a study that was done about placebo's, and they took a group of people and, you know, they split them to two, and they told them they were pain patients, they all had pain, and they told them that they were getting a pain pill, and they gave half of them a sugar pill that they told them cost ten cents, and they give the other half a sugar pill, the same pill, but they told them it cost two fifty, at the time there was more money. 
And lo and behold, the ones with a pill that was two dollars and fifty cents, it worked much better than the ones with the cheap pills. 
And that's the power of delusion, that's the power, or senses, we ignore our senses. 
The idea is so strong in our minds. 
Another example, which is I think really important, is there's a school teacher, and she was given a class of underachievers, but she was told they were gifted. 
And what happened was that, you know, at the end of the course, they did so much better than anyone had ever expected them to do. 
But these aren't just unusual quirks, you know, little cute little stories that happen, you know, just in the right situation, this is actually how our minds dilute themselves. 
This is what we do day in and day out with our minds. 
You know, if we believe that people are untrustworthy, we tend to see what the ways that they are aren't reliable. 
If we believe we're flawed, we tend to see what's wrong with us. 
You know, I've always been astounded really by what happens when people divorce sometimes. 
Here's the love of your life, you spend twenty-five years together loving each other, you know, something was working for a while, and then all of a sudden this person has not a single good quality, you know, it's delusion. 
It's one of the reasons that I've, over the years, I've often reminded myself to not believe everything I think. 
One of the reasons also, you know, you've probably, a lot of times, you know, as we practice and, you know, you know, you might talk with a teacher, you know, and, you know, they often point out that's the narrative, you know, what's going on inside you now, not the story, not the narrative. 
And the narratives we tell ourselves are often really far from the truth. 
You know, these are interesting, and this is kind of a quirk of humans. 
There was a man, this is an example, he went to a, you know, some classical concert, and you know, on his way there he was really excited, really looking forward to it, he's very, very happy. 
And you know, he was listening to the concert, and he was like really absorbed, and it was just such a beautiful moving, moving concert. 
And right near the end, there was this horrible, horrible screech in the room. 
And you know, everybody got a little unsettled. 
But afterwards, when he told the story, basically the concert was ruined. 
You know, it was a bad concert. 
It was ruined, because we tend to, we tend to take endings, and you know, and create our narratives, giving the ending of a narrative more weight. 
And I think that's what happens on divorce too, because you know, forget all the years of love, and focus on the difficult parts at the end more. 
But so, you know, when we tell our narratives ourselves about this, even our narratives about what happened on retreat sometimes, you know, I question that myself when I, when I've retold them, there's somehow not always all that, you know, all that accurate. 
The teachings, the teachings point to four primary distortions of the way we see things. 
And the first one is to view things that are impermanent as permanent. 
And those are some of the examples we mentioned, you know, love forever, you know, and then divorce, you know. 
We tend to think, you know, we're going to live forever somehow. 
Somehow we don't actually believe we're going to die, you know, or that health is going to last. 
So unconsciously, because we believe in these things, we can make our lives or happiness dependent on those things, dependent on another person, dependent on a job, depending on our children, dependent on a lot of impermanent things. 
It's such a prevalent delusion that the Buddha actually recommended these five daily recollections. 
And I'll just read them to you. 
I am of the nature to grow old. 
I cannot avoid aging. 
Of the nature to become ill or injured. 
I cannot avoid illness or injury. 
I'm of the nature to die. 
I cannot avoid death. 
All that is mine, dear and delightful, will change and vanish. 
I am the owner of my actions. 
I am born of my actions. 
I am related to my actions. 
I am supported by my actions. 
Any thoughts, words or deeds I do, good or evil, those I will inherit. 
And I think that the way we can hold that, instead of holding it with the sadness of things that die, we can hold it with appreciation of the preciousness of everything that changes, everything that is here and gone. 
So the second primary distortion is that what is suffering is happiness. 
We mistake suffering for happiness. 
And we tend to believe that chasing what we want and rejecting what we don't want is a good strategy for happiness. 
And as I mentioned, since none of us can get what we want a lot of the time, that means we're perpetually unhappy when we do that. 
And then the third one is what is empty of self to be self. 
And we identify with things that are insubstantial and we think of them as real. 
Just as Gil was talking yesterday, we identify with our identities, with our looks, with that's so huge in our culture, identifying with our looks. 
I remember when I was younger, people would really suffer over having a bad hair day and others having a no hair day. 
And wrinkles, as you get older, it changes a little bit. 
But we can identify so much with our bodies or shape or size. 
And in our culture, that's huge, it's huge. 
We can identify with our jobs or children or status in society. 
Like Gil said, a bad failed oatmeal maker, a good bad meditator. 
But my favorite identities, my go-to identities have always been what I felt my strongest ones were opinions, being right all the time. 
That's always been one of my favorite ways of identifying. 
I'm really smart and I'm right, and I'll fight for this. 
We can use our identities, our identities are useful. 
It's nice to think of taking our identities on and off like a cloak. 
Right now I'm a parent, right now I'm a friend, right now I'm a cook, right now I'm a toilet cleaner. 
Just we take them on and off, on and off with a lightness of heart. 
The fourth misperception is to think of what is not beautiful as beautiful. 
We even have a saying for that, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 
It's easy to see when it comes to art. 
I know there's at least one artist here, so I don't want to say too much. 
I remember seeing a framed piece of rope that had a knot in it for $20,000. 
To me that's like the emperor has no clothes a little bit, maybe I missed it, I don't know. 
It's not inherently, things aren't inherently beautiful or fashion. 
People invest a lot of fashion. 
I used to have a beehive at one point, a flip, bell bottoms, all these things that were really hip at one point. 
I've heard so many times, oh they've got no taste. 
It's more delusion, more thinking things are beautiful that aren't. 
But even more so is the way we view human bodies. 
We view them as this, we see somebody really beautiful and attractive, and of course, God they're really beautiful and we want to look at them and we just see their beauty. 
I still remember in high school I had a really good male buddy and he was shocked when I told him that girls farted. 
He thought, well they're so beautiful, how could anything not beautiful come out of them? We've got phlegm, we've got feces, we've got sweat, we have all sorts of unbeautiful things. 
An essential part of practice is meeting these delusions and seeing through them. 
That's how we practice. 
We don't grab them and try to tear them apart but we just have to see through them when they show themselves, when it opens up for us so we can do that. 
One of the things I noticed when I was really struggling with the idea of delusion is that I noticed that desire, which when we cling to it becomes greed, is natural in the world. 
Desire always moves towards the light. 
All life moves towards the pleasant and away from the unpleasant. 
It moves towards the things that make it thrive, that make it live and survive. 
Without desire for food we would starve. 
Without desire for sex there would be no humanity, no precious human life. 
Without aversion to cold we might freeze to death. 
The desire and aversion are these things that will help us survive. 
They make life on this planet possible. 
It made me think that if those are somehow useful and the way we do these things are useful, maybe there's something useful about delusion. 
I started looking at how is delusion useful. 
I realized that the fact that I don't realize that I could die at any moment lets me plan the rest of my life, let me go to school, you can plan for a ride for the retreat with that delusion, a right home from the retreat, so we can do things in our lives because we have that delusion that we're going to be alive in a moment, but how many people are suddenly not alive the next moment that happens? In noticing how delusion can be useful this way and noticing what happens with desire and aversion in the world, it made me realize that it gave me a real deep respect for those instincts in our lives and it allowed me to begin to befriend the greed, aversion, and delusion in myself instead of making them the enemy. 
I realized that how many of you really want to get to know your enemies? We're not really drawn to get to know the people we see as enemies, but we really want to get to know our friends intimately. 
For me, bringing that attitude towards the defilements, the word itself sounds like, oh, they're wrong, they're bad, so for me to be able to see these really painful, sometimes icky things inside me, but really look at them as if it's a friend, it's a friend. 
When I was a child, dysfunctional family like many of us had, the ways that I used greed and aversion actually helped me survive my life in this world. 
To respect that, and when we respect it, we can open to it. 
If we reject those things in ourselves or defilements, it's something we have to get rid of, it's very hard to explore them, to give them room to free themselves. 
At any moment that we let go of clinging, any moment at any given point is a moment of freedom. 
We don't have to postpone our freedom until we get concentrated, until the next retreat, until we have the deepest insights, until our back stops hurting. 
And I've done that with all of those things, but letting go at any given moment is a moment of freedom. 
If you can just for a moment, just let go, just for a moment. 
And one of the things that happens when we let go, as we continue to let go, this practice is just a deepening of that letting go process. 
Just our natural generosity, our natural goodwill, our loving kindness, our loving hearts continues to blossom more and more. 
Just a letting go process lets that come out naturally. 
It's not something we have to force out of ourselves. 
In our lives they alternate, they call them the worldly winds, the winds of change. 
We get pain and pleasure, gain and loss, fame and disrepute, praise and blame, all those things that yo-yo was back and forth, back and forth. 
And if we can just allow them to come and go, just come and go, because they will, they will come and go and keep coming and going. 
And that letting go is freedom. 
So I'd like to end with a poem from Zen Monk. 
And I don't know if I have his name right, Kozan Ichigyo. 
I may be close your eyes for this. 
He handed, I entered the world, barefoot, I leave it. 
My coming, my going, two simple happenings that got entangled. 
Let's sit for a minute.
