 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. In conversations with people in this past week or so, a topic of seems to be coming up, or at least it's the one that is striking me in conversations of theme, seems to be woven through many conversations I've had of transition. A lot of the transitions that people have been talking about are pretty major ones, the big kind of transition of loss of a loved one, or having to find a new job, or children moving out from home, and so becoming a solo person in their home for the first time. This one person I spoke to, she said, I haven't lived alone in 25 years, and now I am. And so it's just like the transitions of what does it mean to step into a new place, a new situation. And in many of these conversations there was some discomfort, some confusion, some uncertainty, a topic from last week, the uncertainty. That's a piece of transition often, a sense of not being sure what's coming. We've lost perhaps, lost something that was here. We're not sure what the next thing will be. And so there's a place of uncertainty, of transition essentially. My own relationship with transition has been, and historically has been, in patience. I'm not so happy being in that in-between space. There was one meditation retreat that kind of highlighted this pattern for me. It was my very first long retreat, my very first three-month retreat. And in the last week or so, ten days of that retreat, there was more understanding of the retreat ending. The teachers were talking about the ending of the retreat. There was a shift of activities. We started doing more daily life things, having some conversations. And my whole experience there was just like, I felt so allergic to this. It's like I was happy being in retreat. And I thought I was going to be happy being out of retreat. But this in-between place where it felt like neither here nor there, it felt so uncomfortable. I just felt like, I felt like jumping beans, you know, just get me out of here. I can't stand this. And I recognized the feeling. I recognized that that was a kind of relationship I'd had to transitions in other situations in my life, you know, just wanting to jump over, not have a transition period, not have a space or time where there's that uncertainty. That space, I was realizing that space in the retreat was a space of uncertainty. Like the retreat was ending. And a long retreat like that, I was kind of wanting to know what it was going to be like on the other side of the retreat. What was it going to be like when I got home? How was I going to be when I got home? And I did not want to wait to find out. I just wanted such like, I wish the whole thing could, I could snap my fingers and I would be out of there. So that sense of that impatience of not wanting to be in the transition. And in, you know, becoming a teacher myself and in creating the transitions for people out of retreat, I see actually how important it is to keep people in that field with a change, with that transitional quality happening. Because there's so much learning that happens. So much that space of in between is such a rich place of possibility. I think we think of it as a limbo space, you know, neither here nor there. And I looked up limbo tonight to see, you know, what's the definition of limbo? And the definition of limbo is like the classic definition that was pointed to was like people being in refugee camps. They're in limbo because they don't have their home. They haven't found a new place to go. And that they indicated in that definition of limbo that there was often a restriction of possibility. They didn't have much choice in limbo, choice to, you know, make their decisions. They had to wait to make decisions. And so the feeling in that limbo space may be a sense of restriction of possibility. And I think that's what we think of in those places of transition. We think they're places of restricted possibility. Maybe, maybe. I mean, this is just a thought that some of our discomfort with that space in between might be a sense of, I don't get to decide what I'm doing here or something like that. And so that discomfort with that or a sense of limited possibilities. But there's another, there's another kind of language for this time out of transition or in a transition place. And that's that's the word liminal, liminal space or liminal experience. And that word is often used in in a ritual kind of in particular, like coming of age kind of rituals where there's a letting go of a particular form or identity and a stepping into a new role, perhaps in a community. And then there's this in between space in this ritual where you're neither here nor there. And that space, that liminal space is is understood to be a place of transformation, a place of growth, a place of possibility. And so that's that's the place that I think is much more available for us in these transition places, even even once that seem unpleasant, once that seem challenging or difficult. The loss of a family member or uncertainty about what I'm going to do next. If we are open to the uncertainty, the uncertainty we talked about last week, open to the fact that we don't know what's coming. Looking at the relationships that we have that the not liking that discomfort, if we can if we can get past the not liking the not knowing the not liking the uncertainty, the sense of wanting to get, you know, get over it or have that impatience to get through it. If we can recognize those emotions, those relationships to that space, there may be the possibility of landing in the uncertainty, where there can be a richness, a kind of a bubbling or a place of new possibilities, not restricted possibilities, but something new or different or something can grow in that place. If we're not trying to jump over it to move past it. So that's, that's a piece to be curious about to in those places where we're in a transition uncertain of what's next or confused the kind of instruction I offered in the guided meditation of just, can you have a friendly relationship to whatever that uncertainty is, can you can you have a friendly kind of sense of that be open to it, and maybe be willing to be surprised by what bubbles up. What might be there. I've seen in my own experience different make kind of major transitions in practice I would say times where I knew there was something really fundamentally changing and I didn't understand it I didn't I didn't understand it was uncomfortable, but I've had some very different experiences in that place. So I just wanted to mention different kind of possibilities here because, and this is only two possibilities I'm sure there's many different kinds of experiences that can happen in that liminal space. And I think there's two such dramatically different ones that they kind of contrast each other. So one was, I think they were both coming out of a long retreat coming out of a long retreat after I got home. And so that you know that early that first long retreat I was so anxious to know what it was going to be like when I got home, and what it was like was like chaos. It felt just so confusing and it's like I felt like I didn't understand anything. It's hard to quite describe but it just felt like what I would say is it felt like stormy seas. That was the, that was the experience it felt like there was no stability. It felt like I didn't know where I was going, I knew I had been letting go of things but it's, I felt just it felt just so uncertain so stormy. And the thing that arose as I was noticing this as I kind of like was living with this discomfort of felt kind of chaotic in my mind it felt chaotic and what am I going to do how am I going to live my life you know, I just felt like everything was thrown up in the air. So there was all of this kind of chaos in my mind. And, and a kind of a habit, I would say a habit of making decisions of saying you know, figure this out, you've got to figure out how this is going to go and it was so uncomfortable being in that position and not understanding or not knowing there was a strong kind of push or drive to try to figure it out, but the mind was so chaotic it couldn't really hold on to much thinking very well you know it wasn't planning very well it wasn't, it didn't, it wasn't able to even think about where it could go. And so, there was being with that whole experience there was the memory there. There was an instruction that had been given on the retreat or there was a talk a Dharma talk that had been given where the teacher was talking about or using as an analogy, the process of navigating ocean travel in a canoe, basically, talking about. He was talking about a indigenous practice of navigating by the stars and from Hawaii and there was a voyage across the ocean happening while we were on retreat and he was hearing updates, you know, what was going on so he was using it as analogy for us. The, the process of sailing the process of navigating sees. The analogy that arose in my mind was a time when the there was a master sailor on the on the in the canoe, who was training a newer sailor, and the master sailor had kind of been taking a rest and at some point, while he was taking a rest he kind of sat both upright in the canoe. And he said take down the sails. This was a canoe that was using sails not paddles so take down the sails and within a few minutes, a huge storm came up. And the thing in terms of the practice for me was when it's really chaotic, you know, take down the sail is chaotic on seas you take down the sails you don't try to chart a course over the ocean when it's that stormy, you ride the waves. And so that image came to my mind in this time and it's like, take down the sails don't try to figure it out. Just be with this uncertainty be with this confusion, ride those waves. And that, that's what I was pointing to in the, in the guided meditation that just be with yourself, whatever's happening, be with yourself. Maybe it's confusing maybe it's chaotic that actually that being with yourself. Learning how to navigate whatever is here in this moment. Chaos or otherwise, that capacity to meet just whatever's right in front of you. That is what will support you. Every moment of your life, wherever you end up that capacity to be with whatever is there. You've been cultivating that. So the best way in effect you know in a term, time of transition and an uncertainty of where am I going to go how am I going to, how am I going to be when I get there. The best way to navigate that is to be with this right now. Because that will create a skill for being with whatever that is when you get there. So that was one experience for myself with the transition that kind of stormy seas and just an understanding of yeah take down the sails don't try to chart a course here. It doesn't make any sense. You can't, you can't tell what the direction, what the right direction is. So ride the waves until there's a little more calmness. And on the flip side, another period of practice where there was a kind of a sense of being in limbo being in a space where I had no idea what was going on. In contrast, it was just calm. And that was a little bit unusual for me, you know, it's like I was much more used to the ups and downs. And you know there's just like this calmness like, what do I do with this, you know, how do I go anywhere with this and, and the image that came to me there was being in the middle of a sea of a huge vast sea, not having any sense of where land was. And with the sense of I need to get somewhere. So, if I swim this way, you know, so there was a lot there was a lot of doubt you know it's like I swim this way. But still there's no, no, nothing to guide me. Well maybe if I swim that way, nothing to guide me and so at some point I realized, just float, you know, that's, that's what can be done here just float so that's that's again just meeting that. Space of the calmness. So so much of our relationship to these transition spaces is, is where we are first place of practice like my, my recognition of not wanting to be in this calm space or not wanting to be in the stormy space that resistance to what is beginning to recognize that, and the resistance to what is is always suffering. It's always struggle stress. So the, the recognition of like writing what is, whether it's a up and down wavy kind of experience or just tranquil writing with that being with that, that. I mean it sounds like it sounds like nothing in a way you know it's like well what do I learn from that. We don't know what we're going to learn from it. That's what's surprising. The possibilities that are there can be so unexpected. When we're willing to not fight what's here, but open to what's here. So, maybe, maybe leave it there and see if there's any comments or questions or reflections or anything. Ali, and then Anthony. Yeah, you were talking. I just came to me with the transitions. We're at the beginning of the state of bar though like that also at that stage, perhaps, and then that was my relationship to the call the space I would say at first. Okay, it's boring. There's nothing to happen. Not boring. I'm sorry. Bar though. I'm saying bar though state at the bar. Oh, yeah. Between the two. Yeah. And then the other thing question I had if you want to, you know, address any one of them or just or whatever is the when you were saying charting the course I'm not really I mean to some degree I can chart the course but I'm not really in charge of charting any course either. I mean, I don't know. I mean, it's just for me. I think if I can just take the sales down all the time, I'll be happy. Well, sometimes we can do that. Sometimes we can take the sales down and just kind of ride the waves. And if we have a sense of the responsiveness, right? It's like respond being able to respond to those waves and that can be a beautiful way to live. And then there are times we do have to make decisions. I mean, you know, and and yet, you know, sometimes those decisions can be very spontaneous and other times they like like the one person I'm talking to needing to find a new job. So, you know, there's need to be some activity. It can't just simply be, oh, let's see if a job appears, you know. So there is a little bit of charting a course. But there's also the willingness to ride the waves of that charting the course rather than trying to make it such a straight path or and sometimes the indirectness of a path. I mean, like if I think back on my life, you know, it's so many different turns and I never would have found my way here. You know, I never would have found my way here. I it's like just being responsive to what happened allowed me to be to be here. Like I never could have planned this. This is not this is not what I had in my plans when I was in my 20s. So so that was responsiveness. Again, it's like so much possibility is here if we're if we're open to it. I think I think that I do under the delusion. I think that I do have more choice than what I actually have, you know, on charting that course. There are like so many different things that are there. I mean, I do my heart, but there is not really a self here that can really I mean, I don't I don't want to get it too philosophical about that. I don't want to say anything about the state of Bardot or just go with that one. Thank you, Andrea. Yeah. Well, that that sense of, you know, that the sense of recognizing there's maybe less control of charting a course than we think that's actually probably true. And so but and yet with that understanding of yes, I can make this decision. I can put something in play. It's like what we're doing there is shaping conditions and, you know, how those conditions play with the vast other conditions that are in play in the world. We don't know. And so if we are kind of charting that course with the understanding that we don't know where it's going to go, there's a lot less suffering when it doesn't necessarily get where we think it's going to go. And a kind of potentially availability to be open to something like completely new. That's like a whole new direction. Like for my life, you know, this whole new direction of practice opened up out of just so much suffering. I'm like, I would not have chosen that suffering. But at this point, I wouldn't have wanted it to be any different either. So much so much growth and learning came out of that. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Sorry, I just got something in my throat. And in terms of the Bardo, I mean, it is it is I think that the Bardo is a teaching in another Buddhist tradition, more in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. It's not so much in the Theravada Buddhist Buddhist tradition, but my understanding, the limited I understand about it is that that is a liminal space. It is, you know, and there's a lot of training, a lot of the some of the understanding, I think, is that some of the training that we make in this life here is to support us as we enter that space to be able to not just be pulled in, pulled into some random thing in the Bardo, but to be able to potentially shape or include have conditions that will take us to a more skillful experience. Thank you. Anthony, did you still have something? And you're still muted, Anthony. Thank you. Yeah, I really like those analogies. Would it be about the sailing with either way, regardless if it's calm or a storm to just go with the flow, you know. And what I got out of it is that a sense of, you know, like you said, we're trying to control the narrative and I really which relates to with kind of trying to identify with something with whatever scenario is at hand on your plate at that certain time. But I wanted to know, Andrea, if you had if there's if you could somehow link that the control and identifying with attachment. Is there anything that you notice that goes hand in hand with attachment and the sense of control. Well, control is a kind of attachment to wanting a particular outcome or a particular thing to happen. So there's a, you know, so, you know, the kind of sense of it has to happen the way I want it to happen. So there's attachment to a particular often with control there's attachment to an outcome. And particularly, you know, an image or vision of what it should be like. That's that's one way that I can I think I can express the connection between control and attachment. The Buddha speaks of control in terms of an identification. He said he speaks of, you know, the the the inability to control as being a kind of a pointer or evidence for we should say evidence for they're not being a controller, basically not being a self that's in charge. And he the way he puts it is, if the body were self, would it be, you know, if if he says the body is not self if the body were self, it would be possible to say of the body may my body be thus may my body not be thus. But the body is not self so it is not possible to say of it may be this may be not this. There's limited ways in which we can do that, you know, limited ways in which we can say yeah okay short hair long you know long hair we can choose certain things about our body but total ultimate control over our body no and he goes through that with other aspects, our mind, you know, our mind is not self if or mental formations are not self so our emotional state is not self if it were, if it were self he'd say, it was be possible to say may my emotional state be thus may and not be thus. And how often do we recognize we don't have that choice. You know that, yeah, I wish I wasn't feeling this right now, but, but, but there is the possibility of opening to and this is again what I pointed to in the guided meditation if we open to whatever is here right now that with a kind of curiosity and kindness so that kind of that description of the kind of awareness the kind of practice the kind of attention to experience, not just any kind of attention but that kind of curious interested attention, then that has a power to shape the mind more in the direction over time of more wholesome things over time so it's again it's this, it's that sense of moving in a direction, but not really being in charge of when things happen, but the whole practice is unfold through some measure of making choices and making decisions and so to say there's not control, I think really is pointing to that, you know, that, that kind of demand or that sense of my mind needs to be like this right now, or it needs to go here in this way, as opposed to kind of the movement of shaping it through just this practice of being with being able to meet experience that begins to cultivate more and more wholesome qualities and begins to help the mind to let go of the animal some qualities. So it moves us in a direction, but not in our timeframe. So, you know, the control the piece around control and it's a really interesting thing to notice when we feel like that sense of I need I need to have something I need to be in control, that feeling is kind of a signal for us to attend to that itself, and to attend to what it is we want what you know that clinging, you know, and, and to recognize you know what is it we're clinging to. It's actually often not what we think. Because what we cling to, we think we're clinging to wanting something to be a certain way in the world. But what we actually are clinging to is an idea. It's an idea in our minds.
