Practice Note: The Three Steps of 
Mindfulness (Part One)

This morning I want to offer you three steps  that 
can be helpful in the practice  of mindfulness . 
Some people find it useful to consider these 
three different steps in the ir process because 
having a process can keep you engaged and on 
track.  
 
When you begin  this process , always 
acknowledge what is happening. If you aren’t 
acknowledging  what is happe ning in the present 
moment, then it ’s not quite  mindfulness. There is 
a lot that can be acknowledged in the present 
moment. You don’t have to acknowledge it all 
quickly. Rather, acknowledge what stands out 
for you : what’s compelling, what’s happening . 
Ackn owledging might take a little while. This is 
not just a checklist approach. Really stop. It’s 
like the friend who really listens  to you so that  
you feel well heard. Offer some acknowledgment – some clear kind of presence 
– to what’s happening.  
 
The second step is to feel what is happening. 
Once something has been acknowledged, then 
take your time to feel it. Again , we are talking 
about what is happening in the present moment : 
what does the expe rience feel like? For 
example, i f you acknowledge the presence of 
tension, then you would go into the part of the 
body where the tension is, and you feel it. To 
feel it from the inside  is a way of getting to know 
the tension  more fully. Or  if what you are doing 
is staying with the breath, then you acknowled ge 
the breath first , and then  feel what breathing  is 
like from the inside . What is the experience of 
breathing like? What does it feel like  in the 
body ? Or if you are thinking a lot, firs t you 
acknowledge  the thinking mind, and then  feel 
what the energy of thinking is like in the body , 
the sensations . What does it feel like to be this 
way?  
 
The third step is to soften around what you are 
feeling and what you are acknowledging. 
‘Soften ’ might mean that you are making more 
space around it , not being contracted around it, 
resisting , or in any way tight around the experience.  If there is tension in the experience 
itself, maybe there is some simple way to soften 
a little bit. If there’s tension in the body, m aybe 
you can relax it , soften it . Maybe just an 
infinitesimal amount – that’s enough. Or if you 
can’t relax  it, maybe you can soften around it or 
around how you hold it in your mind.  
 
These are the three steps: to acknowledge, to 
feel, and to soften. And then we can do it again. 
This process can hopefully keep you engaged in 
the present moment – it gives you something to 
do – but it also set s a nice pace in the practice. 
You are not in a hurry to have something 
happen , but you also are not dallying. You’re 
just engaged in this three -step process.  
 
If that makes sense and it’s helpful, you might 
try it. Otherwise, you’re welcome to do the 
practice as you’ve been doing it. Thank you.
